00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
they'll have their hands going straight

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.650 
they'll have their hands going straight
or<00:00:18.900> even<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.470> as<00:00:19.650> my<00:00:19.859> hands<00:00:20.130> come<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:21.390> gap

to seal off and keep that guy from

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.439 
to seal off and keep that guy from
getting<00:00:28.949> underneath<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.300> does

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
other thing we all know that central on

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.139 
other thing we all know that central on
bottom<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.680> create<00:00:34.980> back<00:00:35.250> pressure<00:00:35.610> since

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
bottom is create back pressure since

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.350 
bottom is create back pressure since
Eric<00:00:36.480> my<00:00:36.690> partner<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.620> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> side

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
Eric my partner is going to be the side

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.580 
Eric my partner is going to be the side
one<00:00:39.360> thing<00:00:39.510> that's<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.809> help<00:00:39.960> me<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
one thing that's going to help me is to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.670 
one thing that's going to help me is to
step<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.210> side<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.899> come<00:00:43.170> straight<00:00:43.559> back

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
step to the side if I come straight back

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950 
step to the side if I come straight back
I'm<00:00:44.640> not<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.270> great<00:00:45.480> back<00:00:45.660> pressure

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
I'm not going to get great back pressure

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.720 
I'm not going to get great back pressure
but<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.500> step<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> side<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.430> doesn't

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
but if I step to the side that doesn't

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.950 
but if I step to the side that doesn't
matter<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.030> inside<00:00:48.360> leg<00:00:48.539> outside<00:00:48.660> leg

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
matter if you inside leg outside leg

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.240 
matter if you inside leg outside leg
stand<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.469> whether<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> step<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.039> left

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
stand up whether you step with your left

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
stand up whether you step with your left
or<00:00:50.370> right<00:00:50.430> leg<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:51.300> long<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.629> he's<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.809> this

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
or right leg as long as he's on this

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.650 
or right leg as long as he's on this
side<00:00:52.140> by<00:00:53.039> stepping<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
side by stepping here you're going to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
side by stepping here you're going to
get<00:00:54.750> better<00:00:54.870> back<00:00:55.140> pressure<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
get better back pressure and then the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.709 
get better back pressure and then the
other<00:00:56.610> thing<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.300> that's<00:00:57.420> really

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
other thing that I think that's really

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.139 
other thing that I think that's really
overlooked<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.559> bottom<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.340> controlling<00:01:00.059> your

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
overlooked on bottom is controlling your

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.939 
overlooked on bottom is controlling your
height<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:00.989> talk<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:01.440> pressure<00:01:01.649> back

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
height we all talk about pressure back

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.740 
height we all talk about pressure back
if<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.789> head<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.239> straight<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
if my head is going straight up at the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.929 
if my head is going straight up at the
ceiling<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:05.010> pressuring<00:01:05.430> back<00:01:05.670> I'm

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
ceiling I'm not pressuring back I'm

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
ceiling I'm not pressuring back I'm
going<00:01:06.119> forward<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> lot<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> kids

going forward and I see a lot of kids

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.460 
going forward and I see a lot of kids
jump<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.939> second<00:01:09.180> place<00:01:09.260> that<00:01:10.260> they're

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
jump on for second place that they're

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.440 
jump on for second place that they're
coming<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.460> problem<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
coming up the problem with that is is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.249 
to drive back and one thing that I think
helps<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:24.330> keep<00:01:24.479> mind<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> height

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
helps is to just keep mind if the height

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.289 
helps is to just keep mind if the height
of<00:01:25.409> your<00:01:25.470> first<00:01:25.740> step<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.729> final<00:01:27.119> height

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
of your first step is your final height

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
of your first step is your final height
you're<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.229> great<00:01:28.409> pressure<00:01:28.650> back

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
you're going to get great pressure back

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.149 
you're going to get great pressure back
so<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.729> you're<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.770> high<00:01:31.770> -<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:31.979> first

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
so I'm here you're on high - my first

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.859 
so I'm here you're on high - my first
steps<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.610> height<00:01:32.850> he's<00:01:33.090> pushing<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.720> me

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
steps my height he's pushing into me

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.920 
steps my height he's pushing into me
here<00:01:34.619> much<00:01:35.460> easier<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.970> cut<00:01:36.150> off<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.720> keep

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
here much easier to cut off if I keep

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
here much easier to cut off if I keep
coming<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.920> he's<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> drive<00:01:39.329> me

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
coming up up up he's going to drive me

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.300 
coming up up up he's going to drive me
forward<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.409> when<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.009> set<00:01:41.280> your

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
forward so I think when you set your

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.310 
forward so I think when you set your
hands<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.360> turning<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> little<00:01:43.170> bit

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
hands you turning them out a little bit

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
hands you turning them out a little bit
that's<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> seal<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.490> off<00:01:44.670> you're

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that's going to seal that off you're

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.700 
that's going to seal that off you're
going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.840> try<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.259> elbow<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.619> your

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
going to try to get your elbow to your

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.749 
going to try to get your elbow to your
hip<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> again<00:01:47.220> there's<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
hip and again there's a lot of

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.910 
hip and again there's a lot of
philosophy<00:01:48.270> some<00:01:48.570> people<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.710> try<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
philosophy some people like to try to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.310 
philosophy some people like to try to
come<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.430> catch<00:01:50.640> other<00:01:51.119> people<00:01:51.659> kind<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
come here and catch other people kind of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.260 
come here and catch other people kind of
coming<00:01:52.530> here<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> fight<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.549> we're<00:01:53.970> operating

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
coming here and fight if we're operating

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.969 
coming here and fight if we're operating
on<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> philosophy<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.290> want<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> seal

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
on the philosophy that we want to seal

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
on the philosophy that we want to seal
off<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.670> hand<00:01:56.880> control<00:01:57.180> which<00:01:57.329> i<00:01:57.420> think

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
off and get hand control which i think

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.569 
off and get hand control which i think
is<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.810> best<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.130> I'm<00:01:59.250> looking<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
is the best that's what I'm looking to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.139 
is the best that's what I'm looking to
do<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.240> turn<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.049> hands<00:02:01.259> out<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.860> seal<00:02:02.520> off<00:02:02.729> really

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
do I turn my hands out I seal off really

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.179 
do I turn my hands out I seal off really
important<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:03.840> come<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.469> he's<00:02:05.009> going

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
important I don't come here he's going

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.639 
important I don't come here he's going
to<00:02:05.250> get<00:02:05.369> inside<00:02:05.759> me<00:02:06.030> once<00:02:06.299> he's<00:02:06.479> inside<00:02:06.659> he's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
either going to my wrist he's going to a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.699 
either going to my wrist he's going to a
claw<00:02:09.270> he<00:02:09.629> could<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> lot<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.200> things<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.619> me

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
claw he could do a lot of things to me

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.520 
claw he could do a lot of things to me
here<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> don't

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
here that I don't

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.580 
here that I don't
wanted<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.770> do<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.550> I'm<00:02:12.640> sealing<00:02:12.910> off<00:02:13.560> when<00:02:14.560> I

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
wanted to do so I'm sealing off when I

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.770 
wanted to do so I'm sealing off when I
get<00:02:14.709> hand<00:02:15.040> control<00:02:15.400> see<00:02:16.120> some<00:02:16.360> kids<00:02:16.569> will<00:02:16.690> go

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
get hand control see some kids will go

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.930 
get hand control see some kids will go
for<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.020> rest<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.560> problem<00:02:17.830> with<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.100> he's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
for a rest the problem with that he's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.610 
for a rest the problem with that he's
still<00:02:19.180> active<00:02:19.510> with<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.810> hand<00:02:20.080> if<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.530> get

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
still active with that hand if I can get

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.130 
still active with that hand if I can get
his<00:02:20.709> knuckles<00:02:21.280> I've<00:02:22.030> got<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.360> lot<00:02:22.600> better<00:02:22.780> hand

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
his knuckles I've got a lot better hand

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.199 
his knuckles I've got a lot better hand
control<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.830> again<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:24.850> all<00:02:24.970> know<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
control so again we all know the

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.730 
control so again we all know the
fundamentals<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.959> stand-up<00:02:26.380> but<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:26.650> we

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
fundamentals of the stand-up but if we

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.080 
fundamentals of the stand-up but if we
try<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.160> things<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.550> little<00:02:27.670> bit<00:02:27.790> better

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
try to do things a little bit better

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.559 
try to do things a little bit better
turn<00:02:29.080> our<00:02:29.230> hands<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.590> little<00:02:29.709> bit<00:02:29.920> out<00:02:30.569> steal

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
turn our hands a little bit out steal

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.290 
turn our hands a little bit out steal
off<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> little<00:02:32.020> bit<00:02:32.170> tighter<00:02:32.670> get<00:02:33.670> fingers<00:02:34.150> and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
off a little bit tighter get fingers and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.090 
off a little bit tighter get fingers and
again<00:02:34.560> controlling<00:02:35.560> your<00:02:35.680> height<00:02:35.890> is

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
again controlling your height is

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.440 
again controlling your height is
essential<00:02:36.640> I'm<00:02:36.790> gonna<00:02:36.910> bring<00:02:37.060> Hayden<00:02:37.390> out
