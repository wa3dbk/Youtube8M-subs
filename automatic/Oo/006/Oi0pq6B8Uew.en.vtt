00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:15.650
 let's elaborate farinosos this is a 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:20.800
 Typical sweet of Aragon and for that we are going 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:24.380
 to need 220 grams of flour 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.000
 63 milliliters of water 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.230
 63 milliliters of oil 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.989
 30 grams of sugar and 30 grams of good 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.350
 in a pot we have put all the 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.170
 ingredients except flour what 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.079
 we boil and turn off the 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.320
 fire now let's temper a little bit 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.780
 this mix to later go 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.900
 adding the flour to this is called 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.630
 a blanched dough 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.640
 once we have left little 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.250
 minutes a few products or three minutes 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.490
 that you use the mixture a bit now 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.030
 let's go adding about 220 grams 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.190
 Of flour 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.400
 until we have a mass as well as 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.890
 always elastic well worked has 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.500
 to be a little soft then 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 Now we are going to add flour and 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.329
 stirring with the wooden spoon 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.399
 we have already added all the sugar now 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.680
 we will continue working as with the 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.810
 spoon now will not be done well now 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.390
 we are going to put our hands to get wet 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.360
 well with knuckles and when 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.060
 let's see what is already good 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 well kneaded we will let it rest like 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.200
 10 or 15 minutes 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.869
 Well, we have already worked the dough 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:57.119
 You see what good enough is 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.899
 elastic that work and here then 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.119
 Now we are going to let it rest in a 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.509
 dish for example a deal covered with a 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.509
 cloth 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.910
 once the dough is resting 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.910
 now let's go pick up balls 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.130
 and we are going to stretch them very thin 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.930
 we help the roller we have to 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.930
 leave them very very finite 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.569
 to the sides 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.470
 let's make a kind of rectangle 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.250
 or 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.840
 ah 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.170
 one 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.000
 you see that very very finite the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.000
 we are leaving 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:29.690
 and now we report a little bit so that 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.690
 we were more square 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.210
 you see 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.989
 now we add a little oil and a 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.989
 little sugar 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.879
 and a little honey 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.080
 low 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.080
 now carefully let's fold 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.629
 we bring this from the sides to the center 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.629
 forming a kind of envelope 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.910
 and now 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.260
 now 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.780
 j 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.320
 we bend them to the ends 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.320
 ahead 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.569
 or 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.400
 so that the filling does not come out 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.379
 now we paint it with egg 

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:56.199
 and sprinkle some sugar 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.800
 here we have already prepared the tray 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.650
 oven to the farinosos that have left us 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.229
 with the amount we have made of 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.690
 flour and the rest of the ingredients and 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.229
 now introduce it, we will introduce 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:20.510
 the oven 250 degrees to half height 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:23.960
 until we see that they are golden 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.409
 we had in the oven about 15 minutes 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.350
 our farinosos and you see 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:34.410
 value and cause and the best thing is that they remain 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.350
 now we only have to cool down and 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:42.410
 start enjoying them 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.410
 we have our farinosos here 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.050
 now a coffee with warm milk and 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.050
 the delicious ice once they are
