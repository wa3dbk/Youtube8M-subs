 hu 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.619
 hello to all and all his teeth t 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.480
 I hope is peace is on the 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.439
 potato 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.960
 today new episode of the arsenal 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.560
 dentist on the 40 m to 5 we can 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.419
 see on the screen 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.099
 it was a few videos I did not do 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.200
 Arsenal I really enjoy myself 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.380
 redo this kind of videos on weapons 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.230
 will be a series that I like and that he 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.270
 you like it so I hope so 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.190
 today we are on the m 40 to 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.440
 saint who only have an army sniper 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.089
 American Marine Corps 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.070
 United States precisely which is used 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.989
 since the vietnam war so since 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.140
 the 60s until today so and 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.999
 several versions and has been improved 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.300
 over and over again so it's a 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.339
 rifle that I like a lot about bfm who 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.000
 was present on battlefield bad 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.230
 company 2 under the name m 24 some 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.900
 thing that I learned quite a bit of time in 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.880
 almost making the henry video that 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.330
 present six on which tools 4 modern 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.550
 warfare and on battlefield 3 that's right 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.810
 that it is not time played that used 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.590
 that in video games enough a 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:26.330
 broken stern rifle popular to compare to 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.770
 kuyt 6 4 and the bf and on bf3 on b4 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.470
 it is clearly a very very good snipe 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.120
 especially for close combat 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.920
 so here is no hesitation to play with at 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.090
 test it 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.460
 so at the level of damage at the level of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.410
 snipers it's really enough 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.110
 similarly a bit mostly esnam well 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.260
 quite a bit of difference only difference 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.360
 at the level of the fallout of the ball and 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.420
 the fallout of the power following the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.980
 distance that you can know 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.070
 so it starts to normalize in 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.800
 damage up to 10 meters then pulling 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.360
 beyond the torso actually after that it's 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.930
 pretty random it really depends where 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.880
 you shoot 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.830
 if you shoot in the low wind in 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.610
 the top of the torso lens pulls you into the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.379
 arm too you know - at least 10% of 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.360
 guy when you pull in the arms in 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.550
 the legs is less 50 so I think 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.590
 here is the next one we shoot you but in 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.420
 course it's on paper 100% but 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.890
 very honestly times I do 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.209
 coop wedding that is to say that I shoot without 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.739
 aim high 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.780
 you just blush with a style 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.630
 is often so sometimes it kills sometimes 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.490
 it does not kill so 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.230
 so that's probably it's really 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.810
 random I feel like after 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.670
 really the goal is to eliminate the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.290
 person in one ball is so 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.290
 to guarantee its really must aim the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.190
 head try to aim the head up 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.600
 many times so that's the level of 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.690
 reloading it's pretty similar 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.520
 between all the snipers so these two 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.230
 sets because there are still bullets in the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.720
 charger and 4 seconds when there is 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.250
 plus both bullets a loader 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.230
 it's also pretty similar to all 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.510
 styles are very much alike there is no 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.760
 really two snipers who really 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.990
 reload or and notes that really short 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.410
 for the ci are all more or less in 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.480
 the average 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.390
 she just one or two I think that c 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.440
 is l 96 which makes it a bit slower but 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.900
 it really was not playing much 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.100
 so we see the really not big 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.980
 difference in reloading 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.110
 for sure bf 4 at the level of his snipers 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.520
 the only thing that can change at 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.780
 reloading level it's bullets 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.690
 in fact at the charger 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.010
 so you have dieval in this 40 m but 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.950
 he has others where there are only five bullets 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.570
 others seven or eight so so the man 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.260
 40 still said badertscher this is 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.050
 not at all the rate of fire between 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.330
 the every ball is enough he does not make it 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.560
 wrong is the second of its kind 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.840
 so me it's something 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.470
 of acceptable the fastest is the 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.660
 elite scout 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.910
 so if you want to be the best at 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.850
 shot at the judge and able to chain enough 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.590
 quickly the elite scout will be a small 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.570
 little better than the man 40 even though I play 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.970
 I do not know if you really have the 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.980
 difference it's really a little bit 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.170
 on the access paper says all that but 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.990
 really too much two balls you'll see 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.570
 not too much difference between m 41 scouts 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:09.340
 elite but on the other hand you have m98 b or 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.330
 1.61 which is slower where Mr. 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.670
 you will see as a difference of 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.380
 work 40 and quite fast so that's it 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.209
 really make it very effective or fight 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.330
 close bet to chain shots 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.930
 pretty quickly so me what can I 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.790
 to advise you 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.650
 with that same 40 when you're at 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.570
 close combat of you shoot a 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.270
 ball out fairly quickly your 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.850
 gun to see if you missed 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.470
 your your enemy from directly the 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.249
 kill or finish it if you have it 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.319
 touched but he's not dead 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.899
 so I recommend a pistol 4,15 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:42.169
 also quite ok that has a lot of 

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:44.359
 bullets also in the charger I have 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.529
 used the m9 there to record but 

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:47.149
 after that you can play with 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.529
 any voice any beautiful 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:50.689
 pistol shots that are equal and who 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:53.419
 much like a f4 boe apart 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.089
 the guns that are like the 44 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.279
 magnum the mp4 112 or the sw 40 which are 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.569
 really pistols that have little 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.309
 bullets but that are very powerful and 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.259
 fairly accurate but aulaqi delay at 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:05.329
 loading a little more consequent than I 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.739
 discourage novices after if you 

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:08.679
 like these guns or red with 1 but 

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:10.759
 do not really miss his shot allows 

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:14.479
 so at least at the level of accessories 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:16.369
 cm 40 so I use the breech of 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.219
 maneuver and that like blocks at the end 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:21.919
 of 50 that he laser finder when 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.329
 blocks after 70 that they try 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.769
 would have everything at the level of the viewfinder so 

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:28.699
 it's the x 8 that we have two bases on the 

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:31.009
 42 it's an American rifle if I 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.749
 produce the video so that made 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.569
 American of which there is the viewfinder points 8 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:37.279
 who is the finder used in this game for 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.259
 that american weapons the saiper 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.519
 pain so voila you have it basic 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.610
 it's a good thing could fit 

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:45.409
 on a wear it with a 4x viewfinder that 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.929
 you have to unlock after 30 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.689
 that they or a viewfinder painted in red that 

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:52.279
 you unlock after 60 that he perso 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:54.679
 I have everything more or less used 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.119
 x 8 even when it was great fight 

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:58.399
 close together like the sweat of the 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:06:00.169
 domination what I could film is 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.429
 really my priority i think of the 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.929
 domination because here I am at 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:04.369
 when I wanted to film but there 

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:06.259
 was not a lot of other servers on 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:07.669
 the other game modes so here I have 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.529
 indeed on the deûle at home it plays 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.539
 very much like a sniper who is 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.489
 very performant in close combat and 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.139
 if you know a little bit aimed at the head 

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:16.669
 if you have reflexes and then that 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.529
 pass alone you can also 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.569
 use the deported mother for so 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:22.729
 you have a goal once like me and 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.979
 that you are here I love you little in 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.509
 withdrawal and then suddenly you have a 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.159
 enemy that happens enough for who becomes 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.409
 pretty close police the deported mother 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.119
 it allows to have another aim but 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.339
 just a classic metallic pattern 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:36.439
 once zoom steps on but 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:38.839
 you can switch between 1.8 and one 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:40.639
 deported mother who in close combat at 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:43.060
 to be able to help you this is really bad 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.639
 with the big viewfinder like info 8 etc 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.330
 So here I am empty or will not be 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.520
 mega long 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.050
 I hope I have not forgotten anything about snipes 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.820
 this is the case do not hesitate to read in 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.770
 comments 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.370
 I'm going to leave you there on the 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.370
 next to dubai
