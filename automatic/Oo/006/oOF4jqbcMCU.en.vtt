for<00:00:57.660> iOS<00:00:57.929> 7<00:00:58.550> do<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.820> animation

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
for iOS 7 do you see that animation

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.829 
for iOS 7 do you see that animation
press<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> home<00:01:00.750> button<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:03.210> takes<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.629> back

press the home button it takes you back

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.650

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
so pretty much exactly the same now if I

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.160 
so pretty much exactly the same now if I
could<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:06.930> tap<00:01:07.080> into<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.440> camera<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:07.920> well

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
could just tap into the camera as well

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.290 
could just tap into the camera as well
apparently<00:01:10.170> that's<00:01:10.350> strange<00:01:11.280> didn't<00:01:11.610> give

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
apparently that's strange didn't give

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.280 
apparently that's strange didn't give
you<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> animation<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> go<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.140> there

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290

but as you see if I press the home

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.990 
but as you see if I press the home
button<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.570> zooms<00:01:16.230> out<00:01:16.670> back<00:01:17.670> into<00:01:17.850> the
