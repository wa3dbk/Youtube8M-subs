would<00:01:16.420> not<00:01:16.630> let<00:01:16.840> us<00:01:16.869> down<00:01:16.960> see<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.100> Karma's

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
would not let us down see it Karma's

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.940 
would not let us down see it Karma's
like<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.759> basic<00:01:19.149> fact<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:19.719> life<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:20.439> don't<00:01:20.890> think

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
point well it goes even deeper than that

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.000 
point well it goes even deeper than that
for<00:03:14.940> instance<00:03:15.210> if<00:03:15.540> karma<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.170> real<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.650> you're

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
for instance if karma is real and you're

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
did in the past but he doesn't hold it

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.080 
did in the past but he doesn't hold it
against<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.680> for<00:03:40.860> an<00:03:40.950> eternity<00:03:41.010> like<00:03:41.700> karma

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
against you for an eternity like karma

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.480 
against you for an eternity like karma
when<00:03:42.960> you<00:03:43.050> give<00:03:43.230> your<00:03:43.320> life<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.530> god<00:03:43.800> he<00:03:44.280> wipes
