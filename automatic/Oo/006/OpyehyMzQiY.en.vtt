00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.990
 Microsoft 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.480
 You can enter it here on youtube 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.840

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:37.200

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.010
 just cuts the tv out of the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 I'm doing wrestling tomorrow 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.829
 he cuts out tv so that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.829
 I already did 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.070
 if the you cut to what 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.039
 She is still a bit edge 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:05.909
 do is a bit real out yes if 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:12.600
 So you have to do that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.110
 now here dad and there is the world 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.110
 it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 you can make as many plates as you can 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:35.490
 you want that from the way it ever goes 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.630
 such as the television wanted one 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:47.350
 two plates have because one 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 flat screen is not a single one 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:02:05.770
 videos make the image on each other now 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.390
 then you paint with acrylic paint or something 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.420
 but I would not take a fool because 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.420
 the dect not really times on the edge 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:33.870
 and not at the front because it's useless because then 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:37.150
 Do you stick the picture then you have yours 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.950
 tv then you look again if that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.280
 survives then I want up here 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.959
 Now what is right over there 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.200
 yes and the supernumerary you can 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:52.090
 the next one is not like that 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:55.510
 dramatically yes I come again one 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.400
 stand for it stands with it and there 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.190
 I show you my remote control cd 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.180
 player and a cd below and nets the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:08.769
 makes cover and now we have 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:12.459
 Actually, I could give you one 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:18.130
 very nice and that looks real 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.709
 somehow yes ok and yes I do 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.389
 maybe there should be a video 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.000

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.750
 coaches and he does not want to be right now 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.049
