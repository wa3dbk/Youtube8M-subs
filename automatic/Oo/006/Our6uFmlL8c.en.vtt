think this is definitely a lot more

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.120 
think this is definitely a lot more
important<00:00:08.790> than<00:00:09.269> any<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.809> goes<00:00:10.019> if<00:00:11.010> you

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
important than any of that goes if you

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.620 
important than any of that goes if you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
media to think that this is you know

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.250 
media to think that this is you know
what<00:03:29.730> anime<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.180> manga<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.690> because<00:03:31.110> this

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
what anime and manga is because this

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.500 
what anime and manga is because this
isn't<00:03:31.590> what<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:33.270> meant<00:03:33.450> to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
isn't what it is it it's meant to

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.090 
isn't what it is it it's meant to
entertain<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:34.140> meant<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.410> make<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.650> laugh<00:03:34.800> cry

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
entertain is meant to make you laugh cry

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.860 
entertain is meant to make you laugh cry
excetera<00:03:35.520> but<00:03:35.850> it's<00:03:36.210> never<00:03:36.450> meant<00:03:36.660> for<00:03:36.750> this

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
excetera but it's never meant for this

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.450 
excetera but it's never meant for this
so<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.410> know<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.830> don't<00:03:37.950> want<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.340> go

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
so you know I just don't want this to go

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.310 
so you know I just don't want this to go
out<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.790> media<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.150> anime<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.200> manga

makes you kids kill themselves and

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.320 
makes you kids kill themselves and
that's<00:03:42.390> certainly<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.900> case<00:03:44.180> that's<00:03:45.180> all

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330
