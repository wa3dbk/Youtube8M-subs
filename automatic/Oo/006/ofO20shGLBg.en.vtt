going<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:36.370> talk<00:00:36.519> a<00:00:36.550> little<00:00:36.760> bit<00:00:36.910> about<00:00:37.120> what

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
going to talk a little bit about what

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.819 
going to talk a little bit about what
we've<00:00:37.480> changed<00:00:37.750> on<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.080> combustion<00:00:38.410> quarter

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
we've changed on the combustion quarter

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.140

then I'm going to talk a little bit

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.509 
then I'm going to talk a little bit
about<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.600> s77<00:00:41.379> shell<00:00:41.739> and<00:00:42.250> then<00:00:42.339> we're<00:00:42.430> going

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
about the s77 shell and then we're going

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:43.829 
about the s77 shell and then we're going
to<00:00:42.610> head<00:00:42.699> out<00:00:42.730> onto<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.150> lanes<00:00:43.329> and<00:00:43.570> show<00:00:43.750> you

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
to head out onto the lanes and show you

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.689 
to head out onto the lanes and show you
what<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.079> freight<00:00:44.260> train<00:00:44.500> can<00:00:44.650> do<00:00:44.739> in<00:00:44.860> action

the<00:00:50.710> combustion<00:00:51.070> core<00:00:51.460> in<00:00:51.609> the<00:00:51.699> freight<00:00:51.910> train

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
the combustion core in the freight train

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.930 
the combustion core in the freight train
we've<00:00:53.140> used<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.530> same<00:00:53.739> shape<00:00:54.129> as<00:00:54.340> we<00:00:54.699> had<00:00:54.910> in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
we've used the same shape as we had in

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.270 
we've used the same shape as we had in
the<00:00:55.180> original<00:00:55.449> train<00:00:56.020> but<00:00:56.559> this<00:00:56.739> time<00:00:57.039> we've

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
the original train but this time we've

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.790 
the original train but this time we've
raised<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:57.940> RG<00:00:58.359> two<00:00:58.570> of<00:00:58.719> two<00:00:58.899> point<00:00:59.230> five<00:00:59.469> four

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
raised the RG two of two point five four

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.279 
raised the RG two of two point five four
level<00:01:00.489> we've<00:01:01.120> done<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:01.449> by<00:01:01.629> lightening<00:01:02.170> the

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
level we've done that by lightening the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.219 
level we've done that by lightening the
core<00:01:02.500> density<00:01:02.980> now<00:01:03.640> also<00:01:04.000> as<00:01:04.509> an<00:01:04.690> additive<00:01:05.110> to

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229

this<00:01:05.379> year's<00:01:05.590> freight<00:01:05.860> train<00:01:06.160> we've<00:01:06.610> taken<00:01:06.850> a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
this year's freight train we've taken a

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.760 
this year's freight train we've taken a
dense<00:01:07.270> energy<00:01:07.539> flip<00:01:07.990> block<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.560> we've

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
dense energy flip block and we've

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.499 
dense energy flip block and we've
attached<00:01:09.160> it<00:01:09.429> to<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.610> bottom<00:01:10.090> of<00:01:10.210> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
combustion core when we do this we

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.029 
combustion core when we do this we

strong shell is a combustion coil is
making<00:01:37.599> sure<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:37.899> we<00:01:38.020> raise<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.380> RG<00:01:38.679> enough

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
making sure that we raise the RG enough

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.529 
making sure that we raise the RG enough
to<00:01:39.190> push<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.520> ball<00:01:39.640> down<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.030> lane<00:01:40.179> so<00:01:40.450> it

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
to push the ball down the lane so it

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.930 
to push the ball down the lane so it
didn't<00:01:40.750> hook<00:01:40.840> too<00:01:41.050> early<00:01:41.289> we<00:01:42.190> also<00:01:42.369> use<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
didn't hook too early we also use the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.279 
didn't hook too early we also use the
new<00:01:43.090> nique<00:01:43.300> finishing<00:01:43.780> system<00:01:44.110> on<00:01:44.200> the

new nique finishing system on the

new nique finishing system on the
freight<00:01:44.470> train<00:01:44.679> as<00:01:44.800> well<00:01:45.009> we<00:01:45.369> finished<00:01:45.550> it

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
freight train as well we finished it

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.669 
freight train as well we finished it
with<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.030> epen<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:47.080> Nick's<00:01:47.289> going<00:01:47.410> to<00:01:47.500> tell<00:01:47.649> us

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
with the epen so Nick's going to tell us

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.690 
with the epen so Nick's going to tell us
a<00:01:47.770> little<00:01:47.860> bit<00:01:48.039> about<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.489> e<00:01:48.520> finish<00:01:50.700> that's

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
a little bit about the e finish that's

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.520 
a little bit about the e finish that's
right<00:01:51.849> Eric<00:01:52.119> we<00:01:52.330> actually<00:01:52.630> did<00:01:52.780> use<00:01:52.989> the<00:01:53.020> epad

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
right Eric we actually did use the epad

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.680 
right Eric we actually did use the epad
this<00:01:53.770> time<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:54.310> we<00:01:54.610> found<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.090> epad<00:01:55.479> is

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
this time and we found that the epad is

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.749 
this time and we found that the epad is
the<00:01:55.899> perfect<00:01:56.289> finish<00:01:56.619> for<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.860> higher<00:01:57.099> traction

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
the perfect finish for a higher traction

1500<00:02:11.920> grit<00:02:12.160> but<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.150> look<00:02:13.390> at<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.629> it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
1500 grit but if you look at it it

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500 
1500 grit but if you look at it it
actually<00:02:14.170> appears<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.890> be<00:02:15.010> much<00:02:15.280> finer
