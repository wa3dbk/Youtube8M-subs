collect some more friends and after I
got<00:03:04.470> back<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.040> point<00:03:05.280> as<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.670> can<00:03:05.790> see<00:03:05.940> we

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
got back to this point as you can see we

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.030 
got back to this point as you can see we
have<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.330> little<00:03:06.690> group<00:03:06.900> right<00:03:07.110> here<00:03:07.140> they're

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
have a little group right here they're

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.740 
have a little group right here they're
all<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> little<00:03:08.550> bit<00:03:08.880> higher<00:03:09.090> level<00:03:09.480> right<00:03:09.600> now

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
all a little bit higher level right now

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.630 
all a little bit higher level right now
and<00:03:09.990> it's<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.260> lot<00:03:10.500> easier<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.980> fight<00:03:11.400> these

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and it's a lot easier to fight these

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.790 
and it's a lot easier to fight these
leopard<00:03:12.120> shaman's<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.080> actually<00:03:13.440> defeat

leopard shaman's and actually defeat
them<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.370> once<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.850> do<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.300> only<00:03:15.420> see

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
them and once you do you can only see

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.420 
them and once you do you can only see
the<00:03:15.720> gate<00:03:15.930> right<00:03:16.170> there<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.560> basically<00:03:16.950> open

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
the gate right there you basically open

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.400 
the gate right there you basically open
the<00:03:17.550> gate<00:03:17.760> there's<00:03:18.210> a<00:03:18.330> small<00:03:18.630> chest<00:03:19.050> in<00:03:19.230> there

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
the gate there's a small chest in there

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.770 
the gate there's a small chest in there
