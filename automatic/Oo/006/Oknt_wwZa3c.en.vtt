00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
stained glass process so the very first

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.380 
stained glass process so the very first
thing<00:00:54.650> you<00:00:54.680> need<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:54.920> think<00:00:55.190> about<00:00:55.280> is<00:00:55.670> do<00:00:56.360> I

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
thing you need to think about is do I

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.860 
thing you need to think about is do I
really<00:00:57.079> love<00:00:57.770> what<00:00:58.250> I'm<00:00:58.370> doing<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:58.880> that

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
really love what I'm doing and that

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.750 
really love what I'm doing and that
inspiration<00:01:00.200> can<00:01:00.649> come<00:01:00.710> from<00:01:00.920> absolutely

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
inspiration can come from absolutely

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.639 
inspiration can come from absolutely
anywhere<00:01:02.180> but<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.810> most<00:01:02.960> important<00:01:03.380> thing<00:01:03.530> is

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
anywhere but the most important thing is

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.750 
anywhere but the most important thing is
that<00:01:03.860> it<00:01:03.980> absolutely<00:01:04.579> matters<00:01:04.939> to<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:09.760> the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
that it absolutely matters to you the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.670 
that it absolutely matters to you the
second<00:01:11.150> tip<00:01:11.300> is<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.720> use<00:01:11.750> art<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.380> design

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
second tip is to use art and design

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.160 
second tip is to use art and design
principles<00:01:12.950> in<00:01:13.520> your<00:01:13.580> stained<00:01:14.000> glass<00:01:14.330> let's

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
principles in your stained glass let's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.789 
principles in your stained glass let's
go<00:01:15.290> through<00:01:15.470> those<00:01:15.590> one<00:01:15.770> by<00:01:15.830> one

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.950 

are<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.130> lines<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.729> your<00:01:20.969> pattern<00:01:21.240> crisp

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
are the lines in your pattern crisp

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.099 
are the lines in your pattern crisp
geometry<00:01:22.740> straight<00:01:23.579> lines<00:01:23.789> circles<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.990> are

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
geometry straight lines circles or are

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:26.690 
geometry straight lines circles or are
they<00:01:25.229> more<00:01:25.350> organic<00:01:25.890> shapes<00:01:26.159> these<00:01:26.520> are

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
they more organic shapes these are

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.849 
they more organic shapes these are
things<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.090> consider<00:01:27.409> also<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.649> can<00:01:28.829> think

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
things to consider also you can think

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.529 
things to consider also you can think
about<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.189> width<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.609> lines<00:01:29.939> now

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
about the width of your lines now

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.510 
about the width of your lines now
generally<00:01:31.049> speaking<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.649> a<00:01:31.679> beginner<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
generally speaking as a beginner you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.429 
generally speaking as a beginner you
want<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.880> lines<00:01:33.090> your<00:01:33.630> LED<00:01:33.810> lines<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.289> have

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
want your lines your LED lines to have

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.980 
want your lines your LED lines to have
an<00:01:34.709> evenness<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.459> width<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.569> you<00:01:36.750> get<00:01:36.869> more

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
an evenness in width but as you get more

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.120 
an evenness in width but as you get more
advanced<00:01:37.469> you<00:01:37.500> might<00:01:37.679> want<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> play<00:01:38.100> with

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
advanced you might want to play with

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.620 
advanced you might want to play with
that<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:40.670> second<00:01:41.670> principle<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.149> consider<00:01:42.479> is

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that a second principle to consider is

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.020 
that a second principle to consider is
negative<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.140> positive<00:01:43.619> space<00:01:43.890> remember<00:01:44.520> for

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
negative and positive space remember for

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.599 
negative and positive space remember for
each<00:01:45.179> line<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.619> you've<00:01:46.950> got<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.340> side

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
each line like that you've got this side

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.789 
each line like that you've got this side
as<00:01:47.880> well<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.479> side<00:01:48.539> so<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.409> about<00:01:49.560> both

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
as well as this side so think about both

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.770 
as well as this side so think about both
sides<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.429> line<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:53.179> third<00:01:54.179> principle<00:01:54.659> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
sides of the line a third principle to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.139 
sides of the line a third principle to
consider<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.409> rhythm<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.909> there<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
consider is rhythm so is there a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.020 
consider is rhythm so is there a
repetition<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.989> color<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.979> shape<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.880> can

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
repetition of color of shape you can

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.910 
repetition of color of shape you can
kind<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.329> consider<00:02:00.569> music<00:02:00.989> and<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:01.679> about

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
kind of consider music and think about

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.869 
kind of consider music and think about
is<00:02:02.369> there<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> repeated<00:02:03.420> sort<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.869> pattern<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:04.879 
is there a repeated sort of pattern and

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:07.850 
is there a repeated sort of pattern and
is<00:02:05.879> that<00:02:06.090> repetition<00:02:06.590> interrupted<00:02:07.590> with

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
is that repetition interrupted with

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.289 
is that repetition interrupted with
something<00:02:08.250> that's<00:02:08.879> going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> give<00:02:09.209> you

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
something that's going to give you

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.729 
something that's going to give you
rhythm<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.629> your<00:02:09.660> piece<00:02:12.349> one<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.560> most

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
rhythm in your piece one of the most

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.920 
rhythm in your piece one of the most
obvious<00:02:14.010> considerations<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.239> an<00:02:15.569> art<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
obvious considerations of an art and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.110 
obvious considerations of an art and
design<00:02:16.019> principle<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.769> color<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:17.879> might

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
design principle is color so you might

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.160 
design principle is color so you might
want<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.510> about<00:02:18.660> your<00:02:18.930> color

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
want to think about your color

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.559 
want to think about your color
composition<00:02:20.060> one<00:02:21.060> way<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.269> could<00:02:21.540> think

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
composition one way you could think

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.990 
composition one way you could think
about<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.079> is<00:02:22.400> maybe<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.519> want<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.819> make<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
about it is maybe you want to make a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.030 
about it is maybe you want to make a
piece<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.359> monochromatic<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.709> sort

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
piece of monochromatic so it's all sort

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.770 
piece of monochromatic so it's all sort
of<00:02:26.069> one<00:02:26.250> color<00:02:26.519> but<00:02:26.790> liar<00:02:27.090> shades<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.750> same

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
of one color but liar shades of the same

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.020 
of one color but liar shades of the same
color<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.620> you've<00:02:28.739> got<00:02:28.889> light<00:02:29.100> blues<00:02:29.430> medium

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
color so you've got light blues medium

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.120 
color so you've got light blues medium
blues<00:02:30.239> darker<00:02:30.720> blues<00:02:30.930> all<00:02:31.500> together<00:02:31.829> in<00:02:32.100> one

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
blues darker blues all together in one

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.830 
blues darker blues all together in one
piece<00:02:32.459> that's<00:02:32.880> one<00:02:33.150> possibility

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
piece that's one possibility

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.990 
piece that's one possibility
another<00:02:34.620> possibility<00:02:35.250> might<00:02:35.430> be<00:02:35.609> using<00:02:35.940> a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
another possibility might be using a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.809 
another possibility might be using a
color<00:02:36.239> system<00:02:36.750> such<00:02:37.590> as<00:02:37.799> a<00:02:38.099> complementary

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
color system such as a complementary

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.059 
color system such as a complementary
system<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:40.049> example<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.680> could<00:02:40.859> use

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
system so for example you could use

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.059 
system so for example you could use
really<00:02:41.670> red<00:02:41.970> orange<00:02:42.420> hot<00:02:42.660> red<00:02:42.959> oranges<00:02:43.410> next

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
really red orange hot red oranges next

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.729 
really red orange hot red oranges next
to<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:44.430> cold<00:02:44.790> icy<00:02:45.420> blue<00:02:45.690> greens<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.410> that

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
to really cold icy blue greens and that

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:47.960 
to really cold icy blue greens and that
way<00:02:46.919> you're<00:02:47.160> actually<00:02:47.459> bringing<00:02:47.609> in<00:02:47.790> color

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
way you're actually bringing in color

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.400 
way you're actually bringing in color
temperature<00:02:48.480> as<00:02:48.599> well<00:02:48.780> into<00:02:49.380> your

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
temperature as well into your

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.080 
temperature as well into your
composition<00:02:52.099> another<00:02:53.099> principle<00:02:53.609> is<00:02:53.730> scale

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
composition another principle is scale

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.000 
composition another principle is scale
you<00:02:54.510> want<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.750> think<00:02:54.959> about<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.440> gravity<00:02:55.980> of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
you want to think about the gravity of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.920 
you want to think about the gravity of
say<00:02:56.669> something<00:02:57.000> really<00:02:57.209> big<00:02:57.480> next<00:02:57.810> to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
say something really big next to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.659 
say something really big next to
something<00:02:58.139> small<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.190> might<00:02:59.430> want<00:02:59.609> to

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
something small so you might want to

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.789 
something small so you might want to
play<00:02:59.849> with<00:03:00.060> different<00:03:00.630> sizes<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.590> same

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
play with different sizes of the same

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.039 
play with different sizes of the same
shape<00:03:02.130> for<00:03:03.090> example<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.480> could<00:03:03.599> have<00:03:03.780> large

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
shape for example you could have large

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.870 
shape for example you could have large
squares<00:03:04.410> next<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.769> release<00:03:04.980> small<00:03:05.250> squares<00:03:05.669> or

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
squares next to release small squares or

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.880 
squares next to release small squares or
large<00:03:06.090> circles<00:03:06.599> next<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.079> small<00:03:07.319> circles

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.160 

another<00:03:10.640> principle<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:11.300> can<00:03:11.420> consider<00:03:11.900> is

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
another principle you can consider is

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.400 
another principle you can consider is
the<00:03:12.500> idea<00:03:12.770> of<00:03:12.830> direction<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:14.420> do<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.870> lines<00:03:15.140> in

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
the idea of direction so do the lines in

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.370 
the idea of direction so do the lines in
your<00:03:15.530> piece<00:03:15.860> point<00:03:16.490> in<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.820> certain<00:03:17.090> direction

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
your piece point in a certain direction

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.460 
your piece point in a certain direction
do<00:03:18.380> they<00:03:18.830> have<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.580> horizontal<00:03:19.910> feel<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.200> that

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
do they have a horizontal feel and that

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.440 
do they have a horizontal feel and that
means<00:03:21.740> they're<00:03:22.100> either<00:03:22.340> stable<00:03:22.790> or<00:03:23.000> they<00:03:23.300> have

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
means they're either stable or they have

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.720 
means they're either stable or they have
some<00:03:23.630> weight<00:03:23.870> or<00:03:24.170> do<00:03:24.980> they<00:03:25.100> have<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.340> certain

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
some weight or do they have a certain

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.570 
some weight or do they have a certain
dynamism<00:03:26.270> remember<00:03:27.020> diagonal<00:03:27.530> lines<00:03:27.800> are<00:03:28.250> the

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
dynamism remember diagonal lines are the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.430 
dynamism remember diagonal lines are the
most<00:03:28.700> exciting<00:03:29.210> and<00:03:29.360> most<00:03:29.480> dynamic<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:30.350> you

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
most exciting and most dynamic so you

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.930 
most exciting and most dynamic so you
want<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.680> consider<00:03:30.950> those<00:03:31.220> ideas<00:03:31.580> when<00:03:31.910> you're

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
want to consider those ideas when you're

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.730 
want to consider those ideas when you're
creating<00:03:32.300> your<00:03:32.510> pattern<00:03:35.230> finally<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.590> might

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
creating your pattern finally you might

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.070 
creating your pattern finally you might
also<00:03:36.950> want<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.310> consider<00:03:37.400> contrast<00:03:38.300> you<00:03:38.930> can

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
also want to consider contrast you can

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.480 
also want to consider contrast you can
apply<00:03:39.320> this<00:03:39.380> principle<00:03:39.740> to<00:03:40.130> all<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.370> other

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
apply this principle to all the other

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.290 
apply this principle to all the other
principles

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
principles

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.660 
principles
so<00:03:41.630> think<00:03:41.870> about<00:03:41.930> contrasting<00:03:42.709> colors<00:03:43.070> also

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
so think about contrasting colors also

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.210 
so think about contrasting colors also
contrasting<00:03:44.450> textures<00:03:45.220> contrasting

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
contrasting textures contrasting

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.400 
contrasting textures contrasting
patterns<00:03:46.459> but<00:03:47.209> getting<00:03:47.390> some<00:03:47.600> variation<00:03:48.230> in

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
patterns but getting some variation in

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.470 
patterns but getting some variation in
your<00:03:48.530> piece<00:03:48.770> putting<00:03:49.640> one<00:03:49.820> piece<00:03:49.850> next<00:03:50.300> to

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
your piece putting one piece next to

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.000 
your piece putting one piece next to
another<00:03:50.720> what<00:03:51.140> does<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.260> say<00:03:51.620> about<00:03:51.650> each

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
another what does that say about each

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.920 
another what does that say about each
other<00:03:52.250> if<00:03:52.520> I<00:03:52.670> put<00:03:52.850> a<00:03:52.880> black<00:03:53.120> piece<00:03:53.420> next<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.870> a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
other if I put a black piece next to a

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.270 
other if I put a black piece next to a
bright<00:03:54.140> orange<00:03:54.410> piece<00:03:54.680> it's<00:03:54.890> going<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.070> really

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
bright orange piece it's going to really

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.280 
bright orange piece it's going to really
make<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.610> orange<00:03:55.880> pop<00:03:56.150> if<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.840> put<00:03:57.020> an<00:03:57.110> orange

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
make the orange pop if I put an orange

subtle piece a third tip for creating

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.930 
subtle piece a third tip for creating
stained-glass<00:04:06.500> patterns<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.430> consider

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
stained-glass patterns is to consider

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.410 
stained-glass patterns is to consider
the<00:04:08.360> limitations<00:04:09.050> of<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.410> glass<00:04:09.650> itself

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
the limitations of the glass itself

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.090 
the limitations of the glass itself
you're<00:04:11.420> going<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.660> want<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.870> stay<00:04:12.110> away<00:04:12.410> from<00:04:12.440> L

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
you're going to want to stay away from L

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.860 
you're going to want to stay away from L
shapes<00:04:13.580> because<00:04:14.060> they'll<00:04:14.209> want<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.570> break

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
shapes because they'll want to break

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.390 
shapes because they'll want to break
along<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.350> curve<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:15.890> it's<00:04:16.010> best<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.310> avoid

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
along the curve so it's best to avoid

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.030 
along the curve so it's best to avoid
those<00:04:16.910> when<00:04:17.180> you're<00:04:17.330> creating<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.750> pattern<00:04:18.040> as

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
those when you're creating a pattern as

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.340 
those when you're creating a pattern as
well<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.820> might<00:04:20.030> want<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.330> consider<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.049> idea

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
well you might want to consider the idea

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.710 
well you might want to consider the idea
of<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.680> whole<00:04:21.859> structure<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.550> piece<00:04:22.850> so

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
of the whole structure of the piece so

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.690 
of the whole structure of the piece so
when<00:04:23.960> you're<00:04:24.169> creating<00:04:24.440> your<00:04:24.830> solder<00:04:25.340> lines

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
when you're creating your solder lines

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.330 
when you're creating your solder lines
think<00:04:26.360> about<00:04:26.630> them<00:04:27.020> supporting<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:27.890> leading

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
think about them supporting and leading

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.790 
think about them supporting and leading
up<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.610> all<00:04:29.090> four<00:04:29.540> edges<00:04:29.720> if<00:04:30.169> you're<00:04:30.440> doing<00:04:30.710> a

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
up to all four edges if you're doing a

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.320 
up to all four edges if you're doing a
square<00:04:31.010> frame<00:04:31.340> you're<00:04:31.940> going<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.120> want<00:04:32.270> to

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
square frame you're going to want to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.670 
square frame you're going to want to
have<00:04:32.479> that<00:04:32.660> support<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.440> lines

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
have that support so the lines

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.530 
have that support so the lines
themselves<00:04:33.979> will<00:04:34.700> actually<00:04:35.030> be<00:04:35.150> joining<00:04:35.450> the

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
themselves will actually be joining the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.420 
themselves will actually be joining the
framing<00:04:35.960> lines<00:04:36.169> and<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.979> will<00:04:37.070> give<00:04:37.190> extra

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
framing lines and that will give extra

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.300 
framing lines and that will give extra
support<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.360> piece<00:04:39.010> finally<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.190> might

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
support to the piece finally you might

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.190 
support to the piece finally you might
want<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.550> also<00:04:40.669> consider<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.570> steepness<00:04:41.870> of

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
want to also consider the steepness of

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.380 
want to also consider the steepness of
each<00:04:42.320> curve<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.310> if<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.729> are<00:04:43.940> designing

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
each curve so if you are designing

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.860 
each curve so if you are designing
patterns<00:04:44.900> with<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.620> real<00:04:46.010> steep<00:04:46.580> u-shape<00:04:47.180> think

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
patterns with a real steep u-shape think

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.480 
patterns with a real steep u-shape think
about<00:04:48.110> how<00:04:48.380> difficult<00:04:49.040> that's<00:04:49.160> going<00:04:49.340> to<00:04:49.400> be

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
about how difficult that's going to be

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.280 
about how difficult that's going to be
to<00:04:49.580> cut<00:04:49.790> out<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.300> whether<00:04:50.570> or<00:04:50.780> not<00:04:50.810> you're

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
to cut out and whether or not you're

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.170 
to cut out and whether or not you're
able<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:51.650> do<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:51.979> is<00:04:52.100> your<00:04:52.250> skill<00:04:52.580> level<00:04:52.850> up<00:04:53.000> to

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
able to do it is your skill level up to

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.820 
able to do it is your skill level up to
it<00:04:53.300> yeah<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:53.690> also<00:04:54.140> are<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:54.470> willing<00:04:54.800> to

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
it yeah and also are you willing to

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.439 
it yeah and also are you willing to
spend<00:04:55.010> that<00:04:55.190> extra<00:04:55.310> grinding<00:04:56.090> time

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.480 

finally<00:05:01.449> tip<00:05:01.930> number<00:05:01.960> four<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:03.250> want<00:05:03.340> to

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
finally tip number four you want to

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.340 
finally tip number four you want to
consider<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.270> limitations<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:05.020> your<00:05:05.080> own

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
consider the limitations of your own

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.550 
consider the limitations of your own
time<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.039> tools<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:07.630> first<00:05:07.870> of<00:05:08.020> all<00:05:08.139> you<00:05:08.440> don't

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
time and tools so first of all you don't

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.800 
time and tools so first of all you don't
want<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.830> create<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.340> piece<00:05:09.699> or<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.060> pattern<00:05:10.479> that

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
want to create a piece or a pattern that

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.059 
want to create a piece or a pattern that
you're<00:05:10.930> going<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.169> give<00:05:11.349> up<00:05:11.470> on<00:05:11.650> halfway

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
you're going to give up on halfway

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.950 
you're going to give up on halfway
through<00:05:12.340> because<00:05:12.639> it's<00:05:12.819> so<00:05:13.000> complicated<00:05:13.389> and

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
through because it's so complicated and

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.950 
through because it's so complicated and
so<00:05:14.560> time-consuming<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:16.090> create<00:05:16.509> something

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
so time-consuming so create something

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.409 
so time-consuming so create something
that<00:05:16.990> is<00:05:17.669> realistically<00:05:18.669> within<00:05:19.090> your<00:05:19.270> own

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
that is realistically within your own

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.870 
that is realistically within your own
time<00:05:19.810> budget<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.349> also<00:05:21.220> think<00:05:21.610> about<00:05:21.669> the

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
time budget and also think about the

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.420 
time budget and also think about the
limitations<00:05:22.389> of<00:05:22.479> your<00:05:22.539> tools<00:05:22.900> if<00:05:23.289> you<00:05:24.039> are

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
limitations of your tools if you are

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.640 
limitations of your tools if you are
designing<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.180> piece<00:05:25.419> that<00:05:25.690> has<00:05:25.990> again<00:05:26.410> those

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
designing a piece that has again those

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.219 
designing a piece that has again those
very<00:05:26.919> small<00:05:27.069> curves<00:05:27.580> or<00:05:27.819> small<00:05:28.180> circles<00:05:28.690> have

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
very small curves or small circles have

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.420 
very small curves or small circles have
a<00:05:29.259> think<00:05:29.500> about<00:05:29.530> whether<00:05:29.830> or<00:05:29.979> not<00:05:30.039> you<00:05:30.190> have

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
a think about whether or not you have

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.830 
a think about whether or not you have
the<00:05:30.460> grinder<00:05:30.910> bits<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.330> be<00:05:31.360> able<00:05:31.509> to<00:05:31.660> deal<00:05:31.810> with

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
the grinder bits to be able to deal with

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.620 
the grinder bits to be able to deal with
that<00:05:32.169> or<00:05:32.729> whether<00:05:33.729> or<00:05:33.880> not<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.120> type<00:05:34.270> of<00:05:34.300> glass

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
that or whether or not the type of glass

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.749 
that or whether or not the type of glass
you<00:05:34.900> have<00:05:34.930> is<00:05:35.259> up<00:05:35.410> to<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.620> job<00:05:35.800> so<00:05:36.460> these<00:05:36.580> are

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
you have is up to the job so these are

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.189 
you have is up to the job so these are
kind<00:05:36.880> of<00:05:37.000> considerations<00:05:37.660> that<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.960> want<00:05:38.110> to

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
kind of considerations that you want to

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.050 
kind of considerations that you want to
add<00:05:38.349> on<00:05:38.590> in<00:05:38.830> addition<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.610> all<00:05:39.729> those<00:05:39.849> other

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
add on in addition to all those other

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.300 
add on in addition to all those other
considerations<00:05:40.270> and<00:05:41.080> this<00:05:41.560> is<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.800> practical

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
considerations and this is the practical
