 the same and their grounds are 185 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.289
 centimeters so they differ 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:31.119
 internal parameters of a smaller box 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:34.600

 intended for the exit of gases which 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.380
 battery formed during operation 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 each of the boxes is the installation 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.990
