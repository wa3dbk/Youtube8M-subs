00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.120
 Hm 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.120
 It is Ashino of Weekly ASCII, it is Orihara of av lighter 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:22.019
 It is Panasonic's diga dmr distribution to introduce this time 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.019
 bw 88 round 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:37.270
 This is that c product of Panasonic's Liga, but this is that 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:41.560
 The Tteyuu First, a long time mode corresponding to 10 times 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:46.150
 I think the point, but yes Well that 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:53.050
 Up to now it was 8 times outside building a 8 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:57.260
 Pets This Hano City region is hard ranked first article in that it corresponds to the Well 10 times 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.079
 The plan is good, there is next, and I will touch the box before 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.499
 At 8 longest 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.089
 It can be recorded for 900 hours 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.539
 if 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.870
 Well after another point Nanoha 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.810
 avc 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.270
 Yes yes 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.270
 Yes please see that program 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:30.800
 In that it became a boo 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:34.120
 Well, I always use poppies, but I have a time zone that is both abcd and below 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.120
 In fact 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:44.100
 I think that it is a goo key point 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.520
 If I'd image quality recording to say 10 times I'd told you that a little while ago 10 times 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.049
 How softening image quality calls himself I mean 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:56.990
 I think it will happen, but that's right ... Par panic is still that 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:02:02.509
 If there is that respect is of av-made recording of the technology that I have a life with a coat ice 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:06.510
 Well I'm doing my best, but still it's 10 times that number 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:09.560
 The program to save ak is not usable for a while, but it is surprisingly beautiful 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.830
 Well it will have in about winter 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.950
 Vibration is a bit as recording 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.290
 I feel it 's Toka Na I want to know what 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.400
 That's right I, for example, this 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:27.530
 So I'd say in a baseball game is Toka soccer 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.579
 The term science program is something when Well once I hope even rough 's high-quality until there 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.269
 When I said this does not think there is that we want to after I hd image quality, yet for a long time 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.510
 If you use it for 10 times you can leave a considerable head time 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.300
 Yup 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.870
 Afternoon bankruptcy personally recommended 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.930
 What is yesterday 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.200
 Haba right arm Coast Well um 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:53.800
 Table 1 hit month and Panasonic 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:58.530
 One month worth of cold war broadcasting dance that has a supply function 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.970
 Once you become a do you'll ne one month can receive a mug information based on another 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.710
 Full text at the beginning of the month 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.940
 I personally very happy with nitrous very easy to use even if I come to reverse 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:15.730
 It's now Language Xara calibration likely 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.730
 It seems to be usable before by saying yes
