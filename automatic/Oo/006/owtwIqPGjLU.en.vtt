00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
going on at the same time one for each

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:35.140 
going on at the same time one for each
side<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:23.730> Sandra<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.600> huge<00:00:24.900> sound

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.240 

first<00:00:36.150> we<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.420> flanger<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:37.190> there<00:00:38.190> we

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
first we have the flanger here there we

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.910 
first we have the flanger here there we
go<00:00:42.020> that's<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.080> thing<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.559> pedal

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
go that's the thing about this pedal

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
go that's the thing about this pedal
which<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.130> quite<00:00:44.309> cool<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.540> different

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
which is quite cool and it's different

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
which is quite cool and it's different
from<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> dynamic<00:00:46.500> pedal<00:00:46.739> because<00:00:47.010> this

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
from the dynamic pedal because this

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.640 
from the dynamic pedal because this
pedal<00:00:47.880> have<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.180> course<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.930> manual<00:00:49.500> mode

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
pedal have of course just a manual mode

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.810 
pedal have of course just a manual mode
where<00:00:49.830> you<00:00:49.860> tweak<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> nuts<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.550> play

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
where you tweak the nuts and play

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.939 
where you tweak the nuts and play
without<00:00:51.300> thinking<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.110> use<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.830> an

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
without thinking just use it as an

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.460 
without thinking just use it as an
analog<00:00:53.280> pedal<00:00:53.580> but<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.480> pedal<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:54.989> presets

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
analog pedal but this pedal have presets

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.160 
analog pedal but this pedal have presets
so<00:00:56.220> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.460> store<00:00:56.699> these<00:00:57.020> combination<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
so you can store these combination and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.479 
so you can store these combination and
nice<00:00:58.290> effects<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:58.800> different<00:00:59.070> presets<00:00:59.430> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
nice effects and different presets that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.530 
nice effects and different presets that
what<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.120> that's<00:01:00.210> that's<00:01:00.360> what<00:01:00.540> I<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
yes the cerro through finger is the face

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:27.850 
yes the cerro through finger is the face
of<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.670> tremolo

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.520 

finally<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> vibrato

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.070 

and<00:01:33.530> now<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.460> best<00:01:34.759> part<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.450> pedal<00:01:35.750> had<00:01:35.869> two

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
and now the best part this pedal had two

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.859 
and now the best part this pedal had two
engines<00:01:36.640> they're<00:01:37.640> totally<00:01:38.090> identical<00:01:38.600> but

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
engines they're totally identical but

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.870 
engines they're totally identical but
you<00:01:38.990> can<00:01:39.140> have<00:01:39.290> them<00:01:39.409> have<00:01:40.040> them<00:01:40.189> on<00:01:40.340> at<00:01:40.700> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
you can have them have them on at the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.820 
you can have them have them on at the
same<00:01:41.030> time<00:01:41.299> here's<00:01:41.930> my<00:01:41.990> preset<00:01:42.470> way<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:42.649> have

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
same time here's my preset way I have

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.969 
same time here's my preset way I have
try<00:01:43.759> Korres<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.659> trigger<00:01:44.840> what<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:45.860> it

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
try Korres and the trigger what is it

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.020 
try Korres and the trigger what is it
phaser<00:01:46.220> yeah<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:47.030> face<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:48.789> you<00:01:49.789> we<00:01:49.909> have

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
phaser yeah it's a face of you we have

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:00.600 
phaser yeah it's a face of you we have
two<00:01:50.210> effects<00:01:50.600> at<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.899> same<00:01:51.080> time

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.990 

or<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.850> flames<00:02:02.120> around<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.360> tremolo<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.670> I

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
or the flames around the tremolo so I I

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.880 
or the flames around the tremolo so I I
mean<00:02:08.510> it's<00:02:08.900> such<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> cool<00:02:09.290> pedal<00:02:09.650> let's<00:02:09.770> say

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
mean it's such a cool pedal let's say

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
but you need some modulation and okay if

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.630 
but you need some modulation and okay if
you're<00:02:18.290> tremolo<00:02:18.710> guy<00:02:18.890> just<00:02:19.190> buy<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> tremolo

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
you're tremolo guy just buy a tremolo

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.130 
you're tremolo guy just buy a tremolo
pedal<00:02:19.820> but<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.240> also<00:02:20.480> would<00:02:20.750> like<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.020> have

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
pedal but if you also would like to have

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.140 
pedal but if you also would like to have
a<00:02:21.170> facer<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.800> maybe<00:02:21.920> ocurro's<00:02:22.370> instead<00:02:23.060> of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
a facer and maybe ocurro's instead of

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.050 
a facer and maybe ocurro's instead of
buying<00:02:23.330> five<00:02:23.900> or<00:02:24.080> six<00:02:24.290> petals<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:25.610> modulator

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
buying five or six petals the modulator

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.850 
buying five or six petals the modulator
could<00:02:26.180> be<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> very<00:02:26.420> good<00:02:26.660> choice<00:02:26.810> because<00:02:27.530> of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
could be a very good choice because of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.230 
could be a very good choice because of
all<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.070> presets<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.730> course<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.150> a

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
all the presets and of course it's a

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.450 
all the presets and of course it's a
stereo<00:02:29.600> in<00:02:29.690> stereo<00:02:30.260> out<00:02:30.380> pedal<00:02:30.710> so<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.280> can

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
stereo in stereo out pedal so you can

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.250 
stereo in stereo out pedal so you can
use<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.610> as<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.820> key<00:02:32.030> for<00:02:32.210> player<00:02:32.360> as<00:02:32.480> well<00:02:32.630> or<00:02:32.840> if

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
use it as a key for player as well or if

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.970 
use it as a key for player as well or if
you<00:02:33.350> have<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.740> hundred<00:02:34.070> percent<00:02:34.220> stereo<00:02:34.760> setup
