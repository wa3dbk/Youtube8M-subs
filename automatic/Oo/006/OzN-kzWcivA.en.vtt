00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.740 
pretty damn tricky packaging to be
honest<00:01:59.250> with<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.759> not<00:01:59.790> even<00:02:00.119> sure<00:02:00.360> how<00:02:00.600> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
honest with you I'm not even sure how it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.170 
honest with you I'm not even sure how it
opens<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:02.040> we're<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.189> gonna<00:02:02.430> snap<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.909> box

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.499 

okay<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.409> comes<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.039> center<00:02:08.610> my

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
okay and then out comes the center my

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.940 
okay and then out comes the center my
cake<00:02:09.750> Celeste<00:02:10.200> should<00:02:10.350> put<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.770> one<00:02:10.890> side

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
cake Celeste should put that to one side

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.220 
cake Celeste should put that to one side
we<00:02:11.490> don't<00:02:11.670> need<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.000> anymore

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
we don't need that anymore

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.230 
we don't need that anymore
and<00:02:13.590> inside<00:02:14.100> you've<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.400> some<00:02:14.580> most<00:02:14.760> plastic

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and inside you've got some most plastic

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.210 
and inside you've got some most plastic
protective<00:02:15.720> packaging<00:02:21.709> okay<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:22.770> we're<00:02:23.190> just

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
protective packaging okay so we're just

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.949 
protective packaging okay so we're just
going<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.550> try<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.910> get<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.240> webcam<00:02:24.660> out<00:02:24.870> of

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
going to try and get the webcam out of

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.260 
going to try and get the webcam out of
there<00:02:25.110> there<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:25.380> go

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
there there we go

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.910 
there there we go
you<00:02:27.270> don't<00:02:27.510> actually<00:02:27.660> need<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.050> anymore<00:02:28.800> as

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you don't actually need that anymore as

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.220 
you don't actually need that anymore as

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
look at that in a moment then in here it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.850 
look at that in a moment then in here it
looks<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.660> don't<00:02:36.840> get<00:02:37.020> any<00:02:37.170> driver<00:02:37.500> CD

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860

okay on the back you'd see the cable

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.270 
okay on the back you'd see the cable
goes<00:03:27.060> into<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.450> back<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.810> webcam<00:03:28.280> there

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280
