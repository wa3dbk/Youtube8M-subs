00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
when it first came out I had to think

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.740 
when it first came out I had to think
about<00:05:10.250> where<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:10.640> actually<00:05:10.820> started<00:05:11.420> and<00:05:11.600> I

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
about where it actually started and I

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.750 
about where it actually started and I
think<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.170> big<00:05:12.410> part<00:05:12.710> of<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:12.920> is<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.430> came<00:05:13.580> from

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
think the big part of it is it came from

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.760 
think the big part of it is it came from
kids<00:05:14.030> who<00:05:14.120> ride<00:05:14.330> BMX<00:05:14.630> bikes<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.410> they<00:05:15.620> wear
