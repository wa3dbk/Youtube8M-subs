we're going to pretend that my hand is
the<00:05:48.599> bottom<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.500> once<00:05:49.710> it<00:05:49.919> reaches<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.250> bottom

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
the bottom so once it reaches the bottom

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.820 
the bottom so once it reaches the bottom
you<00:05:51.090> just<00:05:51.330> pull<00:05:51.539> up<00:05:51.659> on<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.960> line<00:05:52.139> to<00:05:52.590> get<00:05:52.710> it

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
you just pull up on the line to get it

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.140 
you just pull up on the line to get it
up<00:05:52.919> off<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.220> bottom<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:53.669> then<00:05:53.849> you<00:05:53.970> let<00:05:54.120> it

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
up off the bottom and then you let it

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.659 
up off the bottom and then you let it
drop<00:05:54.419> again<00:05:54.629> so<00:05:55.289> this<00:05:55.470> is<00:05:55.650> called<00:05:55.889> a<00:05:56.130> jigging

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
drop again so this is called a jigging

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
have any action because this curly tail

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.279 
have any action because this curly tail
when<00:06:34.889> it<00:06:35.009> goes<00:06:35.159> through<00:06:35.460> the<00:06:35.580> water<00:06:35.789> actually

when it goes through the water actually

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.540 
when it goes through the water actually
propels<00:06:37.289> around<00:06:37.710> so<00:06:37.949> i'm<00:06:38.009> going<00:06:38.159> to<00:06:38.219> put<00:06:38.430> it

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
propels around so i'm going to put it

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.209 
propels around so i'm going to put it
with<00:06:38.699> the<00:06:38.729> tail<00:06:39.090> up<00:06:39.300> so<00:06:40.289> that<00:06:40.500> when<00:06:40.680> it<00:06:40.710> drops

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
with the tail up so that when it drops

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:43.070 
with the tail up so that when it drops
and<00:06:41.580> when<00:06:41.729> you<00:06:41.819> lift<00:06:42.060> it<00:06:42.210> up<00:06:42.330> this<00:06:42.779> tale

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
and when you lift it up this tale

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.529 
and when you lift it up this tale
flutters<00:06:43.529> back<00:06:43.740> and<00:06:43.949> forth<00:06:44.219> so<00:06:44.880> jigs<00:06:45.270> work

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
flutters back and forth so jigs work

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.450
