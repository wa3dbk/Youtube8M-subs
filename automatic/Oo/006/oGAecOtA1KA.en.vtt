you shouldn't run into any issues with
your<00:00:45.210> computer<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.760> let's<00:00:47.910> get<00:00:48.030> started<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
your computer so let's get started I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.410 
your computer so let's get started I
guess<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> first<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> want<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.730> open

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
guess so first what I want to do is open

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.790 
guess so first what I want to do is open
up<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.510> catalyst<00:00:51.899> control<00:00:52.320> center<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> can

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
up the catalyst control center you can

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
up the catalyst control center you can
do<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> by<00:00:53.129> right<00:00:53.399> clicking<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.030> desktop

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
do that by right clicking at the desktop

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.139 
do that by right clicking at the desktop
and<00:00:54.780> clicking<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.489> search<00:00:57.120> for

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and clicking this or you can search for

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.200 
and clicking this or you can search for
it<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.809> search<00:00:58.230> bar<00:00:58.559> and<00:01:00.500> open<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
it in the search bar and open it up and

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.530 
it in the search bar and open it up and
it's<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> look<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:05.540> you're

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it's going to look like this and you're

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.609 
it's going to look like this and you're
going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.869> bunch<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.290> options

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
going to have a bunch of these options

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.859 
going to have a bunch of these options
here<00:01:07.680> go<00:01:07.860> under<00:01:08.040> performance<00:01:08.580> now<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
here go under performance now if you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.570 
here go under performance now if you
haven't<00:01:10.080> used<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> catalyst<00:01:10.710> control<00:01:10.830> center

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
haven't used the catalyst control center

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580 
haven't used the catalyst control center
before<00:01:11.970> you're<00:01:12.750> probably<00:01:13.020> only<00:01:13.229> gonna<00:01:13.439> have

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
before you're probably only gonna have

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.200 
before you're probably only gonna have
two<00:01:13.619> options<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> that's<00:01:14.729> CPU

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
two options here and that's CPU

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.469 
two options here and that's CPU
overdrive<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.140> AMD<00:01:16.740> overdrive<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.549> CPU<00:01:18.270> power

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
overdrive and AMD overdrive or CPU power

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
overdrive and AMD overdrive or CPU power
I'm<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.140> totally<00:01:19.320> sure<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.860> you're<00:01:19.979> probably

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
I'm not totally sure but you're probably

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.730 
I'm not totally sure but you're probably
not<00:01:20.610> gonna<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.970> graphics<00:01:21.390> overdrive<00:01:21.900> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
not gonna have graphics overdrive to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.670 
not gonna have graphics overdrive to
enable<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.520> simple<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> was<00:01:25.530> like

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
enable that simple that I was like

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.740 
enable that simple that I was like
speaking<00:01:25.950> towards<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> data<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.330> enable<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
speaking towards the data to enable the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.870 
speaking towards the data to enable the
graphical<00:01:28.110> drive<00:01:28.409> click<00:01:28.710> AMD<00:01:29.280> overdrive<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
graphical drive click AMD overdrive and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.670 
graphical drive click AMD overdrive and
make<00:01:30.210> sure<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.780> enabled<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
make sure it is enabled so you know it

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.069 
make sure it is enabled so you know it
said<00:01:34.860> let's<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.490> ahead<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.820> enable<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
said let's go ahead and enable that so

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.770 
said let's go ahead and enable that so
make<00:01:37.259> sure<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.740> enabled<00:01:38.780> actually

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
make sure this is enabled actually

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.050 
make sure this is enabled actually
disable<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.530> apply<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.850> make<00:01:42.030> sure

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
disable that and apply so make sure

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.120 
disable that and apply so make sure
graphics<00:01:42.659> over<00:01:42.899> drop<00:01:43.079> isn't<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.530> enabled<00:01:44.040> so

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
graphics over drop isn't is enabled so

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030 
graphics over drop isn't is enabled so
you<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.759> option<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:46.380> overclock<00:01:46.950> your

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you get that option so to overclock your

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.480 
you get that option so to overclock your
cpu<00:01:47.659> simply<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.899> go<00:01:49.049> over<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> CPU<00:01:49.799> overdrive

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
cpu simply just go over to CPU overdrive

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.240 
cpu simply just go over to CPU overdrive
and<00:01:50.700> you're<00:01:51.509> probably<00:01:52.140> not<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> have

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and you're probably not going to have

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.929 
and you're probably not going to have
this<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.880> bar<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.399> you<00:01:56.399> want<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.729> check

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
this this bar here and you want to check

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.490

that and click auto-tune click ok and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.899 
that and click auto-tune click ok and
what<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.189> happen<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.790> going

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
what it's going to happen is it's going

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.950 
what it's going to happen is it's going
to<00:02:03.030> progress<00:02:03.360> 100<00:02:04.320> megahertz<00:02:04.590> every<00:02:05.189> time<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
to progress 100 megahertz every time and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.690 
to progress 100 megahertz every time and
it<00:02:06.960> will<00:02:07.140> pretty<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.500> keep<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:08.190> until

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it will pretty much keep going until

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.490 
it will pretty much keep going until
your<00:02:08.970> computer<00:02:09.360> can't<00:02:09.599> handle<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
your computer can't handle it then it

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.920 
your computer can't handle it then it
will<00:02:10.649> reboot<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.400> then<00:02:12.120> you're<00:02:12.599> able<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
will reboot and then you're able to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.559 
will reboot and then you're able to
overclock

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
overclock

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.009 
overclock
-<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.890> right<00:02:15.189> now<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.579> mine<00:02:15.819> at<00:02:16.000> 4.1<00:02:16.689> mega

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
- so right now I have mine at 4.1 mega

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.720 
- so right now I have mine at 4.1 mega
Giga<00:02:17.620> Hertz<00:02:17.890> or<00:02:18.640> megahertz<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:20.379> then<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.890> have

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
Giga Hertz or megahertz and then I have

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.770 
Giga Hertz or megahertz and then I have
to<00:02:21.849> enable<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.239> but<00:02:22.480> then<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:24.250> got<00:02:24.400> 4.2<00:02:25.180> 4.3

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
to enable it but then we got 4.2 4.3

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.890 
to enable it but then we got 4.2 4.3
mine<00:02:26.590> couldn't<00:02:27.129> handle<00:02:27.489> 4.3<00:02:28.150> but<00:02:28.299> I<00:02:28.329> think<00:02:28.810> I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
mine couldn't handle 4.3 but I think I

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.050 
mine couldn't handle 4.3 but I think I
had<00:02:29.049> another<00:02:29.260> program<00:02:29.500> one<00:02:29.920> running<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.489> so

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
had another program one running it so

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.960 
had another program one running it so
just<00:02:31.150> going<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.390> disable<00:02:31.659> that<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.140> imply<00:02:32.650> it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
just going to disable that and imply it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.920 
just going to disable that and imply it
so<00:02:33.970> when<00:02:34.180> you're<00:02:34.269> done<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:34.750> going<00:02:34.870> to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
so when you're done that it's going to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.569 
so when you're done that it's going to
ask<00:02:35.079> you<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.319> reboot<00:02:35.530> I'm<00:02:35.890> pretty<00:02:36.099> sure<00:02:36.310> after

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
ask you to reboot I'm pretty sure after

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.300 
ask you to reboot I'm pretty sure after
you<00:02:36.609> do<00:02:36.819> that<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:38.170> then<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:39.069> should<00:02:39.280> have

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
you do that and then you should have

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.879 
you do that and then you should have
this<00:02:39.489> bar<00:02:39.760> up<00:02:39.909> here<00:02:39.939> and<00:02:40.230> wherever<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.590> made<00:02:41.769> it

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
this bar up here and wherever it made it

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.339 
this bar up here and wherever it made it
to<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.159> this<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.670> should<00:02:43.599> be<00:02:43.629> on<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.079> so<00:02:44.290> you

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
to on this it should be on this so you

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.449 
to on this it should be on this so you
could<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.829> could<00:02:45.040> overclock<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:47.590> thing<00:02:47.829> I<00:02:48.099> I

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
could you could overclock one thing I I

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.569 
could you could overclock one thing I I
have<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.299> stress<00:02:49.659> that<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.620> do<00:02:50.889> not<00:02:51.040> fully

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
have to stress that you do not fully

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.270 
have to stress that you do not fully
overclock<00:02:52.239> your<00:02:52.269> cpu<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.230> max<00:02:53.500> possible

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
overclock your cpu to the max possible

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.210 
overclock your cpu to the max possible
because<00:02:54.760> if<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.780> do<00:02:56.049> that<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.829> cause

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
because if you do that it can cause

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.490 
because if you do that it can cause
problems<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:58.030> your<00:02:58.150> motherboard<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.930> kid<00:02:59.169> if

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
problems to your motherboard a kid if

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.179 
problems to your motherboard a kid if
you<00:02:59.590> have<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.739> crappy<00:03:00.129> heatsink<00:03:00.909> it<00:03:01.120> could

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
you have a crappy heatsink it could

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.569 
you have a crappy heatsink it could
overheat<00:03:03.189> it<00:03:03.430> can<00:03:03.609> do<00:03:03.730> whatever<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:05.220> not<00:03:06.220> good

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579

for your for a computer not at all so

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.879 
for your for a computer not at all so
don't<00:03:09.549> fully<00:03:10.540> overclock<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.409> its<00:03:11.560> max

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
don't fully overclock it to its max

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.129 
don't fully overclock it to its max
potential<00:03:12.370> because<00:03:12.819> it<00:03:13.060> will<00:03:13.299> not<00:03:13.659> be<00:03:13.870> good<00:03:14.019> on

next<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.629> overclock<00:03:23.169> your<00:03:23.290> graphics<00:03:24.010> card

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220

maybe<00:03:24.609> you<00:03:24.790> want<00:03:24.970> overclock<00:03:25.449> your<00:03:25.629> graphics

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
maybe you want overclock your graphics

so you're gonna have a four options here

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.830 
so you're gonna have a four options here
you<00:03:57.370> got<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.609> high<00:03:57.729> performance<00:03:58.150> GPU<00:03:58.599> clock

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
you got the high performance GPU clock

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.750 
you got the high performance GPU clock
which<00:03:59.049> is<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.290> main<00:03:59.439> overclock<00:03:59.889> and<00:04:00.099> slider

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
which is the main overclock and slider

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.250 
which is the main overclock and slider
you<00:04:01.150> got<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.359> high<00:04:01.479> performance<00:04:02.049> memory

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
you got the high performance memory

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.679 
you got the high performance memory
clock<00:04:02.620> settings<00:04:03.010> got<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.879> manual<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.299> fan

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
clock settings got the manual a fan

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.059 
clock settings got the manual a fan
control<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.139> the<00:04:05.199> power<00:04:05.379> control<00:04:05.680> settings

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
control and the power control settings

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.899 
control and the power control settings
for<00:04:07.000> overclock<00:04:07.479> make<00:04:07.870> sure<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.229> enable

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
for overclock make sure you enable

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.789 
for overclock make sure you enable
graphics<00:04:09.909> overdrive<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:11.019> disabled<00:04:11.620> it

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
graphics overdrive that is disabled it

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.759 
graphics overdrive that is disabled it
none<00:04:12.639> of<00:04:12.759> this<00:04:12.849> will<00:04:13.090> actually<00:04:13.479> apply<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:14.409> make

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
none of this will actually apply so make

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.920 
none of this will actually apply so make
sure<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:15.099> have<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.459> enabled<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:17.159> simply

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
sure you have that enabled so simply

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.240 
sure you have that enabled so simply
drag<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.139> to<00:04:20.380> wherever<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.799> want

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
drag it to wherever you want

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.529 
drag it to wherever you want
I<00:04:21.280> recommend<00:04:22.620> keeping<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:24.479> progressing<00:04:25.479> a

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
I recommend keeping it progressing a

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.390 
I recommend keeping it progressing a
hundred<00:04:25.870> megahertz<00:04:26.169> every<00:04:26.620> time<00:04:26.860> so<00:04:27.219> right

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
hundred megahertz every time so right

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.680 
hundred megahertz every time so right
now

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
now

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.730 
now
Emmit<00:04:28.370> let's<00:04:29.370> go<00:04:29.730> to<00:04:29.930> let's<00:04:30.930> just<00:04:31.230> default<00:04:31.620> it

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
Emmit let's go to let's just default it

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.500 
Emmit let's go to let's just default it
so<00:04:32.310> if<00:04:32.550> it's<00:04:32.700> at<00:04:33.030> 1050<00:04:33.890> and<00:04:34.890> overclock<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:36.320> to

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
so if it's at 1050 and overclock it to

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.350 
so if it's at 1050 and overclock it to
1150<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.930> apply<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.860> go<00:04:41.760> over<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.270> your

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
1150 and apply it and go over to your

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360 
1150 and apply it and go over to your
game<00:04:42.600> like<00:04:42.960> minecraft<00:04:43.620> or<00:04:43.770> whatever

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
game like minecraft or whatever

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.910 
game like minecraft or whatever
a<00:04:44.400> game<00:04:44.850> that<00:04:44.880> you<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.620> want<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.860> get

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
a game that you that you want to get

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.520 
a game that you that you want to get
more<00:04:47.040> frames<00:04:47.310> in<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.640> see<00:04:48.450> if<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.810> has<00:04:48.960> changed

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
more frames in and see if it has changed

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.410 
more frames in and see if it has changed
if<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.860> has<00:04:50.070> good<00:04:50.550> go<00:04:50.730> ahead<00:04:50.760> just<00:04:51.090> leave<00:04:51.300> it

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
if it has good go ahead just leave it

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.510 
if it has good go ahead just leave it
like<00:04:51.450> that<00:04:51.600> don't<00:04:52.080> change<00:04:52.470> anything<00:04:52.770> else

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
like that don't change anything else

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.740 
like that don't change anything else
just<00:04:54.030> leave<00:04:54.210> it<00:04:54.330> like<00:04:54.480> that

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
just leave it like that

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.680 
just leave it like that
and<00:04:55.370> then<00:04:56.930> then<00:04:57.930> you're<00:04:58.140> set<00:04:58.410> up<00:04:59.420> what<00:05:00.420> you<00:05:00.510> do

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
and then then you're set up what you do

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.650 
and then then you're set up what you do
not<00:05:00.810> want<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.170> do<00:05:01.290> is<00:05:01.610> simply<00:05:02.610> drag<00:05:03.120> everything

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
not want to do is simply drag everything

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.620 
not want to do is simply drag everything
to<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.260> max<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:05.700> do<00:05:05.940> not<00:05:06.120> want<00:05:06.420> to<00:05:06.510> do<00:05:06.600> that

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
to the max you do not want to do that

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.470 
to the max you do not want to do that
that<00:05:06.960> will<00:05:07.290> crash<00:05:07.920> your<00:05:08.220> computer<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:09.030> that

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
that will crash your computer and that

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.570 
that will crash your computer and that
is<00:05:09.540> not<00:05:10.050> good<00:05:10.350> for<00:05:10.380> your<00:05:10.560> graphics<00:05:11.010> card<00:05:11.370> at

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
is not good for your graphics card at

because for my graphics card I don't

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.920 
because for my graphics card I don't
know<00:05:19.200> for<00:05:19.380> years<00:05:19.680> but<00:05:20.130> it<00:05:20.520> has<00:05:21.030> it<00:05:21.360> detects<00:05:21.750> if

it goes past 1/3 certain threshold it

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.560 
it goes past 1/3 certain threshold it
increases<00:05:25.950> the<00:05:26.040> fan<00:05:26.250> speed<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:26.700> mine<00:05:26.940> 69

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
increases the fan speed so mine 69

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.720 
increases the fan speed so mine 69
degrees<00:05:27.990> as<00:05:28.560> soon<00:05:28.830> as<00:05:28.980> it<00:05:29.100> goes<00:05:29.190> past<00:05:29.550> that

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.680 
degrees as soon as it goes past that
threshold<00:05:30.210> it<00:05:30.840> has<00:05:31.170> 70<00:05:31.740> into<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.430> 80s<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:33.420> fan
