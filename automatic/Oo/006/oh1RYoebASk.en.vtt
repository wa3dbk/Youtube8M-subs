00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.120
 Good morning guys. Show me a little bit. 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.420
 Do not wake up and 200 liters. 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.420
 community with home filter 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.599
 there is the filter 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.869
 is an aquarium of 40 books I had and 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.430
 to ask for a 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.019
 Piece of glass with apodi is making 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:38.019
 these agencies will pay this effect 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:41.440
 Cascade is very simple staff is we have 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:44.140
 the first in the same compartment there 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.460
 that the water inlet passes underneath 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:54.300
 under the channel displayed voice is an advantage and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:59.640
 mechanics and there it is also 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.679
 behind mechanical still goes up ceramics 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.679
 reserved book advises passes 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:09.750
 Underneath it rises again and falls to 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:09.750
 ball there where it gives the return to the court 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.300
 The very simple filter is to solve the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.880
 problems of the parameters he had 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.770
 that it is still up to water to maintain a 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.130
 good quality of fish life without me 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.130
 it helped a lot 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.479
 Only in the aquarium I decided to go pro. 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.820
 to the glass then adapt and also 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.159
 those who fame and who withdraws from 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.840
 water is not a barrel of three 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.770
 rooms water pipe construction 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.229
 normal cheap also very simple one 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.369
 format error inside to 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.549
 inside the water on the back is also 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:02.530
 the format is the same only have a hose 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:05.039
 which captures water back to our filter 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.039
 here o 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.490
 then I'll show a little the 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:15.890
 Gentlemen, how does this effect work? 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.890
 runs to get the water out of the court 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.330
 basically it is equal to the back 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:33.480
 only a small differential has the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:39.350
 apart it captures the water there the water 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.350
 It seems normal until you get back on the court. 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:49.440
 the only differential that has mt has to 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.530
 do in fact at the time she covers dean 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.570
 it is part of the connections and adapts 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.250
 mangueirinha there to give start 1 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.550
 ciffoni to take the air out of the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.680
 siphon the only thing that has 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:08.310
 different there that I had to adapt I 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:10.140
 I did not know but have enough tutorial to 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.959
 about yourself as there are several types 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.790
 several models but can enter 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:21.030
 design that will meet you and only more 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.709
 Something personal also here I had 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.750
 that making glasses is when you get married 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.930
 there is a power outage 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.180
 the ball stops working what we people 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.350
 have to be careful 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.410
 watch there if it was it captures the water well 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.310
 up in the mirror in the mirror of the water 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.150
 on top, then if there is a fall of 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.989
 energy 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.000
 you can see that there is this space there 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.520
 be completed 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.380
 so if kakÃ¡ energy is missing form and 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.350
 maybe some water up there in 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.510
 water mirror will complete a little 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:06.570
 here there is no danger of carrying 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:09.000
 Calm down 40 liters there, he's full. 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.490
 so will you bear in my case here not 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.940
 had overflowed but makes the measurements 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:19.299
 there happened 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:24.600
 your there the energy coming back to the pump 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:28.710
 back up and return the water to the 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.710
 to teach him 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.820
 in my case here the siphons as they were 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.150
 Full they come back to work. 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:42.460
 usually but if you do not go back 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.230
 You 'll have to go there and get the air out. 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.870
 direct if it is to pay a difference 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.640
 people showed is to be watchful to see if he 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.130
 normal return there is no danger that a 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.610
 bomb in my case here he came back to 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.610
 work normally 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.380
 I hung up, did the tests. 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.140
 I turned off what he captures 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.990
 do not overflow it's the book again he 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.150
 go back to mouths glory 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.160
 if it comes back java works normally 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.740
 so I had no problem 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.270
 but I recommend that you do the tests there 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.860
 for the pump burn time 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.600
 personnel's with a return pump 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.570
 1,400 liters with two halls there is the 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.470
 supreme is calm 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:31.360
 the parameters and set the life 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:37.210
 water quality and fish life already 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:40.360
 everything is quiet, is not that what I 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.090
 I had to share it with you and 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.890
 I hope you have enjoyed any 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.520
 doubt any clarification is just 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:51.130
 leave posted there that people respond 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.630
 there as much as possible and thank you very much 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.630
 All good, God rest with you.
