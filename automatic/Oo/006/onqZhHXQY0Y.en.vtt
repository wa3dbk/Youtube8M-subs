00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.590
 remaining 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.719
 and with that we have finished the stage of 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.719
 our packaging 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.220

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.810
 of metallic cardboard 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.290
 now about the outline of our 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.330
 heart we will stick a 6 x 65 tape 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.680

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.680

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.030
 remaining 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.050
 as decoration we will cross two ribbons of 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.320
 lace over the lid in this way 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.820
 over which we will stick a little bit that 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.820
 We have made with the same material 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.390

 your crafts 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:46.310
 to finish we place and paste the 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.310
 tie in this way 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.470
