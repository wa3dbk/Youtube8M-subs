00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.449
 In this part, we will learn about LED 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.420
 basic concept. 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.260
 Light-emitting diode (LED) 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.040
 Very small, is a type that can be used alone or 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.530
 Used for point sources in multiple chips. 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.279
 Optical materials can be used in LED chips or clusters 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.439
 To control and filter light. 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.760
 If the LED chip or cluster, and its driver, 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.949
 It is packaged in the bulb using traditional lamp feet. 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.199
 We can use it instead of incandescent lamps. 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.379
 This is called 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.670
 LED retrofit lights. 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.050
 Spectral power distribution by marking the light at each wavelength in the visible spectrum 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.610
 power, 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.980
 Describe the characteristics of light. 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.730
 The materials available today enable us to manufacture 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.260
 LEDs of all colors. Spectral power distribution 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.120
 It is always very narrow. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.620
 Since the spectrum of a single LED is always narrow, 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.020
 It is not yet possible to manufacture white LED chips. 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.220
 But by mixing red, green and blue, 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.360
 A white LED light can be obtained. 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.170
 Adding an LED chip to a single module or system, 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.140
 Can emit white light. 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.200
 Therefore, a single LED that can emit red, green, and blue light 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.820
 Can emit white light. 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.460
 This type of LED is called an RGB tri-color LED. 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.799
 It consists of 4 pins, 1 for each color, 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.430
 There is also one for the common cathode. 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.800
 Using a combination of blue LED chips and yellow fluorescent materials, 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.180
 We call it a phosphor and we can get high quality. 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.190
 White light. This is called 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.470
 White phosphor LED. 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.500
 This picture shows such a white phosphor LED 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.530
 Spectral power distribution. We can see that, 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.780
 The light emitted almost covers the whole 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.210
 Visible spectrum. 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.850
 There are many magical benefits to using LEDs. 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.500
 LED has a long service life. Professional lamps have a service life of 75.000. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.700
 The consumer's retrofit LED has a lifetime of approximately 20.000 hours. 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.340
 LEDs save energy. 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.569
 LED lights are as effective as compact fluorescent lights. 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.450
 Its efficiency is about six times that of incandescent lamps. 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.810
 The light emitted by the LED does not include any 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.610
 Infrared or ultraviolet radiation. This allows the LED to be used safely 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.540
 Thermally sensitive materials or UV sensitive materials. 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.440
 Due to these benefits, many LEDs are used as a major part of the luminaire. 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.500
 Thank you!
