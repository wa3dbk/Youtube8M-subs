the best way to truly experience Android
in<00:02:19.770> my<00:02:19.890> opinion<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:21.030> only<00:02:21.180> problem<00:02:21.510> I've

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
in my opinion the only problem I've

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.970 
in my opinion the only problem I've
really<00:02:21.780> noticed<00:02:21.930> doesn't<00:02:22.350> really<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.800> do

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
really noticed doesn't really have to do

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.770 
really noticed doesn't really have to do
with<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.220> processing<00:02:23.730> power<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.360> much<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.660> it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
with the processing power as much as it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.630 
with the processing power as much as it
has<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.050> do<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.530> power<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.250> graphics

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
has to do with the power of the graphics

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.260 
has to do with the power of the graphics
card<00:02:26.730> aka<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.930> Adreno<00:02:28.290> 330<00:02:28.650> GPU<00:02:29.270> it's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
card aka the Adreno 330 GPU it's

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.850 
card aka the Adreno 330 GPU it's
probably<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.690> most<00:02:30.810> dated<00:02:31.170> component<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.770> the

probably the most dated component on the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.160 
probably the most dated component on the

so<00:02:34.770> many<00:02:34.980> new<00:02:35.190> animations<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:36.420> can

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
so many new animations it can

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.660 
so many new animations it can
occasionally<00:02:36.960> stutter<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.860> show<00:02:38.130> signs<00:02:38.520> of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
lag here and there it's really not much

lag here and there it's really not much
at<00:02:41.220> all<00:02:41.340> but<00:02:41.550> it's<00:02:41.730> slightly<00:02:42.030> more<00:02:42.330> noticeable

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
at all but it's slightly more noticeable

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.720 
at all but it's slightly more noticeable
it's<00:02:43.530> more<00:02:43.800> noticeable<00:02:43.920> when<00:02:44.400> you're<00:02:44.520> really

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
it's more noticeable when you're really

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.490 
it's more noticeable when you're really
playing<00:02:45.030> games<00:02:45.360> especially<00:02:45.690> graphically

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
intensive games obviously since they you

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.590 
intensive games obviously since they you
know<00:02:49.140> require<00:02:49.500> more<00:02:49.710> GPU<00:02:50.160> power<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:51.270> besides

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
know require more GPU power but besides

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.560 
know require more GPU power but besides
