00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.460
 man she is he guys and answer one 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.710
 question with amateur and chew gum 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.170
 and today's our mod is just a chewing gum 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.180
 churing chewing gum mod which 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.460
 Today I will show quite controversial but 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.780
 nevertheless, it â€™s worth it to show 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.180
 here so kraft normal 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.160
 chewing gum more precisely the basis of this 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.530
 the basis can not be used in any way 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.140
 just throw out all you need further 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.789
 continue to craft and only with her to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.370
 this basis need to add some 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.290
 dye or for example, and watermelon can 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.090
 another dye to add and each 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.730
 time we will get a new chewing 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.010
 gum but if you put this kind of craft 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.630
 then we get a rainbow din which from 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.250
 self is the combination of all 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.730
 chewing gums that just 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.590
 were 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 and now let's consider specific 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.829
 their already more detail the only thing that I 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.750
 don't like it their textures they 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.850
 look like these chewing strips on 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.260
 my mind is not very cool though with 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.190
 the other side how can they be different 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 was show 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.339
 try to heal it we get the effect 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.010
 heist this cud we got from green 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.060
 dye it gives effect 6 on literally 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.130
 a few seconds for 4 seconds that is in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.890
 for four seconds we dig faster 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.750
 well that's not for half a minute because we 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.930
 just for chewing the cud let's 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 eat it again and again and again 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.500
 how do you see the textures to this girl 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.060
 gradually changing but pure asya 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.049
 human point of view a little bit 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.030
 straining. 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.340
 we live the same cud already which 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.409
 but it cannot last forever and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.600
 one day it will end then 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.860
 have we get another effect and here 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.330
 this thing is already impossible 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.330
 use unless throw out 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.100
 there are also other chewing gums 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.619
 alive in which we get ourselves 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.210
 various other some effects but they 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.369
 briefly literally a few 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.920
 seconds and use them for real 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.750
 can not but can not show rosy 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.270
 chewing gum which gives immediately 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.280
 all the effects that are here in general 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.049
 principle yes it can be used then 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.939
 have let's say you came up some 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.310
 high wall for chewing gum and 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.840
 jumped on this wall but in my opinion 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.140
 use it really 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.599
 not cool enough well that's all mod 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.790
 very small and in my opinion this mod 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.040
 doesn't even deserve 5 pit 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.230
 put 3 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.250
 network will now explain why in the first place 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.650
 textures 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.650
 nothing of course different to do 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.129
 especially somehow it was impossible but it is not 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.280
 canal 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.349
 Secondly, the idea is basically okay. 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.329
 be chewing gum in minecraft 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.180
 someone likes it but to me personally it 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.069
 looks like a meaningless thing 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.349
 which nobody needs then these effects 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.049
 I'd rather tell myself a normal potion 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.329
 Further use it is clear that 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.730
 we scuffed one chewing gum and get for 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.400
 this is just the effect of speed up to 4 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.079
 seconds is not cool but as i said 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.609
 from a purely human point of view we 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.819
 it turns out to be housing the same cud 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.430
 several times you do that and i'm not well 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.439
 and all together it certainly pours out into 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.239
 point 3 out of 10 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.159
 maybe someone might have this 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.590
 question of walruses and why do you even take 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.989
 such a bad mod for a review I will say why 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.250
 I'm after all, surveyor guys I have to 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.500
 take some mod 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.569
 and express your opinion on this fashion 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.120
 so please don't really 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.859
 angry i give my opinion on 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.900
 this fashion and you listen to him 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.849
 such work we have thank you all for 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.040
 viewing with you was matthew 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.859
 bye bye you see this purple 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.959
 big design is psychological 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.319
 trap let's look at its principle 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.319
 actions
