and I think it's gonna really help you

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.400 
and I think it's gonna really help you
especially<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.639> creating<00:00:09.150> your<00:00:09.330> class<00:00:09.599> so

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
especially in creating your class so

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.259 
especially in creating your class so
today<00:00:10.889> I'm<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.490> testing<00:00:11.940> out<00:00:12.059> all

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
today I'm going to be testing out all

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.259 
today I'm going to be testing out all
the<00:00:12.599> LMGs<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.679> assault<00:00:13.980> rifles<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> LMGs

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the LMGs the assault rifles and the LMGs

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.240 
the LMGs the assault rifles and the LMGs
so<00:00:15.809> I'm<00:00:16.139> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> be<00:00:16.500> shooting<00:00:16.770> them<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
so I'm going to be shooting them and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.429 
so I'm going to be shooting them and
testing<00:00:17.699> them<00:00:17.730> out<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.570> without<00:00:18.869> grip

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
testing them out with and without grip

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.320 
testing them out with and without grip
and<00:00:19.619> you're<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> results<00:00:21.210> on

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
and you're going to see the results on

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.990 
and you're going to see the results on
screen<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.199> I'm<00:00:23.010> also<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.640> testing

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
screen and I'm also going to be testing

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
screen and I'm also going to be testing
out<00:00:24.060> all<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> semi<00:00:24.660> autos<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.470> burst

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
out all the semi autos and the burst

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.130 
out all the semi autos and the burst
fires<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.400> fully<00:00:26.730> auto<00:00:27.090> mode<00:00:27.420> using<00:00:28.050> the

fires in fully auto mode using the
select<00:00:28.500> fire<00:00:28.650> attachment<00:00:29.340> now<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> results

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
select fire attachment now the results

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.900 
select fire attachment now the results
that<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.170> get<00:00:31.380> are<00:00:31.529> pretty<00:00:31.980> surprising<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
that I get are pretty surprising and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.850 
that I get are pretty surprising and
you're<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> see<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.350> video<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
you're going to see in this video that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.280 
you're going to see in this video that
grip<00:00:35.100> has<00:00:35.280> little<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.910> no<00:00:35.940> effect<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.780> most<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
grip has little to no effect on most of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
grip has little to no effect on most of
the<00:00:37.410> weapons<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.760> some<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> weapons

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the weapons and on some of the weapons

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
the weapons and on some of the weapons
grip<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.530> little<00:00:40.770> influence<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
grip has so little influence on the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.299 
grip has so little influence on the
weapons<00:00:42.420> recoil<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.290> recoil<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.950> actually

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
weapons recoil the recoil is actually

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.819 
weapons recoil the recoil is actually
worse<00:00:44.610> than<00:00:44.640> without<00:00:45.149> grip<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.440> pretty

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
worse than without grip which is pretty

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.250 
worse than without grip which is pretty
surprising<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:48.120> keep<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.660> mind<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.050> I'm

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
surprising now keep in mind that I'm

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
surprising now keep in mind that I'm
doing<00:00:49.469> these<00:00:49.680> tests<00:00:50.219> at<00:00:50.399> close<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> medium

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
doing these tests at close to medium

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.350 
doing these tests at close to medium
range<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.620> let's<00:00:53.010> say<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.370> example<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.879> we

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
range so let's say for example that we

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.389 
range so let's say for example that we
saw<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.110> video<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> grip<00:00:56.129> didn't

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
saw in this video that the grip didn't

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
saw in this video that the grip didn't
make<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.760> much<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.239> difference<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
make that much of a difference for the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.430 
make that much of a difference for the
recoil<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> MSMC<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.840> you're<00:01:01.050> rushing

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
recoil for the MSMC so if you're rushing

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.650 
recoil for the MSMC so if you're rushing
around<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.890> MSMC<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.059> might<00:01:03.300> want<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
around the MSMC you might want to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.590 
around the MSMC you might want to
consider<00:01:03.960> replacing<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.129> grip<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:06.210> more

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
consider replacing the grip of a more

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
consider replacing the grip of a more
useful<00:01:06.780> attachment<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.680> quick<00:01:08.310> draw<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
useful attachment like quick draw or a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.179 
useful attachment like quick draw or a
laser<00:01:09.299> sight<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.530> happens<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:11.010> you're

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
laser sight but what happens if you're

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.340 
laser sight but what happens if you're
far<00:01:11.490> away<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:12.900> more<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
far away and you know you're more like a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.590 
far away and you know you're more like a
defensive<00:01:14.010> player<00:01:14.280> where<00:01:14.580> you'd<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> sit

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
defensive player where you'd like to sit

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.899 
defensive player where you'd like to sit
in<00:01:15.689> windows<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.530> head<00:01:16.799> glitch<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.729> want

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
in windows and head glitch and you want

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
in windows and head glitch and you want
to<00:01:17.970> pick<00:01:18.150> people<00:01:18.479> off<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> far<00:01:19.020> away<00:01:19.049> well<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
to pick people off and far away well I

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
to pick people off and far away well I
did<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> test<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.270> testing<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.200> guns

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
did a test on this testing all the guns

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.380 
did a test on this testing all the guns
wolf<00:01:22.890> grip<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.340> without<00:01:23.700> grip<00:01:24.000> from<00:01:24.150> long

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
wolf grip and without grip from long

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.330 
wolf grip and without grip from long
range<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.320> results<00:01:25.770> were<00:01:25.860> basically

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
range and the results were basically

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.060 
range and the results were basically
identical<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> thought<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.619> gripped<00:01:28.920> in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
identical so if you thought I gripped in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.770 
identical so if you thought I gripped in
and<00:01:29.220> make<00:01:29.310> any<00:01:29.549> difference<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.240> an<00:01:30.360> assault

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and make any difference on an assault

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.380 
and make any difference on an assault
rifle<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.860> video<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:33.030> probably

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
rifle in this video then it's probably

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.819 
rifle in this video then it's probably
not<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> make<00:01:33.930> any<00:01:34.110> difference<00:01:34.259> even

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
not going to make any difference even

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.340 
not going to make any difference even
from<00:01:35.189> long<00:01:35.430> range<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.079> one

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
from long range but I'm not really one

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.990 
from long range but I'm not really one
to<00:01:37.409> tell<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> whether<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.430> should<00:01:38.490> use<00:01:38.759> grip

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
to tell you whether you should use grip

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969 
to tell you whether you should use grip
