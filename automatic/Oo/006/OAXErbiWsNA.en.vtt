00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.250 

this<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.260> particular<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:36.260> gunmetal

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
this one in particular is in gunmetal

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.190 
this one in particular is in gunmetal
color<00:00:41.149> there's<00:00:42.149> not<00:00:42.329> much<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.780> review<00:00:43.140> or

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
color there's not much of a review or

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.069 
color there's not much of a review or
show-and-tell<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.789> YouTube<00:00:45.270> regarding<00:00:45.600> this

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
show-and-tell in YouTube regarding this

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.580 
show-and-tell in YouTube regarding this
break<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.030> might<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.180> well<00:00:48.210> throw<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.469> in

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
break so might as well throw one in

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
break so might as well throw one in
there<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:56.180> first<00:00:57.180> thing<00:00:57.390> you're<00:00:57.510> gonna<00:00:57.570> notice

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
there so first thing you're gonna notice

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.450 
there so first thing you're gonna notice
is<00:00:59.660> it's<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.020> nicely<00:01:01.530> made<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.160> pretty

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
is it's a it's nicely made it's pretty

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:14.700 
is it's a it's nicely made it's pretty
clean<00:01:05.390> yes<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:07.100> titanium<00:01:08.100> hardware

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:24.920 

nicely<00:01:15.710> machined

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.219 

some<00:01:25.950> plastic<00:01:26.950> parks<00:01:27.579> here<00:01:27.909> save<00:01:28.840> late<00:01:29.110> I

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
some plastic parks here save late I

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.859 
some plastic parks here save late I
guess<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.680> it's<00:01:33.460> it's<00:01:33.729> nicely<00:01:34.000> made<00:01:34.570> breaks

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
guess but it's it's nicely made breaks

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
guess but it's it's nicely made breaks
it's<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.729> pretty<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.270> seems<00:01:37.450> pretty<00:01:37.630> quality

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it's it's pretty it seems pretty quality

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.800 
it's it's pretty it seems pretty quality
so<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:41.439> a<00:01:41.560> dual<00:01:41.799> pivot<00:01:42.189> so<00:01:42.850> that's<00:01:43.509> gonna<00:01:43.689> be

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
so it's a dual pivot so that's gonna be

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.639 
so it's a dual pivot so that's gonna be
one<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.819> the<00:01:49.329> second<00:01:49.750> one<00:01:49.869> will<00:01:50.140> be<00:01:50.170> this

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
one here and the second one will be this

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:05.700 
one here and the second one will be this
one<00:01:50.710> which<00:01:54.450> slides<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.450> bar<00:01:58.720> right<00:01:59.080> there

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.640 

solving<00:02:06.710> with<00:02:06.980> breaks<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:12.020> actually<00:02:12.410> works

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
solving with breaks it actually works

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.290 
solving with breaks it actually works
this<00:02:13.070> way

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.260 

so<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.620> dual<00:02:20.890> pivot<00:02:21.280> system<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:23.580> heard<00:02:24.580> that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
so it's a dual pivot system I heard that

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.810 
so it's a dual pivot system I heard that
install<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.260> fine<00:02:26.590> tuning<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> little<00:02:27.700> bit

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
install and fine tuning is a little bit

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.260 
install and fine tuning is a little bit
of<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.620> job<00:02:29.620> because<00:02:30.190> it's<00:02:30.460> pretty<00:02:30.850> sensitive

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
of a job because it's pretty sensitive

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.670 
of a job because it's pretty sensitive
to<00:02:32.100> cable<00:02:33.100> housing<00:02:33.310> lengths<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:38.200> guys<00:02:38.440> are

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
to cable housing lengths so you guys are

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.500 
to cable housing lengths so you guys are
update<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.730> once<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.090> install<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.720> so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
update on that and once I install it so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.160 
update on that and once I install it so
okay<00:02:44.370> running<00:02:45.370> there<00:02:45.700> comes<00:02:46.630> with<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.930> brake

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
okay running there comes with the brake

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.550 
okay running there comes with the brake
pads<00:02:47.440> already

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.960 

they<00:02:53.560> say<00:02:53.920> it's<00:02:54.220> Swiss<00:02:54.670> stops<00:02:55.030> but<00:02:56.820> I'm<00:02:57.820> not

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
they say it's Swiss stops but I'm not

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.960 
they say it's Swiss stops but I'm not
sure<00:03:01.620> doesn't<00:03:02.620> look<00:03:02.800> like<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.160> but<00:03:03.490> I'll<00:03:03.670> be

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
sure doesn't look like it but I'll be

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.550 
sure doesn't look like it but I'll be
changing<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.960> with<00:03:05.290> Salman<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:08.230> like<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.500> said

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
changing that with Salman so like I said

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.090 
changing that with Salman so like I said
these<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:09.010> gunmetal<00:03:09.370> color<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:11.680> uh<00:03:14.100> it's

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
these the gunmetal color it's uh it's

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.270 
these the gunmetal color it's uh it's
it's<00:03:15.490> in<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.730> darker<00:03:16.300> shade<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.230> than<00:03:18.070> their

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's in a darker shade of than their

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.130 
it's in a darker shade of than their
also<00:03:18.430> it's<00:03:18.730> perfect<00:03:19.210> for<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.510> black<00:03:19.750> frame<00:03:25.140> so

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
also it's perfect for the black frame so

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.080 
also it's perfect for the black frame so
that's<00:03:26.500> that

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.759 

comes<00:03:30.780> with<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:32.900> some<00:03:33.900> tools<00:03:35.269> washers<00:03:36.269> and

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
comes with this some tools washers and

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:44.420 
comes with this some tools washers and
cable<00:03:37.769> pinch<00:03:39.769> that<00:03:40.769> goes<00:03:42.620> right<00:03:43.620> here<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
cable pinch that goes right here and the

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:52.640 
cable pinch that goes right here and the
hook<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:47.450> weighed<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.720> on<00:03:48.840> my<00:03:49.049> scale<00:03:50.540> it's<00:03:51.650> forty

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
hook I weighed it on my scale it's forty

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.009 
hook I weighed it on my scale it's forty
eight<00:03:52.830> point<00:03:53.459> forty<00:03:53.940> eight<00:03:54.060> pounds<00:03:54.569> which<00:03:54.780> is

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
eight point forty eight pounds which is

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.880 
eight point forty eight pounds which is
equivalent<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:56.840> two<00:03:57.840> hundred<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.319> seventeen

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
equivalent to two hundred and seventeen

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.110 
equivalent to two hundred and seventeen
grams<00:04:00.379> so<00:04:01.379> but<00:04:01.680> supposedly<00:04:02.370> it's<00:04:02.519> rated<00:04:03.090> for

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
grams so but supposedly it's rated for

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.460 
grams so but supposedly it's rated for
it's<00:04:03.870> rated<00:04:04.470> at<00:04:04.849> sub<00:04:05.849> 200<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.870> says<00:04:07.230> on<00:04:07.380> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
it's rated at sub 200 it says on the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.680 
it's rated at sub 200 it says on the
websites<00:04:07.920> like<00:04:09.140> 197<00:04:10.549> I<00:04:11.549> don't<00:04:11.940> know<00:04:12.030> maybe

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
websites like 197 I don't know maybe

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.460 
websites like 197 I don't know maybe
without<00:04:16.700> pads<00:04:17.700> there<00:04:18.090> or<00:04:18.269> something<00:04:18.690> most

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
without pads there or something most

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.650 
without pads there or something most
likely<00:04:19.859> without<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.220> pads<00:04:20.459> it's<00:04:21.209> just<00:04:21.479> a

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
likely without the pads it's just a

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.920 
likely without the pads it's just a
cartridge<00:04:22.019> holder<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.700> break<00:04:23.700> itself<00:04:24.060> so

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
cartridge holder and break itself so
