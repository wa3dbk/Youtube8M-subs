today was her agility day we spent the
workout<00:00:08.109> going<00:00:08.320> over<00:00:08.620> the<00:00:08.710> five<00:00:08.920> ten<00:00:09.160> five<00:00:09.400> in

the<00:00:09.760> album<00:00:10.260> we<00:00:11.260> did<00:00:11.410> some<00:00:11.620> precursor<00:00:12.220> drills

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
the album we did some precursor drills

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.019 
the album we did some precursor drills
to<00:00:13.030> prime<00:00:13.990> them<00:00:14.200> or<00:00:14.950> get<00:00:15.370> them<00:00:15.460> ready<00:00:15.670> for<00:00:15.760> the

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
to prime them or get them ready for the

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.089 
to prime them or get them ready for the
drills<00:00:16.420> and<00:00:16.689> then<00:00:17.470> actually<00:00:17.769> went<00:00:17.980> into

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
drills and then actually went into

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.939 
drills and then actually went into
performing<00:00:18.940> the<00:00:19.810> concept<00:00:20.289> of<00:00:20.380> these<00:00:20.560> drills

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
performing the concept of these drills

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.550 
performing the concept of these drills
that<00:00:21.160> have<00:00:21.250> put<00:00:21.400> these<00:00:21.520> kids<00:00:21.789> in<00:00:22.119> a<00:00:22.560> unathletic

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
that have put these kids in a unathletic

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.400 
that have put these kids in a unathletic
position<00:00:24.369> or<00:00:25.060> an<00:00:25.150> unofficial<00:00:25.630> position<00:00:26.230> and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
position or an unofficial position and

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.540 
position or an unofficial position and
see<00:00:26.560> how<00:00:26.710> well<00:00:26.949> they<00:00:27.160> adjust<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.119> it<00:00:29.160> before<00:00:30.160> we

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
see how well they adjust to it before we

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.819 
see how well they adjust to it before we
start<00:00:30.820> every<00:00:31.090> single<00:00:31.270> workout<00:00:31.779> we<00:00:32.439> go<00:00:32.619> through

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
start every single workout we go through

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.490 
start every single workout we go through
a<00:00:32.859> complete<00:00:33.129> dynamic<00:00:33.850> warmup<00:00:34.239> that<00:00:35.079> starts

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
a complete dynamic warmup that starts

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.410 
a complete dynamic warmup that starts
with<00:00:35.590> myofascial<00:00:36.130> release<00:00:36.399> improving<00:00:37.300> the

with myofascial release improving the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.660 
with myofascial release improving the
quality<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.020> tissue<00:00:38.399> waking<00:00:39.399> up<00:00:39.550> the

nervous system in a ladder routine and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.560

then<00:00:42.040> it's<00:00:42.190> all<00:00:42.399> dynamic<00:00:42.640> in<00:00:43.000> nature

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
then it's all dynamic in nature

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.600 
then it's all dynamic in nature
after<00:00:43.930> that<00:00:44.110> we<00:00:44.530> go<00:00:44.649> into<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.890> pre<00:00:45.190> Gap<00:00:45.370> type

after that we go into a pre Gap type

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.760 
after that we go into a pre Gap type

everything<00:01:01.149> we<00:01:01.300> do<00:01:01.449> prior<00:01:01.809> is<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.710> promote<00:01:03.010> the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
everything we do prior is to promote the

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.889 
everything we do prior is to promote the
concept<00:01:03.850> of<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.089> efficiency<00:01:04.629> of<00:01:04.659> movement

we're<00:01:05.619> not<00:01:05.770> just<00:01:05.920> going<00:01:06.039> to<00:01:06.130> take<00:01:06.310> them<00:01:06.460> in

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
we're not just going to take them in

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.190 
we're not just going to take them in
here<00:01:06.819> and<00:01:06.939> go<00:01:07.029> through<00:01:07.060> some<00:01:07.420> arm<00:01:07.569> circles<00:01:08.020> and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
here and go through some arm circles and
