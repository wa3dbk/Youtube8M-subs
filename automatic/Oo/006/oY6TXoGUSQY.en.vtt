00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
looking at right here is the cutscene it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.299 
looking at right here is the cutscene it
shows<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:42.000> before<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> little<00:00:42.719> Inlet<00:00:42.989> cave

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
right place and the holocron we need to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.539 
right place and the holocron we need to
get<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:06.869> about<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:10.280> that's<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> one

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
up to the top and to that exit point and

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.550 
up to the top and to that exit point and
once<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.299> get<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.659> there<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.229> you'll<00:01:19.409> see

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
for the crystal unstable red lightsaber

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.380 
for the crystal unstable red lightsaber
crystal<00:01:36.540> let's<00:01:36.689> take<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> look

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.039 

there<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.110> go

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.620 

and<00:01:47.619> you're<00:01:47.770> gonna<00:01:47.890> hop<00:01:48.219> down<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:49.090> make<00:01:49.479> your

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
and you're gonna hop down and make your

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.179 
and you're gonna hop down and make your
way<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.869> exit<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.380> just<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.799> get<00:01:51.009> one

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.010 
way to the exit and just you get one
more<00:01:51.340> look<00:01:51.399> at<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.880> exit<00:01:52.329> there<00:01:52.539> it<00:01:52.689> is<00:01:52.780> right

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
more look at the exit there it is right

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.350 
more look at the exit there it is right
there<00:01:53.729> there<00:01:54.729> you're<00:01:54.850> gonna<00:01:54.939> make<00:01:55.119> your<00:01:55.210> way

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
running really until you get to a whole

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.470 
running really until you get to a whole
lot<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.560> other<00:02:11.830> red<00:02:13.260> enemies<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.730> big<00:02:16.120> red

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
lot of other red enemies the big red

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.869 
lot of other red enemies the big red
plant<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.410> spit<00:02:17.860> stuff<00:02:18.129> at<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.519> which<00:02:18.730> is

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
plant that spit stuff at you which is

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.320 
plant that spit stuff at you which is
not<00:02:19.150> very<00:02:19.420> nice

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.360 

then<00:02:25.200> you're<00:02:25.290> gonna<00:02:25.380> run<00:02:25.560> around<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.950> corner

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
then you're gonna run around this corner

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.480 
then you're gonna run around this corner
to<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.030> left<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.770> area

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.570 

and<00:02:31.580> once<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.420> get<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.900> end<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> path

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
and once you get to that end of the path

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.730 
and once you get to that end of the path
you<00:02:35.450> will<00:02:35.510> have<00:02:35.660> your<00:02:35.780> second<00:02:36.260> light<00:02:36.470> super

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
you will have your second light super

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.380 
you will have your second light super
crispy

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
crispy

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.610 
crispy
if<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.660> compressed<00:02:39.050> school<00:02:39.260> lates<00:02:39.470> of

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
if the compressed school lates of

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.230 
if the compressed school lates of
crystals<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:40.310> that's<00:02:40.580> all<00:02:40.730> I've<00:02:40.820> got<00:02:41.060> for<00:02:41.090> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.050 
crystals so that's all I've got for you
guys<00:02:41.770> enjoy<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.980> crystals<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.640> will<00:02:43.850> see

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
guys enjoy the crystals and I will see

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.340 
guys enjoy the crystals and I will see
you<00:02:44.150> for<00:02:44.360> our<00:02:44.390> next<00:02:44.480> vid<00:02:44.870> which<00:02:45.080> is<00:02:45.230> the
