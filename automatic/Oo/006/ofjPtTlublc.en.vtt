of this so that'll hold that mirror on
there<00:01:29.610> good<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.600> crew<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
there good and that's a crew and that a

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.850 
there good and that's a crew and that a
sticky<00:01:33.720> part<00:01:33.990> right<00:01:34.170> there<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> middle<00:01:34.740> of

sticky part right there in the middle of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.160 
sticky part right there in the middle of
that<00:01:34.950> piece<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.610> should<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.270> enough<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that piece there should have enough to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.190 
that piece there should have enough to
hold<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:40.100> keep<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:42.270> secure<00:01:42.360> so

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
now so this is what I came up with let's

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.040 
now so this is what I came up with let's
see<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.910> does<00:02:22.070> right<00:02:23.070> here<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.050> here's

with<00:02:40.710> my<00:02:40.830> mirror<00:02:41.540> let's<00:02:42.540> see<00:02:42.690> what<00:02:42.840> we<00:02:42.960> got

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
with my mirror let's see what we got

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.300 
with my mirror let's see what we got
there's<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:46.200> there's<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:47.100> hole<00:02:47.280> I

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
there's this and there's the hole I

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.190 
there's this and there's the hole I
drilled<00:02:47.490> for<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.300> everything<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:49.020> all<00:02:49.170> I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
drilled for it and everything it's all I

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.310 
drilled for it and everything it's all I
have<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.500> do<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:49.860> match<00:02:50.100> up<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> hole<00:02:50.580> and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
have to do is this match up the hole and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.990 
have to do is this match up the hole and
feel<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.350> little<00:02:52.440> sticky<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.070> back<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.550> that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
feel a little sticky on the back of that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.730 
feel a little sticky on the back of that
one<00:02:54.300> area<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.810> drill<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.350> hole<00:02:55.500> through

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
one area and drill the hole through

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.700 
one area and drill the hole through
there<00:02:55.890> once<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.220> get<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.460> all<00:02:56.550> lined<00:02:56.850> up<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:58.140> next

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
there once I get it all lined up so next

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.710 
there once I get it all lined up so next
step<00:02:58.950> I'm<00:02:59.070> going<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.640> figure<00:03:00.630> out

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
step I'm going to do is I figure out

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.810 
step I'm going to do is I figure out
where<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.110> hole<00:03:01.620> exactly<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.310> going

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
where that a hole exactly is going

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.800 
where that a hole exactly is going
through<00:03:03.030> here<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:05.390> then<00:03:06.390> I'll<00:03:06.510> drill<00:03:06.690> that

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
through here and then I'll drill that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.600 
through here and then I'll drill that
hole<00:03:06.990> in<00:03:07.170> there<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.470> put<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:07.980> sticky<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.520> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
hole in there and put that sticky on the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.970 
hole in there and put that sticky on the
back<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.030> I'll<00:03:09.750> have<00:03:09.990> this<00:03:10.140> mounted<00:03:10.350> up<00:03:10.680> then

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
back and I'll have this mounted up then

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.230 
back and I'll have this mounted up then
I'll<00:03:11.070> put<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.310> mirror<00:03:11.550> on<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.760> back<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.090> this

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
I'll put the mirror on the back of this

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.550 
I'll put the mirror on the back of this
and<00:03:12.480> it'll<00:03:13.050> be<00:03:13.110> perfect<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:14.420> mean<00:03:15.420> not<00:03:16.140> perfect

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
and it'll be perfect I mean not perfect

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.630 
and it'll be perfect I mean not perfect
but<00:03:17.190> redneck<00:03:18.000> fixed<00:03:18.360> enough<00:03:18.600> for<00:03:18.810> me<00:03:19.640> right

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
but redneck fixed enough for me right

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
the mirror on it kind of had a raised

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.460 
the mirror on it kind of had a raised
area<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:44.880> I'm<00:03:44.940> trying<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.360> make<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.840> as<00:03:46.050> flush

area so I'm trying to make that as flush
as<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.770> possibly<00:03:47.220> can<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.900> still<00:03:48.900> should<00:03:49.110> hold

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
as I possibly can and still should hold

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.280 
as I possibly can and still should hold
on<00:03:49.440> there<00:03:49.650> good<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.630> with<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:51.780> adhesive<00:03:52.170> on

the back

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.440 
the back
everything<00:03:53.340> should<00:03:53.580> stick<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:53.970> there<00:03:54.150> fine

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
everything should stick on there fine

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.470 
everything should stick on there fine
and<00:03:55.730> now<00:03:56.730> we're<00:03:56.910> going<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.090> move<00:03:57.209> on<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.420> the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and now we're going to move on to the

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.270 
and now we're going to move on to the
next<00:03:57.630> step

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
next step

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.060 
next step
flatten<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.459> screw<00:04:00.330> Dremel<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.380> make<00:04:02.010> a

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
flatten that screw Dremel that make a

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.520 
flatten that screw Dremel that make a
little<00:04:02.250> pocket<00:04:02.459> for<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:03.050> then<00:04:04.050> mount<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.350> up

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
little pocket for it then mount it up

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.070 
little pocket for it then mount it up
there<00:04:04.830> make<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.520> video<00:04:05.850> after<00:04:06.360> it's<00:04:06.690> mounted<00:04:06.959> on

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
there make a video after it's mounted on

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.979 
there make a video after it's mounted on
there<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.830> I'll<00:04:08.040> use<00:04:08.370> those<00:04:08.610> little<00:04:09.540> sticky

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
there and I'll use those little sticky

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.800 
there and I'll use those little sticky
pads<00:04:10.230> there<00:04:11.150> all<00:04:12.150> over<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:13.170> hold<00:04:13.620> on<00:04:14.780> well<00:04:15.780> I

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
pads there all over to hold on well I

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.120 
pads there all over to hold on well I
found<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.260> I'm<00:04:16.380> not<00:04:16.590> going<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> gain<00:04:17.070> just

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
found that I'm not going to gain just

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.420 
found that I'm not going to gain just
one<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.180> two<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:19.440> keep<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.769> from<00:04:19.950> moving

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
one but two to keep it from moving

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.510 
one but two to keep it from moving

around up and down or side to side or
anything<00:04:23.700> like<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.690> did<00:04:25.020> flatten

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
anything like that and I did flatten

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.910

retrospect<00:05:36.990> I<00:05:37.200> kind<00:05:37.470> of<00:05:37.560> wish<00:05:37.710> I<00:05:37.860> would<00:05:38.010> have

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
retrospect I kind of wish I would have

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.950 
retrospect I kind of wish I would have
used<00:05:38.280> like<00:05:38.520> plastic<00:05:39.180> for<00:05:39.360> that<00:05:39.510> I<00:05:39.540> think<00:05:39.870> it

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
used like plastic for that I think it

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.780 
used like plastic for that I think it
probably<00:05:40.230> would<00:05:40.380> have<00:05:40.440> been<00:05:40.700> working<00:05:41.700> a

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
probably would have been working a

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.120 
probably would have been working a
little<00:05:41.910> better<00:05:42.420> than<00:05:42.660> anything<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:43.130> sticky

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
little better than anything that sticky

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.880 
little better than anything that sticky
is<00:05:44.600> would<00:05:45.600> have<00:05:45.660> worked<00:05:46.020> better<00:05:46.230> on<00:05:46.380> that<00:05:46.650> end

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
is would have worked better on that end

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.810 
is would have worked better on that end
like<00:05:47.370> that<00:05:47.550> hard<00:05:47.820> like<00:05:48.690> matting<00:05:49.290> for<00:05:49.530> that

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
like that hard like matting for that

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.000 
like that hard like matting for that
clip<00:05:50.820> but<00:05:51.270> either<00:05:51.690> way<00:05:52.050> it's<00:05:52.350> on<00:05:52.500> there<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:52.890> it

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
clip but either way it's on there and it

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.980 
clip but either way it's on there and it
works<00:05:53.160> just<00:05:53.340> fine<00:05:53.460> ain't<00:05:54.180> going<00:05:54.450> nowhere<00:05:54.780> I

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
works just fine ain't going nowhere I

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.370 
works just fine ain't going nowhere I
mean<00:05:55.290> anything<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:55.560> pull<00:05:56.310> on<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:57.380> coming

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
mean anything you pull on it coming

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.320 
mean anything you pull on it coming
loose<00:05:58.560> coming<00:05:59.490> out<00:06:00.740> so<00:06:01.740> it's<00:06:02.370> a<00:06:02.550> redneck<00:06:03.000> fix

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
loose coming out so it's a redneck fix

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.650 
loose coming out so it's a redneck fix
but<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:04.410> know<00:06:04.590> it<00:06:05.010> works<00:06:05.490> just<00:06:05.940> fine

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
but you know it works just fine

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:14.120 
but you know it works just fine
Yeah<00:06:07.200> right<00:06:09.800> so<00:06:11.660> what<00:06:12.660> do<00:06:12.720> you<00:06:12.780> think<00:06:13.130> cheap

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
Yeah right so what do you think cheap

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.980 
Yeah right so what do you think cheap
redneck<00:06:14.520> sticks<00:06:14.790> that<00:06:15.060> didn't<00:06:15.540> cost<00:06:15.720> me<00:06:15.930> a

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
redneck sticks that didn't cost me a

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.440 
redneck sticks that didn't cost me a
diamond<00:06:16.290> seems<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.370> work<00:06:18.440> awesome
