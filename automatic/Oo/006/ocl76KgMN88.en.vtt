 central bank 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:32.989
 we have central and w1 the baby 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:38.780
 sloop bx 1600 mpf gasoline 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:45.940
 a sloop 1.6 gasoline four spouts more 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 positive negative feed and kubina 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.260
 Flying idle 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.170
 everything here and not only through this 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:00.559
 universal cable 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:10.010
 we will put here O trigger 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:14.780
 our simulator is the one that is tek 25 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:18.020
 luciano is a technical school teacher 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:24.410
 so let's go guys this central she 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.310
 do not fire go bomb do not hit friend 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.120
 bovine 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:35.470
 according to the client's complaint we will 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:41.360
 see what happens to her here, not even 30 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:45.340
 nor the 15 and father who on the right side already 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.340
 triggered idle 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.900
 notice that the main cast also 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.920
 fired the king of the bomb also fired 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:06.409
 just deactivated and the ball 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:09.349
 let's go there again 3015 your love 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.500
 here we have to make the selection of 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.209
 spin our case as the is distributor 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.659
 to 12 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.930
 we have the option here at 12 to 5 60 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.609
 - 2 36 - 1 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.890
 So we'll leave the first one. 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:36.890
 option here 60 minus two correct 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:39.319
 so let's see the rotation obina 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.350
 the four nozzles hit your engine is the 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.740
 average but soon will be 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.480
 sequential 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.920
 This is normal but it is beating and 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.810
 Stew 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.000
 the customer complaint is wrong 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.810
 probably something wrong the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.540
 car 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.540
 most of the central defects 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.739
 in fact it is not defective central defect 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.750
 she in the car 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.470
 Let's take a quick look at what 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.470
 happens here 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.239
 slow gear there 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.370
 you can have a better view 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.900
 I'm going to take the load. 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.210
 You're not going to hear the bouncing. 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.660
 elicarlos but will have the visualization 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.770
 best leds there work for 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:56.290
 negative 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:58.930
 come on and gift sequential pulse 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:04.920
 government or decrease a little more 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.920
 so you can see the pulse 7 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:15.700
 fix there the pulse of the bovine and the wrists 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.840
 of the beak 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.840
 hello cool 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.040
 this is our video around like roll 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.410
 an electronic injection center in the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.410
 workbench until the next video
