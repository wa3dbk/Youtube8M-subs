it's absolutely true the internet has to

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.670 
it's absolutely true the internet has to
be<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.180> more<00:04:00.390> interactive<00:04:00.600> experience<00:04:01.050> and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
be a more interactive experience and

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.310 
be a more interactive experience and
sticking<00:04:02.130> up<00:04:02.250> 15<00:04:02.640> sense<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.150> 15<00:04:03.810> seconds<00:04:04.230> of

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
sticking up 15 sense of 15 seconds of

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.470 
sticking up 15 sense of 15 seconds of
something<00:04:04.680> nobody<00:04:05.430> wants<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.730> see<00:04:06.030> before

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
something nobody wants to see before

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.300 
something nobody wants to see before
something<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.110> they<00:04:07.230> want<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.560> see<00:04:07.710> is<00:04:07.830> not<00:04:08.040> a

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
something that they want to see is not a

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.400 
something that they want to see is not a
very<00:04:08.880> good<00:04:08.940> way<00:04:09.270> of<00:04:09.300> interrupting<00:04:10.020> their<00:04:10.200> day

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
very good way of interrupting their day

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.090 
very good way of interrupting their day
so<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:11.220> think<00:04:11.840> more<00:04:12.840> customized<00:04:13.530> things<00:04:13.860> and

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
so I think more customized things and

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.340 
so I think more customized things and
more<00:04:14.220> consumer-generated<00:04:14.730> ads<00:04:15.540> will<00:04:15.959> be<00:04:16.080> very

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
more consumer-generated ads will be very

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.560 
more consumer-generated ads will be very
