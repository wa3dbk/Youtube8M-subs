00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.620 
is different it's different it is a
remake<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.880> older<00:04:32.880> one<00:04:33.060> if<00:04:33.300> I'm<00:04:33.450> not

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
remake of the older one if I'm not

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.790 
remake of the older one if I'm not
mistaken<00:04:35.090> it's<00:04:36.680> it's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
mistaken it's it's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.129 
mistaken it's it's
pretty<00:04:37.949> cool<00:04:38.159> actually<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.909> don't<00:04:39.690> understand

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
pretty cool actually I don't understand

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.529 
pretty cool actually I don't understand
the<00:04:40.319> meaning<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.909> random<00:04:42.300> hook

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
the meaning of the of the random hook

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.320 
the meaning of the of the random hook
pieces<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.169> are<00:04:43.289> just<00:04:43.470> exposed<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:45.180> not

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
pieces that are just exposed and not

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.990 
pieces that are just exposed and not
being<00:04:45.539> used<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:47.099> looks<00:04:47.280> pretty<00:04:47.370> cool<00:04:47.580> and

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
being used but it looks pretty cool and

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.460 
being used but it looks pretty cool and
if<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.270> compare<00:04:48.629> it<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.900> Clone<00:04:49.110> Wars<00:04:49.229> why

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
if you compare it to the Clone Wars why

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.080 
if you compare it to the Clone Wars why
we<00:04:49.680> it<00:04:49.800> almost<00:04:49.979> looks<00:04:50.190> like<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.370> skeletal

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
we it almost looks like a skeletal

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.439 
we it almost looks like a skeletal
version<00:04:51.539> of<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:52.430> but<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.699> is<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.090> whole

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
version of that but it is a whole

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.270 
version of that but it is a whole
different<00:04:54.720> design<00:04:55.139> so<00:04:55.470> I<00:04:55.500> guess<00:04:55.770> you<00:04:56.039> can't

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
different design so I guess you can't

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.469 
different design so I guess you can't
lie<00:04:56.400> can<00:04:56.550> bear<00:04:56.699> it<00:04:56.729> if<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.180> really<00:04:57.210> think

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
lie can bear it if you really think

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.879 
lie can bear it if you really think
about<00:04:57.599> it<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:59.550> has<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.300> only<00:05:00.419> two<00:05:00.629> stickers<00:05:00.930> one

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
about it it has to only two stickers one

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.740 
about it it has to only two stickers one
here<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.370> on<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:02.970> other<00:05:03.120> side<00:05:03.389> so<00:05:03.629> that's

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
here and on the other side so that's

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.960 
here and on the other side so that's
symmetrical<00:05:04.460> symmetrical<00:05:05.460> stickers<00:05:05.819> are<00:05:05.940> a

more<00:07:06.880> than<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:07.210> ones<00:07:07.660> they<00:07:07.780> have<00:07:07.810> to<00:07:07.960> flick

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.170 
more than the ones they have to flick

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.240 
more than the ones they have to flick
with<00:07:08.320> your<00:07:08.410> fingers<00:07:08.740> because<00:07:08.980> they're<00:07:09.130> just

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
with your fingers because they're just
