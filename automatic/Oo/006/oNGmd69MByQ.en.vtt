00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all so today I do not 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.029
 not going to talk to you about butterflies and 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.980
 other little pots that leads all cute 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.730
 no we attack something good 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.259
 more virile frame at first sight 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.210
 at the level of statistics it is 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.520
 really not great he has a good 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.520
 defense a good attack but all the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.980
 rest is a little bit bad it's 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.869
 ground type which is a pretty good type with 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.539
 quite a bit of weakness and resistance 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.189
 to electricity now he also 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.740
 three special abilities that are only 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.710
 not the most useful he can 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.630
 to have rock head that cancels the damage 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.780
 back when we make an attack like 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.670
 ram or as damocles he can 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.890
 also have lightning rod that is not 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.629
 not very very useful since he is already 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.930
 ground type and that it works mostly in 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.760
 duo finally the last baston armor is 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.670
 perhaps the most practical more than she 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.289
 blocks critical hits 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.550
 the other very positive point home these 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.469
 killers it's who take it really 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.629
 a lot of attack and that's always 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.600
 really nice we decide to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.640
 play a podium this time I'm going 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.500
 start the explanation by talking about 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.479
 the object we are going to give our 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.049
 pokemon because he's a little bit 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.970
 special indeed there is an object that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.650
 literally double the attack of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.500
 saturne and that when we want to play it 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 it is almost unavoidable this object 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.110
 is called the rising mass 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.200
 we can find it more or less 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.070
 easily on the wild bones 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.110
 benefit it in addition to mounting 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.970
 considerably the statistic it is so 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.259
 you play on consoles why because 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.619
 that usually for fighting in 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.600
 line 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.100
 it takes six different objects and having 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.180
 mass doss is rather profitable 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.520
 I propose to play it 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.620
 mapaq signature rise their angles which 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.480
 an attack in two strokes and that's 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.850
 very practical especially to come to 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.590
 end of pokemon are behind at club or 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.720
 again to kill the little fans who have 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.040
 a strength belt 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.930
 after if you are more conservative 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.430
 you can also play with earthquake but 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.860
 it's a shame not to take advantage of 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.360
 benefits of this Morocco for the second 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.400
 attack what seems to me the most 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.500
 relevant is to use motion 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.810
 rock slam for type blanket 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.240
 in the third I would advise you 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.459
 really sabotage as you know 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.290
 became very practical with the sixth 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.660
 generation as his power is at 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.730
 climb in last attack there is 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.350
 several possibilities what we will see 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.450
 more often those attacks in that 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.120
 that will allow him to boost himself and the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.800
 make really very very aggressive and 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.780
 some players will leave as well 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.190
 advantage over other attacks that 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.920
 allow to reach more types 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.380
 including fire point or points hitler 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.030
 okay to do but be careful he 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.680
 must know that this way that I you 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.010
 propose to play is for me the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.959
 best 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.550
 now there are other 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.450
 of this is a young man who is 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.190
 full of resources 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.709
 some will benefit for example 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.959
 more of the rock head combo and 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.730
 damocates of other bodies will use to 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.680
 our future a little more defensive 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.600
 especially to place the rock traps 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.810
 just as it will be quite common 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.610
 to relay a mouth of a speed 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.890
 because his speed really does it the most 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.810
 big belt problem that is very 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.980
 slow far too much white to do the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.200
 damage they should do 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.940
 and the pre solution is that it is 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.160
 usually play it in a team 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.140
 distortion distortion it's a little bit 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.209
 like a climate for five rounds that 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.680
 reverse the towers and that makes that 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.810
 the pokÃ©mons the slowest attacks 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.820
 before the fastest pokemon with 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.440
 our pokemon is exactly what he 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.660
 it takes us to be sure of 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.310
 hit very hard before the opponent is 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.319
 necessarily 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.239
 you have to surround him for that I can 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.040
 advise you several pitchers 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.500
 the attak distortion I like playing 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.750
 with no but yes but we can also 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.910
 talk about betting including 2 with a level of 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.980
 rock that will be extremely beautiful or 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.599
 flag to back off and celia there is 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.310
 really a lot and I invite you to 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.260
 possibly look at the list of all 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.940
 those who love tacc after you 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.620
 can also play it quite 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.300
 normally without distortion 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.860
 and for that it's true that we can count 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.019
 on a defense that is not bad 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.640
 even if we will still be 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.650
 penalized by his bad speed 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.690
 so to raise them there are two 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.090
 solutions depending on if you play 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.489
 under distortion or not if it's the case 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.590
 you have to maximize the tacc and 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.690
 the pv being what's left in defense 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.000
 if you play it normally you have to 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.040
 also maximize the tac but you have to 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.500
 then divide what's left between 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.849
 pv and speed for nature the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.620
 the better they really are 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.320
 governed but possibly under 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.630
 brave distortion it's possible and without 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.669
 malignant distortion it is possible if 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.590
 I hope this little video you 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.870
 will make you want to discover also killer 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.039
 which for me has a big advantage does it 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.810
 that they really learn a lot of 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.820
 attack it makes it very easy to 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.830
 integrate into your team and adapted to 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.669
 your style of play and that's it really 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.260
 appreciable 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.789
 so in any case I tell you to 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.789
 very soon for other videos
