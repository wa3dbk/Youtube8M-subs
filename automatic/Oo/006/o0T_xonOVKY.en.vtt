the Aces is in a stable position

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.430 
the Aces is in a stable position
following<00:02:15.150> up<00:02:15.270> by<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.540> peopling<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.350> you

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
following up by the peopling but you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.110 
following up by the peopling but you
will<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.830> people<00:02:16.950> Inc<00:02:17.250> has<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> huge<00:02:17.820> bikes

will see the people Inc has a huge bikes

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.270 
will see the people Inc has a huge bikes
ups<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.720> downs<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.530> means<00:02:19.740> there<00:02:20.070> are

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
ups and downs so that means there are

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.250 
ups and downs so that means there are
times<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:20.850> not<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.270> stable<00:02:21.720> signal<00:02:21.900> while

also not having a stable signal that's

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.700 
also not having a stable signal that's
why<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.430> graph<00:02:26.700> has<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.210> highs<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.960> lows<00:02:28.440> and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
why the graph has a highs and lows and

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.950 
why the graph has a highs and lows and

asus still shows stable graph then the
tip<00:02:35.760> link<00:02:36.060> same<00:02:36.390> as<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.780> first<00:02:37.020> location<00:02:37.470> it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
tip link same as the first location it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.830 
tip link same as the first location it
still<00:02:38.010> does<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.400> some<00:02:38.670> huge<00:02:38.970> spikes<00:02:39.270> but<00:02:39.600> as

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
still does have some huge spikes but as

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.810 
still does have some huge spikes but as
you<00:02:39.990> can<00:02:40.140> notice<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.920> d-link<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.460> having<00:02:41.790> a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
you can notice the d-link is having a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.180 
you can notice the d-link is having a
zigzag<00:02:42.300> position<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.020> sudden<00:02:43.740> drop<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
zigzag position and sudden drop in the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.950 
zigzag position and sudden drop in the
middle<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.610> test<00:02:44.820> which<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.540> think<00:02:45.750> there's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
middle of the test which I think there's

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.050 
middle of the test which I think there's
interference<00:02:46.410> happen<00:02:47.070> around<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.580> time<00:02:47.820> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
interference happen around that time and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.300 
interference happen around that time and
still<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> last<00:02:48.990> position<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.920> Cisco

being<00:03:09.150> followed<00:03:09.420> by<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.720> d-link<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.590> Cisco

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
being followed by the d-link and a Cisco

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.040 
being followed by the d-link and a Cisco
for<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.340> last<00:03:11.550> position<00:03:11.850> again<00:03:12.240> ok<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:12.630> now

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
for the last position again ok so now

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.350 
for the last position again ok so now
this<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:14.010> exciting<00:03:14.400> part<00:03:14.430> since<00:03:14.850> we<00:03:15.209> are

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
this is the exciting part since we are

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.210 
this is the exciting part since we are
in<00:03:15.570> education<00:03:15.690> where<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.470> pathways<00:03:16.920> are

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
in education where the pathways are

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.610 
in education where the pathways are
blocked<00:03:17.580> but<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.940> was<00:03:18.090> since<00:03:18.959> we<00:03:19.110> are<00:03:19.230> now<00:03:19.380> in

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
blocked but it was since we are now in

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.290 
blocked but it was since we are now in
its<00:03:19.800> third<00:03:20.010> case<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.489> here<00:03:20.820> we<00:03:20.940> see<00:03:21.090> which

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
its third case and here we see which

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.540 
its third case and here we see which
devices<00:03:21.510> stands<00:03:22.140> out<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.590> we<00:03:22.860> only<00:03:23.040> had<00:03:23.310> two

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
devices stands out and we only had two

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.060 
devices stands out and we only had two
signals<00:03:23.970> left<00:03:24.209> here<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.680> Asus

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
signals left here and that is the Asus

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.250 
signals left here and that is the Asus
and<00:03:26.310> surprisingly<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.390> d-link<00:03:27.750> but<00:03:27.989> still

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
and surprisingly the d-link but still

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.620 
and surprisingly the d-link but still
it's<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:29.310> great<00:03:29.519> signal<00:03:29.880> strength<00:03:30.180> comparing

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
it's a great signal strength comparing

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.210 
it's a great signal strength comparing
to<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> d-link<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.380> finally<00:03:31.950> for<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.190> last

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
to the d-link and finally for the last

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.979 
to the d-link and finally for the last
occasion<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.510> first<00:03:33.750> floor<00:03:33.930> of

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
occasion and that is the first floor of

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.960 
occasion and that is the first floor of
the<00:03:34.260> building<00:03:34.290> right<00:03:34.890> after<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.519> staircase

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
the building right after the staircase

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.509 
the building right after the staircase
and<00:03:36.180> as<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.540> can<00:03:36.720> see<00:03:36.930> only<00:03:37.290> asus<00:03:37.920> retains<00:03:38.310> in

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
and as you can see only asus retains in

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.910 
and as you can see only asus retains in
this<00:03:38.700> category<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.870> leading<00:03:40.110> still<00:03:40.500> shows<00:03:40.709> up

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
this category but leading still shows up

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.070 
this category but leading still shows up
but<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.700> snippet<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.209> signal<00:03:42.540> but

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
but just a snippet of the signal but

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.110 
but just a snippet of the signal but
totally<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:43.739> out<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.250> chart<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:45.090> this

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
totally it's out of the chart so this

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.509 
totally it's out of the chart so this
concludes<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.780> cases<00:03:46.470> wins<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.130> challenge

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
concludes that cases wins the challenge

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.699 
concludes that cases wins the challenge

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
and as a bonus guys I also tested out

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.050 
and as a bonus guys I also tested out
the<00:03:54.930> routers<00:03:55.260> on<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> default<00:03:55.739> setting<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.459> this

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
the routers on a default setting so this

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.270 
the routers on a default setting so this
is<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.390> real<00:03:57.540> time<00:03:57.750> range<00:03:57.989> test<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:59.070> box

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
is the real time range test of the box

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.550 
is the real time range test of the box
and<00:03:59.489> you<00:04:00.090> decide<00:04:00.360> which<00:04:00.630> rather<00:04:00.930> shows<00:04:01.290> better

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
and you decide which rather shows better

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.350 
and you decide which rather shows better
performance<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.400> let<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.120> know<00:04:03.209> in<00:04:03.330> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
performance and let you know in the

comment<00:04:03.720> section<00:04:04.019> down<00:04:04.050> below<00:04:04.260> what<00:04:04.860> do<00:04:05.010> you

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
comment section down below what do you

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.650 
comment section down below what do you
think<00:04:05.310> about<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.730> comparison<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:06.570> of

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
think about this comparison but of

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.420 
think about this comparison but of
course<00:04:06.959> it's<00:04:07.170> still<00:04:07.290> differs<00:04:07.769> on<00:04:08.010> your<00:04:08.190> budget

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
course it's still differs on your budget

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.670 
course it's still differs on your budget
when<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:08.910> comes<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.360> pricing<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.230> HS<00:04:10.560> is

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
when it comes to the pricing the HS is

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.259 
when it comes to the pricing the HS is
around<00:04:10.920> two<00:04:11.100> thousand<00:04:11.489> five<00:04:11.640> hundred<00:04:11.700> fifty

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
around two thousand five hundred fifty

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.009 
around two thousand five hundred fifty
then<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.290> tp-link<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:13.980> around<00:04:14.570> 1850<00:04:15.570> and

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
then the tp-link is around 1850 and

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.190 
then the tp-link is around 1850 and
drinks<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.620> is<00:04:17.239> 1999<00:04:18.239> for<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.600> dealing<00:04:19.019> it's

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
drinks this is 1999 for the dealing it's

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.440 
drinks this is 1999 for the dealing it's
two<00:04:19.470> thousand<00:04:19.890> three<00:04:20.160> hundred<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:21.000> comparing

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
two thousand three hundred so comparing

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.000 
two thousand three hundred so comparing
to<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.660> d-link<00:04:22.049> you're<00:04:22.260> just<00:04:22.470> paying<00:04:22.800> an

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
to the d-link you're just paying an

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.910 
to the d-link you're just paying an
additional<00:04:23.130> two<00:04:23.729> hundred<00:04:23.760> pesos<00:04:24.210> for<00:04:25.080> the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
additional two hundred pesos for the

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.100 
additional two hundred pesos for the
Jesus<00:04:26.190> router<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:26.820> maybe<00:04:27.060> already<00:04:27.570> decided

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
Jesus router so maybe already decided

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.930 
Jesus router so maybe already decided
which<00:04:28.380> one<00:04:28.680> you're<00:04:28.890> going<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.220> purchase<00:04:29.730> on

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
which one you're going to purchase on

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.030 
which one you're going to purchase on
your<00:04:29.970> next<00:04:30.480> router<00:04:30.960> device<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:31.680> then<00:04:31.920> again

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
your next router device but then again

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.890 
your next router device but then again
when<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.490> comes<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.940> pricing<00:04:33.390> comparing

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
when it comes to the pricing comparing

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.210 
when it comes to the pricing comparing
to<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.080> three<00:04:34.260> routers<00:04:34.650> that's<00:04:34.920> what<00:04:35.100> I've

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
to the three routers that's what I've

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.190 
to the three routers that's what I've
said<00:04:35.490> you're<00:04:35.820> paying<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:36.420> the<00:04:36.540> features<00:04:36.900> and

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
said you're paying for the features and

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.680 
said you're paying for the features and
also<00:04:37.440> take<00:04:37.830> note<00:04:38.010> that<00:04:38.490> each<00:04:38.730> router<00:04:39.150> from

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
also take note that each router from

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.480 
also take note that each router from
where<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.050> can<00:04:40.170> be<00:04:40.290> customized<00:04:40.800> if<00:04:41.010> you're<00:04:41.190> an

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
where it can be customized if you're an

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.610 
where it can be customized if you're an
advanced<00:04:41.880> user<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.540> also<00:04:42.960> there<00:04:43.320> is<00:04:43.350> a

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
advanced user and also there is a

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.680 
advanced user and also there is a
two-year<00:04:44.010> warranty<00:04:44.190> which<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.880> can<00:04:45.180> say<00:04:45.480> it's

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
two-year warranty which I can say it's
