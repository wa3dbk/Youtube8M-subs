show<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.270> mean<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.510> don't<00:03:25.570> know<00:03:25.840> if<00:03:26.080> that's

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
show in I mean I don't know if that's

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.030 
show in I mean I don't know if that's
ever<00:03:26.380> been<00:03:26.560> done

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
ever been done

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.309 
ever been done
it<00:03:28.459> is<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.849> we<00:03:29.120> call<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.420> water-based<00:03:29.959> show

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
it is a we call it a water-based show

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.080 
it is a we call it a water-based show
well<00:03:31.099> because<00:03:31.370> there's<00:03:31.520> a<00:03:31.580> pool<00:03:31.760> but<00:03:31.940> there's

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
well because there's a pool but there's

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.670 
well because there's a pool but there's
also<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.300> stage<00:03:32.599> which<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:32.840> dryness<00:03:33.349> also<00:03:33.560> the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
also a stage which is dryness also the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.619 
also a stage which is dryness also the
hair<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:34.340> if<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:34.760> look<00:03:34.879> at<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.090> cross-section

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
hair so if you look at the cross-section

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.330 
hair so if you look at the cross-section
of<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.750> theater<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.560> water<00:03:36.800> comprises

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
of the theater the water comprises

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.550 
of the theater the water comprises
one-third<00:03:37.819> of<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.030> building<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:41.900> is<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:42.170> very

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
one-third of the building this is a very

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.650 
one-third of the building this is a very
austere<00:03:43.160> environment<00:03:43.849> you<00:03:44.000> know<00:03:44.150> up<00:03:44.390> in<00:03:44.599> the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
austere environment you know up in the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.979 
austere environment you know up in the
air<00:03:44.920> underwater<00:03:45.920> its<00:03:46.550> various<00:03:47.000> time<00:03:47.239> so<00:03:47.690> we

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
air underwater its various time so we

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.170 
air underwater its various time so we
need<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.530> have<00:03:48.739> all<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.190> people<00:03:49.580> everywhere

need to have all the people everywhere

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.330 
need to have all the people everywhere
to<00:03:50.480> take<00:03:50.959> care<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.739> security<00:03:52.310> of

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
to take care of the security of

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.009 
to take care of the security of
everybody<00:03:54.849> great<00:03:55.849> I'm<00:03:56.120> level<00:03:56.450> 6<00:03:56.720> where<00:03:56.930> we

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
everybody great I'm level 6 where we

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.930 
everybody great I'm level 6 where we
load<00:03:57.200> from<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.709> then<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:57.950> see<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.400> platform

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
load from and then you see the platform

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.850 
load from and then you see the platform
move<00:03:59.690> out<00:03:59.870> from<00:03:59.989> underneath<00:04:00.319> you<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.709> you're

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
move out from underneath you and you're

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.280 
move out from underneath you and you're
looking<00:04:01.130> down<00:04:01.160> it's<00:04:01.730> very<00:04:02.150> high<00:04:02.390> it's<00:04:02.959> scary

don't<00:04:27.260> do<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:28.010> stop<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:31.310> level<00:04:31.639> 5<00:04:31.880> we<00:04:32.180> have

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
don't do it you stop the level 5 we have

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.290 
don't do it you stop the level 5 we have
a<00:04:32.330> cruciform<00:04:32.870> you've<00:04:33.680> got<00:04:33.889> 40<00:04:34.250> winches<00:04:34.639> on<00:04:34.850> top

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
a cruciform you've got 40 winches on top

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.180 
a cruciform you've got 40 winches on top
of<00:04:35.450> that<00:04:35.600> we<00:04:35.810> also<00:04:35.840> have<00:04:36.229> vertical<00:04:36.800> winches

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
of that we also have vertical winches

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.500 
of that we also have vertical winches
that<00:04:37.220> go<00:04:37.460> up<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:37.729> down<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.000> there's<00:04:38.120> various

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
that go up and down and there's various

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.570 
that go up and down and there's various
types<00:04:38.930> there's<00:04:39.260> there's<00:04:39.710> pieces<00:04:39.950> for<00:04:40.250> people

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
types there's there's pieces for people

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.610 
types there's there's pieces for people
to<00:04:40.700> fly<00:04:40.880> out<00:04:41.030> on<00:04:41.060> which<00:04:41.570> high-speed<00:04:42.169> winches

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
to fly out on which high-speed winches

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.350 
to fly out on which high-speed winches
some<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.370> these<00:04:43.430> go<00:04:43.639> up<00:04:43.669> to<00:04:43.850> eight<00:04:44.000> meters<00:04:44.180> a

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
some of these go up to eight meters a

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.080 
some of these go up to eight meters a
second<00:04:44.870> so<00:04:45.289> we<00:04:45.320> can<00:04:45.590> really<00:04:45.830> have<00:04:46.580> people<00:04:46.910> just

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
second so we can really have people just

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.909 
second so we can really have people just
fly<00:04:47.300> out<00:04:47.330> we<00:04:47.870> can<00:04:48.020> also<00:04:48.110> bring<00:04:48.380> them<00:04:48.530> in<00:04:48.650> looks

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
fly out we can also bring them in looks

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.010 
fly out we can also bring them in looks
like<00:04:49.100> they're<00:04:49.310> coming<00:04:49.669> into<00:04:49.789> freefall
