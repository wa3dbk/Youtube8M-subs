00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.089
 Vanessa, everything's fine, coming on vacation. 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.120
 bringing the important tips to you 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.410
 have the spectator took 11 we come 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 Let's see the first doubt of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.269
 viewer was foolish in protein with 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.699
 Skim milk after training is 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.289
 correct is incorrect after the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.330
 training we normally get an absorption 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.150
 we need to see very well and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.699
 if it is and the milk is it has lactose 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 which will impair the absorption of the then 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.980
 after training we were not able to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.559
 ei with water or as with a fruit 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.750
 with Alex and Rosa then owen with water or 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.730
 even a fruit may be a necrosis but 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.510
 with milk not because it will harm the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.210
 absorption 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.829
 You can mix up with milk oei 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 but not after training then you 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.480
 We show a very rapid evolution and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.280
 there will be damaging to the absorption 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.789
 Great milk, let's go to the second question. 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.980
 everything from viewer with a fruit 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.780
 After practice is correct, I want to win. 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.789
 muscle mass is very little just one 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.680
 fruit is very little and is also 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.090
 wrong because who wants to gain mass 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.549
 have to think a lot about the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.439
 before and after the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.360
 training and after training that is more 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.180
 important is the protein to recover 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.979
 to maintain and gain muscle mass 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.229
 so the protein can not be 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.119
 fruit is a carbohydrate then after 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.040
 training a thousand times more consumed in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.740
 protein and was the previous question with 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.729
 a protein or yogurt stick or 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.380
 a sandwich 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.479
 but there is an observation that I want 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.250
 talking is better to consume the fruit later 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.960
 of training than anything because there is a 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.299
 study that was recently done with 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.159
 people who did bodybuilding and then 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.780
 of the training were divided into three groups 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.700
 a group or if after training 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.590
 carbohydrate can be a fruit 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.420
 the other group received protein after 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.710
 training that can be a burti error and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.689
 another group received the heart of 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.180
 carbohydrate and protein that could be 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.250
 humble is a fruit all increase the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.689
 muscle mass but what increased the most 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.479
 muscle mass was the one who combined 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.890
 protein is carbohydrate so the best is 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.689
 the fruit of which nothing but wants to make a 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.630
 perfect snack to increase the mass 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.369
 muscular is a bear a sandwich or up 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.380
 even tie in with fruit or one of 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.210
 transit is great, let's go one more 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.550
 question 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.410
 Look, they just want to know how to drink wine. 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.630
 Vanessa then everything in excess goes 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.220
 so keep the wine containers but there 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.080
 on the island there is even wine diet 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.459
 Clear is not for everyone 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.170
 the person has to be part of a whole 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.739
 prerequisite for achieving all 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.900
 days and is a small amount 234 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.239
 houses per day will definitely gain weight 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.739
 in this diet is 12 km per day maximum 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.140
 you can not more than that 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.150
 that person who consumes wine can not 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.100
 consuming a lot of food because our 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.410
 he body recognizes alcohol one 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.239
 toxin has to strive to eliminate 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.340
 people like him can not digest 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.140
 will end up storing then who then 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.870
 people have to consume few elements 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.050
 You will not get fat but surely we the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.080
 one more question I love breaded steak 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.540
 I should not eat any more, I love it. 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.370
 frying is vanessa is true the future with 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.350
 refined carbohydrate from the flour that 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.910
 and back of the animal should never consume 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.310
 But I'm against this, we have to 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.750
 to have flexibility in our lives is 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.640
 on a weight-loss diet have a 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.620
 meal book the week you can 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.750
 put this animal is even on who is 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.549
 in weight maintenance diet has two 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.440
 other light meals that might even 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.690
 It is putting course that is not the thing 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.340
 healthier for life because it is cold 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.230
 no refined carbohydrate all that is 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.120
 made to triple the caloric value 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.680
 food 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.470
 one more tip would be to do this here 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.360
 roast makes all the recipe step lives 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.280
 around eggs can lay a flour 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.260
 integral to let more integral goes 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.090
 provide more society instead of 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.850
 frying in the oven will decrease 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.670
 a lot of caloric value the pain and fear 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.079
 time was fed in this let's go more 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.820
 an additional omega 3 doubt is 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.040
 interesting viewer says he wants 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.200
 increase muscle mass and reduce 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.670
 in fact if you implement the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.590
 Omega 3 is very interesting for 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.470
 practically all people because it 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.280
 has numerous benefits and moisturizes the skin 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.260
 decreases everything that is inflammation type 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.790
 then cellulite fat information 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.220
 then this person who wants to 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.560
 reducing fat is also better 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.540
 immunity and strengthens hair lines 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.500
 It is wonderful and it is highly recommended. 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.600
 especially to people who do not 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.670
 consume fish for example consumes 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.240
 salmon with cement who ends up being 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.890
 implementing but I try to love 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.630
 careful when buying because 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.370
 there are some omega 3's that are 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.770
 contaminated and will not be interesting 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.780
 Do not have to buy good quality is 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.970
 It's tantamount to getting a doctor or 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.920
 specialized nutritionist in this 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.960
 is guiding who is buying to 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.180
 buy quality omega-3 and be 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.670
 healthy for our life still looks 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.200
 thanks, vanessa for the answers and you? 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.330
 who always participates here in our 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.370
 program sending your questions and 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.810
 questions until next Wednesday 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.810
 I hope so, Vanessa.
