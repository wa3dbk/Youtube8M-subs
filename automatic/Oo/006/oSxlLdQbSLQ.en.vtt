00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
on the inside which is the biggest thing

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.699 
on the inside which is the biggest thing
I<00:03:43.079> mean<00:03:45.690> basically<00:03:46.690> it'll<00:03:46.930> just<00:03:47.139> basically

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
I mean basically it'll just basically

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.379 
I mean basically it'll just basically
protect<00:03:48.040> from<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.250> rain<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:48.850> we'll

protect from the rain so we'll

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.970 
protect from the rain so we'll
definitely<00:03:49.480> do<00:03:49.780> some<00:03:49.959> more<00:03:50.109> tests<00:03:50.380> on<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.829> just

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
definitely do some more tests on it just
