00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.999
 the fall of a meteorite in the mountains 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.160
 urals in russia told us rafael 

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:09.630
 It was even more important because it causes 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.220
 an explosion that left hundreds of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.260
 injured people and some serious 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.269
 the authorities reported that 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.100
 fragments of the meteorite affected by 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.440
 at least six cities around the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.910
 point where the astral body fell one 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.010
 spokesman of the nasa said that this phenomenon 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 it's not related to the asteroid that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.130
 wait near the earth in the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.830
 the next few hours what Rafael spoke to us 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.410
 but we are going to Moscow with ignacio ortega de 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.200
 the agency efe so that it extends us the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.960
 information now about this meteorite 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.600
 ignacio a pleasure to say hello 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.730
 Greetings from Moscow that is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.949
 more than a thousand kilometers of subsidiaries that is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.680
 the place where he fell into the already famous 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.570
 meteorite 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.120
 they have even named the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.980
 meteorite the car of chinals because 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.350
 it is just to the region of the urals where 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.660
 where he fell most of 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.250
 true fragments of the meteor then to 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.200
 to say truth there in front of two 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.450
 hours then when it's seven o'clock and 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.089
 twenty and there nine twenty in the 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.820
 urals 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.399
 the sky of this region was crossed by 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.869
 a kind of fire trail that 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.219
 illuminated a principal 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.130
 now we are in the middle of winter 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.829
 endorsing there is a lot of light and people 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.569
 Logically he fell prey to panic because 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.640
 nobody I know because people did not know if it was a 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.189
 passenger plane that had you 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.000
 crashed an earthquake or an explosion 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:34.179
 of gas true then the meteor fell 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.009
 of the tornado you lived and the impact was 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.020
 the shock wave of the impact of 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.939
 meteorite from the meteorite fragments 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.530
 that were several truths that fell 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.719
 on the soil of the region what 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.489
 provoked the destruction throughout 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.409
 this area then let's say band 

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:49.239
 expansive mainly destroyed the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.340
 windows the windows caused a 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:53.110
 kind of vibration shivering in 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.189
 the whole area true then the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.590
 windows of schools hospitals 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.750
 dwellings of thousands of living say 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.489
 they burst into a thousand pieces and this 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.500
 logically the people then of the 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:04.720
 local population 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.460
 or was really scared really at the beginning 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.190
 even all the levels were reported 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.500
 of radiation had gone up and then 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.910
 many people locked themselves in house went to 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.400
 pharmacies to buy hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.970
 all kinds of different medicines more 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.830
 faces to stop to cover his mouth 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.180
 but in a short time already the authorities 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.709
 reported that levels of 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.870
 radiation were within the norm 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.090
 truth that energy water 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.800
 hot the heating worked from 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.420
 that everything was in the norm but that's not 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.950
 calmed the entire population because of course 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.900
 when you are between sending us several 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.690
 degrees below zero and your windows 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.330
 house closed in a thousand pieces by 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.100
 Logically, they can not protect themselves 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.510
 from the cold people a lot of people went out to the 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.760
 street precisely what I thought that 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.180
 it was an earthquake the meat was going to fall 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.220
 the building your house on top of the roof and 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.540
 the 9th for a difficult situation for 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.330
 them like a science movie 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.220
 fiction 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.350
 let me ask you please for the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.370
 people that turned out with some kind of 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.260
 injury 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.180
 Be there in some reports that have 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.370
 come they talk about hundreds of people 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.480
 in addition to those of the real estate that 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.069
 they noticed affect we are seeing images 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.370
 presents of a woman who has 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.200
 in the head and some bandages too 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.909
 in other parts of the face tell us about 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.980
 those people 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.659
 more or less according to the latest the 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.639
 latest figures from both the ministry of 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.519
 health as well as local authorities 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.680
 around a thousand people about 1000 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.139
 people were injured and all 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.370
 completely stopped glass wounds 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.719
 true of hospitals that can 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.849
 I run out that people are left 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.760
 people who are beaten 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.889
 true that slip for example there was in 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.510
 the local pavilion the ice pavilion 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.669
 who are called the children who were 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.620
 skating they fell if they gave a good 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:47.870
 true blow with many people with blows 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.819
 and wounds but usually the minors 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.760
 serious there are only two people that we know 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.640
 for 22 people seriously injured and 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.730
 a score of medium severity and the 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.950
 rest is understood not to go up or 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.019
 is in danger so it has been between 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.849
 quotes rather the true scare and it 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.030
 expects suddenly a meteorite the 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.349
 fragments of the meteorite are going to fall 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.659
 are going to stay in your city because 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.670
 they came in so great were the 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.290
 fragments precisely because according to 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.630
 experts if the meteorite becomes more 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.609
 small would have disintegrated true 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.490
 in the atmosphere but as it was quite 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.229
 great according to experts here is a 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.630
 great tradition of studying meteorites 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.270
 It is part of the cosmos as estimated 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.250
 that the size of say the mass of the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.350
 meteorite was about 50 tons is 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.000
 say it was a great meteorite many 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.680
 pieces but not logically disintegrates 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.370
 many others fell in the chile zone 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.900
 birds and even the shock wave and it 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.820
 noted even in several regions 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.520
 adjacent and even in the republic 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.500
 Central Asian neighbor of Kazakhstan is 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.930
 say that it has been logically scare 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.670
 has been quite large in entities there 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.020
 about three and a half million people 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.080
 city has a little over one million 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.460
 then many people felt it up to 200 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.040
 kilometers of chile a month in the city 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.650
 of yekaterinburg true where the 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.570
 president the deceased and yellows and 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.450
 even at 200 kilometers it would be 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.100
 perfectly from the wake of the leaf 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:14.750
 by the way it was a red wake 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.690
 of one of the pieces of the meteorite 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.280
 It has been a good scare without a doubt 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.050
 my dear ignacio we are seeing 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.000
 images of the fall of this meteorite 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.740
 precisely let's hope to see that the 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.660
 authorities reach this area 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.630
 to say they find mostly 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.900
 that scientists can find out about 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.900
 this meteorite that fell today in russia 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.620
 ignacio ortega fellow reporter of the 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.660
 agency efe 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.660
 conversing with us from Moscow
