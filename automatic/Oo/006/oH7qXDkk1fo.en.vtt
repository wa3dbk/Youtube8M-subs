00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.980
 hello everyone how are you and welcome to 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.180
 the driving raven league is one of the 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.830
 characters that requires a lot 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.360
 practice well description of people 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.120
 who are looking for a challenge will find it 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.980
 this raven champion has a range of 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.800
 attack a little more reduced unlike 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.679
 of others of caris and this is a slight 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.970
 disadvantage on your part but it's still 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.890
 one of the champions that more damage can 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.480
 get to generate at the beginning but 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.089
 especially when the game goes a little 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.829
 more advanced the secret to do that 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.390
 the regime is a deadly weapon is in 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.990
 know how to position it at the time of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.240
 battle 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.920
 have it in a good position and know 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.140
 occupy your skills in the fight you 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.450
 will guarantee success with this character 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.830
 and not only to you since it will also help 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.830
 considerably to your team 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.970
 the liability of the trainer is activated when 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.760
 you generate a critical hit or when you attack 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.790
 with your cv that is spinning acz what 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.850
 does is generate physical damage over time 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.230
 your cv spinning hacks generates physical damage 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.240
 and it's going to increase the damage you do 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.590
 depending how much of atacama that 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.230
 have 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.450
 this ax after launching returns to 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.370
 driver is like a kind of boomerang 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.140
 and catches the weapon is off the 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.670
 cool down and you can reuse it 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.380
 this you can use it as many times 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.540
 you want as long as you do is the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.460
 weapon after you throw it and you can have 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.810
 led the spell up to twice as 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.500
 which is the number of axes that driver 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.470
 have 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.420
 You can use this attack on the move 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.420
 and the ax will go where it is 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.800
 moving a tip that I give you and is that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.780
 you must know when is the time 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.790
 right to grab your ax and when the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.010
 you must leave since it can be a weapon 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.140
 double-edged for wanting to grab your weapon 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.340
 they can grab you out of position and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.340
 you will not have escape 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.000
 wv block increases the speed of 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.830
 movement and attack speed if 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 you activate this skill and then you throw 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.689
 tucu and you trap the ax is deactivated the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.450
 cool down from your w then go back to 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.670
 occupy this attack you can do a great 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.380
 combo with your double vee and with your CV already 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.930
 comment your attack speed and 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.819
 will generate more damage although you must take 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.660
 in mind that how can you spend 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.920
 much mana also your w as it increases you 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.360
 the speed of movement can 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.760
 Serve you to pursue your enemy 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.580
 when he tries to run because he has 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.280
 little life or also for when you 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.110
 you need to run away 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.760
 This spell can be combined with the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.440
 spell of goes that will also increase your 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.360
 fast day of movement and for 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.310
 protect yourself the neighborhood spell 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.530
 this oil may be offensive or 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.500
 defensive since this attack causes damage 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.379
 for your enemies to one side and you 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.730
 reduces the speed of movement 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.989
 then here you can also combine 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.549
 this spell with your double or for 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.290
 increase your movement speed 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.720
 when I 'm chasing someone and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.909
 activate your e to slow down your 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.560
 enemy and move it to one side 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.769
 here you take advantage and apply it damage with your 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.750
 cv or also when you want to upload you can 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.189
 launching this attack reduces the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.720
 speed of movement to your enemy and 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:06.410
 you run for your life 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.450
 the driver building dead-end wifi network is 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.210
 a very powerful attack and it hits everyone 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.760
 the enemies that are in its way 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.700
 the attack can hit twice one of 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.680
 one way and one return 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.090
 You can use this attack at the beginning of 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.250
 a battle when you see all your 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.319
 enemies together and so general is a 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.450
 good amount of damage that will be helpful 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.920
 for your team or at the end when your 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.050
 enemies try to run away 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.010
 to give what is called the shot of 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.840
 Grace 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.099
 to make your last return more 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.460
 fast you just have to go back to 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.500
 press your ere 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.960
 as I said the driver attacks are very 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.620
 powerful if used correctly and if 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.599
 is in a good position 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.299
 The objects that you have to buy are the 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.890
 following at the beginning for a bit of 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.989
 aggressiveness buy it unsworth and two 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.110
 positions later you will build what 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.270
 next in that order 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.230
 as optional objects you can have 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.280
 great amen and mercury imitate or blade 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.280
 of rating 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.110
 your saddest win offensives for 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.490
 increase your damage and some defensive 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.250
 to increase your resistance and 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.170
 survival 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.049
 the runes should be focused on 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.870
 attack damage armor penetration and 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.940
 attacks but some prefer to remove what 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.980
 what is armor penetration and attack speed 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.010
 and put some more objects 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.930
 It is defensive as a cabin at the 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.660
 they can put a little more defense 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.110
 against physical damage and defense against damage 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.110
 magical 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.860
 some characters with whom you must 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.310
 Be careful is British Caitlin Barnes 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.889
 bank and 3 since plus skills can 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.080
 defeat easily driven 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.569
 the tips that I give them with raven to the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.310
 time of the battle should be to know what 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.260
 positional 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.830
 and launch the attacks depending on the 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.480
 situation presented to them 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.070
 if they find you in the position 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.900
 wrong control and sale at the time of 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.790
 the fight could be your end 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.009
 they should always be in constant 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.350
 movement to avoid being attacked and 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.440
 make sure to permeate minions this is 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.570
 very important a tip that I give them is 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.580
 that at 15 minutes they must have 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.800
 around 70 million farm ea 2 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.780
 also your secret is in keeping your 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.120
 cv activated when you are in battle 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.979
 to maximize your damage and as I said 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.979
 when the game is advanced too 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.780
 can be a very dangerous enemy and for 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.370
 last I advise you to practice a lot 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.360
 with this champion since the practice 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.360

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.500
