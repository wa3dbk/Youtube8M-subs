00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
what type of game mode is suited for

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.310 
what type of game mode is suited for
this<00:00:55.010> map<00:00:55.250> maybe<00:00:56.000> demolition<00:00:56.720> or<00:00:56.809> capture<00:00:57.199> the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
here a little bit because I'm think that

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.940 
here a little bit because I'm think that
the<00:02:51.540> opponents<00:02:51.810> don't<00:02:52.080> expect<00:02:52.410> me<00:02:52.560> out<00:02:52.680> here

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
the opponents don't expect me out here

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.530 
the opponents don't expect me out here
because<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.489> kind<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.849> dumb<00:02:54.060> bass<00:02:54.209> would<00:02:54.420> be

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
because what kind of dumb bass would be

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.970 
because what kind of dumb bass would be
out<00:02:54.660> here<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.170> are<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.620> many<00:02:55.860> good

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
out here when you are so many good

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.309 
out here when you are so many good
places<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.400> camp<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.940> think<00:02:57.569> this<00:02:57.690> area<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.050> also

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
places to camp I think this area is also

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.320 
places to camp I think this area is also
a<00:02:58.470> good<00:02:58.709> place<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:59.099> overlook<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.819> there<00:03:00.209> will

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
a good place to overlook and there will

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.300 
a good place to overlook and there will
be<00:03:00.360> no<00:03:00.630> one<00:03:00.780> spawning<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.230> your<00:03:01.319> back<00:03:01.500> only<00:03:02.130> to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
be no one spawning in your back only to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.949 
be no one spawning in your back only to
the<00:03:02.400> left<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.819> right<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.330> my<00:03:03.750> back<00:03:03.930> is

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the left and to the right so my back is

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.690 
the left and to the right so my back is
covered<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.530> all<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.739> got<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.980> do<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.220> keep<00:03:05.400> my

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
covered and all I got to do is keep my

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.430 
covered and all I got to do is keep my
eyes<00:03:05.850> open<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.810> pretty<00:03:07.140> straightforward

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
eyes open it's pretty straightforward

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.710 
eyes open it's pretty straightforward
and<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.220> can't<00:03:08.610> talk<00:03:08.760> about<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.120> golden<00:03:09.390> tactic

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and I can't talk about the golden tactic

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.120 
and I can't talk about the golden tactic
because<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:10.230> don't<00:03:10.440> know<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.890> only

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
because I don't know it's the only

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.920 
because I don't know it's the only
tactics<00:03:11.519> for<00:03:11.670> free<00:03:11.970> fall<00:03:12.239> on<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.450> map<00:03:12.690> or

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
tactics for free fall on this map or

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.570 
tactics for free fall on this map or
probably<00:03:13.530> hiding<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.010> fun<00:03:14.190> house<00:03:14.310> or

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
probably hiding in the fun house or

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.250 
probably hiding in the fun house or
camping<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.180> out<00:03:15.269> in<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.420> castle<00:03:15.810> at<00:03:16.019> least

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
camping it out in the castle at least

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.830 
camping it out in the castle at least
that's<00:03:16.800> what<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.130> see<00:03:17.489> all<00:03:17.670> those<00:03:17.760> doing<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:18.750> I

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
that's what I see all those doing but I

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.330 
that's what I see all those doing but I

going to the movies so I watched some
movie<00:04:37.660> trailers<00:04:37.990> online<00:04:38.140> and<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:38.800> came<00:04:39.010> across

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
movie trailers online and I came across

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.600 
movie trailers online and I came across
a<00:04:39.310> movie<00:04:39.640> called<00:04:39.850> for<00:04:40.150> us<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.660> damn<00:04:41.190> hot<00:04:42.190> stats

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
a movie called for us and damn hot stats

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.670 
a movie called for us and damn hot stats
movie<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.300> looks<00:04:43.330> like<00:04:43.750> real<00:04:43.900> bad<00:04:44.140> movie<00:04:44.470> and

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
movie it looks like real bad movie and

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.890 
movie it looks like real bad movie and
you<00:04:44.740> know<00:04:44.830> it's<00:04:45.040> actually<00:04:45.580> in<00:04:45.670> 3d<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.300> I<00:04:46.540> can't

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
you know it's actually in 3d and I can't

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.390 
you know it's actually in 3d and I can't
believe<00:04:47.050> they<00:04:47.290> put<00:04:47.500> an<00:04:47.590> x-ray<00:04:47.919> after<00:04:48.280> they

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
believe they put an x-ray after they

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.610 
believe they put an x-ray after they
need<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.669> make<00:04:48.790> it<00:04:48.940> 3d<00:04:49.200> do<00:04:50.200> they<00:04:50.320> think<00:04:50.530> they

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
need to make it 3d do they think they

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.409 
need to make it 3d do they think they
can<00:04:50.770> make<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:51.040> better<00:04:51.250> when<00:04:51.520> it's<00:04:51.700> in<00:04:51.820> 3d<00:04:52.120> I

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
can make it better when it's in 3d I

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.360 
can make it better when it's in 3d I
think<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.960> movie<00:04:53.080> will<00:04:53.200> still<00:04:53.680> be<00:04:53.890> bad<00:04:54.070> and

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
think the movie will still be bad and

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.150 
think the movie will still be bad and
they<00:04:54.820> should<00:04:55.000> advertise<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.660> like<00:04:55.870> it's

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160
