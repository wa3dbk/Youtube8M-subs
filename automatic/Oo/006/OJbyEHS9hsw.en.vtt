00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
mediators who don't really realize what

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.970 
mediators who don't really realize what
a<00:02:11.580> mediators<00:02:12.540> goal<00:02:13.260> what

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
a mediators goal what

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.610 
a mediators goal what
the<00:02:14.280> party's<00:02:14.790> goal<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> mediation<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.349> and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the party's goal with a mediation is and

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.890 
the party's goal with a mediation is and
that<00:02:17.190> goal<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.670> settle<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> case<00:02:18.480> not<00:02:19.260> to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
that goal is to settle the case not to

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.110 
that goal is to settle the case not to
you<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.770> in<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.190> case<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> lawsuit

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you know like in a case of a lawsuit

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.180 
you know like in a case of a lawsuit
where<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.840> might<00:02:25.020> want<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> judge<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.980> make<00:02:26.160> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
where you might want the judge to make a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.250 
where you might want the judge to make a
ruling<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.910> your<00:02:26.940> favor<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.630> mediator<00:02:27.989> can't

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
ruling in your favor the mediator can't

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.330 
ruling in your favor the mediator can't
make<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.470> ruling<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:28.920> your<00:02:28.950> favor

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
make a ruling in your favor

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.430 
make a ruling in your favor
so<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.640> mediator<00:02:30.030> really<00:02:30.330> needs<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.720> bring

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
so the mediator really needs to bring

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.400 
so the mediator really needs to bring
the<00:02:31.500> parties<00:02:32.010> together<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.720> reach<00:02:33.720> an<00:02:33.900> overlap

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
the parties together to reach an overlap

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.400 
the parties together to reach an overlap
in<00:02:34.709> two<00:02:34.800> positions<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.610> then<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.660> settlement

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
in two positions and then a settlement

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.650 
in two positions and then a settlement
can<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.530> reached<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.360> quick

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
can be reached so it's a it's a quick

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.020 
can be reached so it's a it's a quick
quicker<00:02:40.500> way<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.800> finding<00:02:41.280> out<00:02:41.580> where<00:02:41.910> that

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
quicker way of finding out where that

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.680 
quicker way of finding out where that
overlap<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.980> what<00:02:43.980> are<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.370> drawbacks<00:02:44.690> to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
overlap is what are the drawbacks to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.370 
overlap is what are the drawbacks to
mediation

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
mediation

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.000 
mediation
well<00:02:47.310> one<00:02:47.850> drawback<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.660> cost<00:02:49.010> mediators

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
well one drawback is the cost mediators

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.380 
well one drawback is the cost mediators
don't<00:02:50.220> work<00:02:50.340> for<00:02:50.519> free<00:02:50.790> they've<00:02:51.060> got<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.300> be

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
don't work for free they've got to be

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.350 
don't work for free they've got to be
paid<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:51.930> you've<00:02:52.260> got<00:02:52.440> take<00:02:53.220> into<00:02:53.430> account<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
paid so you've got take into account the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.930 
paid so you've got take into account the
cost<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.290> mediation<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.760> therefore

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
cost of the mediation and so therefore

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.640 
cost of the mediation and so therefore
you<00:02:57.239> wouldn't<00:02:57.390> want<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.600> mediate<00:02:57.959> unless<00:02:58.380> both

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
you wouldn't want to mediate unless both

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.370 
you wouldn't want to mediate unless both
sides<00:02:58.980> want<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.239> mediate<00:03:00.600> typically<00:03:01.260> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
sides want to mediate typically the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.280 
sides want to mediate typically the
costs<00:03:01.769> are<00:03:01.890> divided<00:03:02.760> between<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.750> two<00:03:03.900> sides

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
costs are divided between the two sides

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.190 
costs are divided between the two sides
so<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.610> one<00:03:05.819> thing<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.060> keep<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:06.360> in<00:03:06.630> in

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
so that's one thing to keep in in in

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.220 
so that's one thing to keep in in in
mind<00:03:08.160> one<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.060> benefits<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.660> mediation

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
mind one of the benefits of mediation

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.309 
mind one of the benefits of mediation
mediation<00:03:11.239> almost<00:03:12.239> always<00:03:12.450> increases<00:03:13.170> this

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
mediation almost always increases this

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.729 
mediation almost always increases this
settlement<00:03:13.650> offer<00:03:13.920> okay<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:16.049> also<00:03:16.260> shows

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
settlement offer okay and it also shows

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.440 
settlement offer okay and it also shows
what<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.250> other<00:03:17.400> side<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:17.940> thinking<00:03:18.329> about

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
what the other side is thinking about

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.380 
what the other side is thinking about
and<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.739> don't<00:03:20.010> settle<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.579> case<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.030> end

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and if you don't settle the case and end

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.250 
and if you don't settle the case and end
up<00:03:21.480> going<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.750> trial

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
up going to trial

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.090 
up going to trial
and<00:03:23.239> finally<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.930> case<00:03:25.200> gets<00:03:25.530> settled<00:03:25.829> before

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
and finally the case gets settled before

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.060 
and finally the case gets settled before
a<00:03:26.130> lawsuit<00:03:26.640> when<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> expenses<00:03:27.570> get<00:03:28.070> an

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
a lawsuit when the expenses get an

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.060 
a lawsuit when the expenses get an
increase<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.970> obviously<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:31.260> time<00:03:31.590> involved

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
increase and obviously the time involved

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.949 
increase and obviously the time involved
in<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.459> lawsuit<00:03:32.670> is<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.160> increase

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
in a lawsuit is going to increase

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.599 
in a lawsuit is going to increase
car-wreck<00:03:36.959> mediations<00:03:37.920> will<00:03:38.340> last

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
car-wreck mediations will last

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.610 
car-wreck mediations will last
approximately<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.660> day<00:03:39.870> they<00:03:40.049> usually<00:03:40.170> start

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
approximately a day they usually start

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.930 
approximately a day they usually start
about<00:03:40.739> 10:00<00:03:41.040> a.m.<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.609> they're<00:03:41.730> usually

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
about 10:00 a.m. and they're usually

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.810 
about 10:00 a.m. and they're usually
done<00:03:42.420> well<00:03:42.690> before<00:03:43.079> or<00:03:43.200> 5:00<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:44.340> you're<00:03:44.670> going
