really really quiet it certainly is easy

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.110 
really really quiet it certainly is easy
to<00:03:44.610> hear<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.950> know<00:03:47.070> those<00:03:47.340> distractions<00:03:47.730> a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
to hear you know those distractions a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.780 
to hear you know those distractions a
little<00:03:48.330> more<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.750> obviously<00:03:49.490> while<00:03:50.490> he<00:03:50.700> was

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
little more and obviously while he was

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.550 
little more and obviously while he was
playing<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.180> ten<00:03:51.330> frame<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.780> actually<00:03:52.170> walked

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
playing to ten frame I actually walked

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.250 
playing to ten frame I actually walked
away<00:03:52.860> woman<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.090> wasn't<00:03:54.390> near<00:03:54.750> any<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:55.050> us<00:03:55.140> so

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
away woman I I wasn't near any of us so

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.870 
away woman I I wasn't near any of us so
I<00:03:55.290> wasn't<00:03:55.830> really<00:03:55.980> familiar<00:03:56.250> with<00:03:56.520> what<00:03:56.790> had

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
I wasn't really familiar with what had

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.930 
I wasn't really familiar with what had
happened<00:03:57.270> until<00:03:57.560> everyone<00:03:58.560> had<00:03:58.710> told<00:03:59.340> me<00:03:59.550> but

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
happened until everyone had told me but

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.020 
happened until everyone had told me but
yeah<00:04:00.870> parently<00:04:01.320> he<00:04:01.550> unfortunately<00:04:02.550> got

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
yeah parently he unfortunately got

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.450 
yeah parently he unfortunately got
caught<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.360> few<00:04:03.480> times<00:04:03.900> with<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:05.130> know<00:04:05.280> some

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
caught a few times with you know some

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.130 
caught a few times with you know some
noise<00:04:05.670> in<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.090> back<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:06.480> then<00:04:06.720> it's<00:04:06.870> just

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
noise in the back and then it's just

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.720 
noise in the back and then it's just
unfortunate<00:04:07.680> but<00:04:08.190> it's<00:04:08.730> kind<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:11.280> i

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
unfortunate but it's kind of the the i

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.020 
unfortunate but it's kind of the the i
guess<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.980> we<00:04:13.980> have<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.220> deal<00:04:14.490> with<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.730> when

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
guess the we have to deal with that when

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.620 
guess the we have to deal with that when
when<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.480> crowd<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:16.320> close<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.630> now

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
when the crowd is so close to it and now

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.719 
when the crowd is so close to it and now
as<00:04:18.810> professional<00:04:19.440> bowlers<00:04:19.799> we<00:04:19.950> have<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.340> come

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
as professional bowlers we have to come

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.250 
as professional bowlers we have to come
to<00:04:20.850> expect<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.479> things<00:04:21.750> like<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:21.960> are

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
to expect that things like that are

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.110 
to expect that things like that are
going<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.530> happen<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:23.400> know<00:04:23.520> for<00:04:23.940> me<00:04:24.090> I

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
going to happen and you know for me I

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.740 
going to happen and you know for me I
try<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.600> just<00:04:25.580> took<00:04:26.580> my<00:04:26.760> ball<00:04:26.970> down<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.360> reset

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
try to just took my ball down and reset

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.659 
try to just took my ball down and reset
and<00:04:27.930> know<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.680> obviously<00:04:29.250> no<00:04:29.460> one's

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
and know that it is obviously no one's

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.490 
and know that it is obviously no one's
doing<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:30.030> on<00:04:30.150> purpose<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.900> just

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
doing it on purpose it's just

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.260 
doing it on purpose it's just
unfortunate<00:04:31.950> timing<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:33.060> deal

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
unfortunate timing and you just deal

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.560 
unfortunate timing and you just deal
with<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:34.430> yeah<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.490> was<00:04:35.580> definitely<00:04:35.820> an

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
with it yeah it was definitely an

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.060 
with it yeah it was definitely an
interesting<00:04:36.780> match<00:04:37.290> being<00:04:37.560> able<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.770> see<00:04:37.950> if

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070
