that<00:06:14.159> the<00:06:14.280> later<00:06:14.460> doctors<00:06:14.849> were<00:06:14.969> eccentric

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
that the later doctors were eccentric

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.209 
that the later doctors were eccentric
rather<00:06:15.960> than<00:06:16.169> bonkers<00:06:16.710> you<00:06:16.740> have<00:06:16.949> to<00:06:17.009> go<00:06:17.099> back

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
rather than bonkers you have to go back

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:18.499 
rather than bonkers you have to go back
to<00:06:17.340> Patrick<00:06:17.669> Troughton<00:06:17.880> to<00:06:18.090> find<00:06:18.240> a<00:06:18.330> really

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
to Patrick Troughton to find a really

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.540 
to Patrick Troughton to find a really
good<00:06:18.659> edge<00:06:19.349> of<00:06:19.590> craziness<00:06:19.949> doctor<00:06:20.400> and<00:06:20.520> I

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
good edge of craziness doctor and I

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.189 
good edge of craziness doctor and I
think<00:06:20.759> Eccleston's<00:06:21.210> the<00:06:21.330> base<00:06:21.449> obviously

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
think Eccleston's the base obviously

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.140 
think Eccleston's the base obviously
looking<00:06:22.949> at<00:06:23.099> it<00:06:23.280> you<00:06:23.370> didn't<00:06:23.580> go<00:06:23.699> you<00:06:23.940> didn't
