00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820 

I<00:00:02.899> think<00:00:03.899> one<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.170> best<00:00:04.319> parts<00:00:04.650> about

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
I think one of the best parts about

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.019 
I think one of the best parts about
being<00:00:05.279> in<00:00:05.400> incites

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
being in incites

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.179 
being in incites
is<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.540> get<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.960> understand<00:00:07.560> your<00:00:07.710> consumer

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
is you get to understand your consumer

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.220 
is you get to understand your consumer
and<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.030> voice<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.570> consumer<00:00:10.080> and

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
and do the voice of that consumer and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.660 
and do the voice of that consumer and
then<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.440> get<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.710> bring<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.040> back<00:00:11.250> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
then you get to bring that back and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.490 
then you get to bring that back and
inspire<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.389> rest<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.690> your<00:00:12.780> team<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.290> the
