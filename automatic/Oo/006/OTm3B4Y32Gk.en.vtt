paint<00:00:21.270> palette<00:00:24.920> I've<00:00:26.720> used<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:28.019> different<00:00:28.859> type

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
paint palette I've used a different type

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
paint palette I've used a different type
of<00:00:29.070> palette<00:00:29.550> before<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.929> little

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
of palette before and it was a little

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.160 
of palette before and it was a little
bit<00:00:31.260> easier<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.239> only<00:00:33.239> because<00:00:33.690> getting

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
bit easier to you only because getting

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.889 
bit easier to you only because getting
the<00:00:34.290> paint<00:00:34.620> out<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.899> pretty

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the paint out of here was pretty

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.470 
the paint out of here was pretty
difficult<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.500> had<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.860> boil<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.280> out<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
difficult I had to boil it out so the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
difficult I had to boil it out so the
other<00:00:39.629> palettes<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.010> keep

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
other palettes are just what they keep

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.220 
other palettes are just what they keep
watercolor<00:00:42.210> paints<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:45.950> pieces<00:00:47.989> don't<00:00:48.989> worry

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
watercolor paints in pieces don't worry

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.860

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
if you get as messy as you can always

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.460

clean<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.720

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
see it gets really messy basically I'm

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.330 
see it gets really messy basically I'm
just<00:01:04.760> smashing<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.960> in<00:01:06.110> there<00:01:06.320> like<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:10.160> ok
