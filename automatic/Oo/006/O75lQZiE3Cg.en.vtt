think<00:06:17.070> I<00:06:17.160> got<00:06:17.340> the<00:06:17.460> energy<00:06:17.580> crystals<00:06:18.120> I<00:06:18.240> need

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
think I got the energy crystals I need

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:28.400 
think I got the energy crystals I need
but<00:06:22.130> tempting<00:06:23.130> me<00:06:26.150> well<00:06:27.150> you<00:06:27.900> can<00:06:28.050> see<00:06:28.230> who<00:06:28.380> is

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
but tempting me well you can see who is

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
way to go not hitting my mind like that

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:59.000 
way to go not hitting my mind like that
would<00:06:45.240> be<00:06:45.270> a<00:06:45.360> good<00:06:45.510> idea<00:06:57.680> not<00:06:58.680> a<00:06:58.710> chrome

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
would be a good idea not a chrome

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:13.310 
would be a good idea not a chrome
kraushaar<00:07:03.020> really<00:07:04.020> slow<00:07:11.750> this<00:07:12.750> is<00:07:12.870> a<00:07:12.930> massive

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
kraushaar really slow this is a massive

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.450 
kraushaar really slow this is a massive
cavern<00:07:13.800> oh<00:07:15.230> we<00:07:16.230> do<00:07:16.320> a<00:07:16.350> lot<00:07:16.650> of<00:07:16.710> stuff<00:07:17.070> here<00:07:17.280> if

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
cavern oh we do a lot of stuff here if

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.330 
cavern oh we do a lot of stuff here if
you<00:07:17.640> had<00:07:17.820> the<00:07:17.850> energy<00:07:18.090> crystals<00:07:18.630> to<00:07:18.750> do<00:07:18.870> that

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
you had the energy crystals to do that

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:32.720 
you had the energy crystals to do that
you<00:07:20.340> drove<00:07:20.520> that<00:07:25.100> you<00:07:26.100> drove<00:07:26.460> that<00:07:29.720> yeah
