goes to prove that on the font is

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.180 
goes to prove that on the font is
definitely<00:05:55.820> involved<00:05:56.800> think<00:05:57.800> you<00:05:57.890> can<00:05:58.040> break

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
definitely involved think you can break

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.780 
definitely involved think you can break
through<00:05:58.460> just<00:05:59.360> you<00:05:59.540> watch<00:06:00.370> i'm<00:06:01.370> not<00:06:01.580> missing

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
a little break and the true cluster

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.490 
a little break and the true cluster
alone<00:06:09.800> to<00:06:10.010> do<00:06:10.190> its<00:06:10.340> work<00:06:10.610> I<00:06:11.140> guess<00:06:12.140> I'll<00:06:12.320> make
