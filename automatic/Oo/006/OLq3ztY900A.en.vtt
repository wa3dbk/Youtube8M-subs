00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.029
 ap 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.470
 one is nothing special 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.439
 remember 11 nov 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.439
 it's not complicated, there's nothing that can solve it 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.119
 this 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.909
 that with the putting the problem 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.769
 how are they new and 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.400
 are entering let's say here in mexico 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.640
 this guy specifically 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.999
 the problem that could be in the 'fan zone' spare part 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.109
 more than someone else is more of a mechanic here in Mexico 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.830
 lift of rapids as it works 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.110
 and he will solve it 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.440
 and it is the provider's obligation not even to 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.410
 of the government 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.900
 I think it's a good 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.900
 option for small farmers 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.920
 on small surfaces 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.920
 this file weapons lanús 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.820
 there's that he pointed out he manages the team 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.360
 this 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.480
 that the problem with machinery and earrings 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.800
 josé a is not apart from getting there or not 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.210
 already came or accidents in the field by tractors for many factors 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.130
 percent 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 also the farmer is in the field and it is not 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.590
 experience and there and I am already experienced 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.590
 then then this one 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 yes i think it takes ap 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.350
 that is because I think the government made this decision 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.990
 because it is easier to give each one of them a walking tractor 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.730
 to give 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
 it is easier to give ten power tillers to 10 producers 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.010
 10 product tractors remained 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.660
 ing and to love cost the same the ten motocultors contract 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.210
 where the problem is the problem is with the producers 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 because if the producers are organized 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.100
 and they know how to work tic and we learn to advantage because they do not know 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.070
 learn anything 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.400
 when the government is going to give a tractor 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.000
 but among the ten destinations that agree to prepare the ground 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 between the 10 to see who goes to who knows marc altayó 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:17.959
 navas that what I've seen 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.439
 I have seen people are perceiving they are a person not 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.299
 i percent 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.769
 The system is designed to meet your own requests 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.879
 and that's what I saw is to put you 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.879
 already two hectares or less times I keep it 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.669
 percent 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.819
 a serious serious problem would be level we were agriculture 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.100
 in Mexico the xelajú 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.389
 society 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.389
 a lot of water is spent in the field 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:54.620
 that what is needed for example in the field in terms of facilitation 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.849
 al shanuka is missing a lot 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.090
 not in the bad technical allos and they stop going 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.009
 so 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.919
 There is that 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.919
 there is a commitment on the part of the technicians 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.899
 and the same and the government although I know that the back 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:18.459
 what what keeps them these lands are proper for such a thing 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.489
 fatal crop 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.489
 and then they support their crops 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.579
 the problem here in mexico is that the farmers then there are 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.859
 they are going to find 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:29.590
 the government does not
