00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.869
 the 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.480
 Saturday, the World Cup Swimming for the Disabled was officially opened in the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.470
 Pieter van den Hoogenband Swimming Stadium in Eindhoven 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.520
 In the coming days, one of the participants from 54 international matches will fight for it 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.499
 honorary metal 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.179
 we started it two years ago to be able to speak for the last 8 weeks 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.109
 countless people 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.350
 last week the stadium the over was imposed very nicely dressed almost 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.489
 at the same time as the world cup in 2008 i think leten just have great states 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.420
 special is that a number of players 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.030
 It is special that this is through Lies and we must have the competition 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.430
 Going in England to find a way in America means that it is not again 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.010
 we also organize such an event for large countries 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.230
 better than the best to bring this out they are going to put the money on it 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.550
 platoon now again just what the special is advantageous and I have the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.550
 sport and we would like to incorporate that 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.140
 The Dutch team also had a chance to win prizes 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.010
 but it becomes increasingly difficult when you look at the beginning of the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.920
 world championships where almost at number one in the medal level but 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.090
 That has deteriorated somewhat in recent years, not that we as the Netherlands 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.000
 less performed poorly in I have the sport is just emerging 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.570
 the other countries are also going to discover the great countries is going to discover 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 It is not for nothing that Russia has the largest delegation 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.450
 so it becomes more difficult to compete but open again 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.369
 what we have the downward spiral that in recent years this has the car or 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.210
 sign that I can now rebuild in the Netherlands with a zipper higher number 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.590
 look back medals a few weeks ago oss municipality already has the netherlands 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.350
 achieved 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.150
 I hope more than 9 then I am satisfied because the first round was a record low 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.740
 record at ten minutes 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.560
