photo out and experiment with the dark
light<00:01:06.570> pattern<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.200> grace<00:01:07.410> figure<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
light pattern and grace figure out a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
light pattern and grace figure out a
value<00:01:08.610> plan<00:01:08.940> that's<00:01:09.390> really<00:01:09.810> pleasing<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.440> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
value plan that's really pleasing to you

value plan that's really pleasing to you
so<00:01:11.190> here's<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> couple<00:01:11.730> more<00:01:11.910> three<00:01:12.510> value<00:01:12.900> note

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
so here's a couple more three value note

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.130 
so here's a couple more three value note
an<00:01:13.820> three<00:01:14.820> value<00:01:15.270> note<00:01:15.510> an<00:01:16.070> more<00:01:17.070> extensive

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
an three value note an more extensive

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.650 
an three value note an more extensive
here<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.230> some<00:01:19.410> more<00:01:19.620> note<00:01:19.890> ants<00:01:20.300> here's<00:01:21.300> just

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
here are some more note ants here's just

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.650 
here are some more note ants here's just
adjusting<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.380> value<00:01:23.120> seeing<00:01:24.120> how<00:01:24.300> I<00:01:24.330> want<00:01:24.600> my

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
adjusting the value seeing how I want my

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.380 
adjusting the value seeing how I want my
dark<00:01:24.960> light<00:01:25.200> pattern<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.340> goes<00:01:26.820> back<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
dark light pattern this goes back to the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.520 
dark light pattern this goes back to the
little<00:01:27.630> assignment<00:01:28.230> of<00:01:28.410> two<00:01:29.400> shadows<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:31.290> four

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
little assignment of two shadows to four

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.700 
little assignment of two shadows to four
two<00:01:31.740> values<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.100> shadow<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.090> light

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
two values for shadow one for light

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.790 
two values for shadow one for light
here's<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.800> two<00:01:35.130> value<00:01:36.090> note<00:01:36.510> ant<00:01:36.840> once<00:01:37.440> again

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
here's a two value note ant once again

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.130 
here's a two value note ant once again
this<00:01:37.980> is<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.310> dealing<00:01:38.790> with<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:38.970> strong<00:01:39.510> source

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
this is all dealing with a strong source

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
this is all dealing with a strong source
light<00:01:41.390> now<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.420> note<00:01:42.840> an<00:01:43.400> can<00:01:44.400> also<00:01:44.640> be

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
light now the note an can also be

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.120 
light now the note an can also be
achieved<00:01:46.070> by<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.460> simple<00:01:48.470> pattern<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.920> if

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
achieved by a simple pattern as if

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:59.800 
achieved by a simple pattern as if
there's<00:01:50.370> no<00:01:50.750> source<00:01:51.750> light
