 on the one hand are the viruses and 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.490
 bacteria with the purpose of entering your body 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 to take over and take control 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.560
 on the other hand are the immunity 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.960
 that protect our bodies against these

 to the place they aim for and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.210
 they move toward the earth

 well organized and disciplined 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 soldiers from the target area 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.970
 do n't give up so quickly

 soldiers who the enemy him often who the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.140
 local people quickly distinguished them

 own army from that of the enemy that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.010
 immediately activate the soldiers who 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.740
 are appointed for the production of weapons

 they produce as far as necessary 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.869
 During this trip they manage the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.119
 difficult task to complete 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.310
 causing harm to themselves yet

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.410
 carry on the most vital 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.420
 place of the enemy 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.890
 in the event of a win

 battlefield suppressed and the T-cells 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.790
 which all fighters sent back to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.200
 their camp the full date that was last on 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.690
 the battlefield of the

 this use of be at one

 similar invasion in the future 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.820
 the excellent army for this 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.260
 the drain system has been described 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.760
 the human body 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.470
 everything explained above 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.560
 happens to microscopic cells 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.330
 invisible to the naked eye how much 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.490
 People are aware that they are like that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.560
 organized disciplined and perfect 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.090
 alloy have their own body 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.820
 how many of them are aware of it 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.320
 that he is environment from all sides 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.180
 communion moreover if they don't 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.470
 prevent serious diseases 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.850
 cause with sun raffled to the full 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.590
 indeed there are the dangerous cattle 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.110
 ingram microbes in the air that we 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.480
 inhale in the water that we drink in 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.560
 so that movement on the surface that we 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.180
 to touch 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.769
 while we while we don't care 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.260
 awareness what's going on 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.870
 living cells in our body an enormous 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.330
 effort to save our body from 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.310
 and protect against diseases to which 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.260
 someone can even die 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.150
 because of all this reason the story is from 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.350
 the formation of the immune system 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.730
 never discussed by any one
