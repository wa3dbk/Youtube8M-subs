sure<00:06:23.050> that<00:06:23.350> happened<00:06:23.680> but<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:23.950> that's<00:06:24.490> the

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
sure that happened but it that's the

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.640 
sure that happened but it that's the
only<00:06:24.760> time<00:06:24.970> that<00:06:25.330> happened<00:06:26.050> and<00:06:26.290> I<00:06:26.440> was<00:06:26.530> like
