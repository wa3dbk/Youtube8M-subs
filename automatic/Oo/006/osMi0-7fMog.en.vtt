00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.119
 now I'm working with juanjo in a 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.919
 piece that is called and sound and we're 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.470
 also working with a repository 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.720
 one by the former power ballerina 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.780
 llama hate and based on what they 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.150
 we started to improvise a lot and 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.300
 each one also with his partner things 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.880
 completely different and it was arming 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.560
 is still being 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.660
 in general but all based on 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.150
 improvisations I would say it is 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.950
 contemporary because already with the style of 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.710
 movement that is made even if you have 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.630
 tips or have whatever it is for me is is 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.000
 contemporary that I like things 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.030
 remain open 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.390
 to the public I know that sometimes it throws some 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.809
 patterns like relationships a bit 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.750
 conflicting 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.750
 as secret traumas 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.290
 happy for everything to go well 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.290
 wonderful 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.350
 a very good job 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.700
 weeks 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.700
 press software 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.329
 and every day we have a new idea or 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.039
 we take a different address is a 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.039
 little a dark piece I lived 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.770
 also it reflects some instability 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.990
 in relationships 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.939
 in situations to be the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.030
 couples that society is living 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.030
 now 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.970
 the first part of the piece is with 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.860
 piano with 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.330
 composers of the game 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.330
 and we have some voices 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.580
 male voices and always being on 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.190
 he in the whole piece the piece had 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.210
 a rollover like that is turned around and 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.210
 it gets hot 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.270
 becomes at the highest level 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.150
 comes from 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.530
 of the pieces of the past you do not know 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.610
 they are already and are very close 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.190
 partner 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.970
 but we also do not know what the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.340
 history of evil 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.340
 with pancho we have good cold 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.560
 very good 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.800
 but neither 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.480
 they are very expensive with nothing 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.480
 the story that is going to have 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.700
 in the environment
