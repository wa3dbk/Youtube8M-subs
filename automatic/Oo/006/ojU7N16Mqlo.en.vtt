00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 in this video jimena aguilar and I 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.390
 we have prepared a trade and makeup 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.670
 spring in my video you are going to see my 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.070
 makeup and the outfit of it and in the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.500
 yours backwards so do not forget about 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.120
 pass projects let's start the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 makeup and in trying very well 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.590
 our skin and as not using 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.720
 also a sunscreen please do not 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.880
 leave home without your protection 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.369
 solar and especially if you take 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.560
 contraceptives and these things for the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.390
 face I'm just going to use a live 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.219
 cream because the truth is and when 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.500
 It starts to get hot they bother me 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.930
 quite the heavy makeup bases 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.239
 so you're very light is 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.790
 it's just going to unify a tad 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.910
 tone 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.430
 dark circles are my worst nightmare so 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.560
 I always use a pretty corrector 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.050
 cover for that area by applying it with 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.540
 the finger because I feel like I do not know how to 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.390
 it fades better and applied it a lot 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.430
 better in the area now I'm going to apply a 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.920
 shadow without brown appointment with some 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.650
 Glitters on the entire eyelid for 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.260
 make as a base for makeup 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.810
 of eyes and also I am going to blur it very 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.660
 well so that there are no edges 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.270
 We continue with a shadow clarita 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.610
 illuminate the bottom part of the eyebrow and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.350
 give us that a little bit of light 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.450
 I wanted to add makeup a 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.070
 little bit of this green that you see only in 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.990
 the outside of the eye and a little bit 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.229
 of the tabs to give a touch 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.479
 of color but that is subtle after 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.540
 with a black shadow I marked the outlined 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.670
 in the upper lashes with the brush 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.200
 If I'm honest, I forgot that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.600
 I wanted to apply this shade in color 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.310
 copper so I put it later in the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.320
 center of the eyelid to add a 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.600
 little bit of brightness and now comes one of 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.770
 my favorite steps the mask of 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.530
 tabs 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.500
 and I do not know why but I usually open my mouth 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.659
 when I put it on if it's the turn of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.729
 eyebrows we are going to fix them very well 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.060
 so that those hairs are kept on 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.710
 order all day 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.600
 we continue with the rouge this in tone 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.929
 peach is a boy's and it's that 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.720
 love we continue with the illuminator for 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.670
 have a super glowing face 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.250
 this age is my favorite 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.200
 and we went to the most important step for me 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.720
 in spring which is to add to the makeup 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.239
 a lipstick of a pink tone or so more 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.180
 clarito orestes de revlon and do not tell me 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.040
 that is not cute and this has been the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.900
 makeup I hope you liked it already 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.959
 you know that it is very in my super line 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.030
 comfortable super easy you know that kind of 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.920
 makeup is that I always do myself and 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.600
