behind<00:04:44.300> it<00:04:44.600> I<00:04:44.630> think<00:04:44.870> some<00:04:45.650> of<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:45.890> could

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
behind it I think some of this could

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.930 
behind it I think some of this could
well<00:04:46.580> actually<00:04:47.020> come<00:04:48.020> come<00:04:48.410> about<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:49.070> think

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
well actually come come about I think

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.510 
well actually come come about I think
what<00:04:50.150> what<00:04:50.840> what<00:04:51.260> it<00:04:51.350> might<00:04:51.500> depend<00:04:51.650> on<00:04:51.919> partly

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
what what what it might depend on partly

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.600 
what what what it might depend on partly
however<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.389> sort<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.720> reaction<00:04:54.130> that<00:04:55.130> it

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
however is the sort of reaction that it

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.700 
however is the sort of reaction that it
gets<00:04:55.940> in<00:04:56.240> Westminster<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.080> in<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.350> country

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
gets in Westminster and in the country

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.140 
gets in Westminster and in the country
at<00:04:57.800> large<00:04:57.979> I<00:04:58.310> mean<00:04:58.550> there'll<00:04:58.700> be<00:04:58.729> some<00:04:59.000> people

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
at large I mean there'll be some people

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.870 
at large I mean there'll be some people
who<00:04:59.330> think<00:04:59.570> this<00:04:59.750> is
