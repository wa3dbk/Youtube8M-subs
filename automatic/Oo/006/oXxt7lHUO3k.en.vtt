ops<00:01:21.960> 1<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.560> released<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:24.140> September<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.650> it

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
ops 1 got released in September was it

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.039 
ops 1 got released in September was it
two<00:01:26.220> thousand

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
two thousand

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.620 
two thousand
2012<00:01:29.049> something<00:01:29.890> like<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.359> so<00:01:31.359> I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:34.240> it's

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
2012 something like that so I think it's

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.419 
2012 something like that so I think it's
believable<00:01:35.109> I<00:01:35.320> think<00:01:35.590> july<00:01:35.770> second<00:01:36.310> is<00:01:36.399> the

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
believable I think july second is the

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.450 
believable I think july second is the
perfect<00:01:37.030> date<00:01:37.210> because<00:01:38.250> everyone's<00:01:39.250> going<00:01:39.429> to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
perfect date because everyone's going to

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.580 
perfect date because everyone's going to
bottom<00:01:39.819> at<00:01:40.000> pack<00:01:40.270> it's<00:01:40.750> right<00:01:40.990> before<00:01:41.140> fourth

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
bottom at pack it's right before fourth

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.069 
bottom at pack it's right before fourth
of<00:01:41.710> July<00:01:42.009> I'm<00:01:42.520> sure<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.420> know<00:01:43.569> right<00:01:43.899> around

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
of July I'm sure you know right around

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.480 
of July I'm sure you know right around
fourth<00:01:44.409> of<00:01:44.560> July<00:01:44.799> they<00:01:44.950> going<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.159> have<00:01:45.280> some

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
fourth of July they going to have some

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.449 
fourth of July they going to have some
sort<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:45.880> double<00:01:46.299> XP<00:01:46.689> thing<00:01:46.959> so<00:01:47.350> it<00:01:47.950> fits

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
sort of double XP thing so it fits

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.199 
sort of double XP thing so it fits
perfectly<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:50.079> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:51.700> it's<00:01:52.060> the

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
perfectly and so I think it's the

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.059 
perfectly and so I think it's the
perfect<00:01:52.420> date<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.350> think<00:01:53.590> it's<00:01:53.740> completely

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
perfect date and I think it's completely

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.029 
perfect date and I think it's completely
legit<00:01:54.789> so<00:01:55.119> expect<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.140> trail<00:01:56.500> are<00:01:56.709> probably

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
legit so expect the trail are probably

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.910 
legit so expect the trail are probably
around<00:01:57.250> i<00:01:57.609> would<00:01:58.209> say<00:01:58.420> june<00:01:58.780> eighteenth<00:01:59.470> maybe

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
around i would say june eighteenth maybe

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.809 
around i would say june eighteenth maybe
June<00:02:00.220> twentieth<00:02:00.670> tops<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.579> know<00:02:03.700> I'm

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
June twentieth tops and you know I'm

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.020

really hoping that map pack three

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.800 
really hoping that map pack three
zombies<00:02:07.569> is<00:02:08.549> kind<00:02:09.549> of<00:02:09.640> go<00:02:09.789> kind<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.479> going<00:02:10.690> to

of like they're turning their map packs
into<00:02:48.819> like<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.090> template<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.900> some<00:02:50.109> sorts<00:02:50.530> kind

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
into like a template of some sorts kind

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.770 
into like a template of some sorts kind
of<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.519> hangover<00:02:51.910> movies<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.569> guys

that<00:02:55.959> in<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.500> way<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:57.760> mad<00:02:57.970> pack<00:02:58.269> 3<00:02:58.720> i'm<00:02:59.010> guessing

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
that in a way so mad pack 3 i'm guessing

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.409 
that in a way so mad pack 3 i'm guessing
it'll<00:03:01.180> be<00:03:01.569> in<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:02.049> tropical<00:03:02.410> setting<00:03:03.340> if<00:03:03.700> not

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
it'll be in a tropical setting if not

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.220 
it'll be in a tropical setting if not
tropical<00:03:05.010> it'll<00:03:06.010> be<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.310> like<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.910> map<00:03:07.419> that<00:03:07.720> has

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
tropical it'll be in like a map that has

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.460 
tropical it'll be in like a map that has
a<00:03:08.470> lot<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.829> daylight<00:03:09.370> on<00:03:09.639> a<00:03:09.730> sun<00:03:10.359> a<00:03:10.750> lot<00:03:11.349> of

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
a lot of daylight on a sun a lot of

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.830 
a lot of daylight on a sun a lot of
colors<00:03:11.950> lot<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.669> grass<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.540> know<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.660> lot<00:03:13.810> of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
colors lot of grass you know a lot of

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.339 
colors lot of grass you know a lot of
greens<00:03:14.579> so<00:03:15.579> expect<00:03:16.060> something<00:03:16.299> like<00:03:16.450> that<00:03:16.900> i'm

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
greens so expect something like that i'm

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.949 
greens so expect something like that i'm
thinking<00:03:17.709> maybe<00:03:18.040> Egypt<00:03:18.700> with<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.389> pyramids

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
thinking maybe Egypt with the pyramids

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:20.520 
thinking maybe Egypt with the pyramids
that<00:03:20.079> would<00:03:20.290> be

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
that would be

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.100 
that would be
sick<00:03:24.420> trying<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.540> think<00:03:25.720> what<00:03:25.810> else<00:03:25.959> they

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
sick trying to think what else they

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.380 
sick trying to think what else they
could<00:03:26.170> do<00:03:26.410> besides<00:03:27.069> making<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.880> too<00:03:28.060> similar

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
could do besides making it too similar

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.190 
could do besides making it too similar
to<00:03:28.510> shi<00:03:29.140> no<00:03:29.260> numa<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.740> shangri-la<00:03:31.200> it's

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
to shi no numa and shangri-la it's

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.920 
to shi no numa and shangri-la it's
really<00:03:32.410> hard<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.830> think<00:03:33.040> here<00:03:33.600> but<00:03:34.600> I'm<00:03:34.720> pretty

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
really hard to think here but I'm pretty

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
really hard to think here but I'm pretty
sure<00:03:35.050> they're<00:03:35.350> going<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.500> stick<00:03:35.740> with<00:03:35.770> the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
sure they're going to stick with the

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.190 
sure they're going to stick with the
tropical<00:03:36.340> setting<00:03:36.640> again<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.690> if<00:03:37.870> I'm<00:03:37.989> wrong

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
tropical setting again and if I'm wrong
