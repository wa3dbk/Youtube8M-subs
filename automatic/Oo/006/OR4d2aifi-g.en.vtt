00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.339
 otherwise get 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.500
 whole maynkravt can be called his 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.080
 kind of revelation for the gaming world yet 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.630
 all games are based on the rail principle 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.580
 where the player cannot step in 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.860
 Well, yes, of course, it doesn't count 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.680
 pixel masterpiece modern stack on 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.440
 this is a player in his cubic world and gives 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.660
 take a deep breath in here 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.970
 freedom of thought and action 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.340
 Well, in general, it is not surprising that the game has become 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.700
 so popular is not surprising and the fact that 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.540
 that clones and minecraft in general like 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.239
 games now 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.780
 ton on all platforms well except 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.730
 windows 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.969
 He of course there at all except vatsap and 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:01.300
 nothing is shorter we look at block abs 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.300
 for you not to be confused black ops 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.590
 it is worth starting with our very first 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.450
 anti review anti review rubric video 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.159
 reviews on the channel strip hole in which 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.990
 considered the most poor quality not 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.490
 interesting and generally lousy applications 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.260
 The first anti channel review was 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.820
 video about playing slenderman then later 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.610
 for some time the rubric was revived and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.220
 got its current name seemed 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.530
 would and where does slenderman let's say so 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.659
 very much and not only that 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.360
 today's patient is crooked 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.490
 and the bones are very much like a slender 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.310
 both games are also penned by one 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.130
 a developer who has become so angry that 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.400
 on stamped a whole bunch of similar games 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.909
 based on games known and not that guy 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.829
 well done 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.229
 very well oriented in trends 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.270
 what is popular at the moment is not 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.000
 wonder if he's chinese 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.610
 he even has a slenderman in minecraft 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.799
 you style as you little idea in general block 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.200
 abs is supposedly a call of duty in the world 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.450
 maykravt from call of duty sticking here 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.489
 in front of the nose a gun of three pixels from 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.459
 maykravt schedule from which it becomes 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.650
 bad and somehow pulls retire in 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.930
 restroom and I don't want to say that in 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.880
 minecraft bad graphics there at least 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.010
 there is some stylization and here in 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.300
 overall everything is somehow sad and I would even 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.370
 said fig molt 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.920
 block abs we need to shoot by 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.290
 cubic enemies and no 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.750
 the beginnings of intelligence of the latter are not 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.210
 there is generally they are able to 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.490
 wiggling and occasionally shooting at 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.190
 randomized directions however your 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.470
 allies if they are in the mission too 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.630
 the mind does not differ brains like them 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.320
 parrots sense in principle, too, and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.120
 There is, by the way, this brand of demon already 129 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.670
 rubles for a universal application 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.910
 Well, by itself, in fact, value 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.100
 This application is an absolute zero graphics 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.100
 terrible control is inconvenient to play not 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.660
 interestingly done everything is very bad so 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.300

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.450
