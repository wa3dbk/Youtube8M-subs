00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.720
 of what you can get 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.930
 There are 3 there are not 4 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.230
 are those 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.589
 Well, not only 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.589
 each 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.070
 the sighting something then we're going 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.070
 Now there are 5 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.380
 for me 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.120
 sunflower or others other we are down 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.630
 Do not be naughty 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.080
 we know that it loads well 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.080
 It will be something I think 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.140
 because I had something strange a while ago but 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.909
 no longer made us 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.150
 but there are some colors but they are 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.030
 doing with the other 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.650
 when browsing is another are 123 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.390
 they are 42 those are all 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.390
 6 but it is not paying 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.450
 so he can not get to this thing anymore 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.679
 there is another one if it is also final to 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.299
 through the centuries 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.789
 pinche light is not reached let's stop 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.400
 to improve you learned a lot and there are 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.970
 another more 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.970
 if not 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.470
 no mames 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.950
 but if it is removed, it is where it is 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.950
 that was that you see 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.790
 we're 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.730
 no more are two 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.930
 why 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.439
 they stop and come back advanced 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.439
 ah 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.159

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.829

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.140
 we go 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.550

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.550

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.340

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.010
 many later 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.010
