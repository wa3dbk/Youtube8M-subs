demonstrate how well how electricity is

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.780 
demonstrate how well how electricity is
produced<00:00:05.940> by<00:00:06.450> steam<00:00:06.930> energy<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
produced by steam energy and this is the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.749

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
a help of nine volt or DC we can join we

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.550 
a help of nine volt or DC we can join we
can<00:01:53.080> charge<00:01:53.380> about<00:01:53.770> 300<00:01:54.280> by<00:01:54.400> force<00:01:54.730> at<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.910> time

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
can charge about 300 by force at a time

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.020 
can charge about 300 by force at a time
now<00:01:56.560> I'll<00:01:56.740> show<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.070> how<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.370> set<00:01:57.700> up<00:01:57.730> this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
now I'll show you how to set up this

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.380 
now I'll show you how to set up this
experiment<00:01:58.510> of<00:01:59.020> this<00:01:59.320> soil<00:01:59.650> items<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.790> let<00:02:01.240> us

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
experiment of this soil items and let us

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.219 
experiment of this soil items and let us
say<00:02:01.570> run<00:02:01.750> out<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.140> experiment<00:02:05.520> fix<00:02:06.520> this

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
say run out the experiment fix this

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.010 
say run out the experiment fix this
stake<00:02:08.229> into<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.800> other<00:02:09.070> one<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.840> should

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
stake into the other one and it should

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.410 
stake into the other one and it should
be<00:02:11.140> pleased<00:02:11.440> just<00:02:12.040> about<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.490> nozzle<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:15.420> let

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
be pleased just about a nozzle and let

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.750 
be pleased just about a nozzle and let
us<00:02:16.570> on<00:02:16.750> let's<00:02:17.320> start<00:02:17.590> eating<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:19.260> cocoa
