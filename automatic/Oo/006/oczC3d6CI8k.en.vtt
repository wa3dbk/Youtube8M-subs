hunting<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:12.060> probably<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> fastest<00:02:12.780> way<00:02:12.840> to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
hunting it's probably the fastest way to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.030 
hunting it's probably the fastest way to
make<00:02:13.140> money<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> game<00:02:13.709> you're<00:02:13.890> going<00:02:13.980> to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040

make money in the game you're going to
get<00:02:14.190> over<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.489> hundred<00:02:14.760> thousand<00:02:15.180> no<00:02:15.420> problem

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
get over a hundred thousand no problem

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.740 
get over a hundred thousand no problem
so<00:02:16.489> that's<00:02:17.489> pretty<00:02:17.640> much<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.030> also<00:02:18.299> if<00:02:18.659> you
