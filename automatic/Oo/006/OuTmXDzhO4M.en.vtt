the care package half in half out

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.290 
the care package half in half out
sometimes<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:37.580> works<00:01:37.729> if<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:37.970> just<00:01:38.090> lends

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
sometimes it works if it just lends

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.520 
sometimes it works if it just lends
someone<00:01:38.600> top<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.930> you<00:01:39.020> then<00:01:39.290> you're<00:01:39.380> going<00:01:39.470> to

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
someone top of you then you're going to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.070 
someone top of you then you're going to
need<00:01:39.650> another<00:01:39.890> person<00:01:40.390> right<00:01:41.390> outside<00:01:41.570> and

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
need another person right outside and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.990 
need another person right outside and
right<00:01:42.800> near<00:01:43.010> you<00:01:43.160> that<00:01:43.190> way<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.550> can<00:01:43.790> lunge

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
right near you that way you can lunge

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.580 
right near you that way you can lunge
and<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.360> will<00:01:44.540> slide<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:45.110> right<00:01:45.140> out<00:01:45.410> of<00:01:45.470> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
and it will slide you right out of the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.820 
and it will slide you right out of the
map<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.220> it<00:01:47.150> will<00:01:47.300> that's<00:01:47.810> what<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.050> breach<00:01:48.619> is

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
map and it will that's what a breach is

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.050 
map and it will that's what a breach is
a<00:01:48.860> black<00:01:49.190> ops<00:01:49.369> one<00:01:49.490> is<00:01:49.580> how<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:49.700> get<00:01:49.850> out<00:01:49.970> of

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
a black ops one is how you get out of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.719 
a black ops one is how you get out of
most<00:01:50.180> maps<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.720> then<00:01:51.320> for<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.399> part<00:01:52.640> you

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
most maps and then for this part you

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.139 
most maps and then for this part you
need<00:01:53.149> at<00:01:53.540> least<00:01:53.800> four<00:01:54.800> care<00:01:55.040> packages<00:01:55.550> five<00:01:55.880> or

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
need at least four care packages five or

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.609 
need at least four care packages five or
six<00:01:56.390> my<00:01:56.509> work<00:01:56.690> even<00:01:56.960> better<00:01:56.990> but<00:01:57.350> it's<00:01:57.470> hard

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
six my work even better but it's hard

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.210 
six my work even better but it's hard
timing<00:01:57.950> for<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.680> once<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.800> get<00:02:00.920> care

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
timing for that so once you get care

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.540 
timing for that so once you get care
packages<00:02:01.640> then<00:02:01.940> you're<00:02:02.119> gonna<00:02:02.680> kills<00:02:03.680> care

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
packages then you're gonna kills care

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.280 
packages then you're gonna kills care
package<00:02:04.880> class<00:02:05.119> obviously<00:02:05.390> for<00:02:05.780> care<00:02:05.930> package

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
package class obviously for care package

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.460 
package class obviously for care package
breaching<00:02:06.800> goes<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.670> breach<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.209> run<00:02:08.509> fast<00:02:08.780> so

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
breaching goes to breach and run fast so

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.650 
breaching goes to breach and run fast so
I<00:02:09.770> was<00:02:09.920> just<00:02:10.190> using<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.580> care<00:02:10.759> package<00:02:10.940> class<00:02:11.360> if

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
I was just using a care package class if

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.560 
I was just using a care package class if
you're<00:02:12.470> using<00:02:12.680> my<00:02:12.920> game<00:02:13.160> mode<00:02:13.370> get<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.420> care

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
you're using my game mode get the care

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.180 
you're using my game mode get the care
package<00:02:14.870> class<00:02:15.110> first<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:15.830> can<00:02:15.890> throw<00:02:16.100> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
package class first so you can throw the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.040 
package class first so you can throw the
care<00:02:16.340> packages<00:02:16.760> down<00:02:16.940> jump<00:02:17.300> on<00:02:17.420> top<00:02:17.600> make<00:02:18.020> sure

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
care packages down jump on top make sure

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.010 
care packages down jump on top make sure
it<00:02:18.260> works<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:19.880> throw<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.060> anywhere<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.840> this

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
it works just throw it anywhere on this

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.600 
it works just throw it anywhere on this
building<00:02:21.380> as<00:02:21.560> long<00:02:21.770> as<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:21.980> care<00:02:22.160> packages

then you're going to throw two more one

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.280 
then you're going to throw two more one
or<00:02:37.610> two<00:02:37.730> more<00:02:37.880> down<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.019> bounce<00:02:39.170> it

or two more down and if you bounce it

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.930 
or two more down and if you bounce it
off<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.500> little<00:02:39.650> bar<00:02:40.010> right<00:02:40.190> here<00:02:40.220> as<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.790> did

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
off this little bar right here as I did

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.130 
off this little bar right here as I did
right<00:02:41.060> there<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.330> went<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.630> wrong<00:02:41.690> way<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:41.930> you

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
right there it went the wrong way so you

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.960 
right there it went the wrong way so you
got<00:02:42.260> back<00:02:42.470> up<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.680> little<00:02:42.769> bit<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.730> will<00:02:43.850> hit

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
got back up a little bit and it will hit

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.030 
got back up a little bit and it will hit
the<00:02:44.060> bar<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.510> go<00:02:44.720> right<00:02:44.930> while<00:02:45.080> you're<00:02:45.260> prone

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the bar and go right while you're prone

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.120 
the bar and go right while you're prone
that<00:02:46.670> way<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.630> will<00:02:47.870> land<00:02:48.470> just<00:02:48.860> like<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
that way it will land just like the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.280 
that way it will land just like the
others<00:02:49.340> did<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.600> here<00:02:50.780> I'm<00:02:50.840> getting<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.080> couple

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
others did so here I'm getting a couple

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.600 
others did so here I'm getting a couple
more<00:02:51.380> kills<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.040> case<00:02:52.190> those<00:02:52.370> care

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
more kills just in case those care

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.370 
more kills just in case those care
packages<00:02:52.640> miss<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:53.780> I'm<00:02:53.870> going<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.049> change<00:02:54.290> my

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
packages miss but I'm going to change my

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.320 
packages miss but I'm going to change my
breach<00:02:54.709> class<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.400> sprint<00:02:55.730> across<00:02:56.000> like

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
breach class so I can sprint across like

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.690 
breach class so I can sprint across like
you'll<00:02:56.450> see<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.530> here<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:57.769> think<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.130> speed<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.549> up

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
you'll see so here I think I speed it up

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.820 
you'll see so here I think I speed it up
in<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.060> second<00:02:59.390> here<00:02:59.510> cuz<00:02:59.780> it's<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.620> little

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
in a second here cuz it's a little

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.050 
in a second here cuz it's a little
difficult<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.400> care<00:03:01.580> packages<00:03:01.940> are

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
difficult to the care packages are

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.880 
difficult to the care packages are
staggered<00:03:02.390> like<00:03:02.510> this<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:03.470> just<00:03:03.590> got<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.709> find

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
staggered like this you just got to find

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.289 
staggered like this you just got to find
a<00:03:04.010> way<00:03:04.040> out<00:03:04.160> there's<00:03:04.489> usually<00:03:04.640> always<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:05.120> way

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
a way out there's usually always a way

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.580 
a way out there's usually always a way
up<00:03:05.450> but<00:03:05.660> if<00:03:05.810> there's<00:03:05.959> not<00:03:06.079> you<00:03:06.230> might<00:03:06.380> have<00:03:06.500> to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
up but if there's not you might have to

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.750 
up but if there's not you might have to
throw<00:03:06.799> more<00:03:07.370> care<00:03:07.610> packages<00:03:08.060> down<00:03:08.410> so<00:03:09.760> once

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
throw more care packages down so once

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.640 
throw more care packages down so once
you<00:03:10.850> do<00:03:11.120> finally<00:03:11.420> get<00:03:11.630> up<00:03:11.780> there<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.620> is

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
you do finally get up there and it is

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.590 
you do finally get up there and it is
pretty<00:03:13.280> hard<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:13.670> do<00:03:13.850> with<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.269> class

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
pretty hard to do with this class

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.350 
pretty hard to do with this class
because<00:03:15.049> you<00:03:15.320> run<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.680> fast<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:16.790> right<00:03:17.090> here<00:03:17.299> I

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
because you run so fast but right here I

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.300 
because you run so fast but right here I
get<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.780> finally<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.290> you're<00:03:19.010> going<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.160> need

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
get it finally and you're going to need

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.009 
get it finally and you're going to need
to<00:03:19.340> do<00:03:19.760> this<00:03:19.880> without<00:03:20.060> your<00:03:20.360> tack<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.840> way

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
to do this without your tack that way

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.250 
to do this without your tack that way
you<00:03:21.680> can<00:03:21.890> /<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:23.450> know<00:03:23.540> go<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.870> rest<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.200> the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
you can / you know go to the rest of the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.690 
you can / you know go to the rest of the
spot<00:03:24.440> so<00:03:24.620> let's<00:03:24.829> hear<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:24.980> there<00:03:25.220> get<00:03:25.610> the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
spot so let's hear it there get the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.640 
spot so let's hear it there get the
bridge<00:03:25.820> class<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.329> sprint<00:03:26.600> across<00:03:26.780> then

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
bridge class you to sprint across then

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.050 
bridge class you to sprint across then
you<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:27.920> tack<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:28.250> down<00:03:28.280> now<00:03:28.579> that<00:03:28.730> could<00:03:28.880> be<00:03:28.940> a

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
you can tack it down now that could be a

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.970 
you can tack it down now that could be a
spa<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:29.630> could<00:03:29.810> go<00:03:29.930> from<00:03:30.109> right<00:03:30.200> there<00:03:30.440> but

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
spa you could go from right there but

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.229 
spa you could go from right there but
we're<00:03:31.070> gonna<00:03:31.160> get<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.430> little<00:03:31.579> bit<00:03:31.760> higher<00:03:31.940> on

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
we're gonna get a little bit higher on

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.700 
we're gonna get a little bit higher on
this<00:03:32.480> wall<00:03:32.750> right<00:03:32.780> beside<00:03:33.230> me

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
this wall right beside me

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.020 
this wall right beside me
so<00:03:34.100> here's<00:03:34.280> one<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.580> spots<00:03:34.790> where<00:03:34.940> you

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
so here's one of the spots where you

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.130 
so here's one of the spots where you
suicide<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:35.570> you're<00:03:35.720> going<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.870> need<00:03:36.020> a<00:03:36.050> whole

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
suicide so you're going to need a whole

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.710 
suicide so you're going to need a whole
bunch<00:03:36.530> more<00:03:36.590> care<00:03:36.920> packages<00:03:37.430> if<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.420> play<00:03:38.690> it

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
bunch more care packages if you play it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.100 
bunch more care packages if you play it
easy<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:40.730> want<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.060> use<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.690> care

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
easy and you want to use the care

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.220 
easy and you want to use the care
package<00:03:42.440> class<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:43.370> probably<00:03:43.400> need<00:03:44.180> five<00:03:45.020> or

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
package class you probably need five or

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.570 
package class you probably need five or
six<00:03:45.440> care<00:03:45.650> packages<00:03:46.070> but<00:03:46.220> if<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.460> use<00:03:46.550> a

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
six care packages but if you use a

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.510 
six care packages but if you use a
breach<00:03:46.850> class<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.300> might<00:03:47.480> only<00:03:47.690> gun<00:03:48.200> or<00:03:48.320> two

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
breach class you might only gun or two

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.610 
breach class you might only gun or two
so<00:03:49.520> i<00:03:49.880> think<00:03:50.450> i<00:03:50.630> just<00:03:50.660> played<00:03:51.020> it<00:03:51.140> safe<00:03:51.290> i<00:03:51.470> threw

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
so i think i just played it safe i threw

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.110 
so i think i just played it safe i threw
his<00:03:51.710> mini<00:03:51.890> down<00:03:52.100> as<00:03:52.250> i<00:03:52.340> could<00:03:52.400> just<00:03:52.760> show<00:03:53.060> you

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
his mini down as i could just show you

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.910 
his mini down as i could just show you
guys<00:03:53.240> what<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.480> looks<00:03:53.510> like<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:54.500> was<00:03:54.620> my<00:03:54.800> first

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
guys what it looks like it was my first

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.850 
guys what it looks like it was my first
time<00:03:55.070> doing<00:03:55.310> this<00:03:55.490> spot<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.900> second<00:03:57.680> shot

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
time doing this spot and the second shot

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.010 
time doing this spot and the second shot
you<00:03:57.980> saw<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.400> before<00:03:58.760> this<00:03:58.850> commentary<00:03:59.360> was

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
you saw and before this commentary was

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.110 
you saw and before this commentary was

today i'll put a link to his channel in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.340 
today i'll put a link to his channel in
the<00:04:04.310> description<00:04:04.900> he's<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:05.990> one<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.230> actually

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
the description he's the one to actually

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.890 
the description he's the one to actually
show<00:04:06.650> me<00:04:06.800> how<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:06.950> do<00:04:07.070> this<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.480> i<00:04:08.540> used<00:04:08.750> to

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
show me how to do this and so i used to

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.440 
show me how to do this and so i used to
show<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.770> was<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.920> good<00:04:10.070> shot<00:04:10.280> too<00:04:10.490> so<00:04:11.150> he'll<00:04:11.330> be

ammo crate then I pick it up and I have
a<00:04:38.060> tactical<00:04:38.450> insertion<00:04:39.190> so<00:04:40.190> once<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:40.970> get

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
a tactical insertion so once you get

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.030 
a tactical insertion so once you get
about<00:04:41.240> this<00:04:41.420> far<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:42.140> white<00:04:42.470> area<00:04:42.500> right<00:04:43.010> in

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
about this far this white area right in

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.620 
about this far this white area right in
front<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.250> me<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.610> saw<00:04:43.850> this<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.300> just<00:04:44.390> walk

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
front of me you saw this you just walk

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.630 
front of me you saw this you just walk
right<00:04:44.660> on<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.230> you're<00:04:45.920> good<00:04:46.100> to<00:04:46.130> go<00:04:46.220> and

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
right on it and you're good to go and

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.420 
right on it and you're good to go and
then<00:04:47.600> there<00:04:48.080> are<00:04:48.110> if<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:48.980> look<00:04:49.130> at<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.250> ground

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
then there are if you look at the ground

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.190 
then there are if you look at the ground
some<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:49.910> parts<00:04:50.180> are<00:04:50.360> colored<00:04:50.930> little

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
some of the parts are colored little

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.350 
some of the parts are colored little
like<00:04:51.500> shaded<00:04:51.890> a<00:04:51.980> little<00:04:52.190> different<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:53.030> I<00:04:53.150> see

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
like shaded a little different and I see

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.030 
like shaded a little different and I see
you<00:04:53.450> can<00:04:53.570> tell<00:04:53.720> if<00:04:53.810> it's<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:53.930> drop<00:04:54.140> off<00:04:54.320> or<00:04:54.710> if

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
you can tell if it's a drop off or if

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.340 
you can tell if it's a drop off or if
you<00:04:55.100> just<00:04:55.130> go<00:04:55.340> prone<00:04:55.640> and<00:04:55.970> we<00:04:56.180> get<00:04:56.330> blocked<00:04:56.570> or

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
you just go prone and we get blocked or

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.170 
you just go prone and we get blocked or
if<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.500> fall<00:04:57.710> off<00:04:57.890> then<00:04:58.160> as<00:04:58.340> they<00:04:58.970> fall<00:04:59.150> off

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
if you fall off then as they fall off

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.720 
if you fall off then as they fall off
mark<00:04:59.890> so<00:05:00.890> once<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:01.160> repair<00:05:01.460> you're<00:05:01.640> gonna

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
mark so once you repair you're gonna

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.670 
mark so once you repair you're gonna
need<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:01.970> go<00:05:02.090> back<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.630> opposite<00:05:03.140> way<00:05:03.290> just<00:05:03.590> on

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
need to go back the opposite way just on

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.290 
need to go back the opposite way just on
the<00:05:03.770> higher<00:05:03.950> ledge<00:05:04.250> so<00:05:04.790> there's<00:05:05.060> another

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
the higher ledge so there's another

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.140 
the higher ledge so there's another
example<00:05:05.690> of<00:05:05.810> me<00:05:06.020> falling<00:05:06.260> through<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.650> mouth

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
example of me falling through the mouth

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.280 
example of me falling through the mouth
so<00:05:08.150> it<00:05:09.140> chokes<00:05:09.530> me<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.940> took<00:05:11.090> me<00:05:11.270> like<00:05:11.450> seven

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
so it chokes me it took me like seven

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.650 
so it chokes me it took me like seven

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.580 
package class in your normal speed but I
couldn't<00:05:17.750> get<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.020> we<00:05:18.140> are<00:05:18.230> running<00:05:18.350> out<00:05:18.530> of

which<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.680> would<00:05:21.860> not<00:05:21.980> suggest<00:05:22.130> but<00:05:22.670> if<00:05:22.790> you

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
which I would not suggest but if you

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.840 
which I would not suggest but if you
think<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:23.270> have<00:05:23.510> it<00:05:24.110> then<00:05:24.320> go<00:05:24.470> for<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:24.740> so<00:05:25.490> I<00:05:25.520> am

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
think you have it then go for it so I am

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.890 
think you have it then go for it so I am
just<00:05:25.880> showing<00:05:26.150> you<00:05:26.240> what<00:05:26.390> it<00:05:26.450> looks<00:05:26.480> like<00:05:26.720> if

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
just showing you what it looks like if

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.930 
just showing you what it looks like if
you're<00:05:27.050> normal<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:27.710> how<00:05:28.130> many<00:05:28.220> care<00:05:28.490> packages

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
you're normal and how many care packages

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.060 
you're normal and how many care packages
it<00:05:29.120> takes<00:05:29.300> to<00:05:29.480> do<00:05:29.600> this<00:05:29.750> so<00:05:30.500> that's<00:05:30.650> about<00:05:30.740> five

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
it takes to do this so that's about five

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.190 
it takes to do this so that's about five
or<00:05:31.250> six<00:05:31.400> right<00:05:31.610> there<00:05:31.640> i'd<00:05:31.880> say<00:05:32.090> so<00:05:33.020> here<00:05:33.170> I

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
or six right there i'd say so here I

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.290 
or six right there i'd say so here I
think<00:05:33.380> oh<00:05:33.680> this<00:05:34.520> care<00:05:34.730> package<00:05:34.880> missed<00:05:35.210> I

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
think oh this care package missed I

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.720 
think oh this care package missed I
think<00:05:35.480> I<00:05:35.510> can<00:05:35.660> make<00:05:35.750> it<00:05:35.810> and<00:05:36.110> I<00:05:36.440> did<00:05:36.710> not<00:05:36.950> so<00:05:37.670> you

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
think I can make it and I did not so you

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.070 
think I can make it and I did not so you
need<00:05:37.910> to<00:05:37.970> get<00:05:38.060> extremely<00:05:38.420> close<00:05:38.690> to<00:05:38.780> that<00:05:38.900> wall

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
need to get extremely close to that wall

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.690 
need to get extremely close to that wall
right<00:05:39.230> there<00:05:39.380> otherwise<00:05:40.310> it's<00:05:40.460> not<00:05:40.520> gonna

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
right there otherwise it's not gonna
