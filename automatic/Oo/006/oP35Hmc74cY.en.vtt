important<00:00:44.610> points<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.600> want<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> make<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
important points I want to make when you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.160 
important points I want to make when you
make<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.920> scarf<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.750> need<00:00:48.960> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
make this scarf and that is you need to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.439 
make this scarf and that is you need to
cast<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.309> bind<00:00:51.149> off<00:00:51.480> very<00:00:52.350> loosely

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
cast on and bind off very loosely

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.900 
cast on and bind off very loosely
otherwise<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.989> edges<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.800> drop<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
otherwise your edges will drop and the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.439 
otherwise your edges will drop and the
body<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.660> will<00:00:57.809> sag<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.559> cast<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.640> bind<00:01:00.210> up

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
body of it will sag so cast on bind up

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.810 
body of it will sag so cast on bind up
very<00:01:00.870> loosely<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:02.129> other<00:01:02.280> employment

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
very loosely the other employment

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.320 
very loosely the other employment
important<00:01:03.780> part<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.460> get<00:01:05.460> your<00:01:05.580> gauge<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
important part is to get your gauge and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.350 
important part is to get your gauge and
determine<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> length<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.580> space<00:01:08.880> I

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
determine the length so in this space I

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.280 
determine the length so in this space I
was<00:01:09.689> good<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.320> checked<00:01:10.770> my<00:01:10.920> gauge<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.869> knit<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
was good I checked my gauge I knit up a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.320 
was good I checked my gauge I knit up a
little<00:01:13.470> swatch<00:01:13.799> check<00:01:14.369> my<00:01:14.549> gains<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.090> was

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
little swatch check my gains I was

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
little swatch check my gains I was
getting<00:01:15.689> two<00:01:15.990> stitches<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.799> inch

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
getting two stitches to the inch

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
getting two stitches to the inch
I<00:01:17.659> cast<00:01:19.189> 106th<00:01:20.189> inches<00:01:20.640> which<00:01:20.970> gave<00:01:21.299> me<00:01:22.070> 53

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
I cast 106th inches which gave me 53

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.350 
I cast 106th inches which gave me 53
inches<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.320> will<00:01:25.710> say<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.180> with<00:01:27.180> my

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
inches now I will say that with my

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.660 
inches now I will say that with my
experience<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.470> type<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> novelty

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
experience with this type of novelty

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.660 
experience with this type of novelty
yarn<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.630> grows<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.560> bit<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> made<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
yarn it grows a little bit so I made a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.600 
yarn it grows a little bit so I made a
limpet<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> short<00:01:34.049> side<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.560> 53<00:01:35.189> inches

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
limpet on the short side at 53 inches

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.819 
limpet on the short side at 53 inches
knowing<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.900> will<00:01:37.049> probably<00:01:37.470> stretch

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
knowing that it will probably stretch

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.590 
knowing that it will probably stretch
out<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.820> good<00:01:39.090> 4<00:01:39.479> or<00:01:39.780> 5<00:01:40.049> inches<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.600> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
out you know a good 4 or 5 inches so you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
out you know a good 4 or 5 inches so you
determine<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> length<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.220> fringe<00:01:44.790> in

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
determine the length of the fringe in

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.469 
determine the length of the fringe in
this<00:01:45.869> case<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.829> about<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> six<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.299> eight

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
this case I have about a six or eight

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.880 
this case I have about a six or eight
inch<00:01:48.829> fringe<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.259> take<00:01:52.619> one

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
inch fringe and what I do is I take one

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.139 
inch fringe and what I do is I take one
of<00:01:53.070> these<00:01:53.250> yarns<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:55.350> leave<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.490> length<00:01:56.909> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
of these yarns and I leave a length of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.459 
of these yarns and I leave a length of
yarn<00:01:57.360> maybe<00:01:58.049> eight<00:01:58.920> inches<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.869> knit<00:02:01.170> one

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
yarn maybe eight inches and I knit one

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.530 
yarn maybe eight inches and I knit one
row<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.210> take<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.200> next<00:02:04.229> yarn<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.540> I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
row and then I take the next yarn and I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.290 
row and then I take the next yarn and I
leave<00:02:07.380> eight<00:02:08.069> inches<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:10.580> knit<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:12.270> row

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
leave eight inches and I knit one row

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.360 
leave eight inches and I knit one row
and<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.440> after

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and then after

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.200 
and then after
the<00:02:14.910> end<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.270> each<00:02:15.450> row<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.140> cut<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:17.430> yarn<00:02:17.850> of

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
the end of each row and cut that yarn of

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.320 
the end of each row and cut that yarn of
eight<00:02:18.690> inches<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.950> what<00:02:20.160> I've<00:02:20.340> done<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.970> I've

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
eight inches so what I've done is I've

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.790 
eight inches so what I've done is I've
made<00:02:21.630> my<00:02:21.930> fringe<00:02:22.410> as<00:02:22.800> I'm<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.700> along<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.810> so

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
made my fringe as I'm going along and so

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.860 
made my fringe as I'm going along and so
you<00:02:26.580> keep<00:02:26.850> doing<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.450> using<00:02:28.190> each<00:02:29.190> yarn<00:02:29.870> one

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
you keep doing that using each yarn one

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.130 
you keep doing that using each yarn one
row<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.760> generally<00:02:32.760> put<00:02:32.970> these<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.540> basket

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
row I generally put these in a basket
