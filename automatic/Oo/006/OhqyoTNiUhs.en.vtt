00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:12.170
 Hello UTB, we lived in peace 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.780
 our spirit as usual 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:26.580
 Now open the computer as a dad to find 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:30.960
 difference what happened in the world bought yet 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.610
 I bought a whole card through ebay 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.600
 thing i bought it 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.790
 This is generally one whole whole comedy 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.670
 no one knows in stores what it is 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.280
 come to these but at bob anglin they 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.629
 short pancake drown 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 asking what is a briefing layer no 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.520
 no, you start to explain to them 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.710
 no one will ever recurl 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.890
 first time I heard at home I want 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.440
 give did not go in the evening wait on yellow 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.059
 with them we say that the money with them is not 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.710
 I will take for what I do ok 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.309
 Education that they are so stupid 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.010
 8 whole clown were well and as usual damn 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.200
 well what problems did he create but not 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.150
 problems on the wheel you do not work well all 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.820
 there is installed Windows everything about I do not 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.740
 always call of duty black ops that is 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.720
 alpha 3 on these two games I tested 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:29.310
 by force , the beach is poorly installed first 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:33.840
 often who would stand well and be blue 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.040
 the stains in the picture are better than me 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.930
 Well, the picture is now normal, but 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.520
 The problem is that not glovach and falls in 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.399
 what is the problem I can not understand 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.000
 for starters, I will try to change cards 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.040
 in places 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.170
 because we are not only confused with this 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.860
 cards is my original card all 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.320
 earned 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.930
 Now I want to put this card to the card 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.670
 monitor it must be put on top because 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.850
 what is slot main top slot 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.860
 basic this extra and want 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.860
 see what the result will tell 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.630
 In general, I had to suffer a little 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.870
 I did not move the cards 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.890
 rearranged the whole bleach discovered that on 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.280
 low resolutions 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.319
 or does not fall and do not brake 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.870
 reinstalled the driver put the beta 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.709
 driver just in case reinstalled 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.900
 monitor driver let it work 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.390
 works fine 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.819
 vps good doctrines ended pretty 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.390
 fast on the power supply fan became 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.370
 got to connected 2 cards 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.760
 the fan earned rotates quickly and 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:47.680
 almost no noise is heard 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.799
 hear it from the processor just goes i 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.150
 watched yu tuba video send 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.440
 manufacturers have offered to deliver 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.569
 here in the third slot one more card but not 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.019
 connect it by force just put 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.620
 card 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.640
 have fun dagu told in 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.440
 my case should put a dangerous and 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.410
 pleasure dick you pretty funny 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.549
 but still I will put it as if I am not me 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.430
 began to become a little bit 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.739
 because I have cables here for 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.390
 connect yuzbi they there a little 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.079
 get in the way and how would it take quite 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.049
 much time i think about an hour u 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.750
 it will take me to install these cards 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.930
 I do n't want to do much yet, but I 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.549
 I think somewhere on the weekend I kind of 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.470
 I'll take this issue and see what 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.209
 preferential because they explained 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.200
 what a lot of advantages well how am I 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:44.560
 I guess some technologies will be 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.450
 be processed by a weak card but we put 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.959
 look there all the technology on this 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.480
 I have put the map and look 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:57.690
 what advantages the installation will give are weak 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.690
 how are things so far
