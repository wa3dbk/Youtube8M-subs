00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
from bull 0 that it'll charge a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.220 
from bull 0 that it'll charge a
cellphone<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> two<00:00:18.240> hours<00:00:18.660> like<00:00:19.080> an

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
cellphone in one to two hours like an

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.300 
cellphone in one to two hours like an
iPhone<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:20.670> what<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> did<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.710> let<00:00:22.710> my<00:00:22.859> iPhone

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
get really low and I'm actually gonna

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.160 
get really low and I'm actually gonna
throw<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> Sun<00:00:26.340> today<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
throw this out here in the Sun today and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.620 
throw this out here in the Sun today and
see<00:00:28.170> how<00:00:28.289> long<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.619> takes<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.920> charge<00:00:29.480> kind<00:00:30.480> of

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
see how long it takes to charge kind of

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.400 
see how long it takes to charge kind of
get<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> real<00:00:31.050> real<00:00:31.980> review<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.640> how<00:00:33.149> long<00:00:33.410> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
get a real real review of how long and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.840 
get a real real review of how long and
then<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> think<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:34.950> I'll<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.190> after<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.640> is

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.299 

charge<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.180> also<00:00:40.020> from<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> Sun<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> says<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
charge this also from the Sun it says it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.330 
charge this also from the Sun it says it
takes<00:00:41.520> 3<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.879> 4<00:00:42.180> hours<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.980> supposed

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
takes 3 to 4 hours now this is supposed

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.860 
takes 3 to 4 hours now this is supposed
to<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.520> able<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> charge<00:00:45.030> an<00:00:45.180> iPhone<00:00:45.270> two<00:00:45.719> or

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
to be able to charge an iPhone two or

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
to be able to charge an iPhone two or
three<00:00:46.050> times<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.829> pretty<00:00:47.039> neat<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.610> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
three times which is pretty neat if you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
three times which is pretty neat if you
were<00:00:48.140> out<00:00:49.140> somewhere<00:00:49.500> where<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> didn't<00:00:50.039> have

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
were out somewhere where you didn't have

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.709 
were out somewhere where you didn't have
power<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.350> I'm<00:00:52.350> gonna<00:00:52.530> hook<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
power so I'm gonna hook this up and

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.119 
power so I'm gonna hook this up and
check<00:00:54.719> back<00:00:54.930> periodically<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.829> how<00:00:55.949> long

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
check back periodically and see how long

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.910 
check back periodically and see how long
it<00:00:56.280> takes<00:00:56.489> I'll<00:00:56.699> start<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.420> clock<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.890> how

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it takes I'll start a clock and see how

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.400 
it takes I'll start a clock and see how
long<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> actually<00:00:59.309> takes<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> setup<00:01:01.170> is

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
long it actually takes so the setup is

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.850 
long it actually takes so the setup is
pretty<00:01:01.710> simple<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.879> comes<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
pretty simple it actually comes with a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
pretty simple it actually comes with a
USB<00:01:04.860> cable<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.119> had<00:01:06.299> only<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:09.290> cigarette

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
USB cable and if I had only a cigarette

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
USB cable and if I had only a cigarette
lighter<00:01:10.530> charger<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:11.369> iPhone<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.670> could

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
lighter charger for my iPhone I could

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
lighter charger for my iPhone I could
actually<00:01:12.090> plug<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> plug<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> into

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
actually plug this in and plug it into

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.070 
actually plug this in and plug it into
here<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.850> beauty<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.659> use<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
here but the beauty is I can use the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.859 
here but the beauty is I can use the
iPhone<00:01:16.560> plug-in<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.060> plug<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.630> into

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I've got this thing fully exposed to the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.499 
I've got this thing fully exposed to the
Sun<00:01:29.960> actually<00:01:30.960> I'll<00:01:31.200> set<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.439> right<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.770> here

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
Sun actually I'll set it right up here

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
Sun actually I'll set it right up here
and<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.350> warm<00:01:34.650> today<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.100> probably

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and it's a it's warm today it's probably

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.999 
and it's a it's warm today it's probably
80<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.090> gonna<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.750> hundred<00:01:37.009> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
80 it's gonna get up to a hundred so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.640 
80 it's gonna get up to a hundred so
we're<00:01:38.130> gonna<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.369> plenty<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.700> sunshine<00:01:39.650> so

we're gonna have plenty of sunshine so

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.780 
we're gonna have plenty of sunshine so
I'll<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> see<00:01:41.159> how<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.460> works<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:44.070> this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
I'll get to see how this works so this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.179 
I'll get to see how this works so this
is<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.060> first<00:01:45.270> time<00:01:45.509> using<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.990> by<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.170> way<00:01:47.869> so

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
is my first time using it by the way so

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.469 
is my first time using it by the way so
looks<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.490> turned<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.850> pretty<00:01:51.180> quick

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
looks like it turned on pretty quick

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.649 
looks like it turned on pretty quick
there<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.460> does<00:01:53.670> show<00:01:53.880> charging<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.509> just

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
there and it does show charging I'm just

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.469 
there and it does show charging I'm just
gonna<00:01:54.750> put<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:54.990> out<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:56.000> Sun<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.240> shade

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
gonna put it out of the Sun in the shade

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.109 
gonna put it out of the Sun in the shade
there<00:01:57.920> but<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> looks<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.490> uh<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.030> up

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
there but it looks like it's uh it's up

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.709 
there but it looks like it's uh it's up
and<00:02:00.270> running

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
and running

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.989 
and running
so<00:02:02.229> I'm<00:02:02.350> starting<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.740> clock<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.219> I'll<00:02:03.369> check

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
so I'm starting the clock and I'll check
