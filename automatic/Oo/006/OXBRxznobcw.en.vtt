00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.580
 the design looks a bit old-fashioned but 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.560
 This is the latest model in tablets 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.000
 small windows hello, how are you? 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.770
 vanessa hand orellana for cinema in 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.440
 Spanish and today I have the first 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.870
 look at the tablet although 8 of toshiba 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.789
 in aspect it has nothing new 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.190
 appears to be aluminum but in 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.350
 reality is plastic silver with 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.140
 Curved edges and texture to improve the 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.329
 grip is thick and feels heavy for 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.280
 make a mini tablet weighs almost what 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.810
 same as an ipad was the buttons of 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.790
 volume at the start are not very 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.040
 raised and difficult to find without 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.440
 flip to see has ports for micro 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.280
 usb micro atx e-mail and slot for 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.190
 microsd card the screen measures 8.1 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.829
 inches and has a resolution of 1280 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.899
 x 800 pixels the colors look clear 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.850
 but I almost went blind trying to 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.340
 read the small text the front camera 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.770
 is 2 megapixels for your calls in 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.649
 video and the main camera that does not have 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.539
 flash is 8 megapixels my only complaint 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.320
 is that the colors look a bit opaque 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.390
 but not 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.159
 if it is for the camera or the screen 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.740
 what makes them look like this has the system 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.810
 operative windows 8.1 that has improved 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.060
 a lot compared to the more versions 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.440
 old but still depends a lot on 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.780
 the desktop interface 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.510
 if you want to install programs or change 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.520
 of language on a laptop with mouse and 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.680
 keyboard does not matter that much but in a 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.020
 small tablet without keyboard accessory 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.060
 or tactile mattress is very 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.400
 uncomfortable trying to select files 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.680
 and closing windows comes with a 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.020
 quad-core fast processor atom 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.660
 of intel and does not delay in opening apps and 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.340
 load video games the battery has a 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.800
 good performance to make device 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.570
 windows and lasted a little over 8 hours 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.210
 of video continues the good thing about this 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.950
 tablet with windows 8.1 is that you can 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.890
 install your favorite programs of 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.259
 windows like word or excel the bad thing is that 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.690
 they use a lot of space and you can 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.090
 do not have enough you can buy a 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.240
 tablet and work with 32 gigabytes of 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.269
 storage for 330 dollars or that of 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.100
 64 gigabytes for 400 dollars 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.930
 if you want to download more programs 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.129
 windows you can add up 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.750
 64 gigs more with a microsd card 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.700
 conclusion if you want windows programs 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.159
 on your mobile device is worth the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.769
 worth considering but if what you're looking for is 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.959
 a mini tablet there are other options 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.319
 most attractive and cheap in the market 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.639
 like the kindle dx or the nexus 7 am 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.829
 vanessa hand orellana for cinema in 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:37.450
 Spanish and this has been your first look
