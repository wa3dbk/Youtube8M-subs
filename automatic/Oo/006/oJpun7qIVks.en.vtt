00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
with you as you can see on the 25th of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
with you as you can see on the 25th of
June<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:55.020> almost<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.219> two<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.579> them

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
June they almost there was two of them

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.439 
June they almost there was two of them
actually<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.539> went<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.050> under<00:00:58.350> 150<00:00:59.039> K<00:00:59.460> coins

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
actually that went for under 150 K coins

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.700 
actually that went for under 150 K coins
which<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.530> bizarre

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
which is really really bizarre

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.070 
which is really really bizarre
especially<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> same<00:01:02.640> day<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.780> far<00:01:04.049> as

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
especially on the same day but as far as

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.690 
especially on the same day but as far as
the<00:01:04.350> trend<00:01:04.619> goes<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:05.010> seem<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.430> staying

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the trend goes they seem to be staying

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.359 
the trend goes they seem to be staying
the<00:01:05.820> same<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> ps3<00:01:07.049> though<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.680> seems<00:01:08.189> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the same on the ps3 though it seems that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.710 
the same on the ps3 though it seems that
some<00:01:08.580> people<00:01:08.610> are<00:01:08.909> buying<00:01:09.119> him<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> little

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
some people are buying him for a little

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.990 
some people are buying him for a little
more<00:01:09.869> than<00:01:09.990> he's<00:01:10.140> worth<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.650> his<00:01:11.460> price<00:01:11.760> seems

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
more than he's worth and his price seems

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
more than he's worth and his price seems
to<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.150> rising<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.530> reckon

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to be rising a little bit and I reckon

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.679 
to be rising a little bit and I reckon
it<00:01:14.189> will<00:01:14.250> rise<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:14.760> bit<00:01:15.000> more<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.479> least

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it will rise a little bit more at least

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.770 
it will rise a little bit more at least
they're<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> same<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.610> day's<00:01:17.850> goes<00:01:18.119> goes<00:01:18.509> on

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
they're the same as a day's goes goes on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
they're the same as a day's goes goes on
because<00:01:19.110> he'll<00:01:19.229> become<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.680> rare<00:01:19.890> rare<00:01:20.280> as

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
because he'll become more rare rare as

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.090 
because he'll become more rare rare as
time<00:01:20.640> goes<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.180> it'll<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.229> interesting<00:01:22.380> it'll

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
time goes so it'll be interesting it'll

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.399 
time goes so it'll be interesting it'll
be<00:01:23.189> interesting<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.790> how<00:01:24.210> he<00:01:24.240> whether<00:01:25.200> he

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
be interesting to see how he whether he

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.810 
be interesting to see how he whether he
becomes<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.860> expensive<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.729> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
becomes more expensive or not but you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
becomes more expensive or not but you
guys<00:01:26.909> keep<00:01:27.119> an<00:01:27.270> eye<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.470> come<00:01:28.770> to

in-game stat and those are really really
nice<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:33.360> 90<00:01:33.869> ball<00:01:34.200> control<00:01:34.560> nineteen

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
nice that's 90 ball control nineteen

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.840 
nice that's 90 ball control nineteen
nine<00:01:35.909> crossing<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.920> 97

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
nine crossing I think that is and 97

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.569 
nine crossing I think that is and 97
finishing<00:01:39.650> 92<00:01:40.650> dribbling<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.130> mean<00:01:41.280> he's<00:01:41.400> got

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
finishing 92 dribbling I mean he's got

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.060 
finishing 92 dribbling I mean he's got
some<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:42.150> solid<00:01:42.420> stats<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.979> of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
some really solid stats there but of

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.530 
some really solid stats there but of
course<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> big<00:01:44.790> things<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.390> know

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
course the big things that we all know

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.480 
course the big things that we all know
Walcott<00:01:45.960> 4<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.259> his<00:01:46.409> pace<00:01:46.649> there's<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
Walcott 4 is his pace there's a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.130 
Walcott 4 is his pace there's a
three-star<00:01:48.149> weak<00:01:48.329> foot<00:01:48.540> which<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.840> huge

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
three-star weak foot which is a huge

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.499 
three-star weak foot which is a huge
disappointment<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.460> makes<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
disappointment but that makes a but the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.240 
disappointment but that makes a but the
four-star<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.200> skills<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:52.890> doesn't<00:01:53.189> make

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
four-star and skills really doesn't make

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.240 
four-star and skills really doesn't make
up<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.149> take<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> look<00:01:54.420> at<00:01:54.600> their<00:01:54.720> 99

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
up for it but take a look at their 99

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.819 
up for it but take a look at their 99
acceleration<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.750> 99<00:01:57.750> sprint<00:01:58.320> speed<00:01:58.530> so

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
acceleration and 99 sprint speed so

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.999 
acceleration and 99 sprint speed so
you're<00:01:59.040> thinking<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.640> now<00:01:59.869> holy<00:02:00.869> crap<00:02:01.680> he

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
pitch he's really agile he's got

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.559 
pitch he's really agile he's got
incredible<00:02:07.619> pace<00:02:07.879> all<00:02:08.879> you've<00:02:09.060> got<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.330> do<00:02:09.420> is

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
incredible pace all you've got to do is

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.150 
incredible pace all you've got to do is
just<00:02:09.599> bomb<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.050> down<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> wings<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:11.039> be

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
just bomb it down the wings and to be

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.380 
just bomb it down the wings and to be
honest<00:02:11.400> with<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:11.790> what<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.030> tried<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
honest with you that's what I tried to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.460 
honest with you that's what I tried to
use<00:02:12.629> him<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:12.930> but

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
use him with but

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.950 
use him with but
have<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.950> admit<00:02:14.220> guys<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.700> could<00:02:15.180> honestly<00:02:15.480> name

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
have to admit guys I could honestly name

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.100 
have to admit guys I could honestly name
about<00:02:16.260> 20<00:02:16.830> faster<00:02:17.460> players<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:18.000> him<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.900> some

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
about 20 faster players in him for some

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.990 
about 20 faster players in him for some
reason<00:02:19.440> he<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.650> doesn't<00:02:20.250> feel<00:02:20.430> fast<00:02:20.760> at<00:02:20.910> all

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
reason he just doesn't feel fast at all

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
reason he just doesn't feel fast at all
and<00:02:21.210> take<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> look<00:02:21.660> at<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.900> for<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> chip<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
and take a look at that for a chip the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.770 
and take a look at that for a chip the
keeper<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:23.370> obviously<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.060> wanting<00:02:24.480> salt

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
keeper was obviously just wanting salt

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.360 
keeper was obviously just wanting salt
as<00:02:24.930> he<00:02:25.080> watched<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:25.890> go<00:02:26.040> over<00:02:26.130> his<00:02:26.340> head

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
as he watched that just go over his head

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.880 
as he watched that just go over his head
that<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.690> shameful<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.320> keeper<00:02:28.710> but

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that is just shameful for the keeper but

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.040 
that is just shameful for the keeper but
and<00:02:29.130> yeah<00:02:30.060> he's<00:02:30.270> actually<00:02:30.450> he's<00:02:30.690> actually<00:02:30.810> got

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
and yeah he's actually he's actually got

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.870 
and yeah he's actually he's actually got
really<00:02:31.620> really<00:02:32.100> good<00:02:32.280> finishing<00:02:32.730> that's

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
really really good finishing that's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.000 
really really good finishing that's
probably<00:02:33.150> his<00:02:33.300> strongest<00:02:33.870> thing<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:34.470> me<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
probably his strongest thing for me you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.050 
probably his strongest thing for me you
know<00:02:35.100> don't<00:02:35.340> get<00:02:35.460> me<00:02:35.550> wrong<00:02:35.580> he's<00:02:35.880> got<00:02:36.030> a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
know don't get me wrong he's got a

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.430 
know don't get me wrong he's got a
pretty<00:02:36.540> good<00:02:36.720> shot<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> little<00:02:37.350> bit

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
pretty good shot it's a little bit

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.840 
pretty good shot it's a little bit
inconsistent<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.190> be<00:02:38.280> honest<00:02:38.520> with<00:02:38.610> you

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
inconsistent to be honest with you

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.730 
inconsistent to be honest with you
but<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.510> biggest<00:02:39.870> letdown<00:02:40.230> for<00:02:40.260> me<00:02:40.470> maybe

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
but the biggest letdown for me maybe

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.830 
but the biggest letdown for me maybe
it's<00:02:40.830> because<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.340> was<00:02:41.370> expecting<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.150> much<00:02:42.330> but

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
it's because I was expecting so much but

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.570 
it's because I was expecting so much but
for<00:02:43.020> me<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.140> was<00:02:43.380> honestly<00:02:43.740> expecting<00:02:43.980> him<00:02:44.550> to

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
for me I was honestly expecting him to

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.940 
for me I was honestly expecting him to
feel<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> lot<00:02:45.300> quicker<00:02:45.510> than<00:02:45.690> he<00:02:45.900> does<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.830> know

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
feel a lot quicker than he does you know

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.890 
feel a lot quicker than he does you know
that's<00:02:47.130> his<00:02:47.280> big<00:02:47.550> trait<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.000> know<00:02:48.120> he's<00:02:48.870> a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that's his big trait you know he's a

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.380 
that's his big trait you know he's a
speedster<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.860> for<00:02:50.220> me<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:50.790> he<00:02:50.970> gets<00:02:51.120> past

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
speedster and for me like he gets past

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.600 
speedster and for me like he gets past
players<00:02:51.690> pretty<00:02:51.990> well<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.560> don't<00:02:53.459> get

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
players pretty well you know don't get

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.270 
players pretty well you know don't get
me<00:02:53.670> wrong<00:02:53.820> at<00:02:54.150> all<00:02:54.270> he<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:54.990> fast<00:02:55.320> but<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.130> what

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
me wrong at all he is fast but for what

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.250 
me wrong at all he is fast but for what
is<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.670> say<00:02:56.940> he<00:02:57.180> just<00:02:57.360> doesn't<00:02:57.750> get<00:02:57.900> away<00:02:58.140> he

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
is that say he just doesn't get away he

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.230 
is that say he just doesn't get away he
doesn't<00:02:58.560> accelerate<00:02:58.890> nearly<00:02:59.370> as<00:02:59.459> fast<00:02:59.700> that's

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
doesn't accelerate nearly as fast that's

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.699 
doesn't accelerate nearly as fast that's
usually<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.660> biggest<00:03:01.020> issue<00:03:01.170> with<00:03:01.380> players

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
usually the biggest issue with players

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.610 
usually the biggest issue with players
is<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:03.209> know<00:03:03.330> they<00:03:03.510> they<00:03:04.470> have

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
is that and you know they they have

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.750 
is that and you know they they have
really<00:03:04.830> good<00:03:04.920> sprint<00:03:05.250> speed<00:03:05.459> but<00:03:05.640> their

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
really good sprint speed but their

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.340 
really good sprint speed but their
acceleration<00:03:06.390> could<00:03:06.540> be<00:03:06.660> really<00:03:06.900> slow<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.140> it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
acceleration could be really slow so it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.930 
acceleration could be really slow so it
takes<00:03:07.500> him<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.650> long<00:03:07.890> time<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.220> get<00:03:08.520> up<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.790> their

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
takes him a long time to get up to their

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.000 
takes him a long time to get up to their
top<00:03:09.240> speed<00:03:09.390> but<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.140> mean<00:03:10.380> he's<00:03:10.530> got<00:03:10.680> 99

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
top speed but I mean he's got 99

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.560 
top speed but I mean he's got 99
acceleration<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:11.850> he<00:03:12.000> should<00:03:12.180> be<00:03:12.209> getting<00:03:12.510> up

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
acceleration so he should be getting up

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.570 
acceleration so he should be getting up
there<00:03:12.750> pretty<00:03:12.990> quick<00:03:13.260> but<00:03:13.770> unfortunately<00:03:14.400> he

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
there pretty quick but unfortunately he

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.970 
there pretty quick but unfortunately he
doesn't<00:03:14.940> feel<00:03:15.060> fast<00:03:15.330> at<00:03:15.540> all<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.810> know<00:03:15.980> this

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
doesn't feel fast at all you know this

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.560 
doesn't feel fast at all you know this
might<00:03:17.250> be<00:03:17.370> really<00:03:17.610> controversial<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.360> don't

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
might be really controversial I don't

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.940 
might be really controversial I don't
know<00:03:18.630> about<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.900> guys<00:03:19.019> but<00:03:19.260> I'd<00:03:19.530> honestly

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
know about you guys but I'd honestly

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.570 
know about you guys but I'd honestly
prefer<00:03:20.190> Lennon<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.120> Walker<00:03:21.769> it's<00:03:22.769> just<00:03:23.040> maybe

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
prefer Lennon to Walker it's just maybe

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.949 
prefer Lennon to Walker it's just maybe
it's<00:03:23.790> because<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.180> way<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.330> play<00:03:24.660> or<00:03:24.720> whatever

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it's because the way I play or whatever

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.920 
it's because the way I play or whatever
but<00:03:25.170> he<00:03:25.980> just<00:03:26.160> doesn't<00:03:26.340> feel<00:03:26.580> fast<00:03:26.880> at<00:03:27.060> all<00:03:27.180> if

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
but he just doesn't feel fast at all if

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.420 
but he just doesn't feel fast at all if
you<00:03:28.080> want<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.380> use<00:03:28.500> Walcott<00:03:28.920> when<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.100> highly

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
you want to use Walcott when I highly

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.040 
you want to use Walcott when I highly
recommend<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.030> way<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.660> should<00:03:30.900> be

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
recommend the way you you should be

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.350 
recommend the way you you should be
using<00:03:31.230> them<00:03:31.440> is<00:03:31.590> simply<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.580> bomb<00:03:32.970> down<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
using them is simply to bomb down the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.000 
using them is simply to bomb down the
wings<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.780> cross<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.769> fair

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
wings and cross it in and to be fair

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.170 
wings and cross it in and to be fair
that<00:03:35.070> was<00:03:35.310> probably<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.640> nicest<00:03:35.820> goal<00:03:36.150> I

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
that was probably the nicest goal I

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.790 
that was probably the nicest goal I
scored<00:03:36.330> with<00:03:36.690> him<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:36.989> fact<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.530> was<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.769> first

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
scored with him in fact it was the first

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.100 
scored with him in fact it was the first
goal<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.310> scored<00:03:38.489> with<00:03:38.790> him<00:03:39.000> an<00:03:39.630> absolute

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
goal I scored with him an absolute

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.720 
goal I scored with him an absolute
rocket<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.680> went<00:03:40.860> straight<00:03:41.280> down<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.580> middle

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
rocket it went straight down the middle

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.100 
rocket it went straight down the middle
of<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.940> goal<00:03:42.090> as<00:03:42.239> well<00:03:42.360> but<00:03:42.750> like<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:42.900> was

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
of the goal as well but like I was

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.240 
of the goal as well but like I was
saying<00:03:43.170> his<00:03:43.440> shot<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.769> really<00:03:43.920> quite

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
saying his shot is really quite

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.460 
saying his shot is really quite
inconsistent<00:03:44.580> but<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.989> really<00:03:46.170> want<00:03:46.410> to

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
inconsistent but if you really want to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.530 
inconsistent but if you really want to
use<00:03:46.620> Walcott<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.160> his<00:03:47.250> maximum<00:03:47.820> effectiveness

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
use Walcott to his maximum effectiveness

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.960 
use Walcott to his maximum effectiveness
I<00:03:48.870> suppose<00:03:49.230> bomb<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.280> down<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.580> winger<00:03:50.820> make

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
I suppose bomb it down the winger make

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.900 
I suppose bomb it down the winger make
sure<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.209> have<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.330> tall<00:03:51.660> player<00:03:52.170> like<00:03:52.500> maybe

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
sure you have a tall player like maybe

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.550 
sure you have a tall player like maybe
Gomez<00:03:53.910> ziget<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.660> know<00:03:54.780> people<00:03:55.140> like<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.290> or

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
Gomez ziget you know people like that or

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.990 
Gomez ziget you know people like that or
something<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.310> make<00:03:56.580> sure<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:56.820> have

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
something and just make sure you have

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.370 
something and just make sure you have
him<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.420> middle<00:03:57.630> because<00:03:57.750> that's

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
him in the middle because that's

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.110 
him in the middle because that's
probably<00:03:58.560> where<00:03:58.830> Walcott<00:03:59.250> most<00:03:59.670> effective

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
probably where Walcott most effective

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.789 
probably where Walcott most effective
now<00:04:00.269> for<00:04:00.510> me<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.630> cut<00:04:00.989> inside<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.350> lot<00:04:01.530> just<00:04:01.709> to

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
now for me I cut inside a lot just to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
use him to his best abilities bomb it

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.590 
use him to his best abilities bomb it
down<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.340> wings<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.760> crossing<00:04:09.330> him

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
player in fact he is

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.270 
player in fact he is
very<00:04:27.300> fast<00:04:27.539> but<00:04:28.080> there<00:04:28.229> are<00:04:28.380> far<00:04:28.650> faster<00:04:29.130> out

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
very fast but there are far faster out

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.090 
very fast but there are far faster out
players<00:04:29.610> out<00:04:29.850> there<00:04:29.880> with<00:04:30.600> were<00:04:31.560> stats<00:04:31.889> than

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
him which really quite confused me to be

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.969 
him which really quite confused me to be
honest<00:04:34.110> with<00:04:34.199> you<00:04:34.320> but<00:04:34.500> that's<00:04:34.560> just<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.860> way
