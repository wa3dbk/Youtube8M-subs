the ability is going to be torrent

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.199 
the ability is going to be torrent
because<00:03:27.880> this<00:03:28.209> is<00:03:28.420> an<00:03:29.310> offensively<00:03:30.310> based<00:03:30.640> set

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209

coverage now the last move slot you can
either<00:04:23.890> use<00:04:24.070> aqua<00:04:24.340> jet<00:04:24.820> for<00:04:25.150> stab<00:04:25.780> prior

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
either use aqua jet for stab prior

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.650 
either use aqua jet for stab prior
or<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.380> can<00:04:27.530> use<00:04:27.650> Brick<00:04:27.980> Break<00:04:28.010> as

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
or you can use Brick Break as

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.420 
or you can use Brick Break as
fighting-type<00:04:29.660> moves<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.530> water<00:04:30.890> type<00:04:31.160> moves

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
fighting-type moves and water type moves

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.210 
fighting-type moves and water type moves
all<00:04:31.850> Sobers<00:04:32.540> up<00:04:32.720> provide<00:04:33.110> decent<00:04:33.770> type

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
all Sobers up provide decent type

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.410 
all Sobers up provide decent type
coverage<00:04:34.670> so<00:04:34.970> overall<00:04:35.930> if<00:04:36.380> you<00:04:36.710> have<00:04:37.420> water

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
coverage so overall if you have water

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.900 
coverage so overall if you have water
fighting<00:04:39.220> drown<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.460> ice<00:04:40.930> moves<00:04:42.010> then<00:04:43.010> it's

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
fighting drown and ice moves then it's

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.610 
fighting drown and ice moves then it's
gonna<00:04:44.210> be<00:04:44.420> pretty<00:04:44.630> much<00:04:44.750> impossible<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:46.450> have

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
gonna be pretty much impossible to have

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.160 
gonna be pretty much impossible to have
one<00:04:48.620> move<00:04:48.920> that<00:04:49.400> doesn't<00:04:50.240> hit<00:04:50.420> for<00:04:50.660> at<00:04:50.870> least

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
one move that doesn't hit for at least

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.720 
one move that doesn't hit for at least
neutral<00:04:51.920> damage<00:04:52.670> so<00:04:53.240> I<00:04:54.010> personally<00:04:55.010> like<00:04:55.460> this

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
neutral damage so I personally like this

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.320 
neutral damage so I personally like this
set<00:04:56.090> here<00:04:57.010> but<00:04:58.010> it's<00:04:58.220> up<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:58.730> again<00:04:59.120> like

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
set here but it's up to you again like

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.450 
set here but it's up to you again like

combo<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.240> have<00:05:02.630> priority<00:05:03.320> then<00:05:03.500> it's<00:05:03.650> up<00:05:03.830> to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
combo and have priority then it's up to

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.450 
combo and have priority then it's up to
you<00:05:04.190> or<00:05:04.430> if<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:05.420> want<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:05.810> have<00:05:06.440> even<00:05:07.280> better

you or if you want to have even better

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.690 
you or if you want to have even better
type<00:05:08.030> coverage<00:05:08.540> then<00:05:09.140> you<00:05:09.950> can<00:05:10.190> opt-out

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
type coverage then you can opt-out

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.170
