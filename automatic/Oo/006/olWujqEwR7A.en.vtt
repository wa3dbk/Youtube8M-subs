 use of any annoying plastic 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:28.619
 of course there is an instruction 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.410
 some kind of advertising paper device 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.650
 that in itself is naturally the most 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.200
 the main thing as well 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.140
 standard headphones i think they don't 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.430
 the best in the world and of course 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.250
 so simple 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.640

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.290
 the device will first remove the baby 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.770

 systems 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.520
 own design there is

 let's start with the video here is standard 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.480
 files and video on this screen 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.880
 certainly very good but a big one 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.530
 the flaw which is naturally obvious 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.120
 the screen is very small too 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.650
 listening to music then everything is perfect 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.250
 the sound is good the player is very comfortable and 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.010
