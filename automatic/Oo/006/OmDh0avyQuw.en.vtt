00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.900
 né in its 50 meters in its 100 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.640

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.140

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.140
 So come on, do not talk again. 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.099
 really expected - it's that way 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.859
 But everybody, everyone here knows. 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.720
 I think this is very cool so 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.209
 This is what makes me happier. 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.549
 My darling, I could trade with him. 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.519
 that I spent I received so much in exchange 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.519
 I would not have gone that far if I had not. 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.280
 had you know what makes it all worth the 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.200
 and they're people I'm going to take my 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.940
 heart forever 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.400
 is a very important moment of swimming 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.480
 but these palms were the most special 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.200
 of your life for sure because symptoms 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.829
 full of affection you know is not only pro for 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.109
 water for speed by the Senate 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.689
 I think it's a 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.610
 randy blair witch who knows even with 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:32.590
 she 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:36.250
 but it is not a recognition of this 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:41.319
 Friends, you know, a kind affection is explained. 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:44.590
 very big really spent the bad ones 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:47.319
 Moments my life, swimming is very 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.969
 strong is a life right I do not know why 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.219
 Flavia without swimming I'll find out 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:54.009
 right now 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:57.819
 gives a medley and at the same time a super 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:00.639
 The excitement of starting over is 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.139
 strength that comes with me forever this 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.449
 Descent is still in love, it's just you. 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.000
 could give a message though the swimmer 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.490
 young people coming around, we see 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.800
 in its category né alexandre quintão 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.409
 another arm and may not want you to 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.360
 can give the female swimming is that he 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.310
 need both an athlete to take the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.180
 name of Brazilian swimming at levels 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.310
 times higher 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:26.050
 It's the same thing that was starting with 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.789
 My brother, he's a gentleman, a lonely kiss. 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.500
 with that other day about the sport that 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.370
 represents for you 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.610
 he started now to compete handbike knows 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.440
 which is difficult the categories are has until 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.990
 the building categorization was 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.879
 starting mine is not independent of 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.120
 things happen things that people do 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:49.870
 unjust fairness with difficulties or 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.520
 Win a prize is not the medal 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.000
 You have to find the things that 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.990
 really make your heart is to want 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.690
 make it worth it here and there 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.450
 You can politically win things. 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.600
 lose move on and devote 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.190
 a form about human is something that 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.510
 Up ahead I was not our look 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.190
 everything that I did 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.040
 regardless of what you took from 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.820
 material therein is going to have been worth 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.500
 Too bad you'll have learned to 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.000
 know and value what is important 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.980
 for you and is able to take full 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.090
 you investigate the circumstance that goes 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.860
 take forever 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.390
 then a message for the girls who 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.250
 times they have more difficulty grasping 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.180
 to a sport the competition that is a 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:39.990
 naturally masculine force understood 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:42.000
 What can I do for a woman? 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.620
 female you can be cool you can 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.410
 be good at the same time be very 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.280
 that has an objective ambition 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.870
 big and all at the same time you do not 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.600
 It must be something or another feeling 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.000
 become a man to be a great swimmer 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.460
 a great player and many times 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.150
 girls stop by for a career 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:06.060
 Because of that the girl wants to talk 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:09.300
 It's cute, but it's wanessa. 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.840
 It's very cool, we have it here. 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.419
 price and in this case, congratulations and good 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.370
 luck and everything she said is worth it 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:20.930
 any profession in the world, right? 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.930
 no doubt this is the question is this
