I'm going to see where water gets in if

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.479 
I'm going to see where water gets in if
any<00:00:46.590> water<00:00:46.800> gets<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.280> see

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
any water gets in it so as you can see

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.950 
any water gets in it so as you can see
the<00:00:51.090> ports<00:00:51.480> are<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.530> closed<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.960> they

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the ports are all closed up like they

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.760 
the ports are all closed up like they
should<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.199> his<00:00:55.949> back<00:00:56.250> flap<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.770> closed

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
should be his back flap here is closed

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:08.570 
should be his back flap here is closed
up<00:00:59.010> and<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:06.950> no<00:01:07.950> water<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.460> in

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
up and and and no water can get in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.560 
up and and and no water can get in
through<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> front<00:01:08.939> because<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
through the front because there's a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660 
through the front because there's a
screen<00:01:09.930> protector<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:11.040> comes<00:01:11.520> with

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
screen protector on it that comes with

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.450 
screen protector on it that comes with
the<00:01:11.790> case<00:01:11.939> that's<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> case<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.250> no<00:01:14.250> water

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the case that's on the case and no water

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039 
the case that's on the case and no water
can<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.760> through<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.150> camera<00:01:15.420> hole<00:01:15.659> because

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
can get through the camera hole because

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
can get through the camera hole because
the<00:01:16.229> same<00:01:16.439> screen<00:01:16.710> protector<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.430> goes<00:01:18.270> up

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the same screen protector here goes up

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.480 
the same screen protector here goes up
into<00:01:18.659> there<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.380> probably<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> only<00:01:20.250> place

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
into there so probably the only place

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.249 
into there so probably the only place
will<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.729> water<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.689> guessing<00:01:21.990> we'll<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
will get water I'm guessing we'll get a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.499 
will get water I'm guessing we'll get a
lock<00:01:22.470> through<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.159> through<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:24.060> camera

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
lock through here through the camera

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.429 
lock through here through the camera
because<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.470> don't<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.710> how<00:01:25.890> um<00:01:27.140> good<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.290> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
because I don't know how um good that is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.100 
because I don't know how um good that is
at<00:01:28.560> keeping<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:28.920> water<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.900> probably<00:01:30.900> down

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
at keeping out water and probably down

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.780 
at keeping out water and probably down
there<00:01:31.140> through<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.590> bottom<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.610> what<00:01:32.700> I'm

all<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.940> water<00:02:45.420> here<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.620> all<00:02:46.980> from<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
all this water here is all from the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.460 
all this water here is all from the
port's<00:02:47.820> down<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.240> bottom<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:51.230> did<00:02:52.230> keep

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
port's down on the bottom so did keep

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.920 
port's down on the bottom so did keep
that<00:02:52.620> water<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:55.110> top<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:57.360> water<00:02:57.570> got<00:02:57.780> in

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
that water on the top the water got in

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.180 
that water on the top the water got in
through<00:02:58.860> anywhere<00:02:59.450> not<00:03:00.450> even<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.900> back<00:03:01.770> flap

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
through anywhere not even the back flap

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.820 
through anywhere not even the back flap
on<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.400> back<00:03:02.640> here<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:04.290> I'd<00:03:04.380> probably<00:03:04.560> give<00:03:04.800> it

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
on the back here so I'd probably give it

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.890 
on the back here so I'd probably give it
a<00:03:05.100> seven<00:03:05.460> out<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.760> ten<00:03:05.880> on<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.720> water

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
a seven out of ten on the water

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.840 
a seven out of ten on the water
resistance<00:03:07.410> test<00:03:07.680> because<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.490> did<00:03:08.670> keep

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
resistance test because it did keep

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.270 
resistance test because it did keep
water<00:03:09.090> out<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.300> most<00:03:09.960> ports<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.760> these<00:03:11.760> ports

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
water out of most ports and these ports

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.500 
water out of most ports and these ports
on<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.520> bottom<00:03:14.820> here<00:03:16.970> usually<00:03:17.970> probably

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
on the bottom here usually probably

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.990 
on the bottom here usually probably
wouldn't<00:03:19.200> get<00:03:19.620> as<00:03:19.830> much<00:03:20.010> water<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.610> them<00:03:20.790> as

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
wouldn't get as much water in them as

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.810 
wouldn't get as much water in them as
they<00:03:21.240> did<00:03:21.450> because<00:03:21.740> all<00:03:22.740> I<00:03:22.800> had<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.160> go<00:03:23.640> into

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
they did because all I had to go into

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.120 
they did because all I had to go into
when<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.660> was<00:03:24.780> doing<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.080> tests<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.710> our<00:03:25.800> demo

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
when I was doing the tests and our demo

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.700 
when I was doing the tests and our demo
here<00:03:26.430> was<00:03:27.150> all<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.450> had<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.720> go<00:03:27.840> into<00:03:27.990> was<00:03:28.380> its

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
here was all it had to go into was its

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.449 
here was all it had to go into was its
case<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.990> if<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.170> real<00:03:31.350> ipod<00:03:31.740> was<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.130> have

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
case and if a real ipod was in it have

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.000 
case and if a real ipod was in it have
more<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.300> keep<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.200> up<00:03:34.290> against<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.560> edges<00:03:34.890> so

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
more to keep it up against the edges so

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.860 
more to keep it up against the edges so
I<00:03:35.040> don't<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:35.550> as<00:03:35.760> much<00:03:35.790> water<00:03:36.270> would<00:03:36.570> get<00:03:36.750> in

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
I don't think as much water would get in

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.010 
I don't think as much water would get in
but<00:03:37.770> still<00:03:38.190> some<00:03:38.520> water<00:03:38.730> would<00:03:39.270> get<00:03:39.510> in<00:03:39.630> as<00:03:39.840> we

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
but still some water would get in as we

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.250 
but still some water would get in as we
see<00:03:40.230> here<00:03:40.550> so<00:03:41.550> like<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.300> said<00:03:42.360> seven<00:03:42.900> out<00:03:42.990> of<00:03:43.020> ten

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
see here so like I said seven out of ten

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.170 
see here so like I said seven out of ten
water<00:03:44.250> resistance<00:03:44.730> test<00:03:45.000> um<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.590> other<00:03:47.430> neat

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
water resistance test um and other neat

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.770 
water resistance test um and other neat
little<00:03:48.360> thing<00:03:49.250> if<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.730> case<00:03:50.970> you

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
little thing if you have this case you

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.730 
little thing if you have this case you
just<00:03:51.840> watching<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.320> video<00:03:52.500> if<00:03:52.560> you're

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
just watching the video if you're

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.280 
just watching the video if you're
thinking<00:03:52.890> about<00:03:53.040> buying<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.550> case<00:03:53.790> and

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
thinking about buying this case and

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.840 
thinking about buying this case and
you're<00:03:55.290> concerned<00:03:55.620> about<00:03:55.890> this<00:03:56.010> camera<00:03:56.640> flop

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
you're concerned about this camera flop

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.430 
you're concerned about this camera flop
here<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.300> you're<00:03:57.870> thinking<00:03:58.230> they're<00:03:58.350> going

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
here and you're thinking they're going

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.940 
here and you're thinking they're going
to<00:03:58.620> have<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.910> hold<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.150> camera<00:04:00.420> flap<00:04:00.950> back

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
to have to hold the camera flap back

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.310 
to have to hold the camera flap back
when<00:04:02.550> you're<00:04:02.670> taking<00:04:02.820> video<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.989> actually

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
when you're taking video you actually

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.460 
when you're taking video you actually
don't<00:04:04.440> have<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.860> there's<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:05.970> little<00:04:09.140> like<00:04:10.140> nub

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
don't have to there's a little like nub

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.330 
don't have to there's a little like nub
there<00:04:10.709> on<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.920> back<00:04:11.100> right<00:04:12.060> there<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.020> that

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
there on the back right there and that

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.539 
there on the back right there and that
little<00:04:14.340> nub<00:04:14.640> goes<00:04:14.940> into<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:17.040> hole<00:04:17.250> right

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
little nub goes into the hole right

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.470 
little nub goes into the hole right
there

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.930 

it<00:04:23.050> works<00:04:23.230> better<00:04:23.380> when<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.740> device<00:04:24.640> that's

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
it works better when the device that's

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.180 
it works better when the device that's
the<00:04:25.060> in<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.270> but<00:04:25.530> when<00:04:26.530> it's<00:04:26.680> actually<00:04:26.830> on<00:04:27.040> your

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
the in it but when it's actually on your

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.830 
the in it but when it's actually on your
device<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.730> little<00:04:27.970> hole<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.450> can<00:04:28.600> put<00:04:28.750> the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
device that little hole you can put the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.990 
device that little hole you can put the
nub<00:04:28.990> in<00:04:29.110> there<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.860> will<00:04:29.950> hold<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.400> out<00:04:30.730> of

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
nub in there that will hold it out of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.200 
nub in there that will hold it out of
the<00:04:31.060> way<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.240> your<00:04:31.300> camera<00:04:31.510> just<00:04:32.940> on<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.000> side
