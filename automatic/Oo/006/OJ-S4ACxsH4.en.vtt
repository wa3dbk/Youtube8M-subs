00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.320 

I<00:00:02.530> think<00:00:03.430> with<00:00:03.520> the<00:00:03.610> gaming<00:00:03.940> thing<00:00:04.150> you<00:00:04.240> might

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.330 
I think with the gaming thing you might

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.389 
I think with the gaming thing you might
have<00:00:04.480> had<00:00:04.690> the<00:00:04.990> last<00:00:05.200> week<00:00:05.500> I<00:00:05.800> decided<00:00:06.130> that

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:06.399 
have had the last week I decided that

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:07.680 
have had the last week I decided that
today<00:00:06.730> I'm<00:00:06.940> going<00:00:07.060> to<00:00:07.150> talk<00:00:07.270> about<00:00:07.390> time

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:07.690 
today I'm going to talk about time

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.799 
today I'm going to talk about time
management<00:00:08.020> games<00:00:08.559> I<00:00:08.889> don't<00:00:09.730> play<00:00:09.940> them<00:00:10.150> tons

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
management games I don't play them tons

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.230 
management games I don't play them tons
upon<00:00:11.110> tons<00:00:11.170> because<00:00:11.980> there's<00:00:12.549> usually<00:00:12.789> a<00:00:13.030> very

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
upon tons because there's usually a very

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.820 
upon tons because there's usually a very
limited<00:00:13.420> amount<00:00:13.869> of<00:00:13.930> time<00:00:14.110> you<00:00:14.289> can<00:00:14.350> play<00:00:14.619> them

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
limited amount of time you can play them

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.140 
limited amount of time you can play them
because<00:00:15.070> they<00:00:15.400> have<00:00:15.490> limited<00:00:15.789> amount<00:00:16.059> of

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
because they have limited amount of

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.140 
because they have limited amount of
levels<00:00:16.330> but<00:00:17.289> that's<00:00:17.650> sometimes<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.760> reason

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
levels but that's sometimes the reason

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.540 
levels but that's sometimes the reason
why<00:00:19.330> I<00:00:19.390> like<00:00:19.570> to<00:00:19.750> play<00:00:19.930> them<00:00:20.110> because<00:00:20.560> there's

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
why I like to play them because there's

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.640 
why I like to play them because there's
only<00:00:21.850> so<00:00:22.180> many<00:00:22.270> levels<00:00:22.540> and<00:00:22.960> when<00:00:23.380> you're<00:00:23.500> done

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
only so many levels and when you're done

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.280 
only so many levels and when you're done
you're<00:00:24.190> done<00:00:24.220> I<00:00:24.640> mean<00:00:25.000> you<00:00:25.090> can<00:00:25.240> replay<00:00:25.570> it<00:00:25.600> but

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
you're done I mean you can replay it but

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.430 
you're done I mean you can replay it but
I<00:00:26.610> really<00:00:27.610> don't<00:00:27.880> free<00:00:28.270> play<00:00:28.510> games<00:00:28.780> unless<00:00:29.230> I

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
I really don't free play games unless I

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.519 
I really don't free play games unless I
really<00:00:30.160> really<00:00:31.060> really<00:00:31.450> liked<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:32.050> gameplay

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
although my memory is not exactly the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.469 
although my memory is not exactly the
best<00:00:46.890> other<00:00:47.890> than<00:00:48.159> that<00:00:48.339> there's<00:00:48.640> plantasia

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
best other than that there's plantasia

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.719 
best other than that there's plantasia
if<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.379> same<00:00:50.589> color<00:00:50.890> plants<00:00:51.249> next<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.640> each

know you can carry four items just just

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.660 
know you can carry four items just just
because<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:48.980> learned<00:02:49.220> how<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.430> balance

because like you learned how to balance

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.460 
because like you learned how to balance
them<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.090> your<00:02:50.270> arm<00:02:50.450> or<00:02:50.630> something<00:02:51.080> I'm<00:02:51.290> like

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
you don't know that is something you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.680 
you don't know that is something you
could<00:02:54.050> learn<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.590> guess<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.850> makes<00:02:56.510> more

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
could learn I guess but it makes more

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.690 
could learn I guess but it makes more
sense<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.990> have<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.230> tray<00:02:57.590> or<00:02:57.830> have<00:02:58.250> magical

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
sense to have a tray or have magical

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.729 
sense to have a tray or have magical
powers<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:59.540> think<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.750> one<00:02:59.930> product<00:03:00.380> is<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
powers I think a one product is the

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.970 
powers I think a one product is the
build<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.130> lot<00:03:01.310> franchise<00:03:02.320> build<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.380> lot<00:03:03.560> one
