00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
much ground to separate guys apart

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.480 
much ground to separate guys apart
should<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.350> pulled<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> shot<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.220> I

live<00:02:47.510> but<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.810> think<00:02:48.050> two<00:02:48.260> more<00:02:48.440> players<00:02:48.650> had

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
live but I think two more players had

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.860 
live but I think two more players had
just<00:02:49.190> spawned<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.849> when<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.510> pull<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
just spawned and when you pull to the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.300 
just spawned and when you pull to the
back<00:02:50.959> door<00:02:51.349> of<00:02:51.500> their<00:02:51.650> camping<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.190> they're

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
back door of their camping and they're

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.030 
back door of their camping and they're
building<00:02:52.730> like<00:02:53.000> most<00:02:53.209> players<00:02:53.480> are<00:02:53.780> on<00:02:54.040> you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
building like most players are on you

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.559 
building like most players are on you
can<00:02:55.220> pull<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.640> get<00:02:55.760> out<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.150> they<00:02:56.180> really

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
can pull and get out and they really

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.570 
can pull and get out and they really
don't<00:02:56.599> have<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.870> line<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.440> sight<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.129> you<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:58.459> it

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
don't have a line of sight on you so it

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.850 
don't have a line of sight on you so it
makes<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.819> little<00:02:58.940> bit<00:02:59.150> easier<00:02:59.330> I'm<00:03:00.200> right<00:03:00.739> now

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
I'm still trying to get around this bus

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.150 
I'm still trying to get around this bus

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
the front door i probably should have

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.580 
the front door i probably should have
pulled<00:04:22.340> to<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.520> back<00:04:22.729> like<00:04:22.940> i<00:04:22.970> did<00:04:23.240> before

pulled to the back like i did before

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.950 
pulled to the back like i did before
however<00:04:24.590> i<00:04:25.010> did<00:04:25.099> allow<00:04:25.639> my<00:04:26.180> teammate<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.750> just

however i did allow my teammate to just
walk<00:04:27.169> up<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:27.560> door<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:27.740> pull<00:04:28.010> it<00:04:28.039> which<00:04:28.280> is

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
walk up to the door and pull it which is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.629 
walk up to the door and pull it which is
huge<00:04:28.990> every<00:04:29.990> pool<00:04:30.229> matters<00:04:30.680> especially<00:04:31.310> in

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
huge every pool matters especially in

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.440 
huge every pool matters especially in
that<00:04:31.729> situation<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:33.430> if<00:04:34.430> we<00:04:34.550> get<00:04:34.760> this<00:04:34.940> cap<00:04:35.240> we

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
that situation and if we get this cap we

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.149 
that situation and if we get this cap we
do<00:04:35.599> take<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.930> lead<00:04:36.110> we're<00:04:36.590> down<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:36.950> under<00:04:37.130> a

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
getting that pool if they do attempted

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.749 
getting that pool if they do attempted
and<00:05:01.479> they<00:05:02.479> did<00:05:02.720> pool<00:05:03.250> all<00:05:04.250> right<00:05:04.370> so<00:05:04.639> we

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
and they did pool all right so we

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:05.980 
and they did pool all right so we
dropped<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.120> two<00:05:05.270> guys<00:05:05.449> we're<00:05:05.720> trying<00:05:05.900> to
