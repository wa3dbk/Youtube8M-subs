 new era games games for playstation 3 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.050
 playstation 4 and xbox the year in media 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.050
 digital 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.609
 Let's go here with another video for the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.240
 channel and a new series will begin. 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.730
 on here 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.070
 minecraft the best game modes this 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.260
 series may or may not avenge much 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.210
 how you will receive the first video 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.430
 many registrants asked me to do 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.010
 this series mainly after I 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.030
 I started to make molds here then without 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.000
 more curling 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.850
 we love craft the best ways of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.040
 and start with odd simply 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.680
 that allows you to access the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.320
 internet inside the game you can enter 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.489
 on any website until adults are 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.410
 switched on 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.329
 just remembering that the description has a 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.340
 link from a video of a guy who teaches 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.530
 install follows what he does what he 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.570
 Speak that you will not have beauty mistake 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.489
 then after you have a mode 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.180
 installed you will have to create a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.020
 16-by- 9 screen the way you are going 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020
 see now 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.810
 when you finish it will be like this 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.640
 remembering that you also have to do 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.980
 a keyboard if you play in the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.720
 creative will be much easier now if 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.610
 you will create in normal mode 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.080
 Then you 'll have to see other videos. 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.940
 YouTube tutorials 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.130
 now when you're done, and you? 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.229
 right click on the screen 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.330
 it's going to turn white 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.220
 then you hold the left shift and 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.260
 with the right mouse button you give a 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.750
 click will appear a space for you 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.470
 enter the url of any site that 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.070
 want to 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.650
 Just remembering that you have to put 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.080
 http points and slash is bound 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.930
 beauty I even got into my face channel 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.450
 It's a great thing, you see your 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.880
 channel from within an old game 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.619
 movies and so on then it went ahead like 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.910
 I like the video that today is very 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:14.110
 It's really cool, too. 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.110
 my secondary channel 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.680
 I do not have here with another video like 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.709
 you see there is Naruto Shippuden 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.500
 I just did not and I also took a 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:37.580
 twitter, take advantage of the already there, follow me 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.959
 I liked it a lot more than that. 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.549
 imagining some things you can 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.400
 do with it you suddenly create a 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.130
 mega show with a stage and screens with 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.400
 very old youtube rotating videos 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.799
 Fuck man, let's go with the next and now. 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.780
 passing for another fantastic way and 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.840
 before talking like that is very crazy 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.459
 I want to say that the creator of the mod 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.380
 authorized to use by twitter passed me 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.019
 until the link to download then much 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.560
 thanks, another thing this template has pre 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.030
 alpha and he needs help 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.160
 complete this template then if you have 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.750
 conditions after you see the video there 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.700
 I think if you like I have 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.380
 conditions to help link for you have 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.200
 access to catar description website 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.810
 Beauty mod adds armor 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.320
 based on the face movie robots that 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.320
 Crazy 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.000
 turning into a robot is very crazy 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.010
 but does not stop there there is no 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.040
 moment you can turn into a 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:53.959
 ship with right up to sound effect in the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.760
 bottom left corner you see the 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.859
 How many miles of your ship is 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.900
 going and you can drop a turn too 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.900
 dude there you see the stuff goes crazy 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.260
 also have robots that turn into 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.950
 cars with good processing effects 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.950
 cool 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.420
 the law 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.020
 remembering that it is a pre alpha and of course 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.150
 that in the final version the cars will be 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.830
 improved and much more will enter 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.000
 So that's why I already helped 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.530
 dude I recommend 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.930
 If you liked it and I think it 's worth it. 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.110
 help link to his site is to 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.450
 beauty description and now passing to 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.730
 another epic mold called galaxy 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.770
 craft by the name you can already have an idea 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.360
 what it is about and if you think of 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.970
 space these things 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.150
 that's right this motto lets you travel 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.790
 to space planets and everything else create 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.010
 ships making nasa designs is one 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.290
 very fucking mess 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.910
 this mode is very complex to create all 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.160
 the things he needs for you 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.870
 taking off into space is something not 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.910
 very easy to do 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.220
 now if you have a creative mode already 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.440
 makes things easier but the 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.160
 focus here is to show this trip through 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.500
 space 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.840
 after you have created a docked base 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.120
 your there fuel rocket 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.520
 you can travel into space with 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.520
 right until countdown and everything 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.450
 and in space you have access to all 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.400
 old solar system you can see the 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.270
 planets if you double click on 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.280
 over them 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.130
 you have a zoom is a very thing 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.680
 It's cool and it's better than you see. 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.990
 To be able to visit guy you can be giving 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.730
 a leap the planets is a very thing 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.730
 Fuck yourself. 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.880
 the effect it makes when you skip a 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.770
 very cool thing and you can 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.560
 remake your base place your ship 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.630
 and visit other planets that are 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.940
