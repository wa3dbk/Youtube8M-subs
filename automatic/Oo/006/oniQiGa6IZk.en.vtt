00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.500
 what's happening alive today we're on the day 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.179
 35 that belly at home was in shape and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.859
 I wanted to give you tour my goal was to go up 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.630
 the way and practice more the combos of 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.010
 frizz is so I started to warm up I did 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.539
 a little bit of everything but it was already improving 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
 Then I started practicing the Congo 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.510
 day 34 is to do the halo combo 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:32.640
 elbow freeze in the end I did leave it 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.930
 filipe elbow to elbow without jailbreak and as 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.190
 I already had it cool so I decided to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.610
 add something else and I got to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.610
 to experience 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.289
 and there came the idea to change color 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.309
 another way look great but sometimes the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.309
 simple does not work 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.270
 they already have appeared is good 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.429
 after that I'm looking for another way 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.700
 to finish it and it occurred to me to download it to 6 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.700
 babies 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.580
 but as it cost a lot and neither is it 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.350
 it's cool for me to keep doing the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.910
 changes practice them and even because there 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.100
 two ways to change the elbow put in 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.990
 This elbow is strong and you go to the other or 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.030
 just change position if you 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.410
 I did everything by force, I fell 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.020
 have to combine a normal change in the 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.020
 site with then make the changes 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.020
 sliding 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.549
 and it came out to me like I had the painting 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.019
 It is quite loaded with the course 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.370
 practice them already hamas since it is something that 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.730
 they have never left me because they have not 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.730
 put to it 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.980
 but I saw that the base failed me so 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.510
 I started to practice some basic 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:55.519
 starting from the middle and click and click 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:57.650
 in and 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.390
 I noticed that when pulling hammers and 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.950
 legs went where he pleased and 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.569
 also this arm was coming down towards me 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.500
 instead of staying on top so 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.500
 I tried to correct that 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.510
 but at the end of everything it was already 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.549
 burst and also like I crunched 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.959
 abdominal will not be a given thing but a 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.970
 moisture very good roll so I decided 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.140
 stop and after all to stretch I ended up 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.609
 happy because I had taken one 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.170
 new way to nail the was not was 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.670
 handsome that of tracing and making changes 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.920
 so I think anything else until 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.040
 while we day 35 so see you 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.040
 morning
