00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.139 

another<00:00:00.450> way<00:00:00.659> of<00:00:00.690> looking<00:00:00.810> at<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:02.149> use

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
another way of looking at this is to use

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.410 
another way of looking at this is to use
electrolysis<00:00:04.609> here<00:00:05.609> are<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.790> pair<00:00:06.299> of

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
electrolysis here are a pair of

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.179 
electrolysis here are a pair of
electrodes<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.410> what<00:00:07.620> we're<00:00:07.740> going<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.919> do<00:00:08.069> is

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
electrodes and what we're going to do is

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.759 
electrodes and what we're going to do is
pass<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.820> current<00:00:09.210> remains<00:00:09.660> current<00:00:10.410> between

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
pass a current remains current between

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.570 
pass a current remains current between
these<00:00:11.190> electrodes<00:00:11.730> within<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.330> water<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.580> if

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
these electrodes within the water and if

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.760 
these electrodes within the water and if
we<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:14.910> place<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.450> electrodes<00:00:15.929> within<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
we just place the electrodes within the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.230 
we just place the electrodes within the
water<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.080> turn<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.970> first

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
water here and turn it on the first

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.849 
water here and turn it on the first
thing<00:00:21.390> you'll<00:00:21.510> see<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.840> lot<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.109> gases<00:00:22.619> being

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
thing you'll see is a lot of gases being

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.359 
thing you'll see is a lot of gases being
produced<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.970> tap<00:00:24.180> water<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:25.369> virtually

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
produced in the tap water and virtually

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.740 
produced in the tap water and virtually
nothing<00:00:26.580> happening<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.300> reverse<00:00:27.510> osmosis

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
nothing happening in the reverse osmosis

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.070 
nothing happening in the reverse osmosis
water<00:00:28.349> now<00:00:29.189> these<00:00:29.369> gases<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:30.119> hydrogen<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
water now these gases are hydrogen and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.540 
water now these gases are hydrogen and
oxygen<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.890> primary<00:00:32.700> components<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.300> water

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
oxygen the primary components of water

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.620 
oxygen the primary components of water
we<00:00:35.550> still<00:00:35.850> look<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> reverse<00:00:36.420> osmosis

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
we still look at the reverse osmosis

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.619 
we still look at the reverse osmosis
there's<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:38.160> little<00:00:38.489> reaction<00:00:39.000> occurring

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
there's very little reaction occurring

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.420 
there's very little reaction occurring
here<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.860> course<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.280> we're

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
here at all and of course what we're

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.180 
here at all and of course what we're
starting<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.440> big<00:00:43.440> color<00:00:43.770> change

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
starting to see is a big color change

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.869 
starting to see is a big color change
occurring<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.600> tap<00:00:45.809> water<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:46.260> well<00:00:46.879> we're

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
occurring in the tap water as well we're

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.130 
occurring in the tap water as well we're
also<00:00:48.030> seeing<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.450> lot<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> heat<00:00:48.899> being

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
also seeing a lot of heat being

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.860 
also seeing a lot of heat being
generated<00:00:49.850> now<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> big<00:00:51.149> difference<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
generated now the big difference here is

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.450 
generated now the big difference here is
everyone<00:00:52.199> assumes<00:00:52.559> water<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.309> good

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
everyone assumes water is a good

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.850 
everyone assumes water is a good
conductor<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.270> electricity<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:55.379> isn't

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
conductor of electricity it isn't

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.549 
conductor of electricity it isn't
actually<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.960> primary<00:00:57.960> difference<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
actually the primary difference is that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.830 
actually the primary difference is that
the<00:00:58.859> water<00:00:59.100> has<00:00:59.309> been<00:00:59.460> conducted<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.600> tap

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the water has been conducted in the tap

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
the water has been conducted in the tap
water<00:01:00.920> through<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> dissolved<00:01:02.789> solids

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
water through all the dissolved solids

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
water through all the dissolved solids
within<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.809> that's<00:01:04.290> why<00:01:04.500> we're<00:01:04.739> getting<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
within it and that's why we're getting a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.149 
within it and that's why we're getting a
very<00:01:05.159> strong<00:01:05.280> reaction<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> color<00:01:07.530> change<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
very strong reaction the color change is

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
very strong reaction the color change is
caused<00:01:08.490> by<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> precipitation<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
caused by the precipitation of the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.700 
caused by the precipitation of the
mineral<00:01:11.070> salts<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.970> metals<00:01:12.590> within<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
mineral salts and the metals within the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.830 
mineral salts and the metals within the
water<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.220> you'll<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.909> again<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
water and you'll see again on the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
water and you'll see again on the
reverse<00:01:16.110> osmosis<00:01:16.320> water<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.430> actually<00:01:17.670> no

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
reverse osmosis water but actually no

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.749 
reverse osmosis water but actually no
colour<00:01:18.180> change<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:21.630> color<00:01:21.840> changes<00:01:22.759> very

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
colour change the color changes very

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.300 
colour change the color changes very
obvious<00:01:24.299> now<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.990> heat<00:01:25.350> generated<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.100> well

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
obvious now the heat generated as well

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
obvious now the heat generated as well
it's<00:01:27.090> quite<00:01:27.479> clear<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.049> touch<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.560> it's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it's quite clear if I touch this it's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.760 
it's quite clear if I touch this it's
it's<00:01:29.340> now<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.549> hot<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.439> we're<00:01:31.590> seeing

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
it's now very hot now what we're seeing

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.020 
it's now very hot now what we're seeing
here<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.610> range<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.240> minerals<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.259> metals

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
here is a range of minerals and metals

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
analysis we know that there are a lot of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
analysis we know that there are a lot of
metals<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.380> actually<00:01:49.530> not<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.369> good<00:01:50.520> for

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
metals that are actually not so good for

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.270 
metals that are actually not so good for
our<00:01:50.790> health<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:51.149> all<00:01:51.390> they<00:01:52.380> include<00:01:52.740> aluminium

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
our health at all they include aluminium

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.020 
our health at all they include aluminium
and<00:01:53.700> barium<00:01:54.630> lead<00:01:55.340> there<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.490> some<00:01:56.700> iron

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and barium lead there is some iron

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.770 
and barium lead there is some iron
obviously<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:59.070> there's<00:01:59.549> good<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.149> bad<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
obviously so there's good and bad and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200 
obviously so there's good and bad and
the<00:02:01.469> real<00:02:01.649> issue<00:02:01.979> here<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.939> reverse

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the real issue here is that the reverse

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.690 
the real issue here is that the reverse
osmosis<00:02:03.420> system<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.290> able<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.680> take<00:02:04.890> virtually
