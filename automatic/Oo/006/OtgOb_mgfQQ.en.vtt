let me go ahead and cut this out on a

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.110 
let me go ahead and cut this out on a
screen<00:02:30.310> shot<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:33.130> difference<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.850> size

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
screen shot the difference in the size

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.700 
screen shot the difference in the size
of<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> bullet<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.200> bullet<00:02:35.440> pattern<00:02:35.680> I

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
of the bullet of the bullet pattern I

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.710 
of the bullet of the bullet pattern I
ignore<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.250> little<00:02:36.550> one<00:02:36.670> down<00:02:36.790> there<00:02:37.060> but<00:02:37.690> uh

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
ignore the little one down there but uh

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.050 
ignore the little one down there but uh
that's<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.470> reason<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.800> do<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.010> because<00:02:39.760> it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
that's the reason I do it because it
