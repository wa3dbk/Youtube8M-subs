00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.580
 very good to all boys and girls 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.590
 welcome once more to the channel today 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.290
 I bring a new gta 5 video online 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.960
 we are to version 1.17 and good guys 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.240
 today I bring you one of those rare paintings 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.700
 of those secret strange paintings good 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.710
 each one calls him as he wants not and what 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.360
 that I come to show you is how to do it 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.550
 it's worth it so once we're in the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.470
 workshop we are going to go to paintings and the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.140
 metallized let's look for the color that 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.300
 it's called purple chapter vale is going to be the 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.760
 first layer that we are going to put like this 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.850
 that we will click and we will put the purple 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.739
 chapter of agreement you can try with 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.739
 other colors if you want but good for 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.780
 if you want to get this painting 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.030
 You need to put it as I do 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.470
 say ok then once we have the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.680
 purple charter we're going to go to the market 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.449
 and the pearl will have to put the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.710
 color that you are going to see right now that is 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.170
 torino red red torino worth 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.390
 agreement is at number 15 on the list 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.700
 we will put the red finished in pearl 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.260
 and once we have that pearl 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.719
 we will simply have to fill in the 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.280
 car as you see I still have the 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.780
 lime green 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.240
 and that lime green color should be 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.579
 change it in secondary color 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.860
 so we will give the secondary heat 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.810
 we would go to metal and we will put 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.509
 again the same color that we used 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.259
 before that is the purple chapter voucher or 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.970
 however the number 69 is pronounced 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.159
 guys, it's worth keeping that in mind 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.720
 numbers 69 so good once what 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.030
 we have as you see guys we already have 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.399
 all the color car of one color is worth 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.500
 of our color so we only have left 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.020
 change the color of the tires that 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.060
 It has to be for guys I advise you 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 the truth that you put it as close 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.030
 to the color of the car 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.350
 or at least if it's not more like 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.659
 color that the car has at least 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.850
 that is the contrary that stands out 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.929
 very much for it to look like that 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.959
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:12.410
 this painting now you will see it with more 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.760
 clarity is valid and with different angles and 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.769

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.720
