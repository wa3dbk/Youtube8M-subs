impression tools from the shop very good

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.840 
impression tools from the shop very good
tools<00:00:21.650> obviously<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.220> practice<00:00:23.699> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
tools obviously you have to practice and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.109 
tools obviously you have to practice and
able<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:24.779> when<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.500> do

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
able to do that but when you do

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.450 
able to do that but when you do
impression<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.210> log<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.900> very<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.920> pleasing

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
impression a log is very very pleasing

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.130 
impression a log is very very pleasing
so<00:00:29.640> I'm<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> go<00:00:30.150> through<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> whole

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
so I'm going to go through the whole

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.139 
so I'm going to go through the whole
process<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.859> hopefully<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.790> look

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
process and hopefully I can do that look

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.319 
process and hopefully I can do that look
in<00:00:33.329> less<00:00:33.540> than<00:00:33.780> six<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.770> seven<00:00:35.100> minutes

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
in less than six or seven minutes

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.080 
in less than six or seven minutes
otherwise<00:00:36.329> nobody's<00:00:37.140> gonna<00:00:37.290> watch<00:00:37.530> that

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
otherwise nobody's gonna watch that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
otherwise nobody's gonna watch that
anyway<00:00:39.620> first<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.860> put<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.399> key<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.930> key

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
anyway first you put the key in a key

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:52.100 
anyway first you put the key in a key
border<00:00:44.660> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.899> foiling<00:00:48.469> surface<00:00:50.719> lose<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
border of the foiling surface lose and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.910 
border of the foiling surface lose and
clean<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.980> influence<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> put<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
clean for the influence so you put the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.349 
clean for the influence so you put the
key<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> lock<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.230> tickle<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
key in the lock and you tickle with it

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.729 
key in the lock and you tickle with it
now

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.140 

and<00:01:06.260> then<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.920> use<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.940> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and then you can use this one it's a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.430 
and then you can use this one it's a
very<00:01:09.180> good<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.550> magnifier<00:01:11.550> light<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:16.260> can

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
very good the magnifier light you can

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.359 
very good the magnifier light you can
actually<00:01:16.619> start<00:01:18.290> seeing<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.500> places<00:01:23.100> where

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
actually start seeing the places where

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:36.940 
actually start seeing the places where
you<00:01:23.820> need<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.210> cut<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:25.800> would<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.640> six<00:01:34.039> okay

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
you need to cut that would be a six okay

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.969 
you need to cut that would be a six okay
