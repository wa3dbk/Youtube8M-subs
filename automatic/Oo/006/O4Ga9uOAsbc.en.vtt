00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
the other thing you do is you could add

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.700 
the other thing you do is you could add
all<00:04:57.180> those<00:04:57.330> three<00:04:57.630> dice<00:04:57.810> together<00:04:58.260> into<00:04:58.620> the

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
all those three dice together into the

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
and that's basically zombie dice - so

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.940 
and that's basically zombie dice - so
summing<00:05:05.760> up<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.270> zombie<00:05:06.480> dice<00:05:06.840> -<00:05:07.260> double

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
summing up the zombie dice - double
