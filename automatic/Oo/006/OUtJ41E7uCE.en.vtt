00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
what will happen is that what we simply

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.580 
what will happen is that what we simply
want<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:24.380> get<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:26.390> DAC<00:01:27.390> DC<00:01:28.080> adapter

sizes<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.630> estimates<00:02:01.170> should<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:02.030> correct

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
sizes so the estimates should be correct

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.359 
sizes so the estimates should be correct
and<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.869> next<00:02:04.079> thing<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:05.070> have

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
and the next thing here is that you have

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.359 
and the next thing here is that you have
to<00:02:05.700> count<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> number<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.420> pots<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:07.770> USB<00:02:08.190> hub

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to count the number of pots this USB hub

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.089 
to count the number of pots this USB hub
itself<00:02:08.819> has<00:02:09.090> four<00:02:09.720> pots<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.560> all<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.009> to

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
itself has four pots so all you have to

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.580 
itself has four pots so all you have to
do<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> number<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.879> pots<00:02:12.120> times<00:02:12.540> 0.5

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
do is the number of pots times 0.5

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.050 
do is the number of pots times 0.5
and<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.980> amount<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.190> amperior<00:02:17.880> that

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
and that is the amount of amperior that

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.260 
and that is the amount of amperior that
the<00:02:19.130> power<00:02:20.130> adapter<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:21.060> so

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
the power adapter you have to have so

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.570 
the power adapter you have to have so
this<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.599> also<00:02:21.900> obligated<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.800> have<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.160> need<00:02:23.489> to

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
this is also obligated I have I need to

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.260 
this is also obligated I have I need to
have<00:02:23.730> two<00:02:24.000> amps<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.450> all<00:02:25.170> power<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.760> USB

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
have two amps and all power just for USB

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.259 
have two amps and all power just for USB
we<00:02:27.630> require<00:02:27.959> five<00:02:28.349> votes<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.190> for<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.880> you

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
we require five votes so for this you

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.470 
we require five votes so for this you
can<00:02:30.420> see<00:02:30.630> your<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.870> specification<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:32.480> that's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
can see your in specification you that's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.070 
can see your in specification you that's
basically<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.280> 5<00:02:35.760> volts<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.209> 2

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
basically it that is 5 volts and 2

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.670 
basically it that is 5 volts and 2
ampere<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.459> that's<00:02:39.180> all<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.440> and

so now I'm just going to show you just
quickly<00:03:22.859> a<00:03:23.519> video<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.420> how<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.780> works

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
quickly a video of how it works

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.550 
quickly a video of how it works
the<00:03:26.640> USB<00:03:27.000> hot<00:03:27.180> plugged<00:03:27.630> into<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.170> wall<00:03:28.200> and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the USB hot plugged into the wall and

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.670 
the USB hot plugged into the wall and
then<00:03:29.010> we<00:03:29.519> will<00:03:29.640> move<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:29.970> from<00:03:30.150> there<00:03:30.420> as<00:03:30.750> you

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
then we will move on from there as you

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.830 
then we will move on from there as you
can<00:03:31.799> see<00:03:31.890> here<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.519> light<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:33.030> powered<00:03:33.390> up<00:03:33.569> I

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
can see here the light is powered up I

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.380 
can see here the light is powered up I
just<00:03:34.350> popped<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.739> into<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.250> wall<00:03:35.459> sorry<00:03:36.000> that

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
just popped it into the wall sorry that

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.030 
just popped it into the wall sorry that
I<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.750> put<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.079> vertically<00:03:37.650> like<00:03:37.829> that

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
I have to put it vertically like that

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.940 
I have to put it vertically like that
because<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:39.390> wire<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.690> not<00:03:39.989> long<00:03:40.170> enough<00:03:40.200> so

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
because the wire is not long enough so

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.680 
because the wire is not long enough so
uh<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.430> can<00:03:41.489> see<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.790> power<00:03:42.000> here<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.359> should

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
uh you can see the power here I should

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.410 
uh you can see the power here I should
show<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.519> me<00:03:44.519> plugging<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.150> into<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.930> phone<00:03:47.420> to

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
show you me plugging it into a phone to

00:03:48.420 --> 00:04:06.580 
show you me plugging it into a phone to
show<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.720> how<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.709> works
