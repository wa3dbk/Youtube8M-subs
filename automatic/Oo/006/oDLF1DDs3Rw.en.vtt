00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.310 
picked this up from Target and it was
$9.99<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:32.969> sure<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.329> Ulta<00:00:33.600> has<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.050> if

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
$9.99 I'm not sure the Ulta has it if

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
$9.99 I'm not sure the Ulta has it if
they<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.190> will<00:00:35.250> link<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.820> hotel<00:00:36.239> link<00:00:36.420> below
