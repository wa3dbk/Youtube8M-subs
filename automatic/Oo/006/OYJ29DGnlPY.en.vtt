00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.100
 as you know the biological activity of the waters in the Bay of 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.390
 tokyo it's very pro 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.809
 so suppose a thick layer of oil come to cover the decline 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.030
 you realize the very serious threat that would then be based on 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.189
 our entire city karim m 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.989
 eh yes 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.989
 6 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.680
 then if it is not the liquid state it on face conditions it is common 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.240
 moves with the winds 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.150
 and what is more serious the heat helping there is evaporation 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.659
 it's from there 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.149
 when they mix with the extremely skeptical database 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.430
 the cities then of a spark so that the mixture ignites 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.899
 we will 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.099
 two fires caused during the summer but extremely toxic due 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.729
 to the combustion of plastics will not leave humiliating and hope 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.130
 all activities are then stopped the dead will be counted by 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.130
 million 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.340
 no military and police medical rescue organization what to do 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.769
 anything 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.930
 this situation will lead to more and more disasters more and more 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.930
 of pipeline rupture explosions is becoming more dead 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.039
 the result will be well bombard mans and a half 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:47.109
 will paralyze the entire nation millions of lives will be in danger what 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.389
 will be a disaster hiroshima city and nagasaki
