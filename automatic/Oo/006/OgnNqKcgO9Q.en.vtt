00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:32.540 
say right now and that is you cannot
judge<00:05:30.599> either<00:05:31.020> way<00:05:31.409> by<00:05:31.800> games<00:05:32.159> that<00:05:32.400> aren't

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
judge either way by games that aren't

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.040 
judge either way by games that aren't
even<00:05:32.789> running<00:05:33.000> on<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.330> hardware<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:33.990> that

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
even running on the hardware and that

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.249 
even running on the hardware and that
our<00:05:34.560> pre-alpha<00:05:35.009> builds<00:05:35.699> you<00:05:36.569> can't<00:05:36.900> judge

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
our pre-alpha builds you can't judge

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.140 
our pre-alpha builds you can't judge
what<00:05:37.680> systems<00:05:38.159> actually<00:05:38.400> gonna<00:05:38.639> have<00:05:38.879> better

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
what systems actually gonna have better

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.689 
what systems actually gonna have better
performance<00:05:39.479> because<00:05:40.139> of<00:05:40.379> that<00:05:40.699> it's

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
performance because of that it's

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.760 
performance because of that it's
ridiculous<00:05:42.539> I<00:05:42.719> cannot<00:05:43.020> believe<00:05:43.229> in<00:05:43.560> some<00:05:43.740> of

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
ridiculous I cannot believe in some of

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.589 
ridiculous I cannot believe in some of
the<00:05:43.889> people<00:05:44.099> I've<00:05:44.370> seen<00:05:44.580> making<00:05:45.000> videos<00:05:45.360> about

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
the people I've seen making videos about

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.679 
the people I've seen making videos about
this<00:05:45.960> I<00:05:46.139> know<00:05:46.560> no<00:05:47.189> better<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:48.210> I<00:05:48.240> don't<00:05:48.479> know<00:05:48.539> if

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:48.689 
this I know no better so I don't know if

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.170 
this I know no better so I don't know if
they're<00:05:48.839> just<00:05:49.110> trolling<00:05:49.560> or<00:05:50.129> they're<00:05:50.909> like

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
they're just trolling or they're like

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.029 
they're just trolling or they're like
you<00:05:51.389> know<00:05:51.509> they<00:05:51.689> really<00:05:51.960> like<00:05:52.289> Microsoft

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
you know they really like Microsoft

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.769 
you know they really like Microsoft
which<00:05:53.310> I<00:05:53.550> don't<00:05:53.819> think<00:05:54.210> that's<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.479> case

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
which I don't think that's the case

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:57.350 
which I don't think that's the case
because<00:05:55.080> I<00:05:55.289> know<00:05:55.669> that<00:05:56.669> these<00:05:56.759> people<00:05:57.000> don't

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
because I know that these people don't

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.629 
because I know that these people don't
but<00:05:58.349> really<00:05:58.770> you're<00:05:58.919> going<00:05:59.250> and<00:05:59.399> especially

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
but really you're going and especially

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.309 
but really you're going and especially
the<00:05:59.879> fact<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.300> they're<00:06:00.419> just<00:06:00.449> sports<00:06:00.990> games

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
the fact that they're just sports games

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.040 
the fact that they're just sports games
now<00:06:01.469> I<00:06:01.529> can<00:06:01.860> say<00:06:02.129> that<00:06:02.729> driveclub<00:06:03.089> only<00:06:03.689> ran<00:06:03.899> at

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
now I can say that driveclub only ran at

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.559 
now I can say that driveclub only ran at
