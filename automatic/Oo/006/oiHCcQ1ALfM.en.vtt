especially<00:00:02.760> when<00:00:02.939> your<00:00:03.060> magic<00:00:03.419> rubber<00:00:04.049> runs

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
especially when your magic rubber runs

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.459 
especially when your magic rubber runs
out<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.879> hits<00:00:06.589> then<00:00:07.589> you're<00:00:07.799> screwed<00:00:08.510> so<00:00:09.510> I'm

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
out of hits then you're screwed so I'm

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.440 
out of hits then you're screwed so I'm
not<00:00:10.620> going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.950> waste<00:00:11.190> my<00:00:11.340> warm<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:11.940> those<00:00:12.120> I'm

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
not going to waste my warm on those I'm

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.060 
not going to waste my warm on those I'm
just<00:00:12.780> going<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.170> make<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> jump<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.099> run<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.580> it

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:29.269 

I<00:00:18.099> think<00:00:19.089> that<00:00:19.210> might

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.369 

step<00:00:30.279> on<00:00:30.490> too<00:00:31.000> many<00:00:31.210> hits<00:00:31.480> I<00:00:31.630> think<00:00:31.929> anymore<00:00:32.140> on

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
step on too many hits I think anymore on

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.439 
step on too many hits I think anymore on
my<00:00:32.410> Warhammer<00:00:32.890> so<00:00:33.520> you<00:00:33.579> need<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.850> go<00:00:34.000> here<00:00:34.270> and

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
my Warhammer so you need to go here and

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.930 
my Warhammer so you need to go here and
flip<00:00:34.629> a<00:00:34.690> switch

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.560 

outrun<00:00:38.940> them

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
outrun them

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.300 
outrun them
and<00:00:40.840> as<00:00:41.260> soon<00:00:41.410> as<00:00:41.500> you're<00:00:41.680> here<00:00:41.890> you're<00:00:42.040> safe

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
and as soon as you're here you're safe

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.730 
and as soon as you're here you're safe
so<00:00:43.150> if<00:00:43.390> you<00:00:43.510> didn't<00:00:43.780> flip<00:00:43.990> the<00:00:44.140> switch

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
so if you didn't flip the switch

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.680 
so if you didn't flip the switch
you<00:00:45.250> couldn't<00:00:45.640> enter<00:00:45.970> here<00:00:46.240> and<00:00:46.270> then<00:00:46.570> you

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
you couldn't enter here and then you

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:55.710 
you couldn't enter here and then you
have<00:00:46.810> problem<00:00:53.490> so<00:00:54.490> there<00:00:54.760> are<00:00:55.000> some<00:00:55.210> arrows

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
have problem so there are some arrows

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.600 
have problem so there are some arrows
that<00:00:55.870> are<00:00:55.990> drawn<00:00:56.290> on<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:56.560> floor<00:00:56.860> and<00:00:57.310> you<00:00:57.400> need

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
that are drawn on the floor and you need

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.400 
that are drawn on the floor and you need
to<00:00:57.700> follow<00:00:57.910> them<00:00:58.150> exactly<00:00:58.300> because<00:00:59.170> otherwise

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
to follow them exactly because otherwise

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.810 
to follow them exactly because otherwise
you<00:00:59.620> will<00:00:59.710> be<00:00:59.800> teleported<00:01:00.160> by<00:01:00.610> those

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
you will be teleported by those

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.910 
you will be teleported by those
teleporters<00:01:01.510> again<00:01:01.840> back<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.590> where<00:01:02.770> we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
teleporters again back to where we

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.670 
teleporters again back to where we
started<00:01:02.950> over<00:01:03.489> there<00:01:05.310> so<00:01:06.310> now<00:01:06.910> let<00:01:07.150> don't

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
started over there so now let don't

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.840 
started over there so now let don't
follow<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:08.890> arrow<00:01:09.100> because<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.640> will<00:01:09.760> be

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
follow this arrow because you will be

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.120 
follow this arrow because you will be
teleported<00:01:10.120> so<00:01:10.870> flip<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.229> switch<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.750> now

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
teleported so flip the switch and now

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:24.600 
teleported so flip the switch and now
the<00:01:15.130> arrow<00:01:15.340> turns<00:01:20.790> oh<00:01:22.140> dammit<00:01:23.140> I<00:01:23.500> miss<00:01:24.160> one<00:01:24.400> I
