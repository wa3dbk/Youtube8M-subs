00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.190
 Welcome people to the new 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.799
 enns and with the base lutea three 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.599
 as the main actor 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.150
 we will get this device a bit 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.160
 look closer of course and 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.050
 look like the display is like that 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.090
 hardware is how fast it is 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.460
 if you have to relish then follow me 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.070
 Just like today I want you in 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:35.489
 this hands on ne the base lutea 3 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:38.290
 imagine that has a 4 3 inch display 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.629
 and quite fast on the way 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.239
 with a gigahertz by before processor 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.580
 The device runs very smoothly as you can 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.049
 I see that in the start screens 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.390
 have not done anything except wlan 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:51.610
 set and that's why we can 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.680
 The device is really quiet watching the bar 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.659
 you can pull down and wonderful 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.860
 I think that you really are up here 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.180
 anything can adjust 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.989
 from the wlan to bluetooth volume everything 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.280
 possible and the brightness you can 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.750
 I can really adjust everything 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.270
 now set to automatic 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.810
 then the dark settles when the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.310
 environment is a bit darker though 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.190
 the full brightness level is already in 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.650
 order to make the great display so 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.570
 i think it's a great display good 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.410
 able to see 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.090
 So we have a device that 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.240
 voter other has trained bluetooth 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.700
 and even nfc so you can do that too 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.860
 theoretically pay when you look at the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.620
 right bank has the device has android 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.030
 4.0 on it and that one can maybe 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.170
 already see a little bit 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.510
 that has an 8 megapixel camera and there 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.780
 we have the camera so you can 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.780
 really 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.870
 you can focus on the camera 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.540
 put 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.900
 the device has autofocus what is real 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.280
 A wonderful thing is and the pictures 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.780
 are really good 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.549
 Of course you can also do that here 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.960
 change camera function that is with 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.960
 change video camera 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.430
 the video camera has a hd 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.470
 resolution and a hd ready 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.050
 resolution and how to see the device 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.970
 has no buttons down here 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.550
 which appears in the display when you see it 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.680
 I think that's really great 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.690
 you can even serve them one can 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.450
 the applications call here 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.360
 that are currently active that means nice 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.120
 I can do multitasking here in the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.030
 to go in or here in the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.000
 Camera so that everything runs very smoothly 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.310
 and I already convince myself something 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.040
 also very good think that's a great 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.740
 father when i put the display 3 on the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.020
 start screen 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.220
 then the whole thing is spinning so no matter 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.250
 then where I go 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.890
 that's all then one side 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.420
 Ingenious thing widgets has the device 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.530
 Of course, a lot of great things 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.530
 live applications how to get on the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.540
 front screen can pull 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.120
 and there are many important ones 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.610
 things installed like the antivirus app 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.860
 very important nowadays that you are there 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.880
 nothing dangerous is caught 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.120
 So what can I say to that I can 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.280
 you still the price betrayed the device 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.610
 If you are so in the trade force 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.000
 199 euros or if you look at base 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.730
 buys or contract with 9 euros per month 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.310
 a few special features are also 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.300
 the 4 GB internal memory one 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.010
 can expand up to 32 gigabytes a 4 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.100
 gb memory card is also still in it 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.150
 means one has a total of eight gigabytes 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.180
 is not bad for one 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.130
 entry- level device in the price range and 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.370
 The device is also available in black 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.110
 So I find the back very valuable 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.650
 is a bit grouped here 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.630
 stylus 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.690
 so not really very good at that 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.570
 hand and it is even pretty easy 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.790
 that's the best of the three is a great one 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.910
 device I can only highly recommend 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.739
 And there is shop in every bed shop 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.239
 could have if you like the video 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.370
 he subscribe to none of course 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.810
 to miss more videos and then 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.810
 I would say until next time
