00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.649
 hello friends with you bonus decided 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.790
 make a video about the work on the balls on it 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.130
 absorbing cells 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.860
 grout mafey ultra color plus under 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.770
 any cell I pick my color 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.920
 grout in this case jasmine manhattan 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.840
 and brown proportions 2020 to one on 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.449
 Powerful grout condition will be darker 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.070
 tiles but also combined with it in 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.260
 bright state will be to optical 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.080
 merge with the film first stage 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.440
 kneading infusion stirring and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.790
 Job 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.450
 the result is the first stage and is roughly 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.690
 smeared went further that we are not not 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.450
 waiting for 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.700
 only she starts to dry on 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.680
 surface 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.559
 immediately rude sponge smear me 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.800
 the sponge does not wipe dry so the first 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.100
 movement do you have here is a widespread 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.770
 movement to remove the sound of excess moisture 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.010
 and then just stupidly smear grout 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:10.020
 in order to here these stratifications 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.540
 the grout was not remind every grout 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.810
 have their features of enemies 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.119
 tell me 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.500
 you are metro color plus on beech feature 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.420
 if i'm going to press a sponge and 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.670
 rip like honestly nothing at me 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.710
 good will not work 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.240
 there is a risk that was still in fear 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.159
 deeper and i don't need it like this 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.810
 way to smear and leaving 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.130
 Tile acquired here follows the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:56.350
 there is when the surface starts to dry 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:58.390
 further we are working manually while grouting 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.560
 on the surface the shock dries already 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:09.039
 some will start to grapple and we 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:12.509
 already the quality of the seam will be better further 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.509
 only hand seam 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.969
 I work without gloves so as not to 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.310
 distracted because already overexposed 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:26.430
 a little bit if the grout were going to start 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.549
 grab it then it may be too w 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.549
 u 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.640
 First of all we work with seams 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.849
 with seams if you have time you can like this 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.459
 times younger 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.909
 here is this patient 6 so he finally 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.689
 not hardened plaque tolerant palette 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:54.659
 color plus very viscous very sticky 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:58.400
 if we perederzhat this raid 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.400
 then will have very much into the rub off 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.590
 again basically we moisten the bloom 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:10.889
 smear it so that it does not stick to 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.909
 tile and do pre 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:21.389
 smoothing out the seams simply sponge 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:25.139
 nightmare the seams are getting crap than 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:30.180
 after a rough blurring foam read 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:34.169
 float rough seam formation to her very 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:41.819
 convenient to just manually it would be 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:46.310
 big with a float so smeared 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.310
 will find stitches 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:58.840
 after drying the tile again we 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:06.890
 we go to bed in a raid but further 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:10.150
 stretch it will be cleaned cleaner and walked 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.150
 put everything wet 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.639
 why very very squeezing grater sponge 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.880
 I do not use it because the quality is manual 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.180
 It turns out better I can assume that 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:37.389
 it depends on the quality of the grater itself 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.820
 from the quality of the grout, too, here you can see 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.500
 let's say 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.730
 after the grater was such a rough 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.300
 as the grout and shobla wipe cleanly 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.300
 so lightly 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.940
 somewhere if an influx is washed out manually 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:03.190
 to smooth down the noise but again it is not 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.000
 finally plowing it only 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.000
 previously 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:25.759
 Do not wipe with meter 15 device for 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:27.710
 miss gloves so comfortable reluctant hands 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.800
 traveling and will not have time especially as 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:36.080
 basically only dirt takes over 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:41.860
 squeezing grater that's roughly blurred like 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:44.509
 horrible seam hold sponge sponge elastic 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.580
 that is, if we have a sponge like a rag already 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:54.710
 becomes due to old age 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:57.110
 we assure take a new sponge dorchot 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.240
 the defect here is a knife here this blackness 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.240
 I'll add a ray of grout 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:16.759
 Be sure to start working with seams 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.860
 before shiva starts to clutch 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:22.739
 this grout is such that if the seams are already 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.369
 will start to grab and we will try 

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:33.029
 Well, take them out like this 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:37.080
 then the ball will be more rough so these 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:39.599
 transitions unknown when I continue here 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.659
 grout me for grabbing fresh 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:45.479
 tiled and otherwise tiles that started 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:49.740
 already blur so if I do not know 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:53.759
 when i come back and both deepen seam for 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:56.599
 that the subsequent grout does not have 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.599
 for a sharp drop 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.379
 previous 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:16.250
 so this deepening can be done 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:23.030
 as follows even we can 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:26.600
 brush deepen this way 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:29.590
 grout smoothly goes down and grout 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.910
 which will be a continuation of this grout 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.630
 between the new and old grout year 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.630
 smooth transition
