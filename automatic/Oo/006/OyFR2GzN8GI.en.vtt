or you guys can line them up and shoot
them<00:01:18.810> eight<00:01:19.020> times<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> bullets<00:01:20.100> go<00:01:20.250> Pat

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
them eight times so the bullets go Pat

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
them eight times so the bullets go Pat
like<00:01:20.610> through<00:01:20.880> each<00:01:20.970> other<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:21.990> a

collateral<00:01:22.350> damage<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.799> you're<00:01:22.920> pretty<00:01:23.159> much

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
collateral damage so you're pretty much

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
below with the groin so pretty much

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.960 
below with the groin so pretty much
below<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> beltline<00:01:32.040> shoot<00:01:32.670> them<00:01:32.790> eight

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
times in the leg and the knife them now

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.530 
times in the leg and the knife them now
assuming<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.579> guys<00:01:35.729> hit<00:01:35.909> them<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.210> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
assuming if you guys hit them all you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.230 
assuming if you guys hit them all you
guys<00:01:36.630> should<00:01:36.900> average<00:01:37.140> between<00:01:37.520> 1600<00:01:38.520> 1800

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
guys should average between 1600 1800

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.030 
guys should average between 1600 1800
points<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.290> hard<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> hit<00:01:40.799> every

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
points but it is very hard to hit every

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.510 
points but it is very hard to hit every
time<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.820> without<00:01:42.270> missing<00:01:42.600> once<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:42.960> twice<00:01:43.079> and

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
time I without missing once or twice and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.260 
time I without missing once or twice and
depending<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.610> how<00:01:44.670> many<00:01:44.790> times<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> miss

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
depending on how many times you miss

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
depending on how many times you miss
that<00:01:45.479> could<00:01:45.600> affect<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.899> points<00:01:46.290> value<00:01:46.500> but

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that could affect the points value but

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.020 
that could affect the points value but
you<00:01:47.220> guys<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:47.670> i'm<00:01:47.790> shooting

this<00:01:48.060> zombie<00:01:48.360> eight<00:01:48.509> times<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> leg<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.320> I'm

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
this zombie eight times the leg and I'm

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
this zombie eight times the leg and I'm
knifing<00:01:49.829> him<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.729> will<00:01:50.850> give<00:01:50.880> me<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
knifing him and that will give me a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.170 
knifing him and that will give me a
total<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.140> believe<00:01:52.460> 230<00:01:53.460> points<00:01:53.700> per<00:01:54.000> kill

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and times that by six and that is about

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.569 
and times that by six and that is about
1,200<00:01:57.659> points<00:01:57.810> i'm<00:01:58.079> assuming<00:01:58.290> i<00:01:58.590> got<00:01:59.159> 1,200
