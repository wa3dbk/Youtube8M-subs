00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:09.929
 Hello everyone, this is unpacking . 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.290
 set and drive a smartphone for a man though 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.480
 the box is very colorful so we'll see 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.730
 what's inside and inside us as always 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.460
 the smartphone itself which we set aside and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.000
 we'll see later 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.310
 instructions guarantee 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.519
 headset such a headset now 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.850
 let's see what this headset is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.700
 ordinary at first glance looks like a 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.460
 Chinese there is probably 2 yusb cable 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 very comfortable very comfortable losing one 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.489
 you have 2 yusb cable how often do you 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.129
 losing weight bukovele 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.379
 I never lost a carabiner too 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.660
 carabiner awesome cool robic 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.090
 on the site and it is written that people are 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.680
 sort of decorative carabiner you 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.469
 it is not used where used and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.719
 cards climbers and key small key on 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.510
 carabiner to open the back 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.930
 the cover and here is such garbage here this garbage 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.990
 strap don't know he needs a battery 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.770
 The battery here I will immediately say it seems like 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.470
 normal battery 2500 milliampere hours 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.990
 I do not know how many were keeping it all 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 only the first time I am boxing scrub 2 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.979
 rub 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.479
 never mind the first time I open the box 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.580
 Then I will make a separate review of this. 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.740
 smartphone and cruise times how long 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.159
 on this battery two thousand 500 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.549
 milliampere clock charger 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.530
 charger charger 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.229
 we do not know you can see there and so 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.220
 here the milliampere hours are shorter to charge 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.439
 he will be three days as a male phone 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 500 milliamper hours nightmare and spare 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.920
 caps with bolts in the hotel of course 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 plus this is just awesome plus 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.170
 because one hundred percent they will 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.840
 the first is spoiled at all well done 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.360
 class so stunned himself smartphone dai dai 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.580
 lokren give it back 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.860
 okay, he doesn't want to give them 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.010
 such a smartphone 4 inches display 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.810
 480 by 800 in my resolution below 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.390
 touch home menu keys back and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.220
 fuck unnecessary search below some more 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.770
 the hole that is highlighted when 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.310
 enabled smartphone external camera to 0 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.790
 3 megapixel speaker from this to 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.400
 microphone at the top we have a mount for 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.440
 carabiner power button and cap for 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.280
 headsets on the left we have this 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.280
 arc click schA Yasya swing volume 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.320
 below us is hidden under the cap 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.380
 cable micro usb connector shoved with 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.840
 we have no left side at all 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.360
 behind us supposedly 8 megapixel 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.010
 the camera I doubt very much 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.170
 be sure to check and fucking 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.870
 flashlights I already checked shines well 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.820
 so here is the back cover which 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.950
 opens only with a screwdriver 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.810
 Unscrewing these bolts 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.230
 let's take a carbine and unscrew 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.090
 bolts let's see what's under the cover from steeper 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.930
 here it is of course hemorrhoids where probably 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.269
 I cut the moment because the bolts 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.610
 twist off very demons though though it 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.920
 awesome decision is actually the most 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.989
 tight option but just not 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.970
 curled and on the most durable option 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.000
 close the lid here tighten the lid 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.950
 with such a fleshy see good 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.820
 plastic there probably can inside the metal 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.160
 So there is 1 slot inside 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.910
 micro SD card up to 32 gigabytes 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.100
 slot for a simple gsm standard card and 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.670
 a slot for a simple card with 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.519
 gsm standard but with support for 3g and all 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.410
 nothing else we do not have here in front 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.920
 here we are sticking on which 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:03.440
 strange hieroglyphs namely support 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.440
 two sim cards android 4 0 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.120
 ip 68 protection class is also cool 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.950
 like these 67 only 1 more i even 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.440
 I'm afraid to comment on this one here 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.870
 although it simply means water resistance and 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.510
 durability slight damage to the hammer 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.150
 and a battery for two thousand 500 milliamps 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.290
 hours for chico who enjoyed alpha 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.030
 r and highscreen boost 2nd floor garbage full 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.550
 I hope that it will work 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.350
 so much better than in the boost 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:39.620
 its 6 thousandth battery and so it was 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.960
 unboxing so set x-drive to see
