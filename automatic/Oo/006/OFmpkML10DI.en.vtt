turns out he's reading the Sun K diet it

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:29.289 
turns out he's reading the Sun K diet it
has<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:25.959> anyway<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.440> if<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.190> self<00:02:28.670> contract

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
has it anyway so if we self contract

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.729 
has it anyway so if we self contract
it's<00:02:29.540> like<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.660> dam<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.140> put<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.319> dam<00:02:30.560> on<00:02:30.709> a

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
it's like a dam you put a dam on a

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.590 
it's like a dam you put a dam on a
beautiful<00:02:31.340> tree<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:32.030> know<00:02:32.120> what<00:02:32.239> happens

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
beautiful tree you know what happens

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.590 
beautiful tree you know what happens
ultimately<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.260> every<00:02:33.530> damn<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:34.299> had<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.420> see

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
ultimately to every damn I had to see

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.810 
ultimately to every damn I had to see
this<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.870> finally<00:02:36.170> know<00:02:36.320> every<00:02:37.220> damn<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.640> put

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
this to finally know every damn you put

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.800 
this to finally know every damn you put
it<00:02:37.910> down<00:02:38.030> across<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.329> people<00:02:38.570> it's<00:02:38.690> in<00:02:38.750> a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
it down across the people it's in a

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.330 
it down across the people it's in a
really<00:02:39.049> going<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.829> down<00:02:40.010> here

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
really going on down here

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.819 
really going on down here
you<00:02:40.790> put<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> dam<00:02:41.269> across<00:02:41.480> what<00:02:41.870> happens<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.380> it

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
you put a dam across what happens is it

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.050 
you put a dam across what happens is it
will<00:02:42.980> borrow<00:02:43.250> hit<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:43.730> then<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:43.970> will

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
will borrow hit and then it will

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.330 
will borrow hit and then it will
eventually<00:02:44.269> rise<00:02:44.720> up<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:44.989> spill<00:02:45.290> over<00:02:45.320> but<00:02:46.100> it

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
eventually rise up and spill over but it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.000 
eventually rise up and spill over but it
loses<00:02:46.700> its<00:02:47.540> sediment<00:02:48.170> right<00:02:48.350> there<00:02:48.590> so

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
loses its sediment right there so

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.490 
loses its sediment right there so
eventually<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.640> seven<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.180> stacks<00:02:50.510> up<00:02:50.870> until

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
eventually the seven it stacks up until

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.470 
eventually the seven it stacks up until
the<00:02:51.590> sediment<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.220> even<00:02:52.730> with<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:52.910> top<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
the sediment is even with the top of the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.140 
the sediment is even with the top of the
dam<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.720> whole<00:02:54.140> thing<00:02:54.410> flows<00:02:54.650> right<00:02:54.890> over<00:02:55.150> so

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
dam the whole thing flows right over so

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.210 
dam the whole thing flows right over so
Hoover<00:02:56.359> Dam<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.109> thousand<00:02:57.620> years<00:02:57.829> the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
Hoover Dam in a thousand years the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.590 
Hoover Dam in a thousand years the
sediment<00:02:58.640> will<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:58.850> all<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.090> way<00:02:59.209> at<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.359> top

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
sediment will be all the way at the top

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.470 
sediment will be all the way at the top
and<00:02:59.870> it<00:03:00.380> will<00:03:00.440> flow<00:03:00.709> right<00:03:00.950> over<00:03:01.239> copies<00:03:02.239> every

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
and it will flow right over copies every

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.440 
and it will flow right over copies every
damn<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.350> that's<00:03:03.560> kind<00:03:03.859> of<00:03:03.890> like<00:03:04.070> diseased<00:03:05.030> ape

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
damn so that's kind of like diseased ape

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.590 
damn so that's kind of like diseased ape
when<00:03:06.079> that<00:03:06.260> gets<00:03:06.410> sediment<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.100> up<00:03:07.220> like<00:03:07.459> that

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
when that gets sediment it up like that

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.030 
when that gets sediment it up like that
the<00:03:08.600> universe<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.140> flow<00:03:09.470> vintage<00:03:09.769> is<00:03:09.859> not

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
the universe is flow vintage is not

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.420 
the universe is flow vintage is not
going<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.250> be<00:03:10.310> blocking<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:10.970> if<00:03:11.030> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
going to be blocking it so if you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.050 
going to be blocking it so if you
the<00:03:11.969> Duncan<00:03:12.500> whatever<00:03:13.500> toxic<00:03:13.859> ways<00:03:14.040> what<00:03:14.909> what

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the Duncan whatever toxic ways what what

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.390 
the Duncan whatever toxic ways what what
happened<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.569> is<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.870> toxic<00:03:16.560> waste<00:03:16.590> will

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
happened is is that toxic waste will

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
happened is is that toxic waste will
could<00:03:17.670> will<00:03:17.909> start<00:03:18.510> beating<00:03:18.780> something<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
could will start beating something and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.179 
could will start beating something and
it<00:03:21.420> will<00:03:21.540> feed<00:03:21.750> parasites<00:03:22.349> mold<00:03:22.709> yeast

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 
it will feed parasites mold yeast

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.509 
it will feed parasites mold yeast
bacteria<00:03:23.689> viruses<00:03:24.689> whatever<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:26.400> will

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
bacteria viruses whatever and that will

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.250 
bacteria viruses whatever and that will
show<00:03:26.670> up<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:26.939> say<00:03:27.209> at<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.420> liver<00:03:27.629> and<00:03:27.900> all<00:03:28.109> of<00:03:28.230> a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
show up in say at the liver and all of a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.379 
show up in say at the liver and all of a
sudden<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.560> liver<00:03:28.799> will<00:03:28.980> become<00:03:29.389> cirrhosis

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
sudden that liver will become cirrhosis

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.550 
sudden that liver will become cirrhosis
and<00:03:30.659> something<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> be<00:03:31.709> checking<00:03:31.950> out<00:03:33.290> if<00:03:34.290> we

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
and something to be checking out if we

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.589 
and something to be checking out if we
can<00:03:34.739> open<00:03:34.920> up<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.340> energy<00:03:35.760> system<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.359> things

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
can open up the energy system so things

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.119 
can open up the energy system so things
are<00:03:36.780> moving<00:03:37.200> then<00:03:37.409> we're<00:03:37.530> making<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.829> step<00:03:38.010> in

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
are moving then we're making a step in

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.679 
are moving then we're making a step in
the<00:03:38.189> right<00:03:38.340> direction<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.939> live<00:03:39.180> food<00:03:39.510> is

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
the right direction so live food is

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.330 
the right direction so live food is
really<00:03:39.930> powerful<00:03:40.079> because<00:03:40.409> it<00:03:40.650> has<00:03:40.739> water<00:03:41.040> in

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
really powerful because it has water in

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.789 
really powerful because it has water in
it<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.969> it's<00:03:42.090> opening<00:03:42.540> up<00:03:42.689> that<00:03:42.900> flow<00:03:43.319> that

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
it so it's opening up that flow that

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.619 
it so it's opening up that flow that
there's<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.159> more<00:03:44.370> flow<00:03:44.579> happening<00:03:45.060> some

there's a more flow happening some

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.890 
there's a more flow happening some

have to understand quantum physics to

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.819 
have to understand quantum physics to
know<00:03:50.849> that<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:51.659> like<00:03:51.780> one<00:03:51.810> tube<00:03:52.319> from<00:03:52.590> here

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
know that it's like one tube from here

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:59.330 
know that it's like one tube from here
to<00:03:53.189> there<00:03:54.439> whose<00:03:55.439> computer<00:03:57.709> that's<00:03:58.709> that<00:03:59.099> is<00:03:59.310> a

to there whose computer that's that is a

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.670 
to there whose computer that's that is a
river<00:03:59.609> of<00:03:59.849> energy<00:04:00.239> right<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.379> looks<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.560> a

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
river of energy right it looks like a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.500 
river of energy right it looks like a
river<00:04:01.919> meanders<00:04:02.250> back<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.909> forth<00:04:03.150> it's<00:04:03.389> got

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
river meanders back and forth it's got

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.240 
river meanders back and forth it's got
big<00:04:03.750> parks<00:04:04.049> like<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.230> lake<00:04:04.469> that's<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.829> stomach

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
big parks like a lake that's the stomach

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.559 
big parks like a lake that's the stomach
right<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:05.639> about<00:04:05.760> other<00:04:05.909> parts<00:04:06.269> like<00:04:06.389> this

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
right it's about other parts like this

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.240 
right it's about other parts like this
those<00:04:07.079> little<00:04:07.290> things<00:04:07.379> that<00:04:07.530> go<00:04:07.709> into<00:04:07.950> it

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
those little things that go into it

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.429 
those little things that go into it
it's<00:04:08.879> like<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.060> river<00:04:09.419> of<00:04:09.629> energy<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.319> that

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
it's like a river of energy and that

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.470 
it's like a river of energy and that
river<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.889> energy<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.760> influenced<00:04:12.359> by<00:04:12.419> the

quantum theory is true then what's
happening<00:04:16.979> is<00:04:17.099> is<00:04:17.280> we're<00:04:17.459> ingesting<00:04:18.060> we're

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510
