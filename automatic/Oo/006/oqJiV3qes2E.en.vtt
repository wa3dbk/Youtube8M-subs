plastic film which will go in front of
your<00:01:44.889> screen<00:01:45.099> to<00:01:45.429> guard<00:01:45.759> your<00:01:45.880> screen<00:01:46.209> it's<00:01:46.419> a

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
your screen to guard your screen it's a

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.909 
your screen to guard your screen it's a
screen<00:01:46.840> protector<00:01:46.959> guard<00:01:47.380> right<00:01:47.529> there<00:01:47.740> and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:47.919 
screen protector guard right there and

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:50.669 
screen protector guard right there and
then<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.490> pops<00:01:48.909> into<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.810> back<00:01:50.409> peace

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
then that pops into a back peace

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.129 
then that pops into a back peace
solution<00:01:50.979> which<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.549> a<00:01:51.579> flexible<00:01:52.569> but<00:01:52.810> very

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
solution which is a flexible but very

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:56.339 
solution which is a flexible but very
sturdy<00:01:53.619> feeling<00:01:54.249> rubberized<00:01:54.909> plastic<00:01:55.349> areas

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
sturdy feeling rubberized plastic areas

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.469 
sturdy feeling rubberized plastic areas
along<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:56.919> sides<00:01:57.189> of<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.549> case<00:01:57.759> that<00:01:58.119> sort<00:01:58.450> of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
along the sides of the case that sort of

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.199 
along the sides of the case that sort of
help<00:01:58.749> keep<00:01:59.409> it<00:01:59.619> rigid<00:02:00.159> along<00:02:00.489> what<00:02:00.909> could

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
help keep it rigid along what could

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.059 
help keep it rigid along what could
potentially<00:02:01.419> be<00:02:01.869> some<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.349> the<00:02:02.439> worst<00:02:02.529> impact

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
potentially be some of the worst impact

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.319 
potentially be some of the worst impact
zones<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.520> like<00:02:03.639> when<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.880> case<00:02:04.060> hits<00:02:04.239> a

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
zones so like when the case hits a

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.209 
zones so like when the case hits a
corner<00:02:04.599> but<00:02:05.079> on<00:02:05.169> the<00:02:05.289> whole<00:02:05.469> it's<00:02:05.709> going<00:02:06.009> to

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
corner but on the whole it's going to

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.940 
corner but on the whole it's going to
bend<00:02:06.639> and<00:02:06.880> flex<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.389> hopefully<00:02:07.950> dissipate

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
bend and flex and hopefully dissipate

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.240 
bend and flex and hopefully dissipate
any<00:02:09.220> force<00:02:09.610> from<00:02:10.030> drop<00:02:10.869> or<00:02:11.110> fall<00:02:11.440> or<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:12.130> know

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
any force from drop or fall or you know

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.910 
any force from drop or fall or you know
getting<00:02:12.460> mash

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
getting mash

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.650 
getting mash
into<00:02:13.220> something<00:02:13.580> okay<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.120> we're<00:02:14.270> gonna<00:02:14.360> snap

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
into something okay so we're gonna snap

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.710 
into something okay so we're gonna snap
this<00:02:14.930> front<00:02:15.290> piece<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:16.340> gonna<00:02:16.459> clean<00:02:16.880> yes

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
this front piece on just gonna clean yes

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.380 
this front piece on just gonna clean yes
yeah<00:02:18.020> I've<00:02:18.140> got<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.319> little<00:02:18.590> gunk<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.150> only

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
yeah I've got a little gunk the the only

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.510 
yeah I've got a little gunk the the only
problem<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.989> have<00:02:21.200> with<00:02:21.230> these<00:02:21.709> sort<00:02:22.459> of

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
problem that I have with these sort of

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.000 
problem that I have with these sort of
screen<00:02:22.880> guard<00:02:23.290> solutions<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.440> it's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
screen guard solutions is that it's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.330 
screen guard solutions is that it's
really<00:02:25.250> easy<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.610> get<00:02:25.849> grit<00:02:26.349> under<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:28.069> screen

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
really easy to get grit under the screen

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.550 
really easy to get grit under the screen
guard<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.480> sort<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.840> get<00:02:29.959> smashed<00:02:30.350> in

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
guard and just sort of get smashed in

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.080 
guard and just sort of get smashed in
between<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.130> screen<00:02:31.370> guard<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.790> screen

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
between the screen guard and the screen

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.390 
between the screen guard and the screen
so<00:02:32.390> I've<00:02:32.600> got<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.989> front<00:02:33.260> face<00:02:33.560> clipped<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.130> to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
so I've got the front face clipped on to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.010 
so I've got the front face clipped on to
the<00:02:34.489> galaxy<00:02:34.880> s4<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.450> almost<00:02:35.660> kind<00:02:35.930> of

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
the galaxy s4 and it's almost kind of

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.900 
the galaxy s4 and it's almost kind of
like<00:02:36.170> having<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.560> reverse<00:02:36.860> bumper<00:02:37.310> we're<00:02:37.819> gonna

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
like having a reverse bumper we're gonna

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.880 
like having a reverse bumper we're gonna
attach<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.330> now<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.900> back<00:02:39.170> plate<00:02:39.530> just

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
attach it now to the back plate just

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.920 
attach it now to the back plate just
kind<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.220> pop<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.519> in<00:02:40.970> there<00:02:41.209> make<00:02:41.720> sure<00:02:41.900> I

accidentally hit the start button there
at<00:02:47.390> Twilight<00:02:48.110> we<00:02:48.319> have<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> combined<00:02:48.950> case<00:02:49.280> so

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
at Twilight we have a combined case so

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.490 
at Twilight we have a combined case so
right<00:02:50.300> off<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.450> bat<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.930> thing<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.230> love<00:02:51.470> about
