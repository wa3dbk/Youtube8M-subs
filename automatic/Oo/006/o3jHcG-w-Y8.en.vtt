sessions going little intelligence and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.920 
sessions going little intelligence and
our<00:00:23.619> first<00:00:23.830> question<00:00:24.070> today<00:00:24.369> is<00:00:24.730> actually<00:00:25.720> a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
our first question today is actually a

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.229 
our first question today is actually a
two-part<00:00:26.109> question<00:00:26.560> it's<00:00:27.520> from<00:00:27.789> our<00:00:27.910> me<00:00:28.060> and

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:28.239 
two-part question it's from our me and

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.000 
two-part question it's from our me and
Reza<00:00:28.689> and<00:00:29.279> here's<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.400> question<00:00:30.869> he<00:00:31.869> says<00:00:32.110> so

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
Reza and here's the question he says so

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.890 
Reza and here's the question he says so
they<00:00:33.129> say<00:00:33.160> meal<00:00:33.610> frequency<00:00:33.879> does<00:00:34.420> not<00:00:34.629> matter

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
they say meal frequency does not matter

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.590 
they say meal frequency does not matter
as<00:00:35.140> long<00:00:35.170> as<00:00:35.379> you<00:00:35.470> hit<00:00:35.589> your<00:00:35.680> macros<00:00:36.360> now<00:00:37.360> as

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
as long as you hit your macros now as

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.680 
as long as you hit your macros now as
part<00:00:37.809> 1<00:00:37.960> part<00:00:38.410> 2<00:00:38.470> are<00:00:39.430> there<00:00:39.670> any<00:00:39.850> drawbacks<00:00:40.420> to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
part 1 part 2 are there any drawbacks to

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.420 
part 1 part 2 are there any drawbacks to
hitting<00:00:40.900> all<00:00:40.989> your<00:00:41.110> macros<00:00:41.530> or<00:00:41.680> calories<00:00:42.160> and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
hitting all your macros or calories and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.430 
hitting all your macros or calories and
non<00:00:42.670> huge<00:00:42.910> meal<00:00:43.150> all<00:00:43.930> right<00:00:44.079> so<00:00:44.170> we<00:00:44.260> have<00:00:44.320> a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
non huge meal all right so we have a

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.680 
non huge meal all right so we have a
two-part<00:00:44.949> question<00:00:45.159> like<00:00:45.489> I<00:00:45.610> said<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:46.030> Montague

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
two-part question like I said a Montague

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.020 
two-part question like I said a Montague
part<00:00:46.960> 1<00:00:47.110> and<00:00:47.140> i'll<00:00:47.409> talk<00:00:47.890> about<00:00:47.920> part<00:00:48.280> 2<00:00:48.430> so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
part 1 and i'll talk about part 2 so

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.990 
part 1 and i'll talk about part 2 so
does<00:00:49.839> it<00:00:49.989> matter<00:00:50.260> how<00:00:50.799> many<00:00:51.010> meals<00:00:51.309> it<00:00:51.729> takes

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
does it matter how many meals it takes

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.210 
does it matter how many meals it takes
to<00:00:52.390> get<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.720> certain<00:00:52.930> macro<00:00:53.409> trouble<00:00:53.830> and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
to get to a certain macro trouble and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.729 
to get to a certain macro trouble and
the<00:00:54.729> answer<00:00:55.030> is<00:00:55.059> no<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:56.170> does<00:00:56.379> not<00:00:56.559> really

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
the answer is no it does not really

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.740 
the answer is no it does not really
matter<00:00:56.890> whether<00:00:57.369> you<00:00:57.549> get<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:57.790> in<00:00:57.939> you<00:00:58.629> know

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
matter whether you get it in you know

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.920 
matter whether you get it in you know
one<00:00:59.019> meal<00:00:59.260> six<00:01:00.070> meals<00:01:00.250> eight<00:01:00.489> meals

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
one meal six meals eight meals

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.079 
one meal six meals eight meals
essentially<00:01:01.930> it's<00:01:02.530> really<00:01:02.830> irrelevant<00:01:03.070> now<00:01:03.699> I

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
essentially it's really irrelevant now I

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.660 
essentially it's really irrelevant now I
am<00:01:04.449> going<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.720> say<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:05.500> I<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:06.369> know<00:01:06.400> I<00:01:06.520> think

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
am going to say that I you know I think

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.580 
am going to say that I you know I think
would<00:01:06.909> be<00:01:06.970> optimal<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:08.080> get<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:08.500> know

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
would be optimal to get you know

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.050 
would be optimal to get you know
anywhere<00:01:09.130> between<00:01:09.310> like<00:01:09.430> probably<00:01:09.759> four<00:01:09.939> to

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
anywhere between like probably four to

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.530 
anywhere between like probably four to
six<00:01:10.420> now<00:01:11.110> not<00:01:12.009> so<00:01:12.280> much<00:01:12.340> meal<00:01:13.210> frequency

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
six now not so much meal frequency

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.020 
six now not so much meal frequency
matters<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:15.220> amount<00:01:15.369> of<00:01:15.490> time<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:15.970> between

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
matters is the amount of time in between

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.359 
matters is the amount of time in between
meals<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:16.840> what<00:01:17.409> I<00:01:17.439> mean<00:01:17.590> by<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:18.159> you

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
meals and what I mean by that is you

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.679 
meals and what I mean by that is you
know<00:01:18.610> let's<00:01:18.850> say<00:01:18.939> you're<00:01:19.150> you're<00:01:19.420> on<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.570> diet

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
know let's say you're you're on a diet

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.420 
know let's say you're you're on a diet
plan<00:01:19.930> that<00:01:20.200> has<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.560> required<00:01:20.740> six<00:01:21.070> meals<00:01:21.280> a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
plan that has the required six meals a

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.359 
plan that has the required six meals a
day<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:22.049> let's<00:01:23.049> say<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:23.289> stack<00:01:23.920> three<00:01:24.280> of

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
day and let's say you stack three of

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.520 
day and let's say you stack three of
them<00:01:24.520> where<00:01:24.939> it's<00:01:25.090> only<00:01:25.240> 12<00:01:25.509> hours<00:01:25.570> apart<00:01:25.899> now

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
them where it's only 12 hours apart now

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.279 
them where it's only 12 hours apart now
that's<00:01:27.070> really<00:01:27.280> not<00:01:27.429> going<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.700> allow<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.630> whole

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
that's really not going to allow a whole

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.249 
that's really not going to allow a whole
lot<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.560> benefit<00:01:30.039> to<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.280> because<00:01:30.579> a<00:01:31.259> protein

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
lot of benefit to you because a protein

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.020 
lot of benefit to you because a protein
synthesis<00:01:32.799> is<00:01:32.890> already<00:01:33.399> going<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.640> be<00:01:33.700> spike

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
synthesis is already going to be spike

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.209 
synthesis is already going to be spike
and<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.689> takes<00:01:34.929> over<00:01:35.259> two<00:01:35.439> hours<00:01:35.859> for<00:01:36.069> that

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
and it takes over two hours for that

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.700 
and it takes over two hours for that
level<00:01:36.490> Stephen<00:01:37.090> decline<00:01:37.479> so<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.229> hit<00:01:38.619> another

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
level Stephen decline so to hit another

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.249 
level Stephen decline so to hit another
meal<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.340> within<00:01:39.880> two<00:01:40.210> hours<00:01:40.240> or<00:01:40.780> around<00:01:41.079> two

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
meal up within two hours or around two

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.440 
meal up within two hours or around two
hours<00:01:41.289> is<00:01:41.649> going<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.039> be<00:01:42.100> very<00:01:42.369> beneficial<00:01:42.609> now

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
hours is going to be very beneficial now

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.510 
hours is going to be very beneficial now
on<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.689> other<00:01:43.719> end<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.319> the<00:01:44.409> spectrum<00:01:44.520> you

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
on the other end of the spectrum you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.179 
on the other end of the spectrum you
know<00:01:45.609> going<00:01:46.060> over<00:01:46.719> five<00:01:46.990> hours<00:01:47.020> might<00:01:47.799> not<00:01:47.979> be

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
know going over five hours might not be

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.809 
know going over five hours might not be
real<00:01:48.850> beneficial<00:01:49.299> either<00:01:49.689> so<00:01:50.109> um<00:01:50.520> when<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.549> give

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.649 
calories hits what's most important you
know<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.159> might<00:02:00.579> lay<00:02:00.819> it<00:02:00.939> out<00:02:00.999> in<00:02:01.179> like<00:02:01.359> a<00:02:01.389> five

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
know I might lay it out in like a five

know I might lay it out in like a five
meal<00:02:02.249> system<00:02:03.249> and<00:02:03.520> I'll<00:02:03.700> probably<00:02:03.909> say<00:02:04.149> that's

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
meal system and I'll probably say that's

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.910 
meal system and I'll probably say that's
optimal<00:02:04.869> or<00:02:04.929> maybe<00:02:05.079> a<00:02:05.170> six<00:02:05.409> meal<00:02:05.590> whatever<00:02:05.859> i

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
optimal or maybe a six meal whatever i

optimal or maybe a six meal whatever i
feels<00:02:06.159> optimal<00:02:06.639> to<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.509> individual<00:02:07.899> person

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
feels optimal to that individual person

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.109 
feels optimal to that individual person
