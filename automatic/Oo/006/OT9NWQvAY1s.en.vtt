00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
is saying you have like a math test but

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.699 
is saying you have like a math test but
you<00:02:22.239> don't<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:23.079> anything<00:02:23.319> going<00:02:23.439> on

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709

maybe that night really focus on getting

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.140 
maybe that night really focus on getting
your<00:02:29.290> math<00:02:29.500> done<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.159> don't<00:02:30.670> really<00:02:30.790> stress

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
your math done and don't really stress

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.059 
your math done and don't really stress
out<00:02:31.360> about<00:02:31.390> English<00:02:32.079> or<00:02:32.290> science<00:02:32.650> or<00:02:32.799> any<00:02:32.950> of

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
time wisely is to just figure out your

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.470 
time wisely is to just figure out your
schedule<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.430> then<00:02:39.519> figure<00:02:39.790> out<00:02:39.909> what<00:02:40.359> you

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
schedule and then figure out what you

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.349 
schedule and then figure out what you
have<00:02:40.689> time<00:02:40.989> for<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.680> then<00:02:42.099> just<00:02:42.489> make<00:02:43.090> sure

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
have time for and then just make sure

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.670 
have time for and then just make sure
that<00:02:43.540> you're<00:02:43.720> getting<00:02:43.930> everything<00:02:44.290> done

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
ahead of time that way you're not

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.250 
ahead of time that way you're not
waiting<00:02:46.209> till<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.480> very<00:02:46.599> last<00:02:46.720> day<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.079> get

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.569 
waiting till the very last day to get
everything<00:02:47.680> done<00:02:47.859> because<00:02:48.189> that<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.489> be

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
everything done because that can be

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.610 
everything done because that can be

for subjects like English and history
and<00:03:02.470> science<00:03:02.709> we<00:03:03.310> have<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.549> like<00:03:03.670> memorize<00:03:04.180> and

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
and science we have to like memorize and

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.809 
and science we have to like memorize and
study<00:03:04.629> things<00:03:04.930> over<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.379> over<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.370> write<00:03:06.790> down

you do know this is a way to stay
organized<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.519> figure<00:03:24.819> out<00:03:25.000> okay<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:25.510> is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
organized and to figure out okay this is

an hour my next tip is to actually do

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.659 
an hour my next tip is to actually do
your<00:04:05.409> homework<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.099> I<00:04:06.129> know<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.400> it's<00:04:06.519> not

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
your homework and I know that it's not

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.550 
your homework and I know that it's not
fun<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.359> after<00:04:07.780> school<00:04:07.989> you<00:04:08.109> kinda<00:04:08.319> just<00:04:08.349> want

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
fun and after school you kinda just want

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.490 
fun and after school you kinda just want
to<00:04:08.620> come<00:04:08.739> home<00:04:08.949> maybe<00:04:09.639> watch<00:04:09.879> Tim<00:04:10.180> TV<00:04:10.659> and<00:04:10.930> just

to come home maybe watch Tim TV and just
hang<00:04:11.709> out<00:04:11.859> but<00:04:12.459> especially<00:04:12.909> for<00:04:13.329> math<00:04:13.599> I<00:04:13.900> would

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
hang out but especially for math I would

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.659 
hang out but especially for math I would
highly<00:04:14.440> suggest<00:04:14.470> doing<00:04:15.040> your<00:04:15.159> homework<00:04:15.489> and

highly suggest doing your homework and

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:16.099 
highly suggest doing your homework and
the<00:04:15.760> reason

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
the reason

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.649 
the reason
for<00:04:16.379> math<00:04:16.620> especially<00:04:17.039> is<00:04:17.579> because<00:04:17.939> it's<00:04:18.509> like

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
for math especially is because it's like

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.479 
for math especially is because it's like
muscle<00:04:19.109> memory<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.530> do<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.709> problems<00:04:20.099> over

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
muscle memory to do the problems over

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.339 
muscle memory to do the problems over
and<00:04:20.669> over<00:04:20.939> and<00:04:21.060> over<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.689> actually<00:04:22.019> learn

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
and over and over you actually learn

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.809 
and over and over you actually learn
better<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.860> way<00:04:23.009> you<00:04:23.069> learn<00:04:23.189> math<00:04:23.580> better

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 
better that way you learn math better

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.610 
better that way you learn math better
that<00:04:24.060> ways<00:04:24.210> actually<00:04:24.750> do<00:04:24.870> your<00:04:24.960> homework<00:04:25.229> now
