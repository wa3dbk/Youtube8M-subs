so<00:00:00.299> they<00:00:00.450> said<00:00:00.780> it<00:00:00.960> wasn't<00:00:01.140> possible<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.770> make

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
so they said it wasn't possible to make

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.249 
so they said it wasn't possible to make
a<00:00:02.190> nano<00:00:02.520> SIM<00:00:02.820> card<00:00:02.850> out<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.600> your<00:00:03.689> micro<00:00:04.080> SIM

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
a nano SIM card out of your micro SIM

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.110 
a nano SIM card out of your micro SIM
card<00:00:04.470> or<00:00:04.650> your<00:00:04.770> regular<00:00:04.950> SIM<00:00:05.310> card<00:00:05.609> that

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
card or your regular SIM card that

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.700 
card or your regular SIM card that
information<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.690> wrong<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.109> was<00:00:07.259> able<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.589> make

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
information is wrong I was able to make

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.650 
information is wrong I was able to make
my<00:00:07.830> own<00:00:07.980> nano<00:00:08.250> SIM<00:00:08.519> card<00:00:08.550> just<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.510> these

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
my own nano SIM card just with these

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.930 
my own nano SIM card just with these
scissors<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:10.320> about<00:00:10.650> five<00:00:10.980> minutes<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.460> will

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
scissors in about five minutes I will

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.629 
scissors in about five minutes I will
show<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.150> how<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.630> video<00:00:13.340> okay<00:00:14.340> here's

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
show you how in this video okay here's

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.240 
show you how in this video okay here's
some<00:00:14.849> footage<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.540> cutting<00:00:15.870> process<00:00:16.250> so

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
some footage of the cutting process so

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.400 
some footage of the cutting process so
basically<00:00:17.730> our<00:00:17.880> goal<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.840> cut<00:00:19.020> away<00:00:19.199> any

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
basically our goal is to cut away any

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500 
basically our goal is to cut away any
extra<00:00:19.770> plastic<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.760> boost<00:00:21.029> stuff<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.359> this

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
extra plastic to boost stuff in this

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.689 
extra plastic to boost stuff in this
video<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.990> just<00:00:22.289> leave<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.039> golden<00:00:23.400> ship<00:00:23.580> in

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
video and just leave the golden ship in

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.630 
video and just leave the golden ship in
the<00:00:23.760> middle<00:00:23.910> behind<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:25.170> plastic<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.769> kind<00:00:26.519> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the middle behind the plastic is kind of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.939 
the middle behind the plastic is kind of
hard<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.359> some<00:00:27.720> good<00:00:27.900> scissors<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.710> no

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
hard but with some good scissors it's no

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.950 
hard but with some good scissors it's no
problem<00:00:29.250> my<00:00:29.820> sis<00:00:30.029> aren't<00:00:30.390> even<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.689> sharp

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
problem my sis aren't even that sharp

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
problem my sis aren't even that sharp
and<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.380> still<00:00:31.679> managed<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.250> cut<00:00:32.489> away<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and I still managed to cut away the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.760 
and I still managed to cut away the
plastic<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.930> here's<00:00:34.140> an<00:00:34.230> important<00:00:34.530> part<00:00:34.710> in

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
plastic so here's an important part in

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.080 
plastic so here's an important part in
this<00:00:34.920> video<00:00:35.190> when<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.520> take<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> look<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.000> your

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
this video when you take a look at your

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
this video when you take a look at your
SIM<00:00:36.300> card<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.690> will<00:00:36.870> notice<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.530> one

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
SIM card you will notice that in one

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.940 
SIM card you will notice that in one
corner<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.550> little<00:00:38.910> piece<00:00:39.090> missing<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.950> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
corner is a little piece missing and the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.130 
corner is a little piece missing and the
nano<00:00:41.129> SIM<00:00:41.340> card<00:00:41.370> has<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> triangle<00:00:42.540> corner<00:00:42.930> too

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
nano SIM card has a triangle corner too

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.340 
nano SIM card has a triangle corner too
so<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.430> find<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.090> triangle<00:00:45.809> corner<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.230> your

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so just find the triangle corner on your

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.750 
so just find the triangle corner on your
Regulus<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.800> part<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.190> Micro<00:00:47.430> SIM<00:00:47.520> card

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
Regulus in part or your Micro SIM card

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.150 
Regulus in part or your Micro SIM card
and<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> triangle<00:00:49.350> corner<00:00:49.680> on

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and that will be the triangle corner on

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
and that will be the triangle corner on
your<00:00:50.399> nano<00:00:50.579> SIM<00:00:50.879> card<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.329> well<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.500> go

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
your nano SIM card as well so just go

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.189 
your nano SIM card as well so just go
ahead<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.730> patient<00:00:54.210> don't<00:00:54.510> rush<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
ahead and be patient don't rush it and

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.099 
ahead and be patient don't rush it and
focus<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> cut<00:00:56.460> away<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> extra<00:00:57.449> plastic

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
focus and cut away all the extra plastic

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.740 
focus and cut away all the extra plastic
on<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.770> outside<00:00:58.850> you<00:00:59.850> may<00:01:00.059> or<00:01:00.180> may<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.300> know

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
on the outside you may or may not know

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.510 
on the outside you may or may not know
the<00:01:01.170> nano<00:01:01.379> SIM<00:01:01.680> card<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.399> bit

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the nano SIM card is a little bit

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.880 
the nano SIM card is a little bit
thinner<00:01:02.850> than<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> micro<00:01:03.960> SIM<00:01:04.170> card<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.619> people

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
thinner than a micro SIM card so people

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.350 
thinner than a micro SIM card so people
thought<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.430> might<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> problem

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
thought that that might be a problem

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.670 
thought that that might be a problem
when<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.510> comes<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> cutting<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:07.290> own<00:01:07.350> nano

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
when it comes to cutting your own nano

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620 
when it comes to cutting your own nano
SIM<00:01:07.920> card<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.060> tell<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> haven't

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
SIM card but I can tell you I haven't

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.510 
SIM card but I can tell you I haven't
done<00:01:09.780> anything<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.229> thickness<00:01:11.070> off<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> SIM

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
done anything to thickness off the SIM

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.179 
done anything to thickness off the SIM
card<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.880> works<00:01:12.330> perfectly<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.500> iPhone<00:01:13.920> 5

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
card and works perfectly in the iPhone 5

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.340 
card and works perfectly in the iPhone 5
so<00:01:14.939> let's<00:01:15.360> talk<00:01:15.509> about<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> advantages<00:01:16.290> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
so let's talk about the advantages of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
so let's talk about the advantages of
this<00:01:16.590> procedure<00:01:16.920> obviously<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:18.030> good

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
this procedure obviously it's good

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.789 
this procedure obviously it's good
because<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.689> don't<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> pay<00:01:19.259> extra<00:01:19.409> cash

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
because you don't have to pay extra cash

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.580 
because you don't have to pay extra cash
but<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> downside<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.390> put<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.439> can

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
but the downside is you can put you can

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.140 
but the downside is you can put you can
damage<00:01:22.770> your<00:01:23.009> card<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.520> use<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.909> again

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
damage your card and not use it again

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.330 
damage your card and not use it again
but<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:25.170> would<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.590> bought<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> new<00:01:26.100> card

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
but you would have bought a new card

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.090 
but you would have bought a new card
anyway<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.759> no<00:01:27.210> real<00:01:27.509> loss<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.920> real

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
anyway so no real loss here the real

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.969 
anyway so no real loss here the real
downside<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.820> me<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.380> nano<00:01:31.740> SIM

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
downside for me is this is a nano SIM

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.560 
downside for me is this is a nano SIM
card<00:01:32.189> adapter<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.850> does<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.479> put

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
card adapter what this does is you put

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.690 
card adapter what this does is you put
your<00:01:33.720> nano<00:01:33.960> SIM<00:01:34.170> card<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.579> can

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
your nano SIM card in and then you can

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.090 
your nano SIM card in and then you can
use<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.900> micro<00:01:37.259> SIM<00:01:37.439> card<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:37.770> instance

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
use it as a micro SIM card for instance

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.850 
use it as a micro SIM card for instance
in<00:01:38.280> my<00:01:38.430> galaxy<00:01:38.880> s3<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:39.450> HTC<00:01:39.930> One<00:01:40.049> X<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
in my galaxy s3 or HTC One X but the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.649 
in my galaxy s3 or HTC One X but the
self-made<00:01:41.369> nano<00:01:41.579> SIM<00:01:41.790> card<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.180> doesn't<00:01:42.509> fit

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
self-made nano SIM card just doesn't fit

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.719 
self-made nano SIM card just doesn't fit
into<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.960> adapter<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> can't<00:01:44.250> use<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.579> in

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
into this adapter so I can't use it in

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.620 
into this adapter so I can't use it in
my<00:01:45.180> s3<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:45.960> 1x<00:01:46.579> now<00:01:47.579> let's<00:01:47.909> take<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> closer<00:01:48.479> look

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
my s3 or 1x now let's take a closer look

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.800 
my s3 or 1x now let's take a closer look
at<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> final<00:01:49.380> result<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.299> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
at the final result and you can see that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.800 
at the final result and you can see that
I<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:52.049> able<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> cut<00:01:52.680> away<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.130> extra<00:01:53.430> plastic

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
I was able to cut away the extra plastic

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.010 
I was able to cut away the extra plastic
pretty<00:01:54.810> well<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:57.210> corner<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
pretty well and in the corner on the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.100 
pretty well and in the corner on the
right<00:01:58.950> side<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> bottom-right<00:02:00.119> corner<00:02:00.149> you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
right side the bottom-right corner you

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
right side the bottom-right corner you
see<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.799> triangle<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.399> was<00:02:02.579> talking

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
see this little triangle I was talking

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
see this little triangle I was talking
about<00:02:02.909> earlier<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> right<00:02:04.380> side<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
about earlier and on the right side I

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.850 
about earlier and on the right side I
think<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:06.240> cut<00:02:06.930> into<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.290> gold<00:02:07.530> ship<00:02:07.770> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
think I I cut into the gold ship a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.710 
think I I cut into the gold ship a
little<00:02:08.069> bit<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.489> still<00:02:08.759> works<00:02:08.970> perfectly<00:02:09.179> so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
little bit but still works perfectly so

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.160 
little bit but still works perfectly so
no<00:02:10.379> damage<00:02:10.830> done<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:12.450> let's<00:02:12.660> wrap<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.959> video

videos of these three phones I have some
cool<00:03:16.030> comparison<00:03:16.480> videos<00:03:16.690> up<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.740> let's<00:03:18.070> just

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
cool comparison videos up so let's just

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.780 
cool comparison videos up so let's just
wait<00:03:18.580> until<00:03:18.820> my<00:03:19.420> provider<00:03:19.780> shows<00:03:20.050> up<00:03:20.260> here

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
wait until my provider shows up here

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.970 
wait until my provider shows up here
that<00:03:21.790> will<00:03:22.000> be<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.240> final<00:03:22.480> proof<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.710> was

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
that will be the final proof that I was

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.250 
that will be the final proof that I was
able<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.280> cut<00:03:24.520> my<00:03:24.760> own<00:03:24.790> nano<00:03:25.180> SIM<00:03:25.600> card<00:03:25.930> should

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
able to cut my own nano SIM card should

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.890
