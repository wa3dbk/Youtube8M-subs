it<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:58.900> way<00:03:59.370> because<00:04:00.930> PJ<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.170> think<00:04:02.530> I

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
it this way because PJ and I I think I

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.370 
it this way because PJ and I I think I
think<00:04:03.100> it's<00:04:03.310> safe<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.579> say<00:04:03.609> we're<00:04:04.000> we<00:04:04.780> feed<00:04:05.230> off

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
think it's safe to say we're we feed off

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.259 
think it's safe to say we're we feed off
each<00:04:05.410> other<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.010> so<00:04:06.760> like<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:06.970> lot<00:04:07.120> of

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
each other and so like a lot of

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.270 
each other and so like a lot of
creativity<00:04:07.690> happens<00:04:08.230> right<00:04:08.470> right<00:04:08.799> here

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280
