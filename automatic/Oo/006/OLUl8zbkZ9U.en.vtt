00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 scaled hello people or if the wing and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.910
 performs over an edge and oligopoly 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.460
 today 's topic is cinema 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.940
 friends I had a ready agenda for 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.800
 today 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.350
 usually the problem begins in video one 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.930
 the day before it was posted but today 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.359
 dawn leaked trailer universe debate 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.699
 superman and I could not stop talking 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.099
 neither of the trailer of star wars o 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.140
 awakening force then strike will have 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.730
 point I had made and now he 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.340
 talks about these two trailers 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.350
 let's go first all wars and debris 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.210
 a feeling of enormous nostalgia 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.340
 the previous trilogy of a discrepancy 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.890
 so great about the trilogy 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.950
 classic that even though it was star 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.410
 wars caused a certain strangeness and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.199
 not visually it resembles much more 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.870
 original trilogy and not just by visual 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.539
 the preview begins with a luke narration 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.300
 skywalker saying that the force is strong in 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.570
 his family his father had he has to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.570
 sister and now one more person has strength 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.670
 remains to know who he refers to we know 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.619
 that the film will have three protagonists one 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.930
 supposed meeting by the director 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 interpreted by a colleague as well 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.939
 we will have a pilot and ex wing called 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.340
 but of melo errei interpreted by 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.439
 said ridley and my bet goes to 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.390
 character of ridley because I'm taking 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.729
 account of an assertion by the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.680
 president of lucas movies ketlin cana 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.210
 that says we should wait for 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.729
 female characters much more 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.829
 powerful in this technology then I think 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 who retained heiress of the force 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.340
 remembering that until now we only had 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.170
 male protagonists 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.540
 the possible villain also appears with more 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.000
 possible details that in the kingdom 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.070
 hide his face under a mask but the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.590
 better for me at the end with the apparition 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.960
 from hans solo and bacca shower look 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.119
 beauty knew how to make a fan serve without 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.579
 exaggerating dose presents novelties 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.469
 punctuating nostalgia in the right measure and 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.240
 still did not reveal much of his 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.380
 story everything i talk about here would be 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.479
 pure speculation 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.940
 but what I can say is that now it is 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.250
 I feel like I'm waiting for a real 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.990
 continuation of the first trilogy being 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.150
 which was previously a continuation 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.370
 it was a prequel then expectations 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.380
 for the new star wars 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.750
 now let's talk about batman a verse 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.580
 superman will not put snippets of 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.350
 phone leaked here because the warner is 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.210
 hunting any link containing the 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.610
 previous but then let's go 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.040
 the trailer confirms the rumors that said 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.570
 that the superman be idolized as if 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.040
 be a god here on earth 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.320
 thing that would really happen if 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.990
 someone with his power to appear around 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.780
 let's agree more on the ground fighting voice 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.970
 for reflection and if being powerful is not 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.680
 from here and brought his war with him 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.840
 probably referring to the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.680
 kryptonians that caused a part of the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.840
 undoing 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.910
 something else that is assaulted on the rail is 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.560
 that power can rise to the head 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.870
 will we have a super good less 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.330
 noble and more arrogant like that in a 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.120
 game and to whom justice people 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.670
 knelt lose superman admiration 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.930
 fear then appears wizard facing 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.460
 batman uniform 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.650
 we have a breathtaking brief as ben 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.900
 affleck was wearing a uniform 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.730
 we'll have a grittier batman this time 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.959
 remembering the miller version in 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.760
 dark Knight 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.860
 Incidentally, the trailer ends up making a 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.600
 reference to gaffe of mile combat 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.880
 using the armor made to combat the 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.060
 superman and that's when he releases the phrase 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.090
 you creek will bleed 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.430
 The threat so far seems to be the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.810
 superman misunderstood or left 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.130
 the power to rise to the head 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.380
 will fit the party to walk a petelecos 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.570
 in him so that he may return to reason 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.060
 people who are good times to be nerds 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.530
 expectations to the skin and leave us 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.660
