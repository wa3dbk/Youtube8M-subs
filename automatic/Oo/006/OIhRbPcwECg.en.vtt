00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 Well, there are problems again that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.219
 mammoth project skyrim falls into the water 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.599
 but is not quite off the table I will 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.250
 first move and will the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.430
 play second place 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.130
 I have already tried everything 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.060
 possible patches and stuff downloaded 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.789
 and pipapo it just does not work 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.449
 I can show you that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.429
 is here 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.679
 if one now goes on skyrim and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.340
 then play this then comes this 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.469
 error here I have already here so 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 downloaded a file and all that 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.579
 replaced and tried everything 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.920
 I've tried everything 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.719
 now absolutely no more and the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.030
 time is synonymous slow flutes 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.329
 that's why i will be the mammoth project 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.100
 First put skyrim on the side 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.660
 and look that it works again 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 I'll probably play the whole game 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.469
 The install and steam should be there 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.379
 Just download and then it will 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.270
 but that probably works 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.580
 would take me too long now and 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.939
 that's why the mammoth project falls first 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.610
 Skyrim into the water and I will the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.040
 do second place that would be his 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.310
 Kate I hope that works now 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.869
 I start that now and then 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.979
 then in the next few days starts too 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.710
 the lp so long is still running here 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.740
 borderlands and bonn to the end 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.810
 and yes I'm sorry friends one 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.450
 are happy now and say no 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.890
 skyrim the others say the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.780
 I would have liked to see that 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.939
 I myself would be very reluctant to do that 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.920
 game but as I said, it's easy for me 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.299
 too big now it says to the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.720
 install and again down to 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.700
 load 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.759
 even if I have a 50,000 line 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.040
 I've been too long for that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.360
 I do not know how big the game is 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.240
 but it definitely settled 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.549
 It's also about 20gb or even so 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.130
 even bigger and that would be too 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.140
 now take at least two hours and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.810
 I do not mind and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.020
 That's why the project falls into the first 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.030
 water you are welcome under it 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.989
 I can write what I can do about it 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.360
 can show again 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.800
 the error lies 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.320
 in any case here 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.490
 any patches are missing or so me 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.310
 I've already googled 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.470
 I already tried everything I have 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.630
 Here such a file also downloaded 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.790
 in youtube I found something that 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.010
 downloaded and it does not work 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.930
 I have already asked you in facebook 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.290
 The sausage is not in facebook now 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.270
 I got it together with me 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.370
 The people also can not solve it 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.709
 is just really funny so I stay 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.570
 now only one left to the game 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.350
 uninstall and again re 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.209
 to install 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.950
 Unfortunately I bought it in steam 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.709
 no games cd here and that's why yes 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.870
 It takes me too long and that's why 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.620
 this mammoth project first into the water 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.320
 fall 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.550
 pity but maybe it will be at night 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.739
 indicate because that's the second one 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.270
 winner 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:11.940
 maybe it will come after that 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:14.160
 or maybe i will too jafry 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.780
 because I have that too 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.660
 I completely forget about the comments 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.760
 between so to imagine because that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.330
 was also an option that was 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.040
 Far cry is alright now 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.290
 probably write some under 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.090
 this video no no no feasibility 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.200
 not syndicate but no that 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.489
 second place is unfortunately the kate 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.760
 Maybe I'll still be farct 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.630
 steady style let's play him waiting 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.630
 until then
