 get to his current home the giraffe had 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.260
 have to travel 100 kilometers , which is why 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.449
 it took more than 3 hours in the park 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.789

 breeding program for this 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.480
 species is currently in serious 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.320
 danger of extinction in their places of 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.239
 origin 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.870
 they are classified by the list 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.180
 red uc n as a classification 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.060
 dependent that means that then 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.310
 well that depends on its reproduction in 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.350
 captivity so that the species is not 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.290
 classified as threatened 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.570
 we had at the zoo Zacango 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.550
 a very good reproduction of giraffes 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.980
 reticulated we have now registered

 operant conditioning as it will sleep 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.430
 the animal could be quite 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.620
 dangerous by the size of his body 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.630
 sofía mansur detailed that in the next 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.820

 illegal hunting these days we will be 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.340
 moving the giraffe is the first one 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.740

 four are classified as in danger of 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.640
 extinction one of them is Mexican that 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.470
 is the monkey a year black hands and also 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.930
 three coyotes rescued from 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.790
 the illegal house and well they will be able to 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.610
 rehabilitate here in the farm of 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.440
 each finally sofía mansur affirmed that 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.300

 turn the park into a zoo 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.200
 so that the children of ecatepec are 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.989
