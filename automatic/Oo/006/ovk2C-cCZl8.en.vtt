00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
then it doesn't like do anything

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.140 
then it doesn't like do anything
probably<00:04:38.740> because<00:04:39.010> like<00:04:39.220> he<00:04:39.430> failed<00:04:39.850> hacked

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
probably because like he failed hacked

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.940 
probably because like he failed hacked
because<00:04:40.690> he's<00:04:40.960> not<00:04:41.110> very<00:04:41.320> good<00:04:41.530> at<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:41.740> game

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
because he's not very good at this game

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.880 
because he's not very good at this game
and<00:04:42.160> I<00:04:42.640> go<00:04:42.760> for<00:04:42.970> safeguards<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.600> know<00:04:43.680> like<00:04:44.680> he

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
and I go for safeguards I know like he

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.490 
and I go for safeguards I know like he
wants<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.250> like<00:04:45.520> do<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.210> status<00:04:46.870> move<00:04:47.050> on<00:04:47.230> me<00:04:47.380> or

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
wants to like do a status move on me or

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.170 
wants to like do a status move on me or
something<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:48.070> know<00:04:48.130> he<00:04:48.370> wants<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.640> go<00:04:48.820> for<00:04:49.090> like

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
something I know he wants to go for like

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.540 
something I know he wants to go for like
will-o'-wisp<00:04:49.750> probably<00:04:50.740> because<00:04:51.400> it's

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
will-o'-wisp probably because it's

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.220 
will-o'-wisp probably because it's
sceptile<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.270> usually<00:04:52.600> those<00:04:52.750> things<00:04:53.020> run

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
sceptile and usually those things run

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.470 
sceptile and usually those things run
low<00:04:53.530> lowest<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:54.640> I<00:04:54.670> set<00:04:54.910> up<00:04:55.000> with<00:04:55.120> dragging

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
low lowest and so I set up with dragging

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.180 
low lowest and so I set up with dragging
this<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:55.870> go<00:04:55.990> for<00:04:56.200> Jaco<00:04:56.410> meteor<00:04:56.800> because<00:04:57.160> I

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
this and I go for Jaco meteor because I

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.920 
this and I go for Jaco meteor because I
know<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.700> that<00:04:58.180> will<00:04:58.300> make<00:04:58.450> it<00:04:58.480> like<00:04:58.750> way

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
know that that will make it like way

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.130 
know that that will make it like way
stronger<00:04:59.290> or<00:04:59.530> something<00:04:59.890> and<00:05:00.070> then<00:05:00.700> um<00:05:01.140> he's

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
stronger or something and then um he's

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.810 
stronger or something and then um he's
like<00:05:02.290> a<00:05:02.320> total<00:05:02.560> cheater<00:05:02.980> with<00:05:03.250> Sitrus<00:05:03.580> berry

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
like a total cheater with Sitrus berry

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.770 
like a total cheater with Sitrus berry
because<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.150> didn't<00:05:04.390> even<00:05:04.450> know<00:05:04.630> you<00:05:04.690> could

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
because I didn't even know you could

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.410 
because I didn't even know you could
have<00:05:04.960> that<00:05:05.140> and<00:05:05.560> then<00:05:06.190> he<00:05:06.280> goes<00:05:06.490> for<00:05:06.790> the

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
have that and then he goes for the

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.540 
have that and then he goes for the
synthesis<00:05:07.990> like<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.230> cop<00:05:08.560> he<00:05:08.770> like<00:05:08.920> just<00:05:09.160> copied

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
synthesis like a cop he like just copied

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.610 
synthesis like a cop he like just copied
me<00:05:09.700> cuz<00:05:10.330> i<00:05:10.450> go<00:05:10.630> for<00:05:10.780> another<00:05:10.840> jack<00:05:11.230> a<00:05:11.260> meteor
