only<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.600> guy<00:01:09.720> went<00:01:09.960> down<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.439> ahead

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
only one guy went down that way ahead

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490 
only one guy went down that way ahead
round<00:01:11.880> back<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> other<00:01:12.869> way<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.260> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
round back to go the other way but it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.050 
round back to go the other way but it
looks<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.740> my<00:01:13.860> team<00:01:14.100> has<00:01:14.369> pretty<00:01:14.580> much<00:01:14.670> taken

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
looks like my team has pretty much taken

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.600 
looks like my team has pretty much taken
care<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:16.009> see<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> skull<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
care of that I see a skull in the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.950 
care of that I see a skull in the
background<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.299> there's<00:01:18.600> probably<00:01:18.840> an

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
background there there's probably an

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
background there there's probably an
enemy<00:01:19.259> close<00:01:19.500> by<00:01:19.710> sure<00:01:20.130> enough<00:01:20.310> there's<00:01:20.520> one

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
enemy close by sure enough there's one

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.510 
enemy close by sure enough there's one
probably<00:01:21.299> more<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> develop<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
probably more so you have to develop a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.609 
probably more so you have to develop a
third<00:01:23.820> eye<00:01:24.090> watching<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.840> radar<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.690 
sit tight for a second I'm not sure
where<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> enemy<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:24.220> always<00:02:24.340> want<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.610> be

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
where the enemy is you always want to be

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.130 
where the enemy is you always want to be
more<00:02:24.880> careful<00:02:25.300> when<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.570> don't<00:02:25.870> have<00:02:26.080> your

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
more careful when you don't have your

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.280 
more careful when you don't have your
radar<00:02:26.620> up<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.670> as<00:02:27.790> far<00:02:28.030> as<00:02:28.090> killstreaks<00:02:28.810> go<00:02:29.080> I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
radar up so as far as killstreaks go I

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.260 
radar up so as far as killstreaks go I
highly<00:02:29.770> recommend<00:02:30.220> using<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.730> spy<00:02:30.940> plane

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
highly recommend using the spy plane

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.020 
highly recommend using the spy plane
counter<00:02:31.690> spy<00:02:31.900> plane<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> Blackbird<00:02:33.030> those

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
counter spy plane in the Blackbird those

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.930 
counter spy plane in the Blackbird those
three<00:02:34.270> kill<00:02:34.480> streaks<00:02:34.780> will<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:36.700> my<00:02:36.910> opinion

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
three kill streaks will in my opinion

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.660 
three kill streaks will in my opinion
get<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.200> your<00:02:38.350> team<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.950> most<00:02:39.160> benefit

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
get you and your team the most benefit

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.460 
get you and your team the most benefit
and<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.239> also<00:02:40.390> keeps<00:02:40.600> your<00:02:40.780> gameplay<00:02:41.110> going

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
and it also keeps your gameplay going

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.160 
and it also keeps your gameplay going
pretty<00:02:41.739> quick<00:02:42.420> okay<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.870> mean<00:02:44.110> by

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
pretty quick okay so what I mean by

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.220 
pretty quick okay so what I mean by
heavily<00:02:45.100> focusing<00:02:45.880> on<00:02:46.030> your<00:02:46.209> radar<00:02:46.480> means

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
heavily focusing on your radar means

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.100 
heavily focusing on your radar means
that<00:02:47.530> when<00:02:48.010> your<00:02:48.190> spy<00:02:48.489> planes<00:02:48.850> are<00:02:49.090> up<00:02:49.270> you're

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
that when your spy planes are up you're

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.650 
that when your spy planes are up you're
not<00:02:50.230> even<00:02:50.500> watching<00:02:50.739> your<00:02:51.070> screen<00:02:51.420> unless<00:02:52.420> an

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
not even watching your screen unless an
