acting right now when it comes to this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.660 
acting right now when it comes to this
matchmaking<00:01:09.659> system<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.799> why<00:01:11.369> should<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
matchmaking system for one why should it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.760 
matchmaking system for one why should it
load<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.150> full<00:01:12.479> sessions<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.320> begin<00:01:13.619> with

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
load up full sessions to begin with

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280 
load up full sessions to begin with
secondly<00:01:14.580> why<00:01:15.090> should<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.390> take<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.869> long<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
secondly why should it take so long to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.649 
secondly why should it take so long to
do<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.500> thirdly<00:01:17.340> why<00:01:17.970> does<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.630> long

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
do so thirdly why does it take so long

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
do so thirdly why does it take so long
to<00:01:19.020> refresh<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> loading<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.820> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to refresh it's like the loading is so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
to refresh it's like the loading is so
slow<00:01:21.420> by<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> time<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.470> into<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> search

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
slow by the time you get into the search

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
slow by the time you get into the search
they're<00:01:23.939> all<00:01:24.090> taken<00:01:24.509> already

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
they're all taken already

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
they're all taken already
then<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> cycle<00:01:25.770> continues<00:01:26.369> over<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.150> over

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
then the cycle continues over and over

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.319 
then the cycle continues over and over
again<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.380> exactly<00:01:28.890> why<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.490> create<00:01:30.150> my

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
again this is exactly why I create my

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.690 
again this is exactly why I create my
own<00:01:30.360> sessions<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.200> not<00:01:31.619> search<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:31.920> them<00:01:32.280> now

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
own sessions and not search for them now

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
own sessions and not search for them now
you<00:01:32.759> could<00:01:33.060> say<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.479> way<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> bypass<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you could say that's a way to bypass it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
you could say that's a way to bypass it
but<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:34.979> about<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.310> everyone<00:01:35.610> else<00:01:35.790> just

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
but what about for everyone else just

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
but what about for everyone else just
because<00:01:36.570> you're<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.229> searching<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:38.070> wasting

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
because you're not searching not wasting

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429
