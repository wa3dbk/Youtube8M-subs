well I've had a phenomenal week here at

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:13.569 
well I've had a phenomenal week here at
the<00:00:11.869> World<00:00:12.019> Golf<00:00:12.200> Championship<00:00:12.829> in<00:00:12.980> doral<00:00:13.249> and

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:13.579 
the World Golf Championship in doral and

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.000 
the World Golf Championship in doral and
I<00:00:14.480> got<00:00:14.839> to<00:00:14.990> spend<00:00:15.079> a<00:00:15.320> lot<00:00:15.469> of<00:00:15.530> time<00:00:15.650> this

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
I got to spend a lot of time this

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.980 
I got to spend a lot of time this
morning<00:00:16.460> in<00:00:16.670> the<00:00:16.820> Jim<00:00:17.030> McLean<00:00:17.060> Academy<00:00:17.900> in

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
morning in the Jim McLean Academy in

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.140 
morning in the Jim McLean Academy in
there<00:00:18.110> putting<00:00:18.440> studio<00:00:18.800> but<00:00:19.580> I<00:00:19.700> want<00:00:19.910> to<00:00:19.970> give

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
there putting studio but I want to give

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.930 
there putting studio but I want to give
you<00:00:20.180> an<00:00:20.450> image<00:00:20.840> of<00:00:21.140> what<00:00:21.470> it's<00:00:22.100> like<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:22.670> have<00:00:22.880> a

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:22.940 
you an image of what it's like to have a

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.670 
you an image of what it's like to have a
balanced<00:00:23.510> stroke<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.050> why<00:00:24.230> that's<00:00:24.500> so

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
balanced stroke and why that's so

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.800 
balanced stroke and why that's so
important<00:00:25.190> and<00:00:25.580> I've<00:00:25.700> got<00:00:25.910> a<00:00:25.940> principle<00:00:26.630> for

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
important and I've got a principle for

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.540 
important and I've got a principle for
you<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.110> I<00:00:27.170> that<00:00:27.800> I<00:00:27.830> think<00:00:28.100> is<00:00:28.160> going<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.370> help

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
you and I that I think is going to help

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.720 
you and I that I think is going to help
us<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:28.700> here's<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:29.060> principal<00:00:30.280> the<00:00:31.280> middle

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
us and here's the principal the middle

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.550 
us and here's the principal the middle
of<00:00:31.940> my<00:00:32.180> stroke<00:00:32.540> is<00:00:32.750> where<00:00:32.900> I<00:00:32.930> delivered<00:00:33.470> the

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
of my stroke is where I delivered the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.040 
of my stroke is where I delivered the
most<00:00:33.770> energy<00:00:34.630> doesn't<00:00:35.630> sound<00:00:35.930> too

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
most energy doesn't sound too

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.100 
most energy doesn't sound too
complicated<00:00:36.790> this<00:00:37.790> is<00:00:37.940> perfect<00:00:38.180> if<00:00:38.600> as<00:00:38.870> long

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
complicated this is perfect if as long

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.630 
complicated this is perfect if as long
as<00:00:39.230> my<00:00:39.380> stroke<00:00:39.650> is<00:00:39.800> balanced<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:40.310> deliver

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
as my stroke is balanced I deliver

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.420 
as my stroke is balanced I deliver
energy<00:00:40.910> at<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.600> ball<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.110> then<00:00:42.710> i<00:00:42.829> end<00:00:43.190> at<00:00:43.370> the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
energy at the ball and then i end at the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.790 
energy at the ball and then i end at the
end<00:00:43.520> of<00:00:43.730> my<00:00:43.820> stroke<00:00:44.120> which<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:44.420> great<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:45.470> what

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
end of my stroke which is great but what

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.670 
end of my stroke which is great but what
happens<00:00:46.370> if<00:00:46.550> my<00:00:46.790> stroke<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.420> not<00:00:48.050> balanced

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
happens if my stroke is not balanced

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.260 
happens if my stroke is not balanced
let's<00:00:48.860> say<00:00:48.980> it's<00:00:49.130> long<00:00:49.370> back<00:00:49.700> and<00:00:49.970> short

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
let's say it's long back and short

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.740 
let's say it's long back and short
through<00:00:50.739> well<00:00:51.739> now<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.700> energy<00:00:53.120> is<00:00:53.239> still<00:00:53.540> in

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
through well now the energy is still in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.720 
through well now the energy is still in
the<00:00:53.870> middle<00:00:54.110> of<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.380> stroke<00:00:54.710> but<00:00:55.250> my<00:00:55.430> stroke

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
the middle of the stroke but my stroke

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.760 
the middle of the stroke but my stroke
is<00:00:55.910> way<00:00:56.149> behind<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.720> ball<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.350> energy

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
is way behind the ball and the energy

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.830 
is way behind the ball and the energy
the<00:00:57.950> middle<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.219> my<00:00:58.309> stroke<00:00:58.730> is<00:00:58.940> behind<00:00:59.510> the

deliver energy at impact if our stroke

or in front of the ball the stroke meter
was<00:01:42.590> made<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.369> help<00:01:43.640> us<00:01:43.820> with<00:01:44.030> this<00:01:44.180> process<00:01:44.479> so

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
was made to help us with this process so

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.140 
was made to help us with this process so
we<00:01:45.290> simply<00:01:45.799> toss<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.369> down<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.820> we<00:01:46.939> make

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
we simply toss it down and we make

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.820 
we simply toss it down and we make
strokes<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.540> are<00:01:47.720> balanced<00:01:48.140> we<00:01:48.229> go<00:01:48.350> color<00:01:48.619> to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
strokes that are balanced we go color to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.920 
strokes that are balanced we go color to
color<00:01:48.979> if<00:01:49.310> we're<00:01:49.909> going<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.090> putt<00:01:50.360> better<00:01:50.390> and

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
color if we're going to putt better and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.660 
color if we're going to putt better and
we<00:01:51.110> are<00:01:51.259> we're<00:01:51.950> going<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.130> have<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.369> learn<00:01:52.400> this

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670
