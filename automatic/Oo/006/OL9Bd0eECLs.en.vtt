00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.110
 the game between young vitesse and young and a CD canceled on Monday due to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.199
 the bad field in Ghent 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.469
 Tuesday afternoon the game was made up on the artificial grass field at Papendal 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.849
 the visitors started making the best match after the opening phase 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.810
 young vitesse is in control and from that moment the home club dictated 

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:22.839
 actually 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.249
 there were many vitesse supporters at the papendal more than three hundred for the derby 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.710
 to watch 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.859
 the arnhemmers get a free kick after 22 minutes of play 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.500
 Mohamed that he reports but also has a shot 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.500
 he had earned more but it only has the job 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.530
 last week, young vitesse won for the first time this season in breda at nac 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.010
 I played many first team players with it and that is not the case now 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.580
 gerry hamstra's team consists mainly of promises 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.670
 contrary to the ratio, visitors from Nijmegen then come one 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.690
 lead via baywatch 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 this happens at a rotten moment just before the 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.140
 roj talsma can also equalize before half time but the attacker misses the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.480
 open chances and so both teams head towards the game with a kilo one 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.600
 intermediate position 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.180
 gerry hamstra does not change anything, so the same eleven players are up again after the break 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.860
 the field 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.130
 vitesse was also the better team after the break 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.520
 the first real danger in the second half came from that jovink 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.520
 a minute later the Nijmegen goalie did check on the header from 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.180
 defender wormgoor 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.490
 and so it is the same again after 74 minutes of play 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.850
 and that is considering the game image and the odds 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.220
 certainly deserved 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.830
 the arnhemmers then have more than fifteen minutes to score another goal and 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.930
 to achieve the second victory of the season 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.560
 Here indicates that he again has a good chance after a very nice attack by 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.390
 vitesse 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.410
 but whoever does not believe in the way 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.939
 both teams then no longer scored 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.739
 and so it remains in a patents on the beach
