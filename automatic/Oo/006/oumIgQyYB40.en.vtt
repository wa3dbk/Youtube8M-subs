00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.980 

first<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.400> all<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.550> don't<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:09.630> know<00:00:09.750> when<00:00:09.900> we

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
first of all I don't you know when we

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.480 
first of all I don't you know when we
say<00:00:10.139> ground<00:00:10.469> fighting<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.980> guess<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.309> have<00:00:11.429> to

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
say ground fighting I guess we have to

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.039 
say ground fighting I guess we have to
say<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.940> people<00:00:12.210> understand<00:00:12.750> what<00:00:12.809> I'm

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
say that people understand what I'm

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.589 
say that people understand what I'm
about<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.440> talk<00:00:13.620> about<00:00:14.089> first<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.269> all<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
about to talk about first of all and

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.210 
about to talk about first of all and
you're<00:00:15.690> looking<00:00:15.929> at<00:00:16.020> science<00:00:16.440> all<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.100> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
you're looking at science all it is is a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.980 
you're looking at science all it is is a
change<00:00:17.490> of

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
change of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.080 
change of
of<00:00:19.260> planes<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> vertical<00:00:20.700> plane<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.060> a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
of planes you have a vertical plane in a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.910 
of planes you have a vertical plane in a
horizontal<00:00:21.390> plane<00:00:21.840> whatever<00:00:22.530> you<00:00:22.770> learn

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
horizontal plane whatever you learn

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.580 
horizontal plane whatever you learn
vertically<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.550> should<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.850> able<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:24.060> apply

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
vertically you should be able to apply

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.740 
vertically you should be able to apply
horizontally<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.430> there<00:00:26.610> is<00:00:26.730> no<00:00:26.970> difference

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
horizontally so there is no difference

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.900 
horizontally so there is no difference
in<00:00:27.960> fighting<00:00:28.440> other<00:00:29.340> than<00:00:29.610> you're<00:00:29.790> on<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
in fighting other than you're on a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.420 
in fighting other than you're on a
different<00:00:30.119> plane<00:00:30.570> there<00:00:31.500> are<00:00:31.770> some<00:00:31.950> physics

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
different plane there are some physics

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
different plane there are some physics
about<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.970> plane<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.770> are

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
about that plane that is that that are

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.310 
about that plane that is that that are
required<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> know<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.600> works<00:00:36.780> how<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.080> you

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
required to know and it works how do you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.290 
required to know and it works how do you
use<00:00:37.500> force<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> take<00:00:38.309> people<00:00:38.610> off<00:00:38.670> balance<00:00:39.150> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
use force to take people off balance and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.750 
use force to take people off balance and
how<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.780> maintain<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.830> that<00:00:41.520> type

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
how do you maintain it on a on that type

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.970 
how do you maintain it on a on that type
of<00:00:41.790> horizontal<00:00:42.510> plane<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> things

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
of horizontal plane one of the things

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.119 
of horizontal plane one of the things
about<00:00:44.160> when<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.180> win<00:00:45.650> most<00:00:46.650> people<00:00:46.949> when<00:00:47.040> they

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
about when you win most people when they

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.560 
about when you win most people when they
look<00:00:47.280> at<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> Brazilians<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.360> say

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
look at the Brazilians they say

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.330 
look at the Brazilians they say
Brazilian<00:00:49.110> first<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.650> sense<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.070> what

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
Brazilian first of all I sense that what

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.090 
Brazilian first of all I sense that what
is<00:00:50.460> Brazilian<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.300> did<00:00:51.480> sit<00:00:51.720> well<00:00:52.649> I've<00:00:52.860> seen

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
is Brazilian you did sit well I've seen

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
is Brazilian you did sit well I've seen
Brazilian<00:00:53.940> Jujitsu<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.989> I've<00:00:55.079> seen<00:00:55.290> it<00:00:55.410> from

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
Brazilian Jujitsu and I've seen it from

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.030 
Brazilian Jujitsu and I've seen it from
the<00:00:55.680> source

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
the source

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.069 
the source
and<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.970> no<00:00:57.210> difference<00:00:57.510> between<00:00:57.780> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and there is no difference between it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.850 
and there is no difference between it
Japanese<00:00:58.940> jiu-jitsu<00:01:00.170> then<00:01:01.170> there's<00:01:01.440> Chinese

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
Japanese jiu-jitsu then there's Chinese

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.700 
Japanese jiu-jitsu then there's Chinese
the<00:01:02.489> word<00:01:02.640> jiu-jitsu<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.840> mean<00:01:04.050> it<00:01:04.199> goes<00:01:04.350> all

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the word jiu-jitsu I mean it goes all

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.370 
the word jiu-jitsu I mean it goes all
over<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.430> place<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> ending<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:07.200> the

Orient

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
Orient
it<00:01:07.950> simply<00:01:08.280> means<00:01:08.430> punch<00:01:08.820> strike<00:01:09.149> moves<00:01:09.600> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it simply means punch strike moves and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.889 
it simply means punch strike moves and
in<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.759> body<00:01:11.970> works<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.690> punch

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
in the way the body works and the punch

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.469 
in the way the body works and the punch
strike<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.350> when<00:01:13.440> you<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.619> into<00:01:13.800> graphing<00:01:14.479> so

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
strike and when you get into graphing so

strike and when you get into graphing so
judicial<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.470> very<00:01:16.680> good<00:01:17.899> there's<00:01:18.899> nothing

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
judicial is very good there's nothing

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
judicial is very good there's nothing
wrong<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.560> jiu-jitsu<00:01:20.310> other<00:01:20.520> than<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> fact

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
wrong with jiu-jitsu other than the fact

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
wrong with jiu-jitsu other than the fact
that<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> sport<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.740> even<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:23.790> its

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that it's a sport and even at its

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.960 
that it's a sport and even at its
highest<00:01:24.150> base<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.890> still<00:01:26.190> has<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> defensive

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
highest base it still has a defensive

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
highest base it still has a defensive
center<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.780> sacrifices<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> central

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
center and it sacrifices the central

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.950 
center and it sacrifices the central
nervous<00:01:29.190> system<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.940> sacrifices<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> sense

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
nervous system and it sacrifices a sense

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.590 
nervous system and it sacrifices a sense
of<00:01:31.110> balance<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.770> usability<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
of balance and usability but in the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050 
of balance and usability but in the
arena<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> arena<00:01:35.159> from<00:01:35.430> which<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.850> been

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
arena in the arena from which it's been

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.240 
arena in the arena from which it's been
played<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.170> ironic<00:01:37.439> situation

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
played it's it's a very ironic situation

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.910 
played it's it's a very ironic situation
to<00:01:39.240> watch<00:01:39.420> very<00:01:39.900> smart<00:01:40.260> people<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.830> that's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
to watch very smart people and that's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.469 
to watch very smart people and that's
what<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> give<00:01:41.460> them<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.000> races<00:01:42.330> are

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
what I give them I think the races are

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.380 
what I give them I think the races are
very<00:01:42.659> smart<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.909> give<00:01:45.060> them<00:01:45.210> what

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
very smart you have to give them what

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.429 
very smart you have to give them what
they<00:01:45.479> did<00:01:45.570> they've<00:01:45.720> taken<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.140> very

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
they did they've taken a very

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.679 
they did they've taken a very
interesting<00:01:47.130> approach<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.000> arena<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
interesting approach to that arena and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.190 
interesting approach to that arena and
they<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.500> put<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.100> very<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:51.200> very

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
they they put it in a very a very

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.859 
they they put it in a very a very
interesting<00:01:52.500> process<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.970> which<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:54.810> can

takedown<00:05:17.880> then<00:05:18.240> let<00:05:18.390> me<00:05:18.480> show<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.720> something

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
takedown then let me show you something

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.070 
takedown then let me show you something
and<00:05:19.650> we<00:05:19.800> show<00:05:20.010> them<00:05:20.250> some<00:05:20.460> of<00:05:20.580> our<00:05:21.080> scientific

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
and we show them some of our scientific

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.320 
and we show them some of our scientific
processes<00:05:22.590> of<00:05:22.830> how<00:05:23.010> the<00:05:23.070> body<00:05:23.310> works<00:05:23.730> can<00:05:24.210> we

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
processes of how the body works can we

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.020 
processes of how the body works can we
show<00:05:24.510> them<00:05:24.570> some<00:05:24.840> unique<00:05:25.290> things<00:05:25.550> about<00:05:26.550> how

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
show them some unique things about how

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.750 
show them some unique things about how
how<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.780> truly<00:05:28.200> do<00:05:28.590> relaxation<00:05:29.160> techniques

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
how you truly do relaxation techniques

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.240 
how you truly do relaxation techniques
and<00:05:29.970> how<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.150> understand<00:05:31.070> vertical<00:05:32.070> and

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
and how you understand vertical and

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.070 
and how you understand vertical and
horizontal<00:05:32.280> planes<00:05:33.120> if<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.480> understand<00:05:33.960> this

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
horizontal planes if you understand this

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.720 
horizontal planes if you understand this
just<00:05:34.320> by<00:05:34.470> laying<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.860> hand<00:05:35.070> here<00:05:35.340> it

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
just by laying the hand here it

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.700 
just by laying the hand here it
nullifies<00:05:35.970> everything<00:05:36.750> else<00:05:36.960> immediately

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
nullifies everything else immediately

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.830 
nullifies everything else immediately
into<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.310> fight<00:05:38.550> it<00:05:39.000> doesn't<00:05:39.390> last<00:05:39.570> for<00:05:39.810> a

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
into the fight it doesn't last for a

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.700 
into the fight it doesn't last for a
minute<00:05:40.170> it<00:05:40.890> lasts<00:05:41.130> as<00:05:41.340> long<00:05:41.370> as<00:05:41.700> you<00:05:42.080> apply<00:05:43.080> the

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
minute it lasts as long as you apply the

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.890 
minute it lasts as long as you apply the
compression<00:05:44.100> movement<00:05:44.700> so<00:05:45.270> compression<00:05:45.810> that

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
compression movement so compression that

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.480 
compression movement so compression that
we<00:05:45.960> come<00:05:46.290> out<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.620> we're<00:05:46.770> having<00:05:46.980> tapes<00:05:47.310> that

we come out and we're having tapes that

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.920 
we come out and we're having tapes that
we're<00:05:47.580> coming<00:05:47.850> out<00:05:47.910> dealing<00:05:48.300> with<00:05:48.420> it<00:05:48.540> first

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
with us we teach the actual life and

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.490 
with us we teach the actual life and
death<00:06:21.150> kind<00:06:21.420> of<00:06:21.480> concept<00:06:21.900> of<00:06:21.990> where<00:06:22.140> we're<00:06:22.380> not

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
death kind of concept of where we're not

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.720 
death kind of concept of where we're not
going<00:06:22.680> to<00:06:22.740> mess<00:06:22.860> around<00:06:22.980> and<00:06:23.190> grapple<00:06:23.640> and

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730
