00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.299
 that this is a tutorial to remove the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:18.120
 keyboard of a hp powerbook 45 30s 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.690
 that we started 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.020
 what are we going to occupy today disarmed 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.730
 the cross 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:30.300
 an unarmed with point plan 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.040
 any town that has not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.040
 and I'm using a cover 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.090
 it is the object of a computer 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.450
 then the first thing that we have to 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.860
 to do is to remove the battery 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.860
 on their faces in the middle of these two 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.040
 both are 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.250
 padlocks 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.210
 a pile then you have to remove this 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.110
 screw to be able 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.110
 start doing after the stage 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.110
 need it 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.460
 we push is the means 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.610
 and this pushes 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.939
 we remove 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.240
 the following is 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.060
 remove this screw and this one has 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.290
 a keyboard drawing 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.290
 then let's remove them 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.299
 what 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.280
 ready then here's another drawing of 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.380
 keyboard but there's no screw out there 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.670
 let's push the keyboard 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.360
 that then we open the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.360
 the screen 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.130
 and in this vow where there is no screw no 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.679
 has the keyboard drawing we're going to 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.630
 push it a little bit so that it 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.920
 state fonts 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.920
 when so that they can see 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.060
 then we push it 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.519
 how it gets up a little bit 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.480
 little raised 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.610
 and ready 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.190
 after 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.190
 let's have a shovel 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.030
 we are going to mount several clicks that has 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.700
 here 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.709
 what happened 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.599
 It also has glue on the edges 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.190
 the same is going to go as it is taking off 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.900
 a tape 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.900
 they raise us little by little 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.190
 fair 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.190
 nothing 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.770
 ready 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.060

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.430

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.530
 inflexible romÃ¡n we throw it 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.049
 the space the code 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.069
 on the track 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.069
