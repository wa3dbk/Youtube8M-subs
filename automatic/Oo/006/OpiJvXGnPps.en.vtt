00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.130
 inclusion of sets 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.710
 be carry two sets if it happens that 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.920
 every element of a belongs to say 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.809
 what 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.390
 this includes what is part must or 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.130
 that also as a whole must and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.420
 we will write that it is included in b s 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.520
 it would be the symbology of inclusion 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.600
 for the demonstrations I will use 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.600
 the following definition 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.770
 even if only yes 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.940
 for all x 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:46.430
 that belongs 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:53.060
 and is going to have that x belongs to 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:55.160
 then x can also belong ab 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.740
 graphically for example we have the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.840
 universal set in the figures 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.820
 we can see that the whole a is 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.300
 within the set b that means 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.270
 which is included in b 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.670
 now if we consider an element of 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.220
 set to an x 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.220
 we see that this x belongs to the set 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.740
 blue is to say the set to but also 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.619
 this x belongs to the set b then 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.320
 in this way we are demonstrating that x 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.930
 belongs to then sx must belong 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.390
 ab 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.030
 and this we are going to use for the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.700
 joint demonstrations 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.760
 example we have the universal set 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.790
 which is the natural numbers the whole 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.770
 has been through elements 1 and 2 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.270
 we have the whole state by 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.320
 Elements 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.140
 for example I have the set here is 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.320
 represented by 12 and the set of is 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.439
 1 2 3 4 and 5 we realize 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.520
 graphically that the set is inside 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.850
 from set b 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.409
 then we can say that the set to 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.409
 is included in the set b
