00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
distance cast the rod has much more

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.679 
distance cast the rod has much more
power<00:02:04.829> into<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:06.029> middle<00:02:07.029> and<00:02:07.209> bottom

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
power into the middle and bottom

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.259 
power into the middle and bottom
sections<00:02:07.899> of<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.319> rod<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:09.250> also<00:02:09.459> may<00:02:09.759> take<00:02:10.060> a

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
sections of the rod it also may take a

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.780 
sections of the rod it also may take a
little<00:02:10.420> longer<00:02:10.569> distance<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.739> make<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.640> rod

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
little longer distance to make the rod

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.260 
little longer distance to make the rod
feel<00:02:13.239> like<00:02:13.540> you're<00:02:13.750> bending

feel like you're bending

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.900 
feel like you're bending
the<00:02:14.360> cast<00:02:14.630> correctly<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:15.980> these<00:02:16.250> are<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> two

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
the cast correctly so these are the two

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.270 
the cast correctly so these are the two
primary<00:02:17.300> components<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.260> rod<00:02:18.530> action<00:02:18.980> where

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
primary components of rod action where

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.820 
primary components of rod action where
does<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.610> flex<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.240> how<00:02:20.870> much<00:02:21.140> does<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.560> flex

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
does it flex and how much does it flex

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.400 
does it flex and how much does it flex
any<00:02:22.220> other<00:02:22.460> major<00:02:23.060> purchase<00:02:23.630> or<00:02:23.870> even<00:02:24.290> a

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
would match that sport I'd pick try to

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.340 
would match that sport I'd pick try to
pick<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.550> out<00:03:37.610> of<00:03:37.850> what<00:03:37.940> you'd<00:03:38.090> be<00:03:38.209> doing<00:03:38.350> 80

pick that out of what you'd be doing 80

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.930 
pick that out of what you'd be doing 80
or<00:03:39.500> 90<00:03:39.709> percent<00:03:39.830> of<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.160> time<00:03:40.370> with<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.640> rod<00:03:40.910> and

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
or 90 percent of the time with a rod and

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.400 
or 90 percent of the time with a rod and
that'd<00:03:41.360> be<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.540> first<00:03:41.690> one<00:03:41.990> you'd<00:03:42.140> want<00:03:42.170> to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
that'd be the first one you'd want to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.230 
that'd be the first one you'd want to
learn<00:03:42.590> with<00:03:42.770> but<00:03:43.250> it's<00:03:43.370> really<00:03:43.700> critical<00:03:44.180> you

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
learn with but it's really critical you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.540 
learn with but it's really critical you
balanced<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.870> rod<00:03:44.959> with<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.560> line<00:03:45.770> they're

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
balanced the rod with the line they're

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.640 
balanced the rod with the line they're
nice<00:03:46.730> real<00:03:47.030> Ford<00:03:47.360> but<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.690> line<00:03:48.140> weight<00:03:48.470> of

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
nice real Ford but the line weight of

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.970 
nice real Ford but the line weight of
course<00:03:48.830> has<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.370> pull<00:03:50.060> these<00:03:50.209> flies<00:03:50.540> around

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
course has to pull these flies around

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.370 
course has to pull these flies around
easily<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.550> has<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.880> load<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.240> rod<00:03:53.420> down<00:03:53.690> so

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
easily and has to load the rod down so

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.730 
easily and has to load the rod down so
balanced<00:03:54.950> clearly<00:03:55.280> that's<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.520> key
