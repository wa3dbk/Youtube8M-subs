00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.090 
screws on to now I didn't think that
hard<00:02:00.780> about<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.110> being<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.649> big<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.890> an<00:02:01.979> issue

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
hard about it being that big of an issue

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980 
hard about it being that big of an issue
but<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:02.790> mother-in-law<00:02:03.270> had<00:02:03.450> mentioned<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.899> me

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
but my mother-in-law had mentioned to me

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.600 
but my mother-in-law had mentioned to me
that<00:02:04.020> she<00:02:04.259> bought<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.219> she<00:02:05.399> bought<00:02:05.579> a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
that she bought one and she bought a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.839 
that she bought one and she bought a
darker<00:02:06.060> red<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.710> leaked<00:02:08.039> everywhere

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
darker red one and it leaked everywhere

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.730 
darker red one and it leaked everywhere
in<00:02:08.940> her<00:02:09.119> purse<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.129> me<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.940> very

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
in her purse so that to me is a very

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.800 
in her purse so that to me is a very
fealty<00:02:13.130> issue<00:02:13.340> at<00:02:13.640> packaging<00:02:14.180> now<00:02:14.330> mine<00:02:14.600> did

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
fealty issue at packaging now mine did

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.600 
fealty issue at packaging now mine did
not<00:02:14.930> leak<00:02:15.260> all<00:02:15.470> over<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:15.980> as<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.250> said<00:02:16.430> if<00:02:16.520> you

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
not leak all over but as I said if you

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.610 
not leak all over but as I said if you
looked<00:02:16.820> at<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:16.970> close<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:18.110> definitely

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
looked at that close up it definitely

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.340

did<00:02:18.860> kind<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.550> start<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.910> spread<00:02:20.660> out<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.170> guess

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
did kind of start to spread out I guess

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.520

say you would throw it in your purse but

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.080 
say you would throw it in your purse but
I'd<00:03:39.710> be<00:03:39.830> careful<00:03:40.100> with<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.310> in<00:03:40.550> case<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.910> does

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
I'd be careful with that in case it does

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.970 
I'd be careful with that in case it does
leak<00:03:41.390> because<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.410> don't<00:03:42.530> want<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.740> I've

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
leak because I don't want that I've

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.430
