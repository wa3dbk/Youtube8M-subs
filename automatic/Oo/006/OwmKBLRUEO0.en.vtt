you<00:00:19.020> know<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.619> were<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:20.160> bit<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> same

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
you know we were a little bit the same

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.550 
you know we were a little bit the same
with<00:00:20.939> lynnster<00:00:21.390> if<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.960> do<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.289> injuries

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
with lynnster if you do have injuries

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.170 
with lynnster if you do have injuries
here<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> little<00:00:23.100> bit<00:00:23.250> compromise<00:00:23.760> then<00:00:24.029> you've

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
here a little bit compromise then you've

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.099 
here a little bit compromise then you've
got<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.420> try<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.570> fight<00:00:24.840> your<00:00:24.990> way<00:00:25.080> through

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
got to try to fight your way through

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.580 
got to try to fight your way through
those<00:00:26.039> periods<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.960> you<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:28.019> I'd<00:00:28.199> certainly

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
those periods and you know I'd certainly

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.460 
those periods and you know I'd certainly
sympathize<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.390> recent<00:00:31.199> Irish

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
sympathize with the recent Irish

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.840 
sympathize with the recent Irish
performances<00:00:32.130> because<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.300> think<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.960> any

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
performances because I think in any

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.680 
performances because I think in any
results<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.880> might<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.360> gone<00:00:36.510> their

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
results that might not have gone their

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.690 
results that might not have gone their
way<00:00:36.719> could<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.230> mitigated<00:00:37.410> by<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> fact<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
way could be mitigated by the fact that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.200 
way could be mitigated by the fact that
a<00:00:38.790> number<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.980> key<00:00:40.980> players<00:00:41.280> were<00:00:41.579> missing<00:00:41.969> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
a number of key players were missing and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.360 
a number of key players were missing and
I<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.840> even<00:00:42.989> if<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.500> look<00:00:43.680> at<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.280> way

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
I think even if you look at the way

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.430 
I think even if you look at the way
months<00:00:44.700> are<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.450> recharged

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
months are have have recharged

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.200 
months are have have recharged
themselves<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.219> these<00:00:47.399> last<00:00:47.610> couple<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.059> weeks

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
themselves in these last couple of weeks

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.240 
themselves in these last couple of weeks
when<00:00:48.450> they've<00:00:48.719> got<00:00:48.899> key<00:00:49.110> players<00:00:49.410> back<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.980> know

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
when they've got key players back I know

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.330 
when they've got key players back I know
for<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.539> lead<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.590> you're

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
for for lead so it's the same so you're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.910 
for for lead so it's the same so you're
I<00:00:53.489> guess<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.329> hope<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.840> Ireland<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.710> will

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I guess I I hope that Ireland we will

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.459 
I guess I I hope that Ireland we will
have<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.420> an<00:00:57.840> injury<00:00:58.050> free

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
have a little bit of an injury free

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.490 
have a little bit of an injury free
period<00:00:58.949> or<00:00:59.280> less<00:01:00.000> injury<00:01:00.449> anyway<00:01:00.780> than<00:01:00.989> has

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
period or less injury anyway than has

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.770 
period or less injury anyway than has
happened<00:01:02.460> lately<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.000> we'll<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.539> able<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
happened lately and we'll be able to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.140 
happened lately and we'll be able to
gather<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> group<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.400> collective

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
gather that group that collective

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.620 
gather that group that collective
together<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.760> hopefully<00:01:08.760> put<00:01:09.360> out<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
together and and hopefully put out the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
together and and hopefully put out the
performances<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.799> will<00:01:11.400> meet<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
performances that that will meet the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.560 
performances that that will meet the
expectation<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> hope<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.580> some

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
expectation of of what I hope as is some

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.960 
expectation of of what I hope as is some
really<00:01:15.750> good<00:01:15.960> support<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.400> only<00:01:17.520> details

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
really good support and the only details

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.660 
really good support and the only details
on<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.330> backroom<00:01:18.720> team<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.140> stage

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
on your backroom team at this stage

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
on your backroom team at this stage
uh-huh<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:22.110> own<00:01:22.140> details

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
uh-huh now I just got my own details

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.010 
uh-huh now I just got my own details
today<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.299> little<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.659> hard<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
today so it's a little bit hard to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.350 
today so it's a little bit hard to
predict<00:01:25.890> anything<00:01:26.220> further<00:01:27.030> ahead<00:01:27.210> than

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
predict anything further ahead than

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.690 
predict anything further ahead than
there<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.930> stage<00:01:29.270> as<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.509> say<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:31.439> had<00:01:31.560> a

phillips-head<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.970> had<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> pretty<00:01:33.450> big<00:01:33.540> game

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869

their RFU for trying to fit million and
around<00:01:44.729> schedules<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.920> we

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
around schedules so that so that we

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.590 
around schedules so that so that we
could<00:01:47.189> get<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.030> cohesion

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
could get a little bit of cohesion

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.039 
could get a little bit of cohesion
between<00:01:49.070> my<00:01:50.070> day<00:01:50.130> job<00:01:50.490> currently<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
between my day job currently and a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.550 
between my day job currently and a
prospective<00:01:52.770> job

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.740 

not<00:01:59.560> as<00:01:59.740> yet<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.280> be<00:02:00.430> honest<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.869> know<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:02.710> think

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
not as yet to be honest you know I think

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.319 
not as yet to be honest you know I think
as<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:05.020> said<00:02:05.259> before<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.770> had<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.280> job<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.820> think<00:02:06.970> I

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
as I said before I had the job I think I

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.290 
as I said before I had the job I think I
struggle<00:02:07.780> with<00:02:07.810> speculation<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:09.149> I'd<00:02:10.149> rather

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
struggle with speculation and I'd rather

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300 
struggle with speculation and I'd rather
have<00:02:10.509> something<00:02:10.959> concrete<00:02:11.140> because<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.250> think

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
have something concrete because I think

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.960 
have something concrete because I think
speculation<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.269> irritably<00:02:14.519> can<00:02:15.519> lead<00:02:15.700> to

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
speculation and irritably can lead to

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.470 
speculation and irritably can lead to
some<00:02:16.450> people<00:02:16.750> being<00:02:16.989> disinterested<00:02:17.500> when<00:02:18.480> we

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
some people being disinterested when we

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.120 
some people being disinterested when we
might<00:02:19.660> be<00:02:19.810> interested<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.349> trying<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.950> include

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
might be interested in trying to include

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.839 
might be interested in trying to include
them<00:02:21.430> or<00:02:21.580> or<00:02:21.970> otherwise<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:22.840> at<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:23.170> stage

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
the next four to six weeks because even

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.039 
the next four to six weeks because even
during<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.610> four<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.970> six<00:02:31.180> weeks<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:31.569> will

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
during that four to six weeks we will

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.530 
during that four to six weeks we will
still<00:02:32.290> have<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:33.100> number<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.970> things<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.450> we

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
still have a number of things that we

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.330 
still have a number of things that we
have<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.840> do<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.260> Elise<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.920> framework

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
have to do and Elise the framework

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.559 
have to do and Elise the framework
hopefully<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.180> next<00:02:37.390> four<00:02:37.540> weeks

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
hopefully for the next four weeks

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.140 
hopefully for the next four weeks
whether<00:02:38.140> that'll<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.440> determined<00:02:39.000> over<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
whether that'll be determined over the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.620 
whether that'll be determined over the
coming<00:02:40.989> weeks<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.530> if<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.640> is<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.000> bulk<00:02:43.510> of

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
coming weeks but if that is the bulk of

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.229 
coming weeks but if that is the bulk of
my<00:02:43.690> time<00:02:44.010> hopefully<00:02:45.010> beyond<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:46.209> few

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
my time hopefully beyond that and a few

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.750 
my time hopefully beyond that and a few
in<00:02:46.569> Windows<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:47.349> amongst<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.709> we'll<00:02:48.610> be<00:02:48.700> able

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
in Windows in amongst that we'll be able

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.229 
in Windows in amongst that we'll be able
to<00:02:48.849> sort<00:02:49.030> through<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.450> yeah<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:51.430> be<00:02:51.459> honest<00:02:51.790> I

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
to sort through that yeah to be honest I

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.059 
to sort through that yeah to be honest I
know<00:02:52.780> Lee<00:02:52.930> has<00:02:53.019> reasonably<00:02:53.349> well<00:02:53.560> I've<00:02:53.890> worked

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
know Lee has reasonably well I've worked

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.380 
know Lee has reasonably well I've worked
with<00:02:54.250> him<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.459> little<00:02:54.610> bit<00:02:54.760> when<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.060> tried<00:02:55.360> to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
with him a little bit when we tried to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.390 
with him a little bit when we tried to
get<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:55.630> mental<00:02:55.900> insert<00:02:56.290> when<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.650> first<00:02:56.980> started

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
get a mental insert when I first started

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.690 
get a mental insert when I first started
and<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.299> yeah<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.019> think<00:02:59.470> he's<00:02:59.920> incredibly

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
and so yeah I think he's incredibly

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.590 
and so yeah I think he's incredibly
capable<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.329> and<00:03:01.690> for<00:03:02.590> me<00:03:03.060> I'm<00:03:04.060> pretty<00:03:04.299> busy

want<00:04:09.939> to<00:04:10.000> be<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.120> heat

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
want to be a heat

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.260 
want to be a heat
but<00:04:11.360> I've<00:04:11.510> really<00:04:11.810> enjoyed<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.260> experience

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
but I've really enjoyed the experience

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.340 
but I've really enjoyed the experience
after<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.360> first<00:04:14.570> four<00:04:14.750> weeks<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.170> first

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
after the first four weeks the first

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.500 
after the first four weeks the first
four<00:04:15.560> weeks<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.890> wasn't<00:04:16.160> enjoying<00:04:16.330> that<00:04:17.330> might

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
four weeks I wasn't enjoying that might

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.120 
four weeks I wasn't enjoying that might
have<00:04:17.600> been<00:04:17.720> because<00:04:17.900> we<00:04:18.200> kept<00:04:18.350> losing<00:04:18.560> but<00:04:18.920> I

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
have been because we kept losing but I

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.290 
have been because we kept losing but I
think<00:04:20.000> at<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.239> same<00:04:20.420> time<00:04:21.760> I'm<00:04:22.760> really

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
think at the same time I'm really

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.720 
think at the same time I'm really
motivated<00:04:23.480> by<00:04:23.810> challenge<00:04:24.260> I<00:04:24.650> think<00:04:25.160> this<00:04:25.310> is<00:04:25.490> a

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
motivated by challenge I think this is a

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.260 
motivated by challenge I think this is a
super<00:04:26.180> challenge<00:04:26.590> albeit<00:04:27.590> an<00:04:28.580> intimidating

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
super challenge albeit an intimidating

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.470 
super challenge albeit an intimidating
one<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:30.760> guess<00:04:31.760> if<00:04:31.940> you're<00:04:32.090> going<00:04:32.240> to

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
one and I guess if you're going to

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.470 
one and I guess if you're going to
really<00:04:33.440> find<00:04:33.680> out<00:04:33.830> what<00:04:34.790> you<00:04:34.820> think<00:04:35.120> you<00:04:35.300> can

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
really find out what you think you can

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.320 
really find out what you think you can
bring<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.720> a<00:04:35.840> group<00:04:36.640> what<00:04:37.640> better<00:04:37.850> way<00:04:38.030> then

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
bring to a group what better way then

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.720 
bring to a group what better way then
then<00:04:38.600> try<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.900> take<00:04:39.140> on<00:04:39.350> one<00:04:40.130> of<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.310> big<00:04:40.460> jobs

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
then try to take on one of the big jobs

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.390 
then try to take on one of the big jobs

ambitions for the national national team
European<00:04:57.410> level<00:04:57.620> looking<00:04:58.810> again<00:04:59.810> that<00:05:00.050> was

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
European level looking again that was

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.750 
European level looking again that was
that<00:05:00.650> was<00:05:00.770> something<00:05:00.920> that<00:05:01.160> wasn't<00:05:01.460> meant<00:05:01.730> to

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
that was something that wasn't meant to

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.360 
that was something that wasn't meant to
leak<00:05:02.030> into<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.480> public<00:05:02.900> domain<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.590> was<00:05:03.740> you

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
leak into the public domain that was you

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.130 
leak into the public domain that was you
know<00:05:04.460> we<00:05:04.610> had<00:05:04.730> a<00:05:04.760> few<00:05:05.000> key<00:05:05.240> targets<00:05:05.780> there's<00:05:06.020> a

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
know we had a few key targets there's a

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.600 
know we had a few key targets there's a
few<00:05:06.320> others<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:07.400> I<00:05:08.120> won't<00:05:08.510> divulge<00:05:08.930> but<00:05:09.290> I

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
few others that I won't divulge but I

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.470 
few others that I won't divulge but I
think<00:05:10.610> when<00:05:10.730> you<00:05:10.820> get<00:05:10.940> your<00:05:11.120> group<00:05:11.300> together

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
think when you get your group together

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.960 
think when you get your group together
you<00:05:12.320> have<00:05:12.470> a<00:05:12.500> look<00:05:12.740> at<00:05:12.860> what<00:05:12.980> they<00:05:13.070> can<00:05:13.310> do<00:05:13.520> I

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
you have a look at what they can do I

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.000 
you have a look at what they can do I
had<00:05:14.450> the<00:05:14.570> chance<00:05:14.750> with<00:05:15.110> lynched<00:05:15.410> I<00:05:15.500> knew<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:15.800> was

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
had the chance with lynched I knew I was

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.980 
had the chance with lynched I knew I was
coming<00:05:16.310> three<00:05:16.550> months<00:05:16.790> beforehand<00:05:17.360> I<00:05:17.570> had<00:05:17.960> a

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
coming three months beforehand I had a

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.080 
coming three months beforehand I had a
good<00:05:18.200> chance<00:05:18.440> we<00:05:19.040> obviously<00:05:19.400> when<00:05:19.790> I<00:05:19.820> was<00:05:19.970> with

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
good chance we obviously when I was with

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.600 
good chance we obviously when I was with
chemo<00:05:20.450> we<00:05:20.750> we<00:05:21.080> played<00:05:21.320> them<00:05:21.560> in<00:05:21.770> a

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
chemo we we played them in a

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.490 
chemo we we played them in a
quarterfinal<00:05:23.060> of<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.480> Heineken<00:05:23.690> Cup<00:05:23.810> so<00:05:24.260> I

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
quarterfinal of the Heineken Cup so I

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.230 
quarterfinal of the Heineken Cup so I
had<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:24.890> good<00:05:25.070> chance<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.460> have<00:05:25.670> a<00:05:25.700> good<00:05:25.910> look<00:05:26.090> at

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
had a good chance to have a good look at

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.790 
had a good chance to have a good look at
some<00:05:26.360> of<00:05:26.480> their<00:05:26.570> players<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:26.990> I<00:05:27.440> just<00:05:27.650> thought

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
some of their players and I just thought

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.530 
some of their players and I just thought
that<00:05:27.860> there<00:05:28.730> were<00:05:28.820> some<00:05:28.850> things<00:05:29.000> that<00:05:29.420> they

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
that there were some things that they

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.960 
that there were some things that they
did<00:05:29.720> really<00:05:29.900> well<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.290> some<00:05:30.440> things<00:05:30.500> that<00:05:30.970> you

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
did really well and some things that you

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.890 
did really well and some things that you
know<00:05:32.060> if<00:05:32.150> they<00:05:32.270> could<00:05:32.330> do<00:05:32.510> a<00:05:32.540> little<00:05:32.780> bit

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
know if they could do a little bit

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.630 
know if they could do a little bit
better<00:05:33.020> maybe<00:05:33.320> we<00:05:33.620> could<00:05:33.800> grow<00:05:33.950> our<00:05:34.160> game<00:05:34.370> and

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
better maybe we could grow our game and

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.670 
better maybe we could grow our game and
so<00:05:34.820> I've<00:05:35.810> had<00:05:35.960> a<00:05:35.990> good<00:05:36.170> chance<00:05:36.380> they<00:05:36.560> have<00:05:36.650> a

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
so I've had a good chance they have a

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.560 
so I've had a good chance they have a
look<00:05:36.890> at<00:05:37.010> a<00:05:37.040> lot<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.730> Irish<00:05:37.970> players<00:05:38.240> and

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
look at a lot of the Irish players and

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.930 
look at a lot of the Irish players and
and<00:05:38.750> once<00:05:39.020> we<00:05:39.230> kind<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:39.710> get<00:05:39.950> our<00:05:40.190> collective

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
and once we kind of get our collective

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.930 
and once we kind of get our collective
together<00:05:41.860> we'll<00:05:42.860> try<00:05:43.070> to<00:05:43.130> get<00:05:43.280> some<00:05:43.340> process

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
together we'll try to get some process

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.240 
together we'll try to get some process
orientated<00:05:44.600> goals<00:05:44.810> no<00:05:45.320> doubt<00:05:45.530> together<00:05:45.920> that

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
orientated goals no doubt together that

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.370 
orientated goals no doubt together that
that<00:05:46.880> will<00:05:47.060> try<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.980> improve<00:05:48.980> performance<00:05:49.220> or

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
that will try to improve performance or

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.560 
that will try to improve performance or
at<00:05:51.380> least<00:05:51.680> make<00:05:51.980> us<00:05:52.190> as<00:05:52.520> competitive<00:05:53.419> as

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
at least make us as competitive as

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:05.010 
at least make us as competitive as
possible

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.020 

well<00:06:06.020> look<00:06:06.560> he's<00:06:06.770> put<00:06:07.340> some<00:06:07.460> pressure<00:06:07.610> on<00:06:07.880> me

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
well look he's put some pressure on me

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.080 
well look he's put some pressure on me
so<00:06:08.300> I<00:06:08.390> think<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:09.350> know<00:06:09.470> I'd<00:06:10.160> really<00:06:10.490> like<00:06:10.970> to

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
so I think you know I'd really like to

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.720 
so I think you know I'd really like to
put<00:06:11.210> a<00:06:11.270> bit<00:06:11.450> of<00:06:11.480> pressure<00:06:11.540> on<00:06:11.900> him<00:06:12.050> I<00:06:12.200> think<00:06:12.730> you

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
put a bit of pressure on him I think you

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.600 
put a bit of pressure on him I think you

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
know we put a couple of plants in the

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.030 
know we put a couple of plants in the
crowd<00:06:16.910> to<00:06:17.120> start<00:06:17.390> their<00:06:17.570> chants

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040

think what the one thing with Brian is

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.090 
think what the one thing with Brian is
very<00:06:24.150> much<00:06:24.300> his<00:06:24.450> own<00:06:24.600> men<00:06:24.840> he'll<00:06:25.680> make<00:06:25.830> his<00:06:25.920> own

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
very much his own men he'll make his own

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.270 
very much his own men he'll make his own
decision<00:06:26.580> but<00:06:27.390> you<00:06:28.170> know<00:06:28.290> at<00:06:28.740> the<00:06:28.890> same<00:06:29.070> time

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
decision but you know at the same time

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.710 
decision but you know at the same time
it<00:06:29.400> doesn't<00:06:29.550> doesn't<00:06:30.180> stop<00:06:30.330> you're<00:06:30.480> trying<00:06:30.660> to

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.090 
it doesn't doesn't stop you're trying to
push<00:06:30.900> him<00:06:31.020> toward<00:06:31.320> one<00:06:31.500> and<00:06:31.740> so<00:06:33.470> I'd<00:06:34.470> like<00:06:34.950> to

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
that that that would be part of the

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.930 
that that that would be part of the
continuation<00:06:43.740> of<00:06:44.130> a<00:06:44.460> stellar<00:06:44.760> career

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
continuation of a stellar career

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.920 
continuation of a stellar career
hopefully<00:06:45.630> not<00:06:46.050> the<00:06:46.200> end<00:06:46.650> of<00:06:46.740> one
