00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.850 

have<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.720> figured<00:04:48.900> out<00:04:49.080> who<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.260> child<00:04:49.590> is

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
yet if you haven't you're not trying

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:12.990 
yet if you haven't you're not trying
this<00:04:54.690> game<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:55.050> fairly<00:04:55.260> cliche

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.420 

well<00:05:13.600> that<00:05:13.780> was<00:05:13.870> dangerous

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.730 

and<00:05:25.030> we<00:05:25.840> got<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.020> green<00:05:26.230> tile<00:05:26.640> with<00:05:27.640> marks<00:05:27.940> on<00:05:28.120> it

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
and we got a green tile with marks on it

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.240 
and we got a green tile with marks on it
but<00:05:30.430> for<00:05:31.150> now<00:05:31.349> I'm<00:05:32.349> going<00:05:32.470> to<00:05:32.680> say<00:05:32.830> that<00:05:33.130> is

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
but for now I'm going to say that is

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.959 
but for now I'm going to say that is
enough

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.920 

so<00:05:36.599> let<00:05:37.110> us<00:05:37.139> just

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:47.210 

save<00:05:40.710> here

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:55.679 

but

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:55.689 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.509 

okay<00:05:56.379> it's<00:05:56.529> not<00:05:56.619> letting<00:05:56.799> me<00:05:56.889> say<00:05:57.159> if<00:05:57.339> I<00:05:57.429> have

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:57.519 
okay it's not letting me say if I have

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:00.449 
okay it's not letting me say if I have
no<00:05:57.699> idea<00:05:57.789> why<00:05:58.349> but<00:05:59.349> that<00:05:59.769> shouldn't<00:06:00.279> be<00:06:00.429> a

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:00.459 
no idea why but that shouldn't be a

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:03.299 
no idea why but that shouldn't be a
problem<00:06:00.519> I'll<00:06:01.479> figure<00:06:01.599> it<00:06:01.719> out<00:06:01.839> anyways<00:06:02.739> see

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:03.309 
problem I'll figure it out anyways see

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:06.659 
problem I'll figure it out anyways see
you<00:06:03.369> guys<00:06:03.489> around<00:06:03.659> later
