00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
tendency to collect ice the second thing

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.210 
tendency to collect ice the second thing
that<00:00:40.690> happens<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.199> lot<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.440> times<00:00:41.649> you<00:00:42.040> have<00:00:42.129> to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
that happens a lot of times you have to

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.830 
that happens a lot of times you have to
tie<00:00:42.460> them<00:00:42.579> or<00:00:42.699> fix<00:00:42.879> them<00:00:43.030> onto<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.360> rod<00:00:43.510> blink

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
tie them or fix them onto the rod blink

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.720 
tie them or fix them onto the rod blink
and<00:00:44.019> over<00:00:44.440> time<00:00:44.680> those<00:00:44.860> come<00:00:45.160> loose<00:00:45.399> and<00:00:45.610> so

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
and over time those come loose and so

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.100 
and over time those come loose and so
what<00:00:46.149> are<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.329> two<00:00:46.480> things<00:00:46.690> that<00:00:46.870> I<00:00:46.960> always

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
what are the two things that I always

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.229 
what are the two things that I always
did<00:00:47.829> not<00:00:47.980> like<00:00:48.220> about<00:00:48.370> spring<00:00:48.730> bobber<00:00:48.879> so<00:00:49.120> we

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
did not like about spring bobber so we

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.939 
did not like about spring bobber so we
designed<00:00:49.540> a<00:00:49.629> series<00:00:49.839> of<00:00:49.960> spring<00:00:50.409> bobber<00:00:50.620> rods

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
designed a series of spring bobber rods

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.470 
designed a series of spring bobber rods
we<00:00:51.370> took<00:00:51.550> a<00:00:51.640> lot<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:51.879> the<00:00:52.030> things<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.300> we've

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
we took a lot of the things that we've

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.660 
we took a lot of the things that we've
learned<00:00:52.960> out<00:00:53.140> on<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.379> ice<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:53.829> put<00:00:54.220> them<00:00:54.339> into

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
learned out on the ice and put them into

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.119 
learned out on the ice and put them into
each<00:00:54.820> rod<00:00:55.120> by<00:00:55.900> far<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.290> most<00:00:56.409> best-selling

you<00:01:49.750> can<00:01:49.869> even<00:01:50.020> use<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.229> spring<00:01:50.560> bobber<00:01:50.770> outside

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
you can even use a spring bobber outside

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.979 
you can even use a spring bobber outside
in<00:01:51.489> a<00:01:51.550> lot<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:51.700> different<00:01:52.000> scenarios<00:01:52.149> we've

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
in a lot of different scenarios we've

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:55.620 
in a lot of different scenarios we've
also<00:01:53.170> used<00:01:54.039> a<00:01:54.280> more<00:01:54.670> finesse<00:01:55.090> spring<00:01:55.450> bobber

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
also used a more finesse spring bobber

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.240 
also used a more finesse spring bobber
style<00:01:55.989> and<00:01:56.140> some<00:01:56.289> of<00:01:56.380> our<00:01:56.470> shorter<00:01:56.800> lengths

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
style and some of our shorter lengths

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.740 
style and some of our shorter lengths
because<00:01:57.340> again<00:01:57.789> remember<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.420> spring

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
because again remember that a spring

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.510 
because again remember that a spring
bobber<00:01:58.929> just<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.379> not<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.619> strike<00:01:59.979> indicator<00:02:00.429> it

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
bobber just is not a strike indicator it

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.309 
bobber just is not a strike indicator it
also<00:02:00.729> influences<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.539> presentation<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.259> we

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
also influences the presentation so we

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.930 
also influences the presentation so we
get<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.619> soft<00:02:02.920> spring<00:02:03.340> bobber<00:02:03.520> on<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.819> end

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
get that soft spring bobber on the end

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.580 
get that soft spring bobber on the end
of<00:02:04.030> your<00:02:04.090> rod<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:04.780> has<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:04.929> tendency<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.440> make

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
of your rod it has a tendency to make

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.529 
of your rod it has a tendency to make
that<00:02:05.739> jig<00:02:06.220> just<00:02:06.429> dance<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:06.910> quiver<00:02:07.149> in<00:02:07.300> place

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
that jig just dance and quiver in place

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.240 
that jig just dance and quiver in place
and<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.319> itself<00:02:08.590> can<00:02:08.800> be<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.950> very

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and that in itself can be a very

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.979 
and that in itself can be a very
powerful<00:02:09.550> trigger<00:02:10.119> when<00:02:10.569> you're<00:02:10.690> trying<00:02:10.840> to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
powerful trigger when you're trying to

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.220 
powerful trigger when you're trying to
catch<00:02:11.200> fish<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:13.150> rod<00:02:13.420> right<00:02:13.450> here<00:02:13.629> is<00:02:14.050> more

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
catch fish this rod right here is more

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.589 
catch fish this rod right here is more
of<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.349> finesse<00:02:14.560> spring<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:16.209> was<00:02:16.300> just<00:02:16.480> a

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
of a finesse spring it was just a

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.350 
of a finesse spring it was just a
fiberglass<00:02:17.340> strand<00:02:18.340> with<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> globe<00:02:19.000> bead<00:02:19.209> on

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
fiberglass strand with a globe bead on

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.330 
fiberglass strand with a globe bead on
it<00:02:19.480> but<00:02:19.599> that's<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.170> very<00:02:20.379> soft<00:02:20.739> spring<00:02:21.160> bobber

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
it but that's a very soft spring bobber

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.330 
it but that's a very soft spring bobber
so<00:02:21.610> when<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.849> twitch<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.920> there's<00:02:23.920> Bob<00:02:24.129> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
so when you twitch that there's Bob that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.619 
so when you twitch that there's Bob that
spring<00:02:24.640> bobber<00:02:24.790> tipica<00:02:25.209> says<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> nice

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
spring bobber tipica says a nice

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.390 
spring bobber tipica says a nice
delicate<00:02:25.930> dance<00:02:26.349> on<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.739> end<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:26.980> jig<00:02:27.190> and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
delicate dance on the end of the jig and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.000 
delicate dance on the end of the jig and
also<00:02:27.970> our<00:02:28.090> 18<00:02:28.480> at<00:02:28.599> 24<00:02:29.080> inch<00:02:29.200> models<00:02:29.560> are<00:02:29.709> tight
