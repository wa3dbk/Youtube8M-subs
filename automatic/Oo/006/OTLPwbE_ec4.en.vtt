00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:06.869
 then i want to rate this wonderful king hitler infamous vadafone phone 

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:12.110
 that everyone knows I do in the dark to realize the game of reflections that 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.749
 Deadly cocktail on this surface 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.949
 and polishing of the wave phone on which revenge 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.310
 in the end you fire the formula of the third challenge in cm the la then 

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:28.470
 making tests I am touchy, making an analog clock but you can't 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:29.430
 choose also 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.980
 ie the digital form 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.569
 and typing over and the clock shows this 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:39.339
 and shielded this is the alarm clock that can be grown quite easily big 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.650
 very slow the fact that 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.520
 baby point out the fact that the alarm clock can obviously be used also at 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.760
 phone off this then 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.280
 the main section of the phone is that of the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.760
 to do - available but on this back 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.080
 soon before I want to show 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.620
 the part of the 3rd prohibition used to do his main poor job 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.480
 call there is batta 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.380
 typing on transcrime as you can see you can sick even petre 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.840
 quite quickly villa 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.859
 techniques on the screen because I have to say that system has been engineered 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:14.759
 very well then 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.170
 also the repetition of key presses 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.590
 em comes 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.140
 if received very well 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.660
 this is the messaging section instead of dying or writing a 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.040
 new sms just log in to this woman and then use the phone as if 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.970
 it were 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.590
 normal phone with 29 what you can see is that 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.730
 there are these 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.509
 sure lecce on the display that you can use for 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.429
 to exchange the previous word you chose from the art 9 kinda 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.880
 alternative these precedents we need it for moto guzzi laterally and therefore 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.600
 you can change then connect volume keys that is what they are 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.730
 beautiful words you have chosen from fine vocabulary of the ie of the arts no 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.469
 there is also the prose possibility of 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.479
 build 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.390
 mms sky forms so life to indicate an object to insert obviously 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.350
 it is a weighty image on its its all that can be done 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.020
 normally with some premises then in the section 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.850
 dedicated instead 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.950
 in the address book I baby on his what the rubric gives you the possibility of 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.579
 would be mordane we start from, of course 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.969
 from the beginning 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.060
 you can choose whether to store the name 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.590
 green apple zimmer also in the memory of the phone by name and surname 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.419
 I'm in one field and maybe that's something that 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.439
 they could improve us 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.450
 you can environment select a group also a photo from 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.230
 then attach allen contact that there are six major limitations to that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.210
 that you can make better respect from this point of view 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.690
 suitable products from the past so this is the main section 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.430
 of the university I find the address book and messages on halloween pepper those practices 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.469
 are the shock you find 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.559
 open your life 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:04.289
 in the recipe archive, enter this holy and archive of images and sounds 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:08.090
 of sending documents because there is no document reader within the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.640
 nice phone 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.490
 these are 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.570
 the image for example I have talcum powder if the magician does not want one perhaps 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.790
 check a nice problem is that 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.970
 I am a bit' 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.930
 it is a little slow to read books of images that arrive above all 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.720
 and when selected 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.640
 the memory card will therefore be nice to view these messages with 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.740
 beautiful of the small sabrins the delicate add to those that are the photos shown 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.950
 wishing you can but you simply go on the photograph the three you can for 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.339
 enlarge the hammer and then spotlights 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:43.159
 the species of 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.749
 there's one thing inside yours 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:50.299
 this is also the moderator archive section 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.689
 art multimedia phone very nice also the mp3 player that I show 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:56.630
 that immediately 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.410
 clicking on the song at random is enough 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.219
 select play trust me trust me 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.809
 mp3 player that reports multimedia information on the 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:09.359
 faella that you are playing excel you can simply the duration of the song 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.649
 also in this case it is possible to activate scrolling, for example 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:17.639
 within the song you simply m movendo shine slider you have 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.320
 just seen 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.690
 even the radio on mac is very complete well I have to say that it works 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.180
 and very well 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.110

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.360
 king of the arabia to the cape of 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.600
 820 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.080
 it's a sparse crown anyway 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.370
 very very sensitive tuning 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.770
 I think for example that he took care of revenue because these are the various 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.510
 selections 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.510
 entering notations changes with the finger you move 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.710

 voice memo games applications sum all that for each phone 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.010
 a report as usual 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.330
 this is also nice 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.080

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.039
