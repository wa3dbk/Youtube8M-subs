00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.910
 it happens to them from his mentor not like if valves no bolt is gone on a 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.549
 good series you progressed 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.259
 and then couderc to the old 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.700
 dallas of the first round second round a good continuation 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.749
 those little seconds 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 think galley series because early season two handles 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.119
 now there are two cuffs Russian now I'm leaving with the scaphoid 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.359
 I do not know what's going on 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.050
 why a lot given on the bike and for injuries 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.860
 so it's because his parents do not know who was driving around 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.210
 the afp 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.390
 we know that it is tricky around we say that these spaces 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.610
 to a titled to create for ballack 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.610
 the cadets in front of me on the left then right and 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.030
 there was 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.920
 three students media representatives to an ethics of his 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.870
 behavior 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.409
 the team will change the face to face over 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.759
 to really react reacted him I'm also put on the side because that 

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:01.950
 was coming all the way 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.750
 because if the bike was full so could get a little my collarbone and has 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.610
 caused a fall 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.870
 it's really in the loop - on the wrist 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.870
 the first episode 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.289
 in the difficult challenge 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.929
 difficult because the talent is well bouncing and last act title champion 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:20.960
 of Europe then the beginning since the beginning of the year 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.799
 it's not going on the stage but in a better way we're talking about a fight and escaped 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.810
 jordy bishop in the top 15 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.579
 I think in the corner you have 15 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.830
 it seems to me 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.030
 I worked well this winter at the beginning of the season it was badly pinned as soon as 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.950
 the beginning 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.540
 from the standpoint 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.210
 ambitious 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.780
 the day correctly 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 in health it was better 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.120
 he leaves for a tour a first for injury 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.530
 while paco of the bike is good and it has galley to all and not 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.620
 a lot of things 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.070
 the room is much better but it was not a bike to play long 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.799
 no it depends the objectives of this hen dice 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770
 the name of stÃ©phane 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.060
 in front of them they still have a moment of evolution 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.500
 for a top 15 minutes 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.860
 % and + that close this complicated on the site continues to find a handlebar in 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.449
 hand for next season 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:13.169
 see we are setting times 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:15.629
 monteyne content still happy with me they know how I work 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.819
 after grabbing with wounds now 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.069
 we will see what is better one month I signed a contract for two years 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.989
 So how is it going 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.989
 Tonight I think we will surely be disappointed 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.219
 so there the first to the point and who knows if the strongest winds for 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:31.589
 them 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:34.309
 because they have already started of course if doctors hope that the 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.309
 message when a little bit constraining 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.579
 I hope that outside of the cases it is a miracle a miracle to the monks but good 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.590
 here we are going to change the course of the ton in belgium to train 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.039
 in Marseille 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:51.169
 it's a holiday theme I hope by year if ever there was a 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.169
 interruption of motocross at the trial after six tests on the program 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.859
 hello from lorient I do not know at all 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.639
 we start again 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.049
 before it was hard to hurt he will bounce 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:03.950
 support 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.379
 if I have my place next year 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.519
 if I have an opportunity it's a championship by the end of the season is 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.799
 not stopped from returning next year 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.420
 the manceau does not discourage luck
