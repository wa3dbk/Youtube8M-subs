this<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.990> bring<00:01:16.770> us<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> forefront<00:01:17.930> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
this to bring us to the forefront the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.090 
this to bring us to the forefront the
male<00:01:19.080> characters<00:01:19.470> are<00:01:19.590> strong<00:01:19.740> female

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
male characters are strong female

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
think Asian males have been marginalized

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
think Asian males have been marginalized
to<00:01:24.930> sexualize<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.380> times<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.890> characters

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to sexualize the times but characters

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.399 
to sexualize the times but characters
like<00:01:26.430> Tadashi<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> hero<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.720> strong<00:01:28.020> yeah

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
like Tadashi and hero very strong yeah

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.190 
like Tadashi and hero very strong yeah
very<00:01:28.710> capable<00:01:29.210> charismatic<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> intelligent
