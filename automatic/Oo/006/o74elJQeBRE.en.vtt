department and you're you're making all

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.460 
department and you're you're making all
these<00:01:23.119> prototypes<00:01:23.479> are<00:01:23.720> otherwise<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.290> your

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
these prototypes are otherwise and your

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.080 
these prototypes are otherwise and your
do<00:01:24.829> you<00:01:24.950> do<00:01:25.070> real-world<00:01:25.490> testing<00:01:25.909> for

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
do you do real-world testing for

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.219 
do you do real-world testing for
something<00:01:26.329> like<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.509> front<00:01:26.840> wheel<00:01:26.930> cover

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
something like a front wheel cover

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.469 
something like a front wheel cover
that's<00:01:27.619> all<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:27.860> do<00:01:28.040> is<00:01:28.189> take<00:01:28.820> trucks<00:01:29.119> out<00:01:29.329> on

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
that's all I do is take trucks out on

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.420 
that's all I do is take trucks out on
other<00:01:29.659> Road<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.110> burn<00:01:30.710> fuel<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:31.310> our

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
other Road and burn fuel so our

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.880 
other Road and burn fuel so our
customers<00:01:31.820> really<00:01:31.880> don't<00:01:32.299> have<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.740> aka<00:01:33.740> the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
customers really don't have to aka the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.310 
customers really don't have to aka the
fuel<00:01:34.250> maestro<00:01:34.640> areas<00:01:35.210> ok<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:35.840> let's<00:01:36.110> walk<00:01:36.290> down

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
fuel maestro areas ok so let's walk down

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.959 
fuel maestro areas ok so let's walk down
the<00:01:36.590> side<00:01:36.799> here<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.009> little<00:01:37.130> bit<00:01:37.250> ok<00:01:37.670> what<00:01:37.880> about

the side here a little bit ok what about

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:39.700 
the side here a little bit ok what about
these<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.450> fairing<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.049> skirts<00:01:39.350> here<00:01:39.619> is

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
these the fairing and the skirts here is

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.139 
these the fairing and the skirts here is
that<00:01:39.860> something<00:01:40.189> that<00:01:40.219> you<00:01:40.430> can<00:01:40.610> buy<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.789> kick

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
that something that you can buy a kick

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.209 
that something that you can buy a kick
that<00:01:41.360> comes<00:01:41.539> with<00:01:41.659> your<00:01:41.750> Cascadia<00:01:42.289> ition

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
that comes with your Cascadia ition

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.980 
that comes with your Cascadia ition
everything<00:01:43.670> along<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.090> side<00:01:44.299> of<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.479> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
everything along the side of the the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.679 
everything along the side of the the
vehicle<00:01:45.950> here<00:01:46.250> on<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.640> aerodynamic<00:01:47.270> surfaces

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
rubber skirt right here plastic is it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.520 
rubber skirt right here plastic is it
rubber<00:01:52.250> car<00:01:52.520> that<00:01:52.729> it's<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:53.149> rubber<00:01:53.539> skirt<00:01:54.140> here

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
rubber car that it's a rubber skirt here

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.620 
rubber car that it's a rubber skirt here
does<00:01:55.280> what<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.579> what<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:55.789> serves<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.270> do<00:01:56.420> is

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
does what it what it serves to do is

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.599 
does what it what it serves to do is
block<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.560> air<00:01:57.740> from<00:01:58.130> getting<00:01:58.159> underneath

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
block the air from getting underneath

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.160 
block the air from getting underneath
the<00:01:58.850> vehicle<00:01:59.000> getting<00:01:59.509> trapped<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.079> then

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
the vehicle getting trapped and then

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.440 
the vehicle getting trapped and then
smashed<00:02:00.530> into<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.979> rear<00:02:01.159> axle<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.180> it's<00:02:02.329> like

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
smashed into the rear axle so it's like

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.060 
smashed into the rear axle so it's like
an<00:02:02.570> airfoil<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.049> what<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.439> there<00:02:03.590> what<00:02:03.619> are

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
an airfoil and what is there what are

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.469 
an airfoil and what is there what are
the<00:02:04.159> components<00:02:04.430> made<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:04.939> I<00:02:05.060> mean<00:02:05.210> I'm<00:02:05.450> sure

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
the components made of I mean I'm sure

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.969 
the components made of I mean I'm sure
that<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.200> look<00:02:06.409> at<00:02:06.530> weight<00:02:06.770> and

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
that you you look at weight and

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.350 
that you you look at weight and
everything<00:02:07.250> else<00:02:07.399> what<00:02:07.850> kind<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.119> tea<00:02:08.240> really

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
everything else what kind of tea really

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.860 
everything else what kind of tea really
yeah<00:02:08.570> this<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:09.670> really<00:02:10.670> sturdy<00:02:11.000> solid

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
yeah this is a really sturdy solid

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.310 
yeah this is a really sturdy solid
rubber<00:02:12.880> it's<00:02:13.880> rigidly<00:02:14.510> attached<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
rubber it's rigidly attached to the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.750 
rubber it's rigidly attached to the
bottom<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.800> panels<00:02:16.160> here<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:16.670> don't

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
bottom of the panels here so we don't

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.490 
bottom of the panels here so we don't
experience<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.390> lot<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.660> damage<00:02:17.870> on<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> field

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
experience a lot of damage on the field

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.810 
experience a lot of damage on the field
from<00:02:18.710> road<00:02:18.950> debris<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.430> things<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:19.760> that

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
from road debris and things like that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.510 
from road debris and things like that
I'm<00:02:20.180> sure<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.690> cannot<00:02:20.930> get<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.230> cool

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
I'm sure that you cannot get the cool

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.890 
I'm sure that you cannot get the cool
LED<00:02:22.520> freightliner<00:02:23.390> bad

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
LED freightliner bad

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.350 
LED freightliner bad
I wish<00:02:24.439> you<00:02:24.590> could<00:02:24.739> that's<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.640> think<00:02:26.239> that's

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
I wish you could that's a I think that's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.460 
I wish you could that's a I think that's
pretty<00:02:26.480> cool<00:02:26.689> that<00:02:26.900> would<00:02:26.959> be<00:02:27.049> good<00:02:27.170> but

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
pretty cool that would be good but

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.770 
pretty cool that would be good but
everything<00:02:27.950> here<00:02:28.310> all<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.180> way<00:02:29.269> back<00:02:29.480> we've

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
everything here all the way back we've

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780 
everything here all the way back we've
got<00:02:29.959> mere<00:02:30.409> shells<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.890> were<00:02:30.950> redesigned<00:02:31.549> for

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
got mere shells that were redesigned for

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.759 
got mere shells that were redesigned for
the<00:02:31.879> evolution<00:02:32.360> that's<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.659> new<00:02:33.230> heart<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.560> the

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
the evolution that's a new heart for the

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.800 
the evolution that's a new heart for the
truck<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.519> there's<00:02:34.670> like<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.879> little<00:02:35.090> covering

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
truck so there's like a little covering

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.360 
truck so there's like a little covering
on<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.079> is<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.319> something<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.829> know

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
on this is that something that you know

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.979 
on this is that something that you know
it's<00:02:37.519> it's<00:02:37.730> it's<00:02:38.030> actually<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.569> new<00:02:38.720> shell

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
it's it's it's actually the new shell

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.259 
it's it's it's actually the new shell
it's<00:02:39.230> got<00:02:39.379> an<00:02:39.560> airfoil<00:02:40.069> aerodynamic<00:02:40.849> shape<00:02:40.879> to

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
it's got an airfoil aerodynamic shape to

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.149 
it's got an airfoil aerodynamic shape to
it<00:02:41.299> do<00:02:41.900> serves<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.379> move<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.680> move<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:43.069> air

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
it do serves to move it move the air

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.679 
it do serves to move it move the air
around<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.670> around<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.180> mirror<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> little

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
around the around the mirror a little

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.750 
around the around the mirror a little
bit<00:02:44.780> more<00:02:44.959> cool<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.799> looks<00:02:45.950> simple<00:02:46.250> definitely

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
bit more cool it looks simple definitely

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.490 
bit more cool it looks simple definitely
looks<00:02:46.909> arrow<00:02:47.180> I'm<00:02:47.450> sure<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.989> it's<00:02:48.109> got<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.290> lot

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
looks arrow I'm sure that it's got a lot

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.809 
looks arrow I'm sure that it's got a lot
of<00:02:48.530> technology<00:02:49.099> can<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.519> these<00:02:49.609> like

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
of technology can you get these like

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.349 
of technology can you get these like

heated or their standard heated mirrors
it's<00:02:53.540> really<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.049> exterior<00:02:54.439> shell<00:02:54.829> that

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
it's really just the exterior shell that

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.059 
it's really just the exterior shell that

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
fleet rating for a size like this but

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.429 
fleet rating for a size like this but
it's<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.980> got<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.760> new<00:03:25.970> reduced<00:03:26.389> size<00:03:26.989> cooling

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
it's a got a new reduced size cooling

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.110 
it's a got a new reduced size cooling
package<00:03:27.859> it<00:03:28.160> has<00:03:28.340> all<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.489> features<00:03:28.669> on<00:03:29.030> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
package it has all the features on the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.229 
package it has all the features on the
new<00:03:29.239> DD<00:03:29.599> 1580<00:03:30.310> variable<00:03:31.310> speed<00:03:31.459> water<00:03:31.669> pump<00:03:32.030> a

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
new DD 1580 variable speed water pump a

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.720 
new DD 1580 variable speed water pump a
lot<00:03:32.419> of<00:03:32.510> friction<00:03:32.660> reduction<00:03:33.730> lowered

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
lot of friction reduction lowered

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.699 
lot of friction reduction lowered
parasitics<00:03:35.359> lighter<00:03:35.989> weight<00:03:36.230> what<00:03:36.590> does<00:03:36.680> that

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
parasitics lighter weight what does that

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.229 
parasitics lighter weight what does that
mean<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.040> all<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.489> laymon's<00:03:37.819> out<00:03:37.970> there<00:03:38.120> like

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
mean to all the laymon's out there like

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.240 
mean to all the laymon's out there like
myself<00:03:38.449> lower<00:03:38.810> parasitics<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:40.099> means

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
myself lower parasitics that means

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.920 
myself lower parasitics that means
there's<00:03:40.430> less<00:03:40.489> stuff<00:03:40.940> pulling<00:03:41.239> on<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.629> engine

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
there's less stuff pulling on the engine

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.720 
there's less stuff pulling on the engine
while<00:03:42.049> i<00:03:42.079> was<00:03:42.139> trying<00:03:42.409> to<00:03:42.530> move<00:03:42.730> basically

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
while i was trying to move basically

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.490 
while i was trying to move basically
it's<00:03:43.879> a<00:03:44.000> use<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.750> feel<00:03:44.900> more<00:03:45.109> official<00:03:45.470> like

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
it's a use and feel more official like

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.559 
it's a use and feel more official like
one<00:03:45.769> kind<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.069> serpentine<00:03:46.609> belt<00:03:46.879> that<00:03:47.120> sort<00:03:47.510> of

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
one kind of serpentine belt that sort of

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.089 
one kind of serpentine belt that sort of
moves<00:03:47.959> around<00:03:48.169> as<00:03:48.379> much<00:03:48.530> separate<00:03:48.980> or

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
moves around as much separate or

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.800 
moves around as much separate or
something<00:03:49.519> like<00:03:49.609> that<00:03:49.669> you<00:03:49.940> know<00:03:49.970> more<00:03:50.239> more

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
something like that you know more more

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.149 
something like that you know more more
of<00:03:50.900> what's<00:03:51.049> going<00:03:51.230> on<00:03:51.379> inside<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.709> engine

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
of what's going on inside the engine

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.129 
of what's going on inside the engine
really<00:03:52.489> there's<00:03:52.790> there's<00:03:53.209> less<00:03:53.449> there's<00:03:53.959> less

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
really there's there's less there's less

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.349 
really there's there's less there's less
restrictive<00:03:55.069> force<00:03:55.370> going<00:03:55.669> on<00:03:55.790> there<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:56.209> when

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
restrictive force going on there so when

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.539

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
you're throwing fuel into the engine the

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.729 
you're throwing fuel into the engine the
engines<00:03:58.849> allowed<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.180> move<00:03:59.299> more<00:03:59.510> freely<00:03:59.739> what

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
engines allowed to move more freely what

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.520
