a<00:00:43.379> place<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:43.980> wanted<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.370> tell<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> lot

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
a place we really wanted to tell a lot

a place we really wanted to tell a lot
of<00:00:44.789> story<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.420> figured<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.809> should<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:46.079> both

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
of story so we figured we should do both

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.600 
of story so we figured we should do both
the<00:00:47.129> sky<00:00:47.520> wall<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.480> also<00:00:49.289> both<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.739> raid<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the sky wall is a also both a raid and a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.830 
the sky wall is a also both a raid and a
dungeon<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:52.520> then<00:00:53.520> last<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.329> least<00:00:54.390> we

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
dungeon and then last but not least we

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.510 
dungeon and then last but not least we
are<00:00:54.960> doing<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.230> couple<00:00:55.500> new<00:00:55.590> heroics

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.210 

so<00:01:02.120> these<00:01:02.240> are<00:01:02.330> going<00:01:02.540> to<00:01:02.600> be<00:01:02.710> level<00:01:03.710> 85

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
so these are going to be level 85
