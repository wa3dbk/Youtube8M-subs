00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.250
 the lion and the mouse one very afternoon 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.650
 hot and lion 'dozed in a cave 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.840
 dark when he was about to fall asleep 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.239
 completely a naughty mouse like this 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.880
 toy would run on the snout with 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.860
 an angry roar and lion raised his 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.480
 leg and crushed against the ground at 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.480
 poor little mouse 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.010
 how dare you wake me up 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.010
 Lion 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.089
 and the frightened mouse I had from the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.449
 initial level of Chinese but is to take me 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.030
 the hair told the lion to make rotten a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.260
 mousy mouse to allow help 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.260
 a big and strong lion 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.730
 the presumed lion laughed so much that he 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.280
 he neglected and let the mouse go a few days 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.610
 later the lion left home by the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.610
 jungle 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.630
 achieved better mission or was just 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.450
 thinking about your next meal when 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.830
 Suddenly the careless lion stumbled like 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.310
 a rope stretched in the middle of the path 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.409
 and a huge network came down on him and 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.680
 despite all the efforts he could not 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.710
 free yourself from the trap what I will do to 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.170
 to be able to let go I am the strongest the most 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.409
 strong and I can not let go of this 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.310
 cheated while more moved and twisted 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.500
 more and more and more tangled remained the network 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.860
 she was very tense and so the lion could not 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.030
 move more desperate came up with all 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 your forces 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.790
 ross 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.369
 that all the animals that out there 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.820
 they went by they heard it and it's the most 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.890
 away from the jungle he heard the lion 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.410
 lion wondered if any animal 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.900
 would help step a fawn looking at the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.970
 king of the jungle and said 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.310
 Later they take me I better go before 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.019
 to see me the fawn went quickly 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.239
 then pass the boar but remember everything 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.579
 what he had done in the past gave 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.379
 around and was at the time the 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.019
 that the great animal surrendered to the network 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.000
 when an animal that laughed a granite 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.250
 of rice was for rushed filters 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.409
 help the big och in the little 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:46.900
 little mouse approached him and told him if I 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:50.620
 the mouse just a little while to 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.959
 unleash the lion that was so exhausted 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.989
 stay here I'll quote you looking like 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.400
 knee mice the ropes of the network 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.370
 I could hardly believe that after a 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.909
 I 'd be free for a while, it saved me 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.129
 he said he said the lion will never come back 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.080
 doubt the promises made by the 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.230
 small friends 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.620
 little girl keep in mind our mind 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.660
 It is a commitment with you with great pleasure 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.300
 Little friend, I apologize 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.090
 not see the great animal that he 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.340
 the little mouse swelled with joy his little 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.070
 pechito and thanked the lion for being his 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.860
 friend from that moment they were great 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.870
 friends the lion would always remember that his 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.590
 Little friend saved him from dying at the hands 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.590
 of the hunters 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.710
 do not despise others because their 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.720
 skills can surprise you until the 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.840
 smaller can do things 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.840
 big
