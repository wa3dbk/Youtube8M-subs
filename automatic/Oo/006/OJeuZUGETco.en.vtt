00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
far as for my surrounds these here these

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.410 
far as for my surrounds these here these
are<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.989> bad<00:02:52.170> boys<00:02:52.730> these<00:02:53.730> independently

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
are the bad boys these independently

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.020 
are the bad boys these independently
these<00:02:54.750> are<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.019> surround<00:02:55.320> sound<00:02:55.530> speakers

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
these are just surround sound speakers

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.199 
these are just surround sound speakers
these<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.450> are<00:02:57.769> the<00:03:00.830> kar<00:03:01.830> 52s<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:02.970> believe

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
these here are the kar 52s I believe

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.479 
these here are the kar 52s I believe
they<00:03:03.300> are<00:03:04.400> 125<00:03:05.400> watts<00:03:05.640> each<00:03:07.040> comes<00:03:08.040> with<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.220> 2

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
they are 125 watts each comes with a 2

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.350 
they are 125 watts each comes with a 2
mid<00:03:08.870> subwoofers<00:03:09.870> with<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> track<00:03:10.769> horns<00:03:11.360> dual

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
mid subwoofers with the track horns dual

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
mid subwoofers with the track horns dual
and<00:03:13.019> then<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.010> matching<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.550> here

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
and then this is the matching one here

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.370 
and then this is the matching one here
also<00:03:16.380> made<00:03:16.560> by<00:03:16.590> cliffs

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.580 

and<00:03:19.950> then<00:03:20.130> here<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:23.190> my<00:03:23.430> center<00:03:24.300> channel<00:03:24.510> mmm

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
and then here is my center channel mmm

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.590 
and then here is my center channel mmm
speaker<00:03:26.490> which<00:03:26.730> eventually<00:03:27.240> it's<00:03:27.390> gonna<00:03:27.480> be

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
speaker which eventually it's gonna be

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.950 
speaker which eventually it's gonna be
switched<00:03:27.990> out<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:30.000> speaker<00:03:30.390> as<00:03:30.510> bulky<00:03:30.930> as

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
switched out this speaker as bulky as

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.250 
switched out this speaker as bulky as
you<00:03:31.170> see<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.470> here<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:32.580> actually<00:03:32.990> actually<00:03:33.990> is

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
you see it here it actually actually is

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.910 
you see it here it actually actually is
not<00:03:34.680> as<00:03:34.890> powerful<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:36.180> can<00:03:36.660> not<00:03:36.870> keep<00:03:37.050> up<00:03:37.290> with

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
not as powerful and can not keep up with

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.670 
not as powerful and can not keep up with
my<00:03:38.160> speakers<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.870> kind<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.410> lowered

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
my speakers so I kind of like lowered

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.630 
my speakers so I kind of like lowered
the<00:03:40.770> volume<00:03:41.130> on<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.310> front<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:43.640> eventually

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
the volume on the front and eventually

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.640 
the volume on the front and eventually
raised<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.150> volume<00:03:45.480> all<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> way<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.840> max<00:03:46.350> on

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
raised the volume all the way to max on

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.390 
raised the volume all the way to max on
the<00:03:46.950> center<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.270> could<00:03:48.390> keep<00:03:48.510> up<00:03:48.720> and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
the center just so I could keep up and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.990 
the center just so I could keep up and
the<00:03:50.400> pairings<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.270> all<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.830> Denon

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
things that it can do but let's just say

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.370 
things that it can do but let's just say
that<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.780> bad<00:04:33.960> boy<00:04:34.140> here<00:04:34.520> eventually<00:04:36.380> can

that this bad boy here eventually can

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.650 
that this bad boy here eventually can

I really don't watch movies in 3d and in
this<00:05:51.860> particular<00:05:52.070> case<00:05:52.370> I<00:05:52.760> didn't<00:05:53.090> have<00:05:53.270> to

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
this particular case I didn't have to

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.880 
this particular case I didn't have to
buy<00:05:53.720> this<00:05:54.560> movie<00:05:54.890> in<00:05:55.190> 3d<00:05:56.180> version<00:05:56.690> only<00:05:57.290> reason

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
buy this movie in 3d version only reason

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.250 
buy this movie in 3d version only reason
why<00:05:58.040> I<00:05:58.070> did<00:05:58.400> buy<00:05:58.580> 3d<00:05:59.090> version<00:05:59.450> one<00:05:59.660> of<00:05:59.870> it<00:06:00.110> is

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
why I did buy 3d version one of it is

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.220 
why I did buy 3d version one of it is
because<00:06:00.680> it<00:06:01.040> has<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.280> digital<00:06:01.610> copy<00:06:02.230> the

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
because it has the digital copy the

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.790 
because it has the digital copy the
regular<00:06:03.530> DVD<00:06:04.450> coming<00:06:05.450> blu-ray<00:06:05.870> with<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.470> DVD

regular DVD coming blu-ray with the DVD

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.620 
regular DVD coming blu-ray with the DVD
is<00:06:07.040> just<00:06:09.280> what<00:06:10.280> you<00:06:10.400> call<00:06:10.580> it<00:06:10.730> no<00:06:10.880> digital<00:06:11.450> copy

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
is just what you call it no digital copy

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.390

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
here because of the fact that I'd

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.190
