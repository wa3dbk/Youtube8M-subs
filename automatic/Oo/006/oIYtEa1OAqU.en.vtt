almost as a mini ghosts just with a
shorter<00:00:14.340> duration<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.509> phenomenal<00:00:16.260> for

shorter duration and is phenomenal for
escaping<00:00:16.710> ganks<00:00:17.160> especially<00:00:18.000> since<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.600> has<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720

the<00:00:22.260> fact<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.740> now<00:00:22.890> cleanses<00:00:23.369> healing

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the fact that it now cleanses healing

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.630 
the fact that it now cleanses healing
reduction<00:00:24.119> has<00:00:24.510> made<00:00:24.810> heal<00:00:25.199> now<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.160> lot

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
reduction has made heal now have a lot

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880 
reduction has made heal now have a lot
less<00:00:26.910> counterplay<00:00:27.480> being<00:00:28.260> able<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> cleanse

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
less counterplay being able to cleanse

ignite<00:00:29.250> especially<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> late<00:00:30.539> game<00:00:30.840> gives

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
ignite especially in the late game gives

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.440 
ignite especially in the late game gives
you<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.679> much<00:00:31.859> safety<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.489> overall<00:00:33.090> damage

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
you so much safety and overall damage

you so much safety and overall damage
reduction<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.890> example<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:35.670> ignited

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
reduction for example if I was ignited

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.270 
reduction for example if I was ignited
by<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.210> level<00:00:36.510> 18<00:00:36.899> opponent<00:00:37.440> while<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:38.040> also

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
by a level 18 opponent while I was also

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
by a level 18 opponent while I was also
level<00:00:38.640> 18<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.300> used<00:00:39.510> heal<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.079> would

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
level 18 and I used heal I would

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.479 
level 18 and I used heal I would
hypothetically<00:00:40.890> avoid<00:00:41.640> almost<00:00:43.010> 650<00:00:44.010> damage

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
hypothetically avoid almost 650 damage

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.090 
hypothetically avoid almost 650 damage
if<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.090> assume<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.570> full<00:00:45.840> ignite<00:00:46.379> duration<00:00:46.950> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
if we assume the full ignite duration is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
if we assume the full ignite duration is
being<00:00:47.430> cleansed<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.660> doesn't<00:00:49.020> even

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
being cleansed and that doesn't even

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.139 
being cleansed and that doesn't even
account<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.710> how<00:00:50.280> much<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.579> would<00:00:50.700> heal<00:00:50.969> an

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
account for how much you would heal an

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.260 
account for how much you would heal an
ally<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.680> heel<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.890> simply<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.610> no<00:00:53.940> longer

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
ally for heel is simply just no longer

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
countered by ignite since you can

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
countered by ignite since you can

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
cleanse it meaning that the most common

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.599 
cleanse it meaning that the most common
counterplay<00:00:58.500> has<00:00:58.649> been<00:00:58.829> removed<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.430> the

the healing reduction involved in the

the healing reduction involved in the

kit of a champion or item which is just

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
not that common anymore since they

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.070 
not that common anymore since they

remove the debuff that limits the health

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.649 
remove the debuff that limits the health
game<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:10.979> more<00:01:11.250> than<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.460> heel<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.119> used<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
game when more than one heel is used it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
game when more than one heel is used it
makes<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.350> viable<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.070> double<00:01:14.430> healbot<00:01:14.909> now

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
makes it viable to go double healbot now

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.270 
makes it viable to go double healbot now
but<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> fact<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.229> he'll<00:01:16.590> eventually<00:01:16.890> will

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
but the fact that he'll eventually will

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.670 
but the fact that he'll eventually will
out<00:01:17.460> scale<00:01:17.820> barrier<00:01:18.330> makes<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.470> as

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
out scale barrier makes it just as

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.399 
out scale barrier makes it just as
viable<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.340> solo<00:01:20.729> laners<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.330> well<00:01:21.540> i've<00:01:21.869> been

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
viable on solo laners as well i've been

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.380 
viable on solo laners as well i've been
seeing<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.770> lot<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.040> mid<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.580> even<00:01:23.939> some<00:01:24.150> top

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
seeing a lot of mid and even some top

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
seeing a lot of mid and even some top
laners<00:01:24.689> taking<00:01:25.020> heal<00:01:25.259> especially<00:01:25.470> since

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
laners taking heal especially since

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.010 
laners taking heal especially since
scales<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.790> things<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.090> increase<00:01:27.540> healing

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
scales with things that increase healing

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
scales with things that increase healing
such<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.380> spirit<00:01:28.710> massage<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.460> add<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
such as spirit massage and add into that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.940 
such as spirit massage and add into that
the<00:01:30.750> fact<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> health<00:01:31.439> gained<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the fact that the health gained is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.039 
the fact that the health gained is
permanent<00:01:32.790> unlike<00:01:33.210> barrier<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:33.840> only

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
permanent unlike barrier which only

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.950 
permanent unlike barrier which only
lasts<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.619> two<00:01:34.770> seconds<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.689> it's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
lasts for two seconds all in all it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.719 
lasts for two seconds all in all it's
just<00:01:37.229> an<00:01:37.320> incredibly<00:01:37.860> powerful<00:01:37.950> summoner

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
just an incredibly powerful summoner

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.760 
just an incredibly powerful summoner
spell<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.540> has<00:01:39.659> an<00:01:39.810> insignificant<00:01:40.229> amount

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
spell that has an insignificant amount

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280 
spell that has an insignificant amount
of<00:01:41.070> counter<00:01:41.220> play<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.000> vastly<00:01:42.780> exceeds

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
of counter play now and vastly exceeds

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.010 
of counter play now and vastly exceeds
barrier<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> cower<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.820> definitely<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.720> it

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
barrier and cower so definitely take it
