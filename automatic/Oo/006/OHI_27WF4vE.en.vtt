00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
hundred fifty five feet it is a doozy

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.350 
hundred fifty five feet it is a doozy
this<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> highest<00:00:35.640> 14<00:00:36.149> ER<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
this is not the highest 14 ER in

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.299 
this is not the highest 14 ER in
Colorado<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.559> certainly<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.280> there

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
Colorado but it is certainly up there

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
Colorado but it is certainly up there
now<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.969> reason<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.510> talking<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.870> like

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
now the reason I'm talking to you like

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
now the reason I'm talking to you like
this<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.590> when<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.280> hit<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> certain

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
this is because when you hit a certain

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030 
this is because when you hit a certain
altitude<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.809> start<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> go<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:43.530> loopy

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
altitude you start to go a little loopy

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.490 
altitude you start to go a little loopy
so<00:00:44.309> quite<00:00:45.000> honestly<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.420> sound<00:00:45.840> really<00:00:46.260> stupid

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
so quite honestly I sound really stupid

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.130 
so quite honestly I sound really stupid
and<00:00:46.860> some<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> things<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:47.760> saying

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
and some of the things that I'm saying

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
and some of the things that I'm saying
and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.590> wanted<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> kind<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.370> preface<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and I just wanted to kind of preface it

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.490 
and I just wanted to kind of preface it
kind<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> add<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.570> bit<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.750> context<00:00:52.379> now

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
kind of add a little bit of context now

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.410 
kind of add a little bit of context now
in<00:00:52.829> addition<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> didn't<00:00:53.969> film<00:00:54.239> as

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
in addition to that I didn't film as

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
in addition to that I didn't film as
much<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.840> wanted<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.770> once<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.760> hit

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
much as I wanted to because once you hit

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.310 
much as I wanted to because once you hit
a<00:00:57.149> certain<00:00:57.180> point<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:57.989> called<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
a certain point which is called the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.020 
a certain point which is called the
keyhole<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.190> I'll<00:00:59.340> show<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> picture<00:00:59.820> up

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
keyhole which I'll show you a picture up

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
keyhole which I'll show you a picture up
where<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.539> bust<00:01:00.899> through<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> other<00:01:01.530> side

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
where you bust through to the other side

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.399 
where you bust through to the other side
and<00:01:02.250> begin<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.789> climb<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.180> earnest<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and begin that climb in earnest at that

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.380 
and begin that climb in earnest at that
point<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.159> becomes<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.030> bit<00:01:06.210> too

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
point it becomes a little bit too

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.719 
point it becomes a little bit too
dangerous<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.590> film<00:01:07.979> very<00:01:08.220> much<00:01:08.490> so

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
dangerous to really film very much so

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.100 
dangerous to really film very much so
there<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> couple<00:01:09.150> snippets<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:09.960> and

from the parking lot and I was moving
for<00:05:53.360> probably<00:05:53.840> around<00:05:54.169> 13<00:05:54.770> hours<00:05:55.039> give<00:05:55.219> or

for probably around 13 hours give or

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:57.339 
for probably around 13 hours give or
take<00:05:55.460> now<00:05:55.669> the<00:05:55.729> data<00:05:56.120> that<00:05:56.629> you<00:05:56.840> can<00:05:56.990> see<00:05:57.199> by

take now the data that you can see by
clicking<00:05:57.620> that<00:05:57.949> strava<00:05:58.430> button<00:05:58.849> right<00:05:58.999> up

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029 
clicking that strava button right up

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:01.029 
clicking that strava button right up
there<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.719> data<00:06:00.020> that<00:06:00.319> is<00:06:00.409> on<00:06:00.590> there<00:06:00.860> that

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
there the data that is on there that

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.640 
there the data that is on there that
will<00:06:01.520> show<00:06:01.849> you<00:06:01.909> exactly<00:06:02.479> where<00:06:02.990> I<00:06:03.050> went<00:06:03.379> and

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
will show you exactly where I went and

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.320 
will show you exactly where I went and
everything<00:06:03.949> but<00:06:04.189> it<00:06:04.370> cuts<00:06:04.610> out<00:06:04.789> at<00:06:04.939> about<00:06:04.999> 10

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
everything but it cuts out at about 10

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.939 
everything but it cuts out at about 10
hours<00:06:05.479> simply<00:06:05.990> because<00:06:06.259> the<00:06:06.409> watch<00:06:06.620> that<00:06:06.919> I

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
hours simply because the watch that I

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.040 
hours simply because the watch that I
was<00:06:07.099> wearing<00:06:07.310> that<00:06:07.639> cut<00:06:08.360> out<00:06:08.449> in<00:06:08.629> about<00:06:08.719> 10

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
was wearing that cut out in about 10

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.019 
was wearing that cut out in about 10
hours<00:06:09.169> so<00:06:09.529> that's<00:06:10.189> how<00:06:10.340> much<00:06:10.490> data<00:06:10.729> we<00:06:10.909> have

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029 
hours so that's how much data we have

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:12.519 
hours so that's how much data we have
but<00:06:11.180> that<00:06:11.360> point<00:06:11.569> it<00:06:11.749> was<00:06:11.840> just<00:06:12.050> kind<00:06:12.229> of<00:06:12.319> the

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 
but that point it was just kind of the

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.489 
but that point it was just kind of the
path<00:06:12.860> down<00:06:13.219> to<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.819> parking<00:06:14.360> lot<00:06:14.419> but<00:06:14.840> it<00:06:15.289> was

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:15.499 
path down to the parking lot but it was

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:16.929 
path down to the parking lot but it was
still<00:06:15.710> an<00:06:15.800> additional<00:06:16.249> like<00:06:16.400> two<00:06:16.580> or<00:06:16.729> three

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:16.939 
still an additional like two or three

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:18.700 
still an additional like two or three
hours<00:06:16.969> one<00:06:17.629> thing<00:06:17.810> that's<00:06:17.930> amazing<00:06:18.229> about<00:06:18.560> it

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
hours one thing that's amazing about it

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.339 
hours one thing that's amazing about it
is<00:06:19.009> that<00:06:19.069> the<00:06:19.279> record<00:06:19.879> for<00:06:20.060> up<00:06:20.569> to<00:06:20.900> longs<00:06:21.169> peak

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
is that the record for up to longs peak

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.290 
is that the record for up to longs peak
