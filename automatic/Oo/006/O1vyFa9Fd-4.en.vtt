I'll<00:00:04.529> be<00:00:04.589> talking<00:00:04.799> about<00:00:05.150> ratios<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.779> how<00:00:06.960> to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
I'll be talking about ratios and how to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.009 
I'll be talking about ratios and how to
find<00:00:07.319> out<00:00:07.560> ratios<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.130> are<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.790> or<00:00:09.719> rather

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
find out ratios that are a or rather

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.990 
find out ratios that are a or rather
that<00:00:10.260> as<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.530> website<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.490> know<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.700> that

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
that as a website that I know of that

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.999 
that as a website that I know of that
will<00:00:12.599> give<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.870> ratios<00:00:13.290> unfortunate<00:00:13.860> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
will give you ratios unfortunate and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.440 
will give you ratios unfortunate and
find<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.309> out<00:00:14.460> until<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.759> created<00:00:15.269> my<00:00:15.420> own

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
do you find that out so you have a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.650 
do you find that out so you have a
little<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:38.660> production

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
little look if you go to your production

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.790 
little look if you go to your production
tab<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.260> look<00:00:40.379> at<00:00:40.469> your<00:00:40.559> copper

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
tab you have a look at your copper

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.260 
tab you have a look at your copper
cables<00:00:41.600> every<00:00:42.600> half<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.989> second<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:44.879> one

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
cables every half a second you make one

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.650 
cables every half a second you make one
electronic<00:00:45.930> circuit<00:00:46.460> okay<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.789> that's<00:00:48.480> what

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
electronic circuit okay so that's what

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
electronic circuit okay so that's what
the<00:00:48.750> Lok<00:00:48.899> Lak<00:00:49.140> means<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.620> every<00:00:49.829> half<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.100> second

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the Lok Lak means is every half a second

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.189 
the Lok Lak means is every half a second
one<00:00:50.640> electronic<00:00:51.090> circuit<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.480> made<00:00:51.629> one

one electronic circuit is made one

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.689 
one electronic circuit is made one
electron<00:00:52.530> sake<00:00:52.800> requires<00:00:53.129> three<00:00:53.370> copper

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
electron sake requires three copper

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.910 
electron sake requires three copper
cables<00:00:54.059> okay<00:00:54.840> copper<00:00:55.320> cables<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:55.710> made<00:00:55.739> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
cables okay copper cables are made in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.400 
cables okay copper cables are made in
batches<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.020> they're<00:00:58.020> made<00:00:58.170> every

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
batches of two and they're made every

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.619 
batches of two and they're made every
half<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.710> second<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.730> what<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.969> need<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.390> is

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
half a second so what you need to do is

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
half a second so what you need to do is
you<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> find<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> lowest

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you do you have to find the lowest

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.179 
you do you have to find the lowest
common<00:01:02.670> denominator<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
common denominator so and that's and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.730 
common denominator so and that's and
that's<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.489> would<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.790> sex<00:01:06.570> copper<00:01:06.930> cables<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that's it would be sex copper cables to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.120 
that's it would be sex copper cables to
two<00:01:07.890> electronic<00:01:08.340> circuits<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:10.130> after

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
two electronic circuits because after

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
two electronic circuits because after
you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.369> make<00:01:11.580> three<00:01:12.090> times<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.570> copper

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you can make three times the copper

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200 
you can make three times the copper
cables<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.560> half<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> second<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.520> sex<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
cables and half a second that's sex and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.020 
cables and half a second that's sex and
that<00:01:15.840> requires<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.590> two<00:01:17.280> electronic<00:01:17.759> circuit

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that requires and two electronic circuit

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.880 
that requires and two electronic circuit
factories<00:01:18.450> require<00:01:18.750> sex<00:01:19.229> copper<00:01:19.500> cables<00:01:19.799> in

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
factories require sex copper cables in

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.700 
factories require sex copper cables in
half<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> second<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.150> that's<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.540> 3<00:01:21.810> F<00:01:22.229> 3<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.500> 2

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
half a second so that's a 3 F 3 a 2

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.590 
half a second so that's a 3 F 3 a 2
ratio<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.310> that's<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.150> we've<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.420> here

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
ratio and that's what we've got here

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.289 
ratio and that's what we've got here
we've<00:01:24.630> got<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> 3<00:01:25.140> ratio<00:01:25.530> our<00:01:26.100> three<00:01:26.460> pumping

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
we've got a 3 ratio our three pumping

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
we've got a 3 ratio our three pumping
story<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.600> tier<00:01:27.720> 2<00:01:27.930> ratio<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:29.340> how

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
story and tier 2 ratio and that's how

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
story and tier 2 ratio and that's how
you<00:01:29.549> find<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.659> best<00:01:30.840> ratios<00:01:31.229> it's

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
you find out the the best ratios it's

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.929 
you find out the the best ratios it's
all<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.890> fractions<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.610> lowest<00:01:32.820> common

print and then you can do any math you
want<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.759> 800<00:01:51.979> divided<00:01:52.979> by<00:01:53.280> 2

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.649 

400<00:01:56.909> okay

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
400 okay

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.959 
400 okay
pretty<00:01:58.200> simple<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.460> how<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.820> do

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
pretty simple and that's how you can do

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.270 
pretty simple and that's how you can do
any<00:02:00.240> math<00:02:00.570> without<00:02:00.869> having<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.320> alt-tab<00:02:01.890> go<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
any math without having a alt-tab go to

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.969 
any math without having a alt-tab go to
a<00:02:02.399> calculator<00:02:02.670> or<00:02:03.000> anything<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.509> so

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
a calculator or anything like that so

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.940 
a calculator or anything like that so
what<00:02:04.979> i've<00:02:05.130> done<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.430> i've<00:02:05.850> shown<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.920> how<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
what i've done is i've shown you how to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.830 
what i've done is i've shown you how to
have<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> check<00:02:09.000> those<00:02:09.149> ratios<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.629> I'm<00:02:09.690> going

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
have a check those ratios now I'm going

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.770 
have a check those ratios now I'm going
to<00:02:09.929> show<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.229> ratio<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.009> practice<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.569> I'm

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
to show you a ratio and practice so I'm

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.850 
to show you a ratio and practice so I'm
going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> show<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.080> how<00:02:13.319> ratios

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
going to show you how ratios

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.100 
going to show you how ratios
can<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.700> terrible<00:02:15.480> for<00:02:15.660> our<00:02:15.720> factory

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
can be terrible for our factory

there's two of them so it's 8 times 16
and<00:03:32.160> then<00:03:32.640> double<00:03:32.940> because<00:03:33.209> half<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.540> second

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
and then double because half a second

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.920 
and then double because half a second
not<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:33.989> second<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.500> stated<00:03:34.890> okay<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.540> that

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
not a second so I stated okay so that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.470 
not a second so I stated okay so that
requires<00:03:37.260> two<00:03:38.010> sets<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.430> these<00:03:38.519> factories<00:03:38.970> and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
requires two sets of these factories and

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.080 
requires two sets of these factories and
every<00:03:39.780> eight<00:03:39.900> seconds<00:03:40.549> am<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.640> right<00:03:41.790> or<00:03:41.940> am<00:03:41.970> i

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
every eight seconds am I right or am i

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.930 
every eight seconds am I right or am i
mixing<00:03:42.239> up<00:03:42.450> my<00:03:42.480> math<00:03:43.019> no<00:03:46.610> right<00:03:47.610> if<00:03:47.790> they<00:03:47.970> were

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
mixing up my math no right if they were

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.990 
mixing up my math no right if they were
hmm<00:03:51.110> one<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.230> them<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.620> make<00:03:52.650> sixteen<00:03:53.519> so<00:03:53.850> it's

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
hmm one of them can make sixteen so it's

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.390 
hmm one of them can make sixteen so it's
theater<00:03:54.330> yeah<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.260> they<00:03:55.590> require<00:03:55.860> 16<00:03:56.250> every

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
theater yeah and they require 16 every

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.530 
theater yeah and they require 16 every
eight<00:03:56.519> seconds<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:56.970> can<00:03:57.090> have<00:03:57.209> 16

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
eight seconds so you can have 16

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.120 
eight seconds so you can have 16
factories<00:03:58.350> that's<00:03:58.799> right

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
factories that's right

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.490 
factories that's right
jeez<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.209> for<00:04:00.510> every<00:04:00.780> one<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.989> these<00:04:01.170> we<00:04:01.470> can

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
jeez so for every one of these we can

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.300 
jeez so for every one of these we can
have<00:04:01.739> 16<00:04:02.250> advanced<00:04:02.940> circuit<00:04:03.269> factories<00:04:04.310> but

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
have 16 advanced circuit factories but

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.160 
have 16 advanced circuit factories but
we<00:04:05.880> also<00:04:06.030> need<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.269> take<00:04:06.660> into<00:04:06.810> account<00:04:06.900> the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
we also need to take into account the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.259 
we also need to take into account the
copper<00:04:07.440> cable<00:04:07.739> for<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:08.670> let's<00:04:09.090> actually

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
copper cable for that so let's actually

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.580 
copper cable for that so let's actually
have<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.570> look<00:04:09.630> at<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:09.989> because<00:04:10.230> I've<00:04:10.470> already

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
have a look at this because I've already

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.110 
have a look at this because I've already
set<00:04:10.950> up<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.430> should<00:04:11.610> make<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.910> bit

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
set up and that should make a bit

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.890 
set up and that should make a bit
simpler<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:12.510> you

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
simpler for you

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.830 
simpler for you
so<00:04:13.470> we've<00:04:13.769> got<00:04:13.950> one<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.370> these<00:04:14.459> supplying<00:04:15.120> 16

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
so we've got one of these supplying 16

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.690 
so we've got one of these supplying 16
factories<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:16.560> every<00:04:16.890> eight<00:04:17.070> factories<00:04:17.579> only

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
factories and every eight factories only

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.400 
factories and every eight factories only
requires<00:04:18.060> one<00:04:18.180> copper<00:04:18.510> cable<00:04:18.870> because<00:04:19.140> if<00:04:19.320> we

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
requires one copper cable because if we

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.370 
requires one copper cable because if we
go<00:04:19.530> back<00:04:19.790> that<00:04:20.790> makes<00:04:21.000> two<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.660> five<00:04:21.930> seconds

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
go back that makes two and five seconds

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.670 
go back that makes two and five seconds
so<00:04:22.470> every<00:04:22.710> second<00:04:23.039> it<00:04:23.130> makes<00:04:23.250> four<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:24.680> each

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
so every second it makes four and each

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.540 
so every second it makes four and each
one<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.130> these<00:04:26.220> uses

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
one of these uses

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.860 
one of these uses
four<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.740> four<00:04:29.800> every<00:04:30.430> eight<00:04:30.580> seconds<00:04:31.000> okay

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
four and four every eight seconds okay

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.170 
four and four every eight seconds okay
so<00:04:31.930> that<00:04:32.379> means<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.650> we<00:04:32.770> can<00:04:32.889> have<00:04:33.039> it<00:04:33.789> 2-1

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
so that means that we can have it 2-1

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.240 
so that means that we can have it 2-1
okay<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:35.139> this<00:04:35.259> is<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.440> perfect<00:04:35.860> ratio<00:04:36.099> between

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
okay so this is a perfect ratio between

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.689 
okay so this is a perfect ratio between
green<00:04:36.849> sockets<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.479> two<00:04:38.050> red<00:04:38.229> sockets<00:04:38.699> okay

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
green sockets and two red sockets okay

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.529 
green sockets and two red sockets okay
and<00:04:39.909> then<00:04:40.150> from<00:04:40.629> red<00:04:40.810> circuits<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:41.409> to

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
and then from red circuits and to

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.510 
and then from red circuits and to
assembly<00:04:43.539> machine<00:04:43.810> here<00:04:44.490> making<00:04:45.490> a

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
assembly machine here making a

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.339 
assembly machine here making a
substation<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.419> know<00:04:46.780> you're<00:04:46.960> thinking<00:04:47.110> things

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
substation I know you're thinking things

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.879 
substation I know you're thinking things
to<00:04:47.590> do<00:04:47.759> with<00:04:48.759> those<00:04:49.120> eight<00:04:49.449> you're<00:04:49.930> making<00:04:50.289> one

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
to do with those eight you're making one

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.960 
to do with those eight you're making one
electronic<00:04:51.849> circuit<00:04:52.270> per<00:04:52.419> second<00:04:53.669> indeed<00:04:54.669> and

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
electronic circuit per second indeed and

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.719 
electronic circuit per second indeed and
this<00:04:55.780> requires<00:04:56.139> five<00:04:56.949> electro<00:04:57.340> circuits

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
this requires five electro circuits

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.120 
this requires five electro circuits
every<00:04:58.000> half<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.300> second<00:04:58.690> so<00:04:59.319> with<00:04:59.680> these<00:04:59.800> two

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
every half a second so with these two

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.219 
every half a second so with these two
banks<00:05:00.729> here<00:05:00.940> we're<00:05:01.509> making<00:05:01.630> one<00:05:01.870> electronic

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
banks here we're making one electronic

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.920 
banks here we're making one electronic
circuit<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.650> half<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:02.919> second<00:05:03.509> to<00:05:04.509> electronic

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
circuit and half a second to electronic

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.110 
circuit and half a second to electronic
circuits<00:05:05.229> have<00:05:05.349> same<00:05:05.590> three<00:05:06.009> circuits<00:05:06.729> half<00:05:07.030> a

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
circuits have same three circuits half a

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.600 
circuits have same three circuits half a
second<00:05:07.330> four<00:05:07.599> five<00:05:08.289> so<00:05:08.919> in<00:05:09.039> order<00:05:09.159> to<00:05:09.460> make

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
second four five so in order to make

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.020 
second four five so in order to make
this<00:05:10.080> one<00:05:11.080> thing<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.740> half<00:05:12.009> a<00:05:12.099> second<00:05:12.520> this<00:05:12.819> is

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
this one thing and half a second this is

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.640 
this one thing and half a second this is
the<00:05:13.210> size<00:05:13.479> of<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.930> factory<00:05:14.380> that<00:05:14.470> you're

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
the size of the factory that you're

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.879 
the size of the factory that you're
gonna<00:05:14.800> need<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:16.270> this<00:05:16.389> is<00:05:16.509> what<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:16.690> mean<00:05:16.810> by

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
gonna need so this is what I mean by

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.089 
gonna need so this is what I mean by
ratios<00:05:17.889> are<00:05:18.069> great<00:05:18.599> but<00:05:19.710> sometimes<00:05:20.710> they<00:05:20.919> can

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
ratios are great but sometimes they can

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.909 
ratios are great but sometimes they can
be<00:05:21.130> a<00:05:21.520> complete<00:05:22.210> pain<00:05:22.539> in<00:05:22.719> the<00:05:22.810> ass<00:05:22.930> because

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
be a complete pain in the ass because

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.740 
be a complete pain in the ass because
there's<00:05:24.340> no<00:05:24.430> need<00:05:24.669> for<00:05:24.909> you<00:05:25.210> be<00:05:25.360> making<00:05:25.659> these

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
there's no need for you be making these

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.839 
there's no need for you be making these
every<00:05:25.990> half<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.259> second<00:05:26.530> because<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:27.069> is<00:05:27.370> what

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
every half a second because this is what

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.610 
every half a second because this is what
you<00:05:27.969> would<00:05:28.120> need<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:28.810> make<00:05:28.960> those<00:05:29.139> every<00:05:29.440> half

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
you would need to make those every half

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.740 
you would need to make those every half
a<00:05:29.710> second<00:05:30.039> which<00:05:30.460> is<00:05:30.490> a<00:05:30.639> massive<00:05:31.389> amount<00:05:31.659> of

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
a second which is a massive amount of

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.320 
a second which is a massive amount of
resources<00:05:32.289> for<00:05:33.009> something<00:05:33.699> basically

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
resources for something basically

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.029 
resources for something basically
because<00:05:34.659> it's<00:05:34.840> really<00:05:35.110> expensive<00:05:35.349> to<00:05:35.830> make<00:05:35.949> a

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
because it's really expensive to make a

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.159 
because it's really expensive to make a
substation<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.789> that's<00:05:37.690> all<00:05:37.870> there<00:05:38.020> is

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
substation and that's all there is

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.999 
substation and that's all there is
so<00:05:38.710> yes<00:05:39.219> use<00:05:40.139> ratios<00:05:41.139> if<00:05:41.469> you're<00:05:41.710> making

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
so yes use ratios if you're making

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.249 
so yes use ratios if you're making
something<00:05:42.270> cheap<00:05:43.270> something<00:05:43.719> easy<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:44.050> make

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
something cheap something easy to make

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.649 
something cheap something easy to make
yes<00:05:45.069> use<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.400> ratios<00:05:45.759> to<00:05:45.940> make<00:05:46.090> these<00:05:46.300> because

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
yes use the ratios to make these because

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.769 
yes use the ratios to make these because
it's<00:05:46.810> just<00:05:46.990> a<00:05:47.229> fantastic<00:05:48.130> idea<00:05:48.279> but<00:05:49.150> don't<00:05:49.659> go

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
it's just a fantastic idea but don't go

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.930 
it's just a fantastic idea but don't go
overboard<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:50.469> make<00:05:50.650> freaking<00:05:51.099> everything

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
overboard and make freaking everything

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.820 
overboard and make freaking everything
with<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.389> correct<00:05:52.659> ratio<00:05:52.840> because<00:05:53.529> you<00:05:53.650> will

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
with the correct ratio because you will

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.350 
with the correct ratio because you will
end<00:05:54.039> up<00:05:54.130> with<00:05:54.340> something<00:05:54.520> ridiculous<00:05:55.330> like

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360
