Pocket<00:02:17.540> Edition<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.830> crashed<00:02:19.520> some

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
Pocket Edition and it crashed some

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.699 
Pocket Edition and it crashed some
reason<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.300> don't<00:02:20.420> know<00:02:20.599> why<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:21.110> crashes<00:02:21.380> on

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
reason I don't know why it crashes on

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.890 
reason I don't know why it crashes on
the<00:02:21.770> first<00:02:22.630> time<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:24.440> install<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:25.870> but<00:02:26.870> I

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
the first time you install it but I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.750 
the first time you install it but I
think<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.709> because<00:02:27.830> it's<00:02:28.040> saving<00:02:28.430> some

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
think it's just because it's saving some

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.110 
think it's just because it's saving some
stuff<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.480> have<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.930> saved<00:02:30.170> some<00:02:30.970> data<00:02:31.970> a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
stuff I I have it saved some data a

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.370 
stuff I I have it saved some data a
little<00:02:32.330> bit<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.670> type<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.000> block<00:02:35.390> that

you see here we're just destroying those
places<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:36.030> we<00:04:37.030> can<00:04:37.210> reach<00:04:37.419> now<00:04:37.800> because

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
places that we can reach now because

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.629 
places that we can reach now because

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
to the next goat the next code is the

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.050 
to the next goat the next code is the
fat<00:04:48.130> goat<00:04:48.400> secondly<00:04:49.150> just<00:04:49.449> stay<00:04:50.880> with<00:04:51.880> just

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
fat goat secondly just stay with just

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.290 
fat goat secondly just stay with just
the<00:04:52.180> cow<00:04:52.889> this<00:04:53.889> is<00:04:53.949> calvin<00:04:54.430> ops<00:04:54.639> over<00:04:54.820> blocks

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
the cow this is calvin ops over blocks

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.129 
the cow this is calvin ops over blocks
omit<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.599> does<00:04:59.080> have<00:04:59.349> a<00:05:02.250> knocking<00:05:03.960> boost<00:05:04.960> i

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
omit it does have a knocking boost i

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.310 
omit it does have a knocking boost i
guess<00:05:05.320> like<00:05:05.349> it<00:05:05.680> knocks<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.130> blocks<00:05:07.320> farther

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
guess like it knocks the blocks farther

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.830 
guess like it knocks the blocks farther
than<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:08.889> regular<00:05:09.070> goat<00:05:09.840> does<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.199> that's

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
than the regular goat does so that's

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.240 
than the regular goat does so that's
that's<00:05:13.840> what<00:05:14.080> i<00:05:14.110> meant<00:05:14.229> for<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:14.590> to<00:05:14.650> do<00:05:17.250> all

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
that's what i meant for it to do all

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.339 
that's what i meant for it to do all
right<00:05:18.490> i'll<00:05:19.270> let's<00:05:19.479> move<00:05:19.630> on<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:19.840> the<00:05:20.080> next<00:05:20.110> one

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
right i'll let's move on to the next one

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.560 
right i'll let's move on to the next one
I<00:05:20.740> don't<00:05:21.460> know<00:05:21.550> why<00:05:21.699> it's<00:05:21.909> not<00:05:21.970> knocking<00:05:22.479> it

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
I don't know why it's not knocking it

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.180 
I don't know why it's not knocking it
farther<00:05:22.870> I<00:05:23.020> tried<00:05:23.409> to<00:05:23.530> make<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.710> off<00:05:23.949> far

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
farther I tried to make it off far

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.890 
farther I tried to make it off far
