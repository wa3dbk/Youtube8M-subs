00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.630
 every time I return to my country and open the 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.500
 door of my house is a feeling of 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.500
 complete happiness 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.460
 the dancer elisa cheek opened us 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.070
 the doors of your house to share 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.150
 with us some of the most 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.670
 significant of his life 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.890
 I remember a lot the room where I was 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.100
 taking the class there are so many 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.590
 girls and I also remember the moment more 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.210
 shocking was when I went to the palace 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.650
 of fine arts to see the sylph and the 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.650
 Scottish with the national company of 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.680
 dance and I transported that magical world 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.030
 It was one of the moments that marked me 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.129
 since that first encounter with 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.320
 dance around five years 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.110
 Felicia takes us through the sea of 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.350
 childhood memories of studies of 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.610
 presentations I say everything in a school 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.710
 in which it had to be very 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.479
 disciplined has schedules let's say 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 from 7 am until 6 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.070
 mean 7 in the evening , let's say 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.710
 it was something I saw it as something very normal 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.210
 it became a lifestyle I and I 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.210
 I never saw it as an obligation 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.130
 the school sent me sent me some of 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.780
 the national competitions had to be 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.040
 on Saturdays all the girls rested 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.020
 and on Saturdays I had to go to the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.690
 school and rehearse and study in the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.630
 feet and you have to repeat things but 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.450
 I really did not see it at that time 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.190
 I took it as something that was 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.690
 sacrificing what I was losing me 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.880
 a beautiful stage of my life because 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.160
 I always had that I could also play and 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.160
 I could enjoy those years 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.800
 when you're a little girl you do not 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.040
 Do you really know what you mean? 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.970
 you understand that it is a passion you do it 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.030
 because you like to get attention 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.490
 dance forges the body discipline 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.070
 creates habits but who lives for 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.810
 compete must have a mettle and a 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.810
 well-defined character 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.760
 When I'm in Berlin, I say all the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.099
 that we are here we have something special and 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.900
 if I'm here it 's because I have something I'm 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.480
 very very lucky I have the blessing 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.099
 to be here then that's what to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.769
 sometimes motivates us we know of place very 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.680
 far I am different from the others let's say 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.880
 I have brown hair eyes 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.860
 skin 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.690
 everyone has their beauty then 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.670
 I try to be good if I'm here for something 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.670
 and then I will give the best I have 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.150
 but we all have to have let's say that 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:00.030
 a good technique that and after that 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.940
 everyone is taking out as their gifts 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.130
 special let's not say 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.620
 I do not like to talk about how I look 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.450
 I do not know either I do not know but things that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.280
 I also know that I have a comb 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.840
 let's say there are not many people who know what 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.330
 you have pretty feet is something that gave me the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.790
 nature because good I do not know or where 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.070
 I took it out the truth is that the 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.140
 extensions something also that have me 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.490
 said and good is something that for me is a 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.710
 of the strongest things and more 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.130
 important the dancers is the way 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.200
 to express to feel the things I try 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.150
 that is one of my strengths is what 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.890
 what I try to be able to interpret 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.320
 and to feel what I do not just 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.150
 think about the technique because the technique 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.950
 it's something we should have are both 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.410
 very important things but when you 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.190
 sales is technical you're not doing what 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.190
 what is the artist
