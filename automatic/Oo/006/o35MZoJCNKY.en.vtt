sensitive switch is adjustable and we

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.880 
sensitive switch is adjustable and we
said<00:01:10.479> it<00:01:10.600> very<00:01:10.810> close<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.470> oil<00:01:11.500> pressure

that<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.340> engine<00:01:12.640> runs<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:14.170> it's<00:01:14.740> possible

that the engine runs so it's possible

it from time to time and then give us a

it from time to time and then give us a

problem<00:01:23.410> we've<00:01:23.560> got<00:01:23.860> some<00:01:24.160> pretty<00:01:24.280> terrific

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580

motor<00:01:26.920> we're<00:01:27.160> sure<00:01:27.310> yeah<00:01:27.880> but<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.120> looks<00:01:28.330> like

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
motor we're sure yeah but it looks like

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.940 
motor we're sure yeah but it looks like
it<00:01:28.720> almost<00:01:28.990> sounds<00:01:29.350> like<00:01:29.380> every<00:01:29.650> time<00:01:29.830> you

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
it almost sounds like every time you

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.110

yeah<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.180> Bobby<00:03:04.630> isn't<00:03:04.990> that<00:03:05.080> because<00:03:05.230> he's

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
yeah but Bobby isn't that because he's

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.949 
yeah but Bobby isn't that because he's
drafting<00:03:06.099> Danny<00:03:06.819> right<00:03:07.090> now<00:03:07.240> it<00:03:07.720> would<00:03:07.870> be

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
drafting Danny right now it would be

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.809 
drafting Danny right now it would be
different<00:03:08.170> perhaps<00:03:08.709> when<00:03:09.040> he<00:03:09.160> if<00:03:09.400> he's<00:03:09.670> able

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
different perhaps when he if he's able

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.130 
different perhaps when he if he's able
to<00:03:10.000> pass<00:03:10.239> him<00:03:10.480> we'll<00:03:10.630> see<00:03:10.780> if<00:03:10.870> he<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.020> pull

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
to pass him we'll see if he can pull

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.320 
to pass him we'll see if he can pull
away<00:03:11.290> that<00:03:11.980> would<00:03:12.190> be<00:03:12.310> conclusive<00:03:12.970> but<00:03:13.000> what

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
away that would be conclusive but what

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.570 
away that would be conclusive but what
we<00:03:13.450> see<00:03:13.480> now<00:03:13.810> really<00:03:14.170> isn't<00:03:14.349> is<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.620> well<00:03:15.099> the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
we see now really isn't is it well the
