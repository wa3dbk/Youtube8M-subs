not just happy to be here I think every

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.030 
not just happy to be here I think every
time<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.960> walk<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> court<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
time you walk on the court you have to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.399 
time you walk on the court you have to
tell<00:01:47.880> yourself<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.960> believe<00:01:49.229> that

tell yourself that you believe that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.200 
tell yourself that you believe that
you're<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> win<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> match<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
you're going to win the match but I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.660 
you're going to win the match but I

this really happening and
let's<00:02:07.899> try<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.080> keep<00:02:08.259> this<00:02:08.470> going<00:02:08.800> how<00:02:09.610> do<00:02:09.670> you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
let's try to keep this going how do you

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.630 
let's try to keep this going how do you
maintain<00:02:10.629> oh<00:02:11.019> how<00:02:11.349> did<00:02:11.709> you<00:02:11.890> maintain<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
maintain oh how did you maintain the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.360 
maintain oh how did you maintain the
motivation<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.440> sit<00:02:14.680> old<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
motivation and you can sit old that you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.940 
motivation and you can sit old that you
went<00:02:15.670> through<00:02:15.790> with<00:02:16.629> all<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.170> injuries<00:02:17.560> all

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
went through with all the injuries all

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.089 
went through with all the injuries all
the<00:02:18.160> surgeries<00:02:18.459> right<00:02:19.120> being<00:02:19.870> laid<00:02:20.140> up<00:02:20.170> well<00:02:21.069> I

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
the surgeries right being laid up well I

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.070 
the surgeries right being laid up well I
think<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.580> motivation<00:02:22.060> then<00:02:22.269> was<00:02:22.480> tough<00:02:22.720> just

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
think the motivation then was tough just

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.449 
think the motivation then was tough just
because<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.590> didn't<00:02:23.830> see<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.129> light<00:02:24.310> at<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
because you didn't see the light at the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.220 
because you didn't see the light at the
end<00:02:24.519> of<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> tunnel<00:02:25.120> whereas<00:02:25.840> now<00:02:26.019> that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
end of the tunnel whereas now that

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.500 
end of the tunnel whereas now that
you're<00:02:26.349> now<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.860> I'm<00:02:26.950> back<00:02:26.980> playing<00:02:27.459> I<00:02:27.910> think

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
you're now that I'm back playing I think

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.140 
you're now that I'm back playing I think
the<00:02:28.569> motivations<00:02:29.110> even<00:02:29.260> been<00:02:29.950> greater<00:02:30.220> just

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
the motivations even been greater just

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.339 
the motivations even been greater just
because<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:32.319> so<00:02:32.560> much<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:33.160> guess<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:35.140> so

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
because it's so much I guess it's so

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.440 
because it's so much I guess it's so
much<00:02:35.530> sweeter<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.610> time<00:02:36.819> around<00:02:36.970> just

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
much sweeter this time around just

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.809 
much sweeter this time around just
because<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.720> know<00:02:37.799> how<00:02:38.799> easy<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.190> tennis<00:02:39.579> can<00:02:39.730> be

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
because I know how easy a tennis can be

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.030 
because I know how easy a tennis can be
taken<00:02:40.120> away<00:02:40.209> from<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.900> how<00:02:41.170> much

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
taken away from you and how much

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.860 
taken away from you and how much
struggle<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.640> went<00:02:42.849> through<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.660> now<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
struggle I went through and so now the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.350 
struggle I went through and so now the
motivation<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.500> great<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:45.190> kind<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.880> keep<00:02:46.150> this

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
motivation is great to kind of keep this

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.020 
motivation is great to kind of keep this
going<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:46.989> not<00:02:47.500> make<00:02:47.739> up<00:02:47.920> for<00:02:48.160> lost<00:02:48.370> time<00:02:48.670> by

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
going and not make up for lost time by

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.210 
going and not make up for lost time by
just<00:02:49.540> knowing<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.530> have<00:02:50.739> been<00:02:50.890> given<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
just knowing that I have been given a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.710 
just knowing that I have been given a
second<00:02:51.549> chance<00:02:51.579> so<00:02:51.940> let's<00:02:52.090> make<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.360> most<00:02:52.390> of

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
second chance so let's make the most of

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.199 
second chance so let's make the most of
it<00:02:52.840> does<00:02:53.260> i<00:02:53.349> make<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.709> mentally<00:02:54.099> tough<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.940> has

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
it does i make you mentally tough it has

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.530 
it does i make you mentally tough it has
to<00:02:55.450> i<00:02:55.840> don't<00:02:56.410> have<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:57.730> experience<00:02:57.879> maybe

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
to i don't have the experience maybe

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.119 
to i don't have the experience maybe
because<00:02:58.810> i<00:02:58.870> haven't<00:02:59.049> played<00:02:59.379> all<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.709> matches

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
because i haven't played all the matches

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.619 
because i haven't played all the matches
but<00:03:00.610> just<00:03:00.849> going<00:03:01.180> through<00:03:01.360> what<00:03:01.480> I've<00:03:01.599> gone

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
but just going through what I've gone

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.420 
but just going through what I've gone
through<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.230> being<00:03:02.410> older<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:02.769> think<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.280> makes

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
through and being older I think it makes

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.009 
through and being older I think it makes
it<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:03.730> much<00:03:03.790> easier<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.329> handle<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.690> ups<00:03:04.840> and

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
it so much easier to handle the ups and

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.839 
it so much easier to handle the ups and
downs<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.530> matches<00:03:05.709> whereas<00:03:06.430> maybe<00:03:06.640> as<00:03:06.819> a

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
downs of the matches whereas maybe as a

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.910 
downs of the matches whereas maybe as a
19<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.599> 20<00:03:07.810> year<00:03:07.930> old<00:03:08.079> I<00:03:08.170> didn't<00:03:08.379> handle<00:03:08.680> quite

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
19 and 20 year old I didn't handle quite

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.120 
19 and 20 year old I didn't handle quite
so<00:03:09.129> well<00:03:09.660> which<00:03:10.660> players<00:03:10.959> have<00:03:11.260> given<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.010> the
