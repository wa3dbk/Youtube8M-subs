 ladies and gentlemen some details 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.450
 tiny but too important 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.880
 about the elements that the 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.930
 skater to go on the track or in 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.930
 the circuit of the route 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.790
 because it is the athlete who prepares 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 your skate and not like for example in the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.090
 cycling is a specialized person 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.400
 in organizing the visits of the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.960
 athletes because he is the skater or the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.210
 skater in this case the one 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.310
 personally he is in charge of preparing his 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.110
 good boot I think that that's very 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.600
 important for one does not have to be 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.700
 very focused on one's things in 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.100
 the materials that one is going to use one 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.600
 he knows how to put his things one has to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.420
 be very confident and how you are going to put it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.480
 it is obligatory to introduce the gloves 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.879
 for the right to the left is 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.460
 mandatory for security also 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.920
 employ the helmet here we have it is a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.990
 helmet that is civil in many occasions 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.960
 to the helmet used by cyclists and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.540
 finally the boot normally now 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.700
 They use errands to make custom 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.229
 truth there are people and companies that in the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.720
 world are dedicated to it the wheels 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.790
 They have a tougher denomination less 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.150
 hard you look at it, look at them 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.150
 numbers 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.270
 Primarily we arrive when we go 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.310
 to play compete first of all because we put 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.660
 a network is not so good to be able 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.870
 roll and heat then we go and 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.910
 we remove the screws to be able to do 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.500
 the change of wheels but it's not very much 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.450
 better to run some batteries 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.850
 we can remove ourselves to show here the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.550
 balineras so small so small that 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.680
 have these vital elements for the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.190
 good performance of an athlete look 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.030
 how it is removed and here is this part that 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.030
 it also takes off truth 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.799
 with the lines the very well 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.150
