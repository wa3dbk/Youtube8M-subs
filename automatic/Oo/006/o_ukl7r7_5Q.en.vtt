00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the way that it looks the worst thing

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.600 
the way that it looks the worst thing
about<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.770> says<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.130> light<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
about it is that it says it's light and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.490 
about it is that it says it's light and
this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.030> nothing<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.810> light<00:01:40.049> color<00:01:40.290> at

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this is nothing like a light color at

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140 
this is nothing like a light color at
all<00:01:40.530> whatsoever<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.340> think<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> more<00:01:42.090> like

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
all whatsoever I think this is more like

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.830 
all whatsoever I think this is more like
an<00:01:42.479> oompa<00:01:42.750> loompa<00:01:43.079> sort<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.380> color<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:45.450> think

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
an oompa loompa sort of color I think

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.359 
an oompa loompa sort of color I think
this<00:01:45.960> would<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.200> great<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.470> those<00:01:46.799> palookas

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
formula is way different I thought it

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.910

but instead it felt like the formula was

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.660 
but instead it felt like the formula was
completely<00:03:17.680> different<00:03:18.010> which<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.220> didn't<00:03:18.489> like
