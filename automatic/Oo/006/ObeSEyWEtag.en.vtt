00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the gym my gym I go to they have a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.009 
the gym my gym I go to they have a
special<00:00:11.280> deal<00:00:11.429> because<00:00:11.940> if<00:00:12.089> I<00:00:12.209> bulk<00:00:12.540> with<00:00:12.749> ring

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
special deal because if I bulk with ring

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.430 
special deal because if I bulk with ring
to<00:00:13.139> cage<00:00:13.379> so<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.839> get<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.400> $1<00:00:17.400> cheaper<00:00:17.789> and

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
to cage so I get this $1 cheaper and

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.650 
to cage so I get this $1 cheaper and
overall<00:00:21.380> you<00:00:22.380> know<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.679> does<00:00:22.920> fit<00:00:23.220> pretty<00:00:23.400> snug

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
overall you know it does fit pretty snug

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.050 
overall you know it does fit pretty snug
it's<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.750> good<00:00:24.929> fit<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:29.220> looks<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.640> goofy

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it's a good fit it looks a little goofy

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.310 
it's a good fit it looks a little goofy
and<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.300> what<00:00:30.539> should<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> little<00:00:31.199> bit

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and I do what should have a little bit

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.119 
and I do what should have a little bit
more<00:00:31.470> protection<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> chin<00:00:36.469> but<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:38.010> does

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
more protection on the chin but it does

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
more protection on the chin but it does
fit<00:00:38.340> pretty<00:00:38.460> snug<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.960> idea<00:00:43.710> behind<00:00:43.920> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
fit pretty snug and the idea behind this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.349 
fit pretty snug and the idea behind this
one<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.879> kind<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.329> hybrid<00:00:45.510> between<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
one is it's kind of a hybrid between a

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.369 
one is it's kind of a hybrid between a
boxing<00:00:48.359> headgear<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.719> wrestling<00:00:49.050> head<00:00:49.170> here

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
so you can wrestle with this and then

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.139

you know when I wrestle so this is gonna
be<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.610> interesting<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.869> try<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.490> we're

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
be a little interesting to try out we're

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.679 
be a little interesting to try out we're
looking<00:01:50.759> forward<00:01:50.969> to<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.299> I'll<00:01:51.420> probably

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
looking forward to it and I'll probably

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.850 
looking forward to it and I'll probably
do<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> review<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:55.229> know<00:01:55.350> probably

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
do a review on it you know probably

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.620 
do a review on it you know probably
about<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.310> month<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.729> few<00:01:56.880> weeks<00:01:57.119> well<00:01:57.509> I'm<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
about a month a few weeks well I'm a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.850 
about a month a few weeks well I'm a
little<00:01:58.049> bit<00:01:58.140> more<00:01:58.290> than<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.500> few<00:01:58.619> weeks

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
little bit more than a few weeks

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.480 
little bit more than a few weeks
probably<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.250> three<00:01:59.640> weeks<00:01:59.789> at<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> least

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
probably like three weeks at the least

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.940 
probably like three weeks at the least
and<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.549> did<00:02:02.729> cost<00:02:02.969> about<00:02:03.350> $70<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.469> believe<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and it did cost about $70 I believe and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.550 
and it did cost about $70 I believe and
the<00:02:05.700> actual<00:02:06.149> boxing<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> air<00:02:06.869> costs<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.530> think

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the actual boxing the air costs I think

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.750 
the actual boxing the air costs I think
120<00:02:08.490> so<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> pretty<00:02:09.750> good<00:02:09.930> deal<00:02:10.760> you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
120 so this is a pretty good deal you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.140 
120 so this is a pretty good deal you
know

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
know
