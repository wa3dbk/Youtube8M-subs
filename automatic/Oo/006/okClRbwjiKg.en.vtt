00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it code but you need a code so I'll be

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.999 
it code but you need a code so I'll be
telling<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> code<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> enter<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.830> right

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
telling you the code to enter in right

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
telling you the code to enter in right
now<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:18.119> code<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:18.960> way<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
now this is my code so that way when you

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.440 
now this is my code so that way when you
enter<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:20.400> points<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.210> you

enter this in I get points and so do you
so<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> two-way<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so it's like a two-way thing it's a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.609 
so it's like a two-way thing it's a
win-win<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.670> both<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.119> us<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.930> enter<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.350> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
win-win for both of us so enter in this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.830 
win-win for both of us so enter in this
code<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.659> 3d<00:01:27.740> b83<00:01:28.740> g<00:01:29.310> i<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:30.060> flash<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> big

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
code here 3d b83 g i will flash that big

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.679 
code here 3d b83 g i will flash that big
up<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> screen<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.979> second<00:01:32.369> here<00:01:32.689> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
up on the screen and a second here and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
up on the screen and a second here and
that<00:01:34.500> way<00:01:34.619> enter<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.100> code<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.490> both

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that way enter in this code and we both

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.060 
that way enter in this code and we both
get<00:01:35.850> coins<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.869> gift<00:01:37.320> cards<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.799> works<00:01:37.950> out
