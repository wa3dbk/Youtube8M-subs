went to the green or the yellow loogie

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.700 
went to the green or the yellow loogie
then<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.430> green<00:00:21.640> loogie<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.630> sweet<00:00:23.079> spot<00:00:23.410> and

difference between a sweet spot in the
sweet<00:00:29.169> spot<00:00:29.289> Pro<00:00:29.769> is<00:00:30.039> we<00:00:30.670> took<00:00:30.880> this<00:00:31.029> sweet

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
sweet spot Pro is we took this sweet

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.170 
sweet spot Pro is we took this sweet
spot<00:00:31.779> narrowed<00:00:32.769> it<00:00:32.920> an<00:00:33.070> inch<00:00:33.370> half<00:00:33.730> inch<00:00:34.000> on

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
spot narrowed it an inch half inch on

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.380 
spot narrowed it an inch half inch on
each<00:00:34.330> side<00:00:34.360> and<00:00:35.460> increase<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.820> nose<00:00:37.030> rocker

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
each side and increase the nose rocker

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.160 
each side and increase the nose rocker
and<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:39.010> that<00:00:39.160> does<00:00:39.430> is<00:00:39.670> help<00:00:40.210> with<00:00:40.600> speed

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
and what that does is help with speed

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.710 
and what that does is help with speed
and<00:00:41.470> it's<00:00:42.370> a<00:00:42.519> little<00:00:42.790> bit<00:00:42.909> more<00:00:43.059> forgiving

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
and it's a little bit more forgiving

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.029 
and it's a little bit more forgiving
than<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.860> sweet<00:00:45.159> spot<00:00:45.460> was<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:47.710> have<00:00:47.829> our

create<00:01:22.360> some<00:01:22.569> speed<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.200> then<00:01:23.950> this<00:01:24.310> board

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
create some speed and then this board

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:27.900 
create some speed and then this board
features<00:01:25.509> our<00:01:25.869> new<00:01:26.440> step<00:01:26.950> tech<00:01:27.220> design<00:01:27.640> which

board and we've come to find out but
this<00:01:33.130> adds<00:01:33.310> speed<00:01:34.239> and<00:01:34.569> it<00:01:35.110> gives<00:01:35.289> it<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.619> nice

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this adds speed and it gives it a nice

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
on the outside locations or you can

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.940 
on the outside locations or you can
remove<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.060> plugs<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.720> put<00:01:53.229> on<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.530> inside

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
remove the plugs and put on the inside

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.520 
remove the plugs and put on the inside
location<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.940> loosen<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.390> board<00:01:55.630> up<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:56.500> I

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
location to loosen the board up what I

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.999 
location to loosen the board up what I
suggest<00:01:57.069> is<00:01:57.280> adding<00:01:58.209> a<00:01:58.479> set<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:59.259> either<00:01:59.530> small

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
suggest is adding a set of either small

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.719 
suggest is adding a set of either small
or<00:02:00.239> medium-sized<00:02:01.349> fins<00:02:02.349> to<00:02:02.979> go<00:02:03.099> on<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.369> inside

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
or medium-sized fins to go on the inside

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.270 
or medium-sized fins to go on the inside
location<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.920> generally<00:02:05.920> speaking<00:02:08.280> adding

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
location and generally speaking adding

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.190 
location and generally speaking adding
fans<00:02:09.550> or<00:02:09.849> using<00:02:10.179> larger<00:02:10.569> fans<00:02:10.810> will<00:02:10.989> tighten

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
fans or using larger fans will tighten

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.229 
fans or using larger fans will tighten
the<00:02:11.379> tail<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.160> adds<00:02:12.340> drive<00:02:12.849> and

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
the tail and that adds drive and

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.150 
the tail and that adds drive and
acceleration<00:02:14.140> when<00:02:14.260> you're<00:02:14.379> pumping<00:02:14.830> it

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
acceleration when you're pumping it

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.650 
acceleration when you're pumping it
gives<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.580> little<00:02:15.849> extra<00:02:16.000> edge<00:02:16.330> when

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
gives you a little extra edge when

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.720 
gives you a little extra edge when
