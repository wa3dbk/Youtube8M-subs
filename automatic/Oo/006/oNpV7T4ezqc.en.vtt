00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
compact and i'm going to try something a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.550 
compact and i'm going to try something a
little<00:01:08.070> different<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.299> tutorial

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
little different for this tutorial

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.420 
little different for this tutorial
instead<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.799> through<00:01:11.070> all<00:01:11.250> the

instead of going through all the
materials<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.330> need<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> build<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.960> i

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
materials that you need to build it i

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.160 
materials that you need to build it i
will<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.500> put<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:14.040> picture<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.869> the

materials that you need on the top of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.370 
materials that you need on the top of
the<00:01:17.670> screen<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.060> now<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.170> play

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the screen right now I this little play

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
the screen right now I this little play
for<00:01:19.650> about<00:01:19.770> 30<00:01:19.979> seconds<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.670> get

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
for about 30 seconds you can get

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.670 
for about 30 seconds you can get
everything<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> need<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.439> start

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
everything that you need and then start

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
everything that you need and then start
building<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.520> i<00:01:23.820> think<00:01:23.939> i'm<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
building so i think i'm just going to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.570 
building so i think i'm just going to
get<00:01:24.600> right<00:01:25.140> into<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.409> first<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.220> want<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> find

this and i recommend just popping this
out<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.000> he<00:01:30.210> could<00:01:30.329> place<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.540> back<00:01:30.720> in

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
out for now he could place it back in

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.140 
out for now he could place it back in
later<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.369> place<00:01:32.369> down<00:01:32.549> your<00:01:32.700> brewing<00:01:32.939> stand

is<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:42.150> ceiling<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:43.439> actually

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
is your ceiling and you can actually

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.120 
is your ceiling and you can actually
close<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.610> now<00:01:45.890> go<00:01:46.890> down

close this up right now go down
underneath<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.360> want<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> place<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.960> block

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
underneath you want to place a block

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.319 
underneath you want to place a block
right<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.460> hop<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.970> into<00:01:51.210> this

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
right here with a hop or going into this

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.469 
right here with a hop or going into this
block<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.840> rail<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.799> top<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.030> mine

block I rail on top of here with a mine

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.539 
block I rail on top of here with a mine
cart<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.840> hopper<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.229> top<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.710> then

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
cart with a hopper on top of that then

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.510 
cart with a hopper on top of that then
you<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> run<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.299> hopper<00:01:57.689> chain<00:01:57.899> down<00:01:58.110> here

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
you want to run a hopper chain down here

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.859 
you want to run a hopper chain down here
so<00:01:59.520> placed<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.939> hoppers<00:02:00.270> make<00:02:00.509> sure<00:02:00.689> they're

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
so placed on hoppers make sure they're

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.630 
so placed on hoppers make sure they're
all<00:02:00.899> facing<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.619> direction<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:02.250> until

this point when you want to make your
drop<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:04.920> chain<00:02:05.130> upwards<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.509> place<00:02:06.810> down<00:02:06.990> all

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
drop or chain upwards so place down all

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.059 
drop or chain upwards so place down all
four<00:02:07.500> droppers<00:02:08.330> for<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.569> here<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.530> need<00:02:10.770> two

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
four droppers for up here you need two

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.820 
four droppers for up here you need two
more<00:02:11.250> hoppers<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:12.629> facing<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.500> dress

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
more hoppers so one facing this dress

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.040 
more hoppers so one facing this dress
and<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.370> going<00:02:14.640> straight<00:02:14.670> down<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.900> remember

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and one going straight down so remember

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.240 
and one going straight down so remember
to<00:02:16.200> hold<00:02:16.290> shift<00:02:16.650> while<00:02:16.740> looking<00:02:17.040> at<00:02:17.130> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
to hold shift while looking at the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.550 
to hold shift while looking at the
hopper<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.700> you're<00:02:18.570> all<00:02:18.660> set<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.230> basics

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
hopper and you're all set for the basics

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.290 
hopper and you're all set for the basics
now<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.040> detecting<00:02:20.550> when<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.910> toss<00:02:21.150> an

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
now it's just detecting when you toss an

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.290 
now it's just detecting when you toss an
item<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.550> out<00:02:23.580> all<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.910> your<00:02:24.150> other

item in so get out all of your other
redstone<00:02:24.690> materials<00:02:26.840> place<00:02:27.840> down<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> block

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
redstone materials place down a block

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.140 
redstone materials place down a block
right<00:02:28.740> here<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.160> they<00:02:29.250> compare<00:02:29.640> their<00:02:29.790> facing
