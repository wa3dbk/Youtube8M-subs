probably the easiest part as soon as you
can<00:01:07.979> move<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> will<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.049> arrow<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.409> with

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
can move you will get this arrow up with

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.710 
can move you will get this arrow up with
the<00:01:10.920> area<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.850> want<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> move<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that you can move is dependent upon how

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.499 
that you can move is dependent upon how
far<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.590> ball<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.100> moving<00:01:20.130> during<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.180> turn

as<00:01:25.170> speed<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.500> condition<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.659> soon<00:01:27.930> as

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
as speed and condition now as soon as

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.410 
as speed and condition now as soon as
you<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.310> interact<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> ball<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
look at this example you see how I first

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.160 
look at this example you see how I first
moved<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> point<00:01:39.540> where<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:40.110> to

creating a low pass High Pass and then

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.690 
creating a low pass High Pass and then
of<00:02:23.050> course<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.410> needed<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.800> select<00:02:24.160> where<00:02:24.400> to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
of course I needed to select where to

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.470 
of course I needed to select where to
place<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.390> ball<00:02:26.790> let's<00:02:27.790> have<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.970> look<00:02:28.150> at<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
place the ball let's have a look at the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.670 
place the ball let's have a look at the
similar<00:02:29.110> example<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:29.890> where<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:31.500> select<00:02:32.500> to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
similar example here where I select to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.590 
similar example here where I select to
receive<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> ball<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.700> like<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.300> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
receive the ball just like in the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.390 
receive the ball just like in the
previous<00:02:35.050> example<00:02:35.380> but<00:02:37.230> instead<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.400> passing

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
previous example but instead of passing

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.580 
previous example but instead of passing
the<00:02:39.520> ball<00:02:39.700> next<00:02:40.000> turn<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.390> decide<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.170> move<00:02:41.350> with

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
the ball next turn I decide to move with

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.090 
the ball next turn I decide to move with
the<00:02:41.680> ball

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
the ball

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.140 
the ball
I<00:02:42.130> try<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.060> shake<00:02:43.450> off<00:02:43.660> my<00:02:43.930> defender<00:02:44.350> here<00:02:45.150> you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
I try to shake off my defender here you

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.380 
I try to shake off my defender here you
see<00:02:46.420> me<00:02:46.570> selecting<00:02:47.230> mood<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.060> moving<00:02:49.060> forward

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
see me selecting mood and moving forward

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.760 
see me selecting mood and moving forward
along<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.380> sidelines

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
along the sidelines

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.360 
along the sidelines
now<00:02:53.310> let's<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.940> look<00:02:54.120> at<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.420> most

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
now let's have a look at the most

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.100 
now let's have a look at the most
advanced<00:02:56.370> things<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:57.750> do<00:02:57.900> in

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
advanced things that you can do in

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.590 
advanced things that you can do in
multiple<00:02:58.560> identities<00:02:59.160> to<00:03:00.060> perform<00:03:00.420> direct

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
multiple identities to perform direct

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.380 
multiple identities to perform direct
actions<00:03:01.260> look<00:03:01.500> at<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.770> example<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.490> select<00:03:03.030> to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
actions look at this example I select to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.690 
actions look at this example I select to
make<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> direct<00:03:04.410> low<00:03:04.800> pass<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.340> one<00:03:05.490> of<00:03:05.610> my

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
make a direct low pass to one of my

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.000 
make a direct low pass to one of my
teammates<00:03:06.090> what<00:03:06.990> this<00:03:07.200> does<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.710> that<00:03:07.740> it

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
teammates what this does is that it

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.280 
teammates what this does is that it
during<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.850> next<00:03:09.150> turn<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.510> will<00:03:09.660> be<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> much

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
during the next turn it will be a much

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.000 
during the next turn it will be a much
shorter<00:03:10.620> turn<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.790> reaction<00:03:12.660> time<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.170> much

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
shorter turn so a reaction time is much

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.510 
shorter turn so a reaction time is much
lower<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.670> perform<00:03:15.240> a<00:03:15.330> director<00:03:15.960> pause

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
lower if you perform a director pause

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.040 
lower if you perform a director pause
we'll<00:03:17.520> look<00:03:17.910> at<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.210> is<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.570> motion<00:03:18.900> here<00:03:19.020> I

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
we'll look at this is the motion here I

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.540 
we'll look at this is the motion here I
select<00:03:19.500> where<00:03:19.710> to<00:03:19.740> go<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:21.860> select<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.160> interact

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
select where to go I select to interact

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.330 
select where to go I select to interact
with<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.820> ball<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.390> pass<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.660> low<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:26.250> I

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
with the ball and to pass it low and I

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.780 
with the ball and to pass it low and I
select<00:03:26.700> where<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.360> want<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.780> pass<00:03:27.990> it<00:03:28.760> now<00:03:29.760> I

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
select where I want to pass it now I

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.870 
select where I want to pass it now I
guess<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.240> feel<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.960> is<00:03:31.640> too<00:03:32.640> short

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
guess you feel that this is too short

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.300 
guess you feel that this is too short
time<00:03:33.210> to<00:03:33.450> perform<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.020> many<00:03:34.470> actions<00:03:35.010> but

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
time to perform this many actions but

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.000 
time to perform this many actions but
believe<00:03:35.760> me<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:36.330> going<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.230> be<00:03:37.380> much<00:03:37.590> easier

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
believe me it's going to be much easier

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.650 
believe me it's going to be much easier
so<00:03:38.310> as<00:03:38.520> soon<00:03:38.730> as<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.030> get<00:03:39.150> used<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.570> the
