unit it's sold in a red card basis that
pretty<00:01:03.180> much<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.750> try<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.990> do<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.259> really

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
pretty much we try to do that really

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.260 
pretty much we try to do that really
consistently<00:01:04.920> across<00:01:05.100> all<00:01:05.399> of<00:01:05.429> all<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.179> our

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
consistently across all of all of our

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.419 
consistently across all of all of our
markets<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> same<00:01:07.380> product<00:01:07.799> doesn't

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
markets it's the same product doesn't

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:11.149 
markets it's the same product doesn't
vary<00:01:08.759> and<00:01:09.719> it's<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.929> same<00:01:10.079> proposition<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.859> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
vary and it's the same proposition to to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.190 
vary and it's the same proposition to to
advertisers<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.939> second<00:01:12.299> solution<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
advertisers the second solution then is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.319 
advertisers the second solution then is
the<00:01:13.499> sort<00:01:14.039> of<00:01:14.070> standard<00:01:14.369> ads<00:01:14.729> which<00:01:15.060> appear

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
the sort of standard ads which appear

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.660 
the sort of standard ads which appear
within<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.689> site<00:01:15.899> we<00:01:16.439> call<00:01:16.619> these<00:01:16.740> ads<00:01:17.369> base

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
within the site we call these ads base

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.630 
within the site we call these ads base
units<00:01:17.999> so<00:01:18.329> these<00:01:18.479> ads<00:01:18.749> are<00:01:19.049> usually<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.950> units

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
units so these ads are usually in units

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.569 
units so these ads are usually in units
of<00:01:20.729> three<00:01:21.149> and<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:22.890> know<00:01:23.009> there's<00:01:23.249> sort<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
of three and you know there's sort of

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.130 
of three and you know there's sort of
more<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.819> a<00:01:23.909> cost-per-click<00:01:24.359> model<00:01:24.869> what<00:01:25.109> we

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
more of a cost-per-click model what we

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.669 
more of a cost-per-click model what we
call<00:01:25.439> performance<00:01:25.979> ads<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.450> again<00:01:27.899> this<00:01:28.499> is

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
call performance ads and again this is

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.010 
call performance ads and again this is
we<00:01:28.889> see<00:01:29.039> a<00:01:29.069> really<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.579> broad<00:01:29.960> sort<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
we see a really really broad sort of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.639 
we see a really really broad sort of
base<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.979> people<00:01:32.219> using<00:01:32.549> these<00:01:32.670> ads<00:01:33.499> it<00:01:34.499> could

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
base of people using these ads it could

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.139 
base of people using these ads it could

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
well I think where we see this going is

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.270 
well I think where we see this going is
like<00:03:03.960> in<00:03:04.110> an<00:03:04.200> ideal<00:03:04.440> world<00:03:04.500> will<00:03:04.920> start<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.220> see

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.750 
are interacting with that we've seen
maybe<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.300> smaller<00:03:27.890> subsection<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.980> real<00:03:29.459> real

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
something that again from an advertiser

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.050 
something that again from an advertiser
point<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.650> view<00:03:34.770> we<00:03:34.890> like<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.340> think<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.640> as<00:03:35.760> a

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
point of view we like to think of as a

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.090 
point of view we like to think of as a
really<00:03:36.300> nice<00:03:36.420> sort<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.050> weapon<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:37.709> the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
really nice sort of weapon in the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.040 
really nice sort of weapon in the
toolkit<00:03:38.489> again<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.450> could<00:03:39.570> be<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.720> product

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
toolkit again it could be a product

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.090 
toolkit again it could be a product
launch<00:03:40.170> or<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.470> could<00:03:40.620> just<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.830> something

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
launch or it could just be something

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.410 
launch or it could just be something
that<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.550> know<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.700> want<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:41.910> create<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.180> round

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
that you know you want to create a round

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.440 
that you know you want to create a round
of<00:03:42.510> brand<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.380> again<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.980> want<00:03:44.269> people<00:03:45.269> to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
of brand and again you want people to

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
beginning and it was one of these things

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.090 
beginning and it was one of these things
that<00:04:16.019> they<00:04:16.109> didn't<00:04:16.440> Reno<00:04:16.650> how<00:04:16.799> bigger<00:04:17.010> is

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
and this one actually I think primarily

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.070 
and this one actually I think primarily
grew<00:06:11.039> has<00:06:11.760> been<00:06:11.970> successful<00:06:12.510> because<00:06:12.630> of<00:06:12.960> what

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
grew has been successful because of what

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.560 
grew has been successful because of what
it's<00:06:13.200> done<00:06:13.349> the<00:06:13.530> facebook<00:06:13.889> platform<00:06:14.479> so<00:06:15.479> they

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
it's done the facebook platform so they

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.930 
it's done the facebook platform so they
of<00:06:15.690> over<00:06:16.380> I<00:06:16.740> think<00:06:17.220> it's<00:06:17.340> around<00:06:17.430> 80<00:06:17.700> million

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
of over I think it's around 80 million

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.379 
of over I think it's around 80 million
unique<00:06:18.840> users<00:06:18.870> per<00:06:19.860> month<00:06:20.360> and<00:06:21.360> they<00:06:22.050> have<00:06:22.229> I

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
unique users per month and they have I

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.550 
unique users per month and they have I
know<00:06:24.389> that<00:06:24.510> they're<00:06:24.660> on<00:06:24.780> there<00:06:24.990> on<00:06:25.139> the<00:06:25.229> iphone

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
know that they're on there on the iphone

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.469 
know that they're on there on the iphone
as<00:06:25.710> well<00:06:26.330> and<00:06:27.330> it<00:06:28.190> again<00:06:29.190> estimates<00:06:30.120> are<00:06:30.210> they

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
as well and it again estimates are they

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.390 
as well and it again estimates are they
they<00:06:30.750> probably<00:06:31.050> earn<00:06:31.260> somewhere<00:06:31.680> between<00:06:31.830> 150

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
they probably earn somewhere between 150

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.860 
they probably earn somewhere between 150
to<00:06:32.610> 200<00:06:32.970> million<00:06:33.590> in<00:06:34.760> 2009<00:06:35.760> just<00:06:36.120> on<00:06:36.300> these
