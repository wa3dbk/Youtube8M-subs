actually see a little bit of muscle

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.910 
actually see a little bit of muscle
definition<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.200> don't<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.469> any

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
muscle definition at all you're you know
likely<00:00:52.410> at<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.039> 12<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.579> 20<00:00:53.850> percent<00:00:54.180> body<00:00:54.300> fat

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779 
likely at the 12 to 20 percent body fat
range<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.410> bulk<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.890> cut<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.399> you're

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
range and if you bulk and cut and you're

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.670 
range and if you bulk and cut and you're
already<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.449> over<00:00:57.809> 12%<00:00:58.140> body<00:00:58.500> fat

ideal candidate for bulking and cutting
now<00:02:09.060> let's<00:02:09.270> talk<00:02:09.390> about<00:02:09.450> how<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> actually<00:02:10.050> do

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
now let's talk about how to actually do

now let's talk about how to actually do
it<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.819> bulking<00:02:12.510> period<00:02:12.930> should<00:02:13.110> be

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
it so a bulking period should be

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.640 
it so a bulking period should be
anywhere<00:02:13.600> from<00:02:13.750> two<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.020> three<00:02:14.140> months

a really really large intake of you know

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.220 
a really really large intake of you know
lean<00:03:02.830> proteins<00:03:03.400> complex<00:03:04.090> carbohydrates<00:03:05.080> and

lean proteins complex carbohydrates and

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.000 
lean proteins complex carbohydrates and
healthy<00:03:05.500> fats

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
healthy fats

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.340 
healthy fats
you<00:03:06.460> know<00:03:06.550> fats<00:03:06.910> are<00:03:07.270> nine<00:03:07.570> calories<00:03:07.870> per<00:03:08.290> gram

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
you know fats are nine calories per gram

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.320 
you know fats are nine calories per gram
so<00:03:08.800> by<00:03:08.920> increasing<00:03:09.520> your<00:03:09.550> healthy<00:03:09.910> fat<00:03:10.120> so

construction worker obviously that

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.050 
construction worker obviously that
construction<00:05:01.740> worker<00:05:02.040> is<00:05:02.610> going<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:02.880> burn<00:05:03.030> a
