00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hi guys between three of minecraft ita mod io 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.870
 I'm a piece today I'm here to show you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.630
 the hybrid weapons 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.700
 mod let's start right away but let's see 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.679
 What we add this new fashion as 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.470
 see this fashion adds us three new ones 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.900
 then this fashion is called its own 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.529
 hybrid because it is a whole more 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.170
 objects as you see here we have three types 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.599
 of horn the one with heron coal that 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.080
 with gold and iron and the one with hammond 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.180
 and gold after breaking these now there 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.399
 they will find the time and we will cook it we will have 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.540
 a probability of getting the buzz a 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:44.030
 ingotto or hybrid con will depend on 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.950
 now in the 1 point 4.7 basic version 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.379
 you still do it with cooking it does not come to you 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.390
 dropped then they are thought of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.399
 update it and make it too much for you 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.719
 directly the col 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.670
 we have a moment to see the power 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:04.500
 of the armor ok that anyway how 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 you see it is more or less around the defense 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.860
 of an armor of iron therefore nothing of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.360
 particular 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.350
 I believe it is more resistant to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.060
 explosions itself with respect to the 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.860
 usual deadly however it was not yet 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.930
 confirmed nothing 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.470
 here instead we have the mixed objects between 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.180
 the gold and the airon as you still see it 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.189
 break find yourself now lined up vi 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.100
 I show the power instead of 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.939
 these here this could definitely 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.950
 less compared to alle gold and iron 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.049
 to the nature of gold and iron the only one 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.579
 difference is that these hybrids will be 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.600
 easier to find 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.890
 then compared to classic materials 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.899
 you will be more likely to find them 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.909
 then to make you an armor instead 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.759
 we have the last film that is between 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.799
 gold and I love you know that the nature of 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.500
 we give from all the power as you see 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.740
 in fact this nothing takes away from us all 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.960
 two defense shields in fact as I have 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.820
 repeated earlier it will be easier to find 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.729
 these elements 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.439
 only they won't have the same power 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.470
 however I show you the differences 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.360
 between an iron one an air one 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.780
 a hybrid we put them in order 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.810
 perfect then that of iron well the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.730
 you know enough about speed 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.680
 quite fast not this fast 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.340
 almost two seconds notary we watch 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.280
 the hybrid one 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.020
 look how fast ok though yes 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.220
 it will ruin this faster too 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:36.840
 why look see you will ruin it 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.150
 hardly like a pickaxe of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.390
 but diamond will have the speed of a 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.250
 gold pick so it's enough 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.349
 this fashion is advantageous compared to 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.420
 utensils like pickaxes spa of things 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:53.250
 but it is kind of useless because 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.170
 if type we find such material 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.120
 we are disadvantaged 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.580
 if we want to do armor, we need it 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.230
 just simply doing the weapons 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.379
 here is a bug of the texture I have 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.940
 just found look I don't know why 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.030
 so you see that he has paid 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.650
 now it seems to me from here look then 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.480
 these are the shoe ideas panels 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.129
 you see that there is a bug with the texture that 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.959
 it makes me see how this pants makes me 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.540
 the bodice is what you do to me 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.599
 pants you see that there is a mistake of the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.819
 textures must have been wrong a 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.010
 insert them so it is still in alpha 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.170
 this fashion is changing and then 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.970
 adds this hybrid blades sword vi 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.000
 I show the kraft very strongly 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.650
 I call with a hybrid sword in iron 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.420
 some do it this way 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.280
 you see that it has a little all wet you see 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.250
 this sword expand with two sticks and one 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.200
 britney breed col and so we did at 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.760
 shovel and a bit all brawl but anyway 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.530
 will be fixed in the next one 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.150
 snap shot let's call it that 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.430
 however we see the attack power 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.420
 here we have a grip and we see you see 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.670
 which is not very strong 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.299
 kills a creeper with four bodies 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.680
 therefore very similar to an iron sword 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.540
 for this they will still have journal 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.250
 anyway it's a great fad I've seen that 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.870
 are also introducing two new types 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.540
 of blocks now I'll show you 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.400
 look at the infusion and the hybrid plan 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.909
 gottfried then the infusion excuses her 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.949
 fuser 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.260
 it's a really really particular inter 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.050
 but look at that test as a brute 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.270
 test as written there is a lot but a lot 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.400
 logically missed I will not show you 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.139
 all the updated fashions that come out 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.229
 however you see that it is very paid ie 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.449
 in the style of a basket and very wet 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.970
 they will then have to adjust the vote 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.380
 final for this fashion 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.500
 six out of ten just like you guys 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.460
 it saves for a little from insufficiency because 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.680
 introduces a variation in the game 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.419
 simply because it introduces us to 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.150
 new harmonies of new objects that 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.729
 even if from the standpoint of rmo we are 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.910
 disadvantaged from the point of view of 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.039
 anyway, guys, we'll see each other 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.430
 in an upcoming video on minecraft ita 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.229
 mod 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.520
 I remind you to join the channel 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.710
 to stay updated on the next ones 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.320
 fashions that will come out of putting I like it 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.030
 because I like to publish a new one 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.900
 fashion and see you in a neighbor 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.590
 video 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.590
 hello everyone guys
