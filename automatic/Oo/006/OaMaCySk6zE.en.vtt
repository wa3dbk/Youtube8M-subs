 it is important for us to find a single rise in damage rates 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.360
 that kind of client who sowed something percent of his side the variety of music 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.860
 to listen to very big people 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.800
 in the other soundtrack of the video game in an important performance to his 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.420
 volume and the worst that can happen to us would be more arguments cuba we have 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
 failed 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.209
 in his opinion the music decided that the meeting looked very good 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.309
 first we look at the one coming from the groups and we make sure that they will be 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.840
 representing back and everyone 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.980
 honestly forgetting with certainty that music is from the United States and 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.520
 england since most with English perhaps a title with a large 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 number of sales in Europe and in different languages ​​we have to 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.530
 ensure us epoch 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 the rest of the countries 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.840
 we want people to see it as an international music compilation 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.979
 you can hear what adding the rest of the world in agreement with states 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.979
 United or England but listen to what is 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.220
 other countries the study of music means nothing

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.290
 let's not stop with listening to a song that we like is to contact the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.060
 company that represented the 0 2% industry do something here we try 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.610
 listen to bands that are starting 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.580
 We seek to discover bands that have something special, and in most 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.700
 pass we found that those bands a football fan are also 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 delighted with your part of your product 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.730
 is not at stake which, as every year, listens to data or groups, certainly not 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.019
 is part 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.180
 not only have we approached them directly after marayes stimuli 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.579
 It is also part of the process 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.339
 that makes them feel involved in the project of 99 as 99 percent 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:27.109
 I had good or the fifa is a huge job this year we will have more 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.379
 of 50 groups with a legal work of excessive interest 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.370

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.549
 masters that of the music of tebeto that kind of matters of fact of the groups 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.399
 of psoe is due exclusively to that 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:43.549
 josé vasconcelos acea perhaps the one that contains more music there are other 30 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.529
 poles in the bathroom games so we work full time almost without
