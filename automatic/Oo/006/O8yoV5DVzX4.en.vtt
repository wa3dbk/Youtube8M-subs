00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.770
 but there's a class that loves the engine at 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.370
 old fashion, and one just needs to be 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:22.950
 some classics pop 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:25.820
 the year is 75 but breath is let maverick 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.820
 twelve thousand and one thousand 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.850
 the original bodywork with some 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.309
 modifications and the rest is everything new everything 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.180
 high performance part is all aimed at 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.220
 stability and performance is safety 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.930
 besides the performance of the power everything he 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.930
 we respond with very beautiful aesthetic 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.910
 mna the classic and modern makes one cid 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.629
 style reference to TURIN 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.010
 customization caprice underneath is so 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.730
 as much as we do over 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.750
 This is one more military coming out. 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.259
 car safety starts here at 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.240
 Adjustable suspension thread has 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.580
 differential locking bar 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.920
 stabilizer since a piece of 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.110
 common iron but for being a future and 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.590
 deserves a police nox piece made under 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.950
 measure 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.460
 a Madrid stand falls like a glove 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.920
 for this kind of customization fraturem 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.380
 it's made on top of our carlos 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.289
 the muscle cars icons of 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.020
 sports since the 60's 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:38.170
 the secret is to preserve the identity of the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.600
 model to consider a search in 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.210
 starting with suspension and brake is what 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.729
 will differentiate an old car 11 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.080
 looking at what would be a new local car 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.899
 such a suspension becomes better 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.909
 what a new car would be to prepare it 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.130
 for that the brakes but one thing not 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.569
 it is worth 500 horsepower and 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.780
 I could not stop the car properly. 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.490
 huh 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.640
 the story changed everything 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.679
 inside the same caprice such was 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.470
 where you stayed on the panel that had 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.709
 time it 's like who carries the gloves 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.680
 of the month the panel was removed in a 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.090
 Mexican shelvey it marks up to 220 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.390
 kilometers per hour with the national by 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.849
 200 pedals of aluminum pedals 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.950
 also made especially by car and 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.840
 an electronic injection module that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.440
 commands the entire motor part in the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.580
 from the logic of the car to 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.140
 People made lime rock cages to do. 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.140
 in each test a little smoke 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.640
 The fight with the envelope is great, huh? 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.920
 works as soon as it comes in through the wheels 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.420
 from the front so you can continue through 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.750
 here the papers pretty clouds 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.000
 smoke that I am no longer damaged 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.069
 rear brake 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 taillights of a pontiac 68 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.490
 cut and inlaid bumpers 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.220
 until the battery went to the trunk 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.060
 the player will be the only attraction track of the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.340
 hood 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.260
 this unique engine and 5 liters and 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.730
 5.7 liter extra.com 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.060
 it has a five-speed exchange and 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.120
 reflection 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.650
 perhaps just aluminum up to the piping that 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.940
 another aluminum boat will also have a 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.940
 cooler air to give more power 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.810
 this idea of a car protour 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.610
 Comfortable for walking on the street 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.650
 but with this model soul of 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.800
 performance in taking care of our 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.800
 better but time is allowed
