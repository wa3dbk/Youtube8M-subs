00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.390
 Now that the forces of darkness are emerging around the world 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.040
 The Elders of Ivgorod sent one of the best disciples of the monastic order 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.690

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.159
 but his um is extended to swords, canes and more. 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.790
 Munich's power in close combat is powered by his Spirit. (By Spirit) 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.540

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:22.219
 These mighty mantras can heal wounds and strengthen defenses while weakening close enemies. 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:29.109

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.609
 With lightning-fast reflexes, it can fend off brutal attacks 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.369
 and with the wind to flee their opponents. 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:39.699
 "You're defeated." 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:43.359
