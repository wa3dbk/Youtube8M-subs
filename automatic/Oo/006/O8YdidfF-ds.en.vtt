going to watch the building watching the
building<00:00:22.800> will<00:00:23.100> allow<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.609> follow<00:00:24.060> people

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
building will allow you to follow people

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.460 
building will allow you to follow people
and<00:00:24.539> they'll<00:00:24.689> allow<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> find<00:00:25.289> new

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
locations to new buildings and hopefully

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.710 
locations to new buildings and hopefully
it<00:00:29.519> will<00:00:29.580> lead<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.420> track

it will lead you on to the right track

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.870 
it will lead you on to the right track
so<00:00:31.590> I'm<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> trace<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> person's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
so I'm just going to trace the person's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
so I'm just going to trace the person's
car<00:00:33.120> rather<00:00:33.329> than<00:00:33.450> trying<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.989> follow<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.500> car

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
car rather than trying to follow the car

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.450 
car rather than trying to follow the car
because<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.280> usually<00:00:35.520> ends<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> tragedy

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
because it usually ends up in a tragedy

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.950 
because it usually ends up in a tragedy
horrible<00:00:38.460> horrible<00:00:38.610> tragedy<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.450> waste<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
horrible horrible tragedy and waste of

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.979 
horrible horrible tragedy and waste of
time<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> car<00:00:40.530> getting<00:00:40.770> away<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.989> anyway

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
time in the car getting away so anyway

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.090 
time in the car getting away so anyway
tracing<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> car<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> also<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> lot<00:00:44.430> less<00:00:44.730> risky

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
tracing the car is also a lot less risky

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.319 
tracing the car is also a lot less risky
really<00:00:47.100> fall<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.550> car<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.760> guess<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.180> your

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
really fall in the car I guess is your

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
really fall in the car I guess is your
view<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> person's

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
view if you see if you know the person's

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.049 
view if you see if you know the person's
there<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> want<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.730> arrest<00:00:50.910> them

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
there and you want to arrest them

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.520 
there and you want to arrest them
without<00:00:51.329> breaking<00:00:51.750> into<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> building<00:00:52.410> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
without breaking into the building that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.189 
without breaking into the building that
would<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> best<00:00:52.949> way<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> anyway<00:00:55.079> I'm

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
would be the best way but so anyway I'm

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.689 
would be the best way but so anyway I'm
just<00:00:55.379> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> place<00:00:55.739> another<00:00:55.920> wiretap<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
just going to place another wiretap to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.860 
just going to place another wiretap to
make<00:00:56.820> sure<00:00:56.940> i'm<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.420> building

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
make sure i'm at the right building

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.639 
make sure i'm at the right building
because<00:00:58.760> it's<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> only<00:00:59.969> way<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> find<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.719> so

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
because it's the only way to find out so

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.380 
because it's the only way to find out so
I<00:01:01.920> mean<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.160> could<00:01:02.309> go<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.489> multiple<00:01:03.030> buildings

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
I mean I could go to multiple buildings

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.649 
I mean I could go to multiple buildings
in<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.519> follow<00:01:05.760> people<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.360> day<00:01:06.600> but

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
in you know follow people all day but

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
in you know follow people all day but
the<00:01:07.409> best<00:01:07.560> way<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> only

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the best way to do it is but the only

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.219 
the best way to do it is but the only
way<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> find<00:01:09.450> out<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> wiretap

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
way to find out is to do a wiretap

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.320 
way to find out is to do a wiretap
otherwise<00:01:10.860> you'll<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.250> end<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.729> wasting<00:01:11.939> all

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
otherwise you'll just end up wasting all

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
otherwise you'll just end up wasting all
your<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:12.600> trying<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.700> breaking<00:01:14.700> into

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
your time trying to breaking into

to<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.420> able<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.659> prevent<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.680> know

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
to be able to prevent it so you know

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.260 
to be able to prevent it so you know
it's<00:01:46.950> really<00:01:47.220> kind<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.490> luck<00:01:47.670> based<00:01:47.909> at<00:01:48.149> this

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it's really kind of luck based at this

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.929 
it's really kind of luck based at this
point<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:49.100> couldn't<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> information<00:01:50.579> as

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
point I couldn't get the information as

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
point I couldn't get the information as
to<00:01:50.970> who<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> arc<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> steal<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to who the arc is going to steal the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.649 
to who the arc is going to steal the
blueprints<00:01:52.979> before<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.939> until<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
blueprints before so until I get that

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.899 
blueprints before so until I get that
information<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.439> kind<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.159> stuck<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:58.909> let's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
information I kind of stuck so let's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.450 
information I kind of stuck so let's
break<00:02:00.180> into<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.659> building<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.710> there's

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
break into that building on there's

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.859 
break into that building on there's
going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.729> some<00:02:04.579> there's<00:02:05.579> going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> be

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
going to be some there's going to be

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.960 
going to be some there's going to be
some<00:02:06.869> edits<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.129> because<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.429> mean<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
some edits here just because I mean this

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.449 
some edits here just because I mean this
game<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.479> pretty<00:02:09.750> much<00:02:10.099> you<00:02:11.099> know<00:02:11.190> once<00:02:11.340> I

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
game is pretty much you know once I

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.890 
game is pretty much you know once I
shown<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.700> guys<00:02:11.970> everything<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.750> need

to see
it's<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.160> really<00:02:14.340> too<00:02:14.610> much<00:02:14.640> more<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.870> do<00:02:16.080> and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
it's not really too much more to do and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.199 
it's not really too much more to do and
to<00:02:16.740> show<00:02:16.920> off<00:02:17.069> in<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.370> game<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.610> mean<00:02:17.760> breaking

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
to show off in this game I mean breaking

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.610 
to show off in this game I mean breaking
it's<00:02:18.480> always<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> same<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:22.470> know<00:02:22.530> I'm

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it's always the same so you know I'm

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.540 
it's always the same so you know I'm
just<00:02:22.680> going<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> try<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.190> show<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550

just going to try and show the
highlights<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.560> if<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.770> see<00:02:28.920> some

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
highlights of it so if you see some

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.650 
highlights of it so if you see some
awkward<00:02:29.400> edits<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.880> really<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.330> sort<00:02:30.569> of

if you get someone very low on the totem

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.590 
if you get someone very low on the totem
pole<00:02:57.840> you're<00:02:58.319> not<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.830> able<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.130> find

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
out a lot of information so you're going

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.199 
out a lot of information so you're going
to<00:03:02.010> spend<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.430> lot<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.610> time<00:03:02.730> doing

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
to spend a lot of time doing

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.870 
to spend a lot of time doing
investigations<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.319> that's<00:03:05.280> really<00:03:05.610> where

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
investigations and that's really where

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.520 
investigations and that's really where
these<00:03:06.090> missions<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.720> begin<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:06.989> fall<00:03:07.230> apart

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
these missions can begin to fall apart

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
these missions can begin to fall apart
because<00:03:07.620> you're<00:03:07.980> doing<00:03:08.459> your<00:03:08.580> time<00:03:10.550> you're

there in that floor safe I found some

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.539 
there in that floor safe I found some
information<00:03:46.590> I'll<00:03:46.920> turn<00:03:47.070> someone<00:03:47.340> into<00:03:47.370> a

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
mission is that it's easier to plot your
