00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.570
 from the hand of gastÃ³n acurio de 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.580
 We went through chifas restaurants 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.800
 mixing Chinese and Peruvian flavors 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.770
 Pollerias that are in the authentic taste 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.200
 from the center of Lima indicates that it crosses 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.270
 Exquisite escaped Peruvian sites 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.520
 embedded in the DNA of the seasoning 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.380
 Peruvian and sites to which 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.380
 you definitely have to go 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.040
 gives us the feeling that the kitchen 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.170
 Peruvian very little replicable because 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.970
 precise ingredients of very high quality 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.329
 fresh and very specific but at the same 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.739
 weather 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.449
 the story should not show otherwise 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.949
 that in the background has been replicated very 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.379
 successfully as explained above 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.589
 clearly the great advantage with which 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.379
 played the Peruvian cuisine was that the 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.359
 world connects in the 90 the consumer 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.120
 world change would happen to be a 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.510
 conservative no conservative gentleman who 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.420
 tends to reject the unknown for a 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.430
 Adventurous consumer who wakes up 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.020
 for trying something new every day and 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.910
 it is in that scenario that the kitchen 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.310
 Peruvian with a group of possibilities 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.210
 Peruvians who finally managed to join 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.130
 reveals and uses your identity to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.980
 turn it into an international brand 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.320
 called Peruvian cuisine that designed a 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.940
 strategy to get to the point where 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.160
 we are today that you mentioned 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.440
 although it has finally been 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.830
 become an international brand 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.770
 global universal 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.910
 what good looks rightly you're doing well 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.910
 just to see it 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.630
 Y 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.920
 popular here the brook 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.460
 to the port with people 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.380
 as they come out 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.830
 and the Chilean public what is the dish 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.830
 that more customers 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.740
 with the Peruvian creams are clear 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.230
 yes 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.750
 big 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.440
 Y 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.610
 now it is at its point 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.880
 I want to meet this chef who 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.819
 has a hand that I think has a 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.769
 brave hand 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.380
 since when you had the dream of having your 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.480
 own restaurant 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.480
 the truth that they are making formula 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.170
 v 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.170
 boy 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.400
 i 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.250
 the chicha morada is the drink 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.970
 from Lima 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.970
 Health 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.630
 I would support because it grows because it is 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.520
 a chicken eat 6 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.900
 It is also a beautiful experience in 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.079
 family that share a single table 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.019
 the table and the jar of chicha and 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:57.110
 bulls and with a chicken can eat the 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:00.280
 three children dad mom and it goes out 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.280
 pretty economic then 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.830
 it's not about denaturing that not 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.580
 just empower them to refresh 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.580
 a little the environment 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.109
 to egg look 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.960
 the chefs we always like the most 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.960
 leg that the breast 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.530
 good 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.620
 I'm happy 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.230
 neither here anymore 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.449
 for example 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.999
 the kitchen prepares is characterized by 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.370
 with the multiculturalism of many 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.550
 flavors the same dish 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:38.580
 is this but in the end harmonizing 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.580
 all as a delicious function 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.740
 and that we maintain 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.199
 a Latin American unit in relational 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.569
 the common principles and values that 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.780
 we share celebrating our 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.520
 diversity 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.620
 no need either to copy us or 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.210
 invite us but on the contrary our 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.290
 great opportunity is in the possibility 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.090
 to be able to enjoy many 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:09.310
 experiences in a common language throughout 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.210
 throughout Latin America and who have 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.180
 had the opportunity to advance 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.639
 just support 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.860
 the premise that we have to 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.320
 build the gastronomic destination 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.600
 america latin in the world the dream is 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.550
 that one day in the euphoria on the mountain 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.780
 there 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.780
 It would be an Argentine grill 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:37.020
 and I already noticed that it was not enough 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.280
 enough time to import customs and 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.570
 cultures 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:45.620
 North now it's time for the North to drink 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.620
 a little bit of our culture
