sup guys rock-solid here I was just

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.579 
sup guys rock-solid here I was just
doing<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:04.950> little<00:00:05.100> test<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:05.790> my<00:00:06.589> four-way

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
doing a little test with my four-way

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.589 
doing a little test with my four-way
system<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.880> I'm<00:00:09.090> trying<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.389> get

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
system here that I'm trying to get

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.240 
system here that I'm trying to get
running<00:00:10.639> I've<00:00:11.639> got<00:00:11.790> some<00:00:12.000> super<00:00:12.330> tweeters

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
running I've got some super tweeters

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.099 
running I've got some super tweeters
high<00:00:14.250> mid<00:00:14.549> I'm<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.210> using<00:00:15.389> these<00:00:15.599> as<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.870> low

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
high mid I'm just using these as a low

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.550 
high mid I'm just using these as a low
mid<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.850> then<00:00:17.850> I've<00:00:18.029> got<00:00:18.240> some<00:00:18.270> subs<00:00:18.900> two

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
mid and then I've got some subs two

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.700 
mid and then I've got some subs two
different<00:00:19.890> kinds<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.279> subs<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:21.619> server<00:00:22.619> in

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
different kinds of subs a server in

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.529 
different kinds of subs a server in
Vegas<00:00:23.010> coupe<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.580> some<00:00:23.970> front-loaded

Vegas coupe and some front-loaded

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.679 
Vegas coupe and some front-loaded
Yamahas<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.400> those<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.760> phase<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.269> need<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
Yamahas to get those in phase I need to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.400 
Yamahas to get those in phase I need to
delay<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.529> Yamaha<00:00:29.039> about<00:00:29.789> 4<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.210> 1/2

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
delay the Yamaha about 4 and 1/2

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.590 
delay the Yamaha about 4 and 1/2
milliseconds<00:00:31.969> so<00:00:32.969> I've<00:00:33.210> been<00:00:33.300> struggling

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
milliseconds so I've been struggling

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.040 
milliseconds so I've been struggling
with<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.020> x32<00:00:35.450> trying<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.540> figure<00:00:36.780> out<00:00:36.809> how<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
with the x32 trying to figure out how to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
with the x32 trying to figure out how to
make<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.530> work<00:00:37.739> with<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> matrix<00:00:38.610> because

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
make that work with the matrix because

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.970 
make that work with the matrix because
there's<00:00:39.629> only<00:00:39.750> six<00:00:40.110> outs<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.790> need<00:00:41.969> eight

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
there's only six outs and I need eight

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.910 
there's only six outs and I need eight
two<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.450> super<00:00:45.450> trader<00:00:45.660> left<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> right

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
two for the super trader left and right

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.819 
two for the super trader left and right
two<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.670> high<00:00:48.120> mid<00:00:48.390> left<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.379> right<00:00:49.530> two

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
for the subs and x32 only has six

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
for the subs and x32 only has six
matrixes<00:00:57.079> matrices<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> let<00:01:00.480> me<00:01:00.570> show<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.809> how

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
matrixes matrices so let me show you how

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.700 
matrixes matrices so let me show you how
I<00:01:01.109> solve<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:03.559> it's<00:01:04.559> gonna<00:01:04.710> load<00:01:05.040> my<00:01:05.430> little

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
I solve this it's gonna load my little

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
I solve this it's gonna load my little
four<00:01:07.710> way<00:01:07.920> test<00:01:08.930> tube<00:01:11.240> now<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> originally<00:01:12.869> had

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
four way test tube now I originally had

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.149 
four way test tube now I originally had
the<00:01:13.170> idea<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.040> buses<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:15.860> made<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the idea to do it on buses I made the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.140 
the idea to do it on buses I made the
first<00:01:17.369> eight<00:01:18.200> buses<00:01:19.200> post<00:01:19.860> or<00:01:20.400> yeah<00:01:20.820> post

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
first eight buses post or yeah post

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.999 
first eight buses post or yeah post
meter<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.670> did<00:01:24.119> all<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.560> equalizing<00:01:25.560> I

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
meter and then I did all my equalizing I

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.030 
meter and then I did all my equalizing I
just<00:01:26.580> did<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> system<00:01:27.630> processing<00:01:28.229> on

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
just did all the system processing on

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.859 
just did all the system processing on
each<00:01:29.250> bus<00:01:29.549> individually

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.929 

turn<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> worked<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.009> sucked<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.549> I

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
turn it worked but it sucked because I

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.840 
turn it worked but it sucked because I
had<00:01:36.119> no<00:01:36.680> left<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.430> had<00:01:38.790> no<00:01:39.030> sub<00:01:39.810> mono<00:01:40.850> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
had no left right I had no sub mono it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.609 
had no left right I had no sub mono it
was<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.450> pretty<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.200> coming<00:01:43.409> out<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
was all just pretty much coming out of

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.889 
was all just pretty much coming out of
here<00:01:43.740> which<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.189> gonna<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:45.420> worked<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
here which I was gonna that worked for a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.440 
here which I was gonna that worked for a
DJ<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.850> able<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.149> bands

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
DJ but I want to be able to do bands

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.410 
DJ but I want to be able to do bands
through<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:50.759> let<00:01:50.909> me<00:01:50.970> show<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> way

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
through this so let me show you the way

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.230 
through this so let me show you the way
I<00:01:51.450> figured<00:01:51.810> out<00:01:51.899> how<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.140> do<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:53.780> my<00:01:54.780> idea<00:01:54.960> was

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
I figured out how to do this my idea was

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.399 
I figured out how to do this my idea was
to<00:01:57.240> use<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> direct<00:01:58.380> outs<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:01.219> here<00:02:02.219> I've<00:02:02.460> got

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
to use the direct outs so here I've got

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.030 
to use the direct outs so here I've got
left-right<00:02:04.409> going<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.100> matrix<00:02:05.640> 1<00:02:05.909> &amp;<00:02:06.060> 2

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
left-right going to matrix 1 &amp; 2

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.420 
left-right going to matrix 1 &amp; 2
and<00:02:07.730> then<00:02:08.360> mono<00:02:08.869> going<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.680> matrix<00:02:10.070> three<00:02:10.310> and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
and then mono going to matrix three and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.350 
and then mono going to matrix three and
four<00:02:12.160> matrix<00:02:13.160> three<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.520> four<00:02:13.700> just<00:02:13.970> go<00:02:14.120> out

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
four matrix three and four just go out

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.770 
four matrix three and four just go out
to<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> sub<00:02:15.140> amps<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.150> mean<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.630> this

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
to the sub amps so I mean in this

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.740 
to the sub amps so I mean in this
situation<00:02:17.840> I'm<00:02:18.530> just<00:02:18.740> using<00:02:18.950> one<00:02:19.130> amp<00:02:19.790> channel

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
situation I'm just using one amp channel

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.110 
situation I'm just using one amp channel
one<00:02:20.990> is<00:02:21.260> one<00:02:22.100> channel<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.670> sub<00:02:22.880> 2<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.970> way

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
one is one channel to the sub 2 that way

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.740 
one is one channel to the sub 2 that way
I'm<00:02:26.300> able<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.750> delay<00:02:28.000> on<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.150> routing<00:02:31.480> now<00:02:32.480> but

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
I'm able to delay on the routing now but

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.020 
I'm able to delay on the routing now but
you<00:02:33.050> know<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.290> come<00:02:33.470> over<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:33.830> -<00:02:34.010> I'll<00:02:34.490> put<00:02:34.670> 7

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
you know you come over here - I'll put 7

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.570 
you know you come over here - I'll put 7
and<00:02:35.210> there's<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.390> delay<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.920> if<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.190> need<00:02:37.370> any

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
and there's a delay and if you need any

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.990 
and there's a delay and if you need any
more<00:02:37.700> delay<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.510> get<00:02:39.020> things<00:02:39.410> phased<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.850> can

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
more delay to get things phased you can

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.450 
more delay to get things phased you can
do<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.270> on<00:02:41.630> any<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.380> them<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:43.280> anyway<00:02:45.460> let's

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
do it on any of them but anyway let's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.400 
do it on any of them but anyway let's
see<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.950> what<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.790> decided<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.630> would<00:02:50.690> do<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.170> take

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
see so what I decided I would do is take

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.550 
see so what I decided I would do is take
the<00:02:51.680> output<00:02:52.160> from<00:02:52.630> matrix<00:02:53.630> 1<00:02:53.840> 2<00:02:54.080> which<00:02:54.410> is

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the output from matrix 1 2 which is

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.460 
the output from matrix 1 2 which is
coming<00:02:54.770> out<00:02:56.230> 1<00:02:57.230> 2<00:02:57.260> on<00:02:57.710> my<00:02:57.860> second<00:02:58.250> s<00:02:58.400> 16<00:02:59.350> let<00:03:00.350> me

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
coming out 1 2 on my second s 16 let me

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.220 
coming out 1 2 on my second s 16 let me
start<00:03:00.770> that<00:03:00.920> over<00:03:01.660> on<00:03:02.660> my<00:03:02.990> first<00:03:03.620> s<00:03:03.890> 16<00:03:04.600> 1<00:03:05.600> 2<00:03:05.810> 3<00:03:05.990> 4

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
start that over on my first s 16 1 2 3 4

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.050 
start that over on my first s 16 1 2 3 4
and<00:03:06.350> 1<00:03:06.500> through<00:03:06.890> 8<00:03:07.130> are<00:03:07.160> all<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.580> outputs<00:03:07.910> for

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
and 1 through 8 are all the outputs for

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.460 
and 1 through 8 are all the outputs for
the<00:03:08.120> amps<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:09.610> high<00:03:10.610> left<00:03:11.030> right<00:03:11.300> high<00:03:12.200> mid

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
the amps so high left right high mid

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.810 
the amps so high left right high mid
left<00:03:12.770> right<00:03:12.980> low<00:03:13.730> me<00:03:13.940> left<00:03:14.209> right<00:03:14.450> sub-1<00:03:15.320> sub-2

left right low me left right sub-1 sub-2
what<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:16.850> did<00:03:17.180> here's<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.870> trick<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.380> took<00:03:19.160> out

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
what I did here's the trick I took out

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.400 
what I did here's the trick I took out
one<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:20.120> two<00:03:20.270> from<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.570> next<00:03:20.840> one<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.200> just

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
one and two from the next one and just

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.180 
one and two from the next one and just
plug<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.800> in<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> input<00:03:23.860> over<00:03:24.860> here<00:03:25.010> so

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
plug it in to the input over here so

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.240 
plug it in to the input over here so
channel<00:03:25.430> 31<00:03:25.790> 32<00:03:26.209> are<00:03:27.200> basically<00:03:27.739> left<00:03:28.040> and

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
channel 31 32 are basically left and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.520 
channel 31 32 are basically left and
right<00:03:28.430> matrix<00:03:29.230> then<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.709> go<00:03:30.890> down<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:32.530> channel

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
right matrix then I go down to channel

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.630 
right matrix then I go down to channel
you<00:03:33.860> know<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:33.980> mean<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.280> can<00:03:34.430> put<00:03:34.550> these

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
you know I mean you can put these

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.890 
you know I mean you can put these
wherever<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.090> want<00:03:35.239> but<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:35.420> put<00:03:35.600> them<00:03:35.690> at<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
wherever you want but I put them at the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.370 
wherever you want but I put them at the
end<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.350> just<00:03:37.280> sent<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.480> input<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.110> each<00:03:39.230> of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
end I just sent the input of each of

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.920 
end I just sent the input of each of
these<00:03:39.470> channels<00:03:39.890> -<00:03:40.370> 31<00:03:40.670> 32<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.420> all<00:03:41.600> 6<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:41.989> them

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
these channels - 31 32 on all 6 of them

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.300 
these channels - 31 32 on all 6 of them
then<00:03:44.930> I've<00:03:45.380> got<00:03:45.709> my<00:03:45.739> equalizer<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:46.880> high<00:03:48.310> high

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
then I've got my equalizer so high high

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.810 
then I've got my equalizer so high high
mid<00:03:49.690> low<00:03:50.690> mid<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.459> then<00:03:52.459> if<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:52.640> go<00:03:52.790> to

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
mid low mid and then if you go to

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.770 
mid low mid and then if you go to
sub-matrix<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:55.190> can<00:03:55.280> see<00:03:55.459> how<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.780> equalized

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
sub-matrix you can see how I equalized

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.290 
sub-matrix you can see how I equalized
the<00:03:56.930> subs<00:03:57.260> just<00:03:57.880> rolling<00:03:58.880> off<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.030> highs

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
the subs just rolling off the highs

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.880 
the subs just rolling off the highs
around

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.179 

140<00:04:03.069> I'm<00:04:03.189> just<00:04:03.370> trying<00:04:03.670> 140<00:04:04.470> in<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.680> sub<00:04:05.920> sub

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
140 I'm just trying 140 in the sub sub

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.670 
140 I'm just trying 140 in the sub sub
I'm<00:04:06.370> doing<00:04:06.640> 100<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.689> might<00:04:07.870> even<00:04:08.019> go<00:04:08.260> as<00:04:08.439> low<00:04:08.650> as

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
I'm doing 100 I might even go as low as

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.460 
I'm doing 100 I might even go as low as
like<00:04:08.950> 84<00:04:09.489> this<00:04:09.659> maybe<00:04:10.659> even<00:04:10.900> bring<00:04:11.049> this<00:04:11.230> down

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
like 84 this maybe even bring this down

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.630 
like 84 this maybe even bring this down
to<00:04:11.500> 120<00:04:12.310> if<00:04:12.400> it's<00:04:12.579> too<00:04:13.409> too<00:04:14.409> punchy<00:04:14.799> but<00:04:15.099> I<00:04:15.340> mean

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
to 120 if it's too too punchy but I mean

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.250 
to 120 if it's too too punchy but I mean
I<00:04:15.849> do<00:04:15.909> bass<00:04:16.209> music<00:04:16.419> so<00:04:18.479> 100<00:04:19.479> Hertz<00:04:19.750> can<00:04:20.049> be<00:04:20.229> a

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
I do bass music so 100 Hertz can be a

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.620 
I do bass music so 100 Hertz can be a
little<00:04:20.620> bit<00:04:20.829> annoying<00:04:21.130> sometimes<00:04:21.579> but<00:04:22.180> if

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
little bit annoying sometimes but if

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.469 
little bit annoying sometimes but if
you're<00:04:23.320> doing<00:04:23.949> a<00:04:24.070> band<00:04:24.310> with<00:04:24.669> a<00:04:24.729> kick<00:04:25.000> drum<00:04:25.030> and

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
you're doing a band with a kick drum and

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.120 
you're doing a band with a kick drum and
the<00:04:25.570> bass<00:04:25.720> guitar<00:04:26.139> 100<00:04:26.530> Hertz<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.889> probably

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
the bass guitar 100 Hertz is probably

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.800 
the bass guitar 100 Hertz is probably
your<00:04:27.220> favorite<00:04:27.400> frequency<00:04:28.320> so<00:04:29.320> anyway<00:04:30.810> boom

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
your favorite frequency so anyway boom

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.279 
your favorite frequency so anyway boom
then<00:04:32.410> in<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.789> routing<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:35.220> go<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.449> output<00:04:37.449> 1<00:04:37.810> I

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
then in the routing I go to output 1 I

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.210 
then in the routing I go to output 1 I
sent<00:04:39.220> it<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.430> direct<00:04:39.880> out<00:04:40.120> channel<00:04:40.660> 27<00:04:41.220> I'll

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
sent it to direct out channel 27 I'll

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.800 
sent it to direct out channel 27 I'll
put<00:04:42.430> two<00:04:42.610> is<00:04:42.789> 28<00:04:43.210> and<00:04:43.449> so<00:04:43.840> on<00:04:47.370> 6<00:04:48.370> &amp;<00:04:48.820> 7<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.389> matrix

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
put two is 28 and so on 6 &amp; 7 is matrix

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.100 
put two is 28 and so on 6 &amp; 7 is matrix
it<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.169> a<00:04:50.320> matrix<00:04:50.850> 9<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:52.419> need<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.720> set<00:04:52.930> to

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
it is a matrix 9 you need to set to

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:02.189 
it is a matrix 9 you need to set to
matrix<00:04:59.010> 9<00:05:00.010> is<00:05:00.280> matrix<00:05:00.550> 1<00:05:00.910> Jam<00:05:01.539> is<00:05:01.660> matrix<00:05:01.870> 2

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
matrix 9 is matrix 1 Jam is matrix 2

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.760 
matrix 9 is matrix 1 Jam is matrix 2
because<00:05:02.470> that's<00:05:02.650> again<00:05:03.250> that's<00:05:03.490> sending<00:05:03.850> into

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
because that's again that's sending into

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.010 
because that's again that's sending into
this<00:05:05.770> which<00:05:06.190> we<00:05:06.400> then<00:05:06.910> send<00:05:07.360> direct<00:05:07.660> outs<00:05:08.130> okay

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
this which we then send direct outs okay

these<00:06:53.259> outputs<00:06:54.069> are<00:06:54.400> pre-painted<00:06:55.300> so<00:06:55.479> I<00:06:55.509> don't

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
these outputs are pre-painted so I don't

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.529 
these outputs are pre-painted so I don't
think<00:06:55.960> the<00:06:57.000> and<00:06:58.110> I<00:06:59.110> turned<00:06:59.590> it<00:06:59.770> off<00:07:00.419> on<00:07:01.419> the

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:02.949 
main left-right because if you turn this

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:09.809 
main left-right because if you turn this
up<00:07:04.169> feedback<00:07:05.520> really<00:07:06.520> nasty<00:07:07.800> I<00:07:08.800> think<00:07:09.639> that's
