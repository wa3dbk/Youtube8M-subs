in<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.380> reasoning<00:01:50.740> block<00:01:50.980> and<00:01:51.280> you'll<00:01:52.120> see<00:01:52.270> a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
in the reasoning block and you'll see a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.910 
in the reasoning block and you'll see a
lot<00:01:52.660> of<00:01:52.690> people<00:01:52.840> with<00:01:53.050> headlamps<00:01:53.530> on<00:01:53.680> and

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
lot of people with headlamps on and

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.980 
lot of people with headlamps on and
buckets<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.490> month<00:01:55.090> ago<00:01:55.210> you'd<00:01:55.510> have<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.870> use

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
buckets a month ago you'd have to use

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.410 
buckets a month ago you'd have to use
snips<00:01:56.380> or<00:01:56.590> Clippers<00:01:56.980> to<00:01:57.310> pluck<00:01:57.790> them<00:01:57.970> off<00:01:58.090> but

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
snips or Clippers to pluck them off but

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.780 
snips or Clippers to pluck them off but
now<00:01:59.320> they've<00:01:59.500> just<00:01:59.680> come<00:01:59.830> off<00:02:00.010> by<00:02:00.159> hand<00:02:00.340> and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
now they've just come off by hand and

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.370 
now they've just come off by hand and
that's<00:02:01.030> why<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.210> wind<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.930> weather

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
that's why the wind and the weather

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.320 
that's why the wind and the weather
eventually<00:02:02.710> take<00:02:03.550> their<00:02:03.730> toll<00:02:03.940> on<00:02:04.000> these

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
eventually take their toll on these

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.540 
eventually take their toll on these
because<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.780> stems<00:02:05.230> just<00:02:05.500> rot<00:02:05.770> at<00:02:06.100> some<00:02:06.310> point

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
because the stems just rot at some point

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.729 
because the stems just rot at some point
and<00:02:06.760> drop<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.780> grapes<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.229> ground<00:02:08.500> which

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
and drop the grapes to the ground which

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.160 
and drop the grapes to the ground which
is<00:02:09.269> all<00:02:10.269> designed<00:02:10.660> by<00:02:10.840> nature<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.200> do<00:02:11.800> that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.540 

we'll<00:02:15.770> probably<00:02:16.100> pull<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:18.740> got<00:02:18.830> 17<00:02:19.280> acres

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
we'll probably pull but we got 17 acres

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.430 
we'll probably pull but we got 17 acres
are<00:02:19.700> picking<00:02:20.030> here<00:02:20.209> tonight<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.870> we<00:02:21.260> should

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
are picking here tonight and we should

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.710 
are picking here tonight and we should
be<00:02:21.620> able<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.890> I'm<00:02:22.310> hoping<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.420> we're<00:02:23.540> get

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
be able to I'm hoping that we're get

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.420 
be able to I'm hoping that we're get
through<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.110> all<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.770> also<00:02:24.920> depends<00:02:25.340> on

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
through it all but it also depends on

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.830 
through it all but it also depends on
the<00:02:25.490> temperature<00:02:25.670> if<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.240> temperature

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
the temperature if that temperature

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.690 
the temperature if that temperature
starts<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.470> rise<00:02:27.560> when<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.040> lose<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.459> freeze

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
starts to rise when you lose the freeze

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.380 
starts to rise when you lose the freeze
then<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.360> stop<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:30.700> anyway<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:31.760> we'll

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
then we have to stop so anyway so we'll

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.110 
then we have to stop so anyway so we'll
see<00:02:32.540> what<00:02:32.660> happens<00:02:33.050> well<00:02:33.890> Canada<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.310> one<00:02:34.790> of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
see what happens well Canada is one of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.760 
see what happens well Canada is one of
the<00:02:35.209> largest<00:02:35.690> producers<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:36.200> ice<00:02:36.410> pond<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:36.709> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
the largest producers of ice pond in the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.800 
the largest producers of ice pond in the
world<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.850> ice<00:02:37.970> puns<00:02:38.209> are<00:02:38.360> stellar<00:02:38.600> I

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
world and the ice puns are stellar I

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.660 
world and the ice puns are stellar I
mean<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.170> climate<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.620> really<00:02:39.920> ideal<00:02:40.160> for<00:02:40.340> it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
mean the climate is really ideal for it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.190 
mean the climate is really ideal for it
as<00:02:40.730> well<00:02:40.970> what<00:02:41.180> are<00:02:41.239> we<00:02:41.330> call<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.690> nectar<00:02:42.170> of

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
as well what are we call the nectar of

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.770 
as well what are we call the nectar of
the<00:02:42.320> gods<00:02:42.590> from<00:02:42.920> God's<00:02:43.100> country<00:02:43.610> nice<00:02:44.540> wine

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
the gods from God's country nice wine

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.890 
the gods from God's country nice wine
imagine<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.370> nectar<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.120> grape<00:02:47.630> no

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
imagine just the nectar of the grape no

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.229 
imagine just the nectar of the grape no
water<00:02:48.170> yeah<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:49.190> magnificent<00:02:49.730> are<00:02:49.850> like<00:02:49.940> no

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
water yeah that magnificent are like no

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.030 
water yeah that magnificent are like no
other<00:02:50.450> product<00:02:50.690> has<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.140> that's<00:02:51.739> why<00:02:51.920> it's

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
other product has that that's why it's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.800 
other product has that that's why it's
so<00:02:52.160> special<00:02:52.220> also<00:02:52.880> why<00:02:53.090> it's<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.600> know<00:02:53.690> it's

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
so special also why it's you know it's

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.750 
so special also why it's you know it's
expensive<00:02:53.989> just<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.950> make<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.130> bottle<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.610> half

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
expensive just to make a bottle a half

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.960 
expensive just to make a bottle a half
bottle<00:02:56.860> it's<00:02:57.860> very<00:02:58.100> expensive<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.640> do<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.880> get

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
bottle it's very expensive to do you get

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.759 
bottle it's very expensive to do you get
about<00:02:59.090> 15%<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.870> what<00:03:00.019> you'd<00:03:00.140> normally<00:03:00.260> get<00:03:00.620> in

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
about 15% of what you'd normally get in

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.090 
about 15% of what you'd normally get in
the<00:03:01.340> normal<00:03:02.350> if<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.410> look<00:03:03.560> at<00:03:03.650> these<00:03:03.860> grapes

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
the normal if you look at these grapes

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.970 
the normal if you look at these grapes
now<00:03:04.630> these<00:03:05.630> are<00:03:05.780> like<00:03:05.900> frozen<00:03:06.200> little<00:03:06.620> marbles

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
now these are like frozen little marbles

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.130 
now these are like frozen little marbles
I'm<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.190> I'm<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.459> squish<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.480> there's<00:03:08.690> nothing

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
I'm a I'm a squish and there's nothing

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.750 
I'm a I'm a squish and there's nothing
happening<00:03:09.350> when<00:03:09.709> we<00:03:09.830> actually<00:03:10.160> break<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.610> open

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
happening when we actually break it open

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.840 
happening when we actually break it open
you<00:03:11.720> see<00:03:11.930> it's<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:12.650> ice<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.459> water<00:03:13.670> is

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
you see it's just ice the water is

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.410 
you see it's just ice the water is
literally<00:03:14.690> ice<00:03:15.290> crystals<00:03:15.830> in<00:03:16.010> there<00:03:16.489> and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
literally ice crystals in there and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.850 
literally ice crystals in there and
that's<00:03:17.600> what<00:03:17.780> we're<00:03:17.900> gonna<00:03:17.989> squeeze<00:03:18.350> out<00:03:18.560> see

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
that's what we're gonna squeeze out see

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.259 
that's what we're gonna squeeze out see
that<00:03:18.890> little<00:03:19.190> bit<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.340> juice<00:03:19.579> there<00:03:19.850> that's

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
that little bit of juice there that's

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.840 
that little bit of juice there that's
the<00:03:20.480> syrup<00:03:20.780> that's<00:03:21.140> ice<00:03:21.320> wine<00:03:21.530> right<00:03:21.739> there<00:03:21.950> so

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
the syrup that's ice wine right there so

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.759 
the syrup that's ice wine right there so
officially<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:24.049> official<00:03:24.380> airport

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
officially the official airport

officially the official airport
temperature<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.250> minus<00:03:25.549> 13<00:03:25.940> but<00:03:26.890> what<00:03:27.890> we're

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
temperature is minus 13 but what we're

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.410

seeing<00:03:28.190> right<00:03:28.280> now<00:03:28.370> what<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.970> cloud<00:03:29.120> coming

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
seeing right now what the cloud coming

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.620 
seeing right now what the cloud coming
is<00:03:29.600> it's<00:03:29.840> actually<00:03:29.959> starting<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.380> warm<00:03:30.500> up<00:03:31.630> yep

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
is it's actually starting to warm up yep

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.180 
is it's actually starting to warm up yep
everybody<00:03:34.120> yeah<00:03:35.120> yeah<00:03:35.989> so<00:03:36.440> we're<00:03:36.860> gonna<00:03:36.920> be

so eric koleda

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.220 
so eric koleda
if<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:46.040> was<00:03:46.130> one<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.760> was<00:03:46.880> getting<00:03:47.090> warm<00:03:47.360> it's<00:03:48.079> a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
if it was one it was getting warm it's a

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.090 
if it was one it was getting warm it's a
bit<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.709> bummer<00:03:48.980> as<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.940> truth<00:03:50.209> but<00:03:51.100> the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
bit of a bummer as the truth but the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.550 
bit of a bummer as the truth but the
fact<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:52.640> when<00:03:53.570> you're<00:03:53.750> into<00:03:54.079> ice<00:03:54.260> wine

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
fact is that when you're into ice wine

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.930 
fact is that when you're into ice wine
and<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:56.660> go<00:03:56.840> all<00:03:57.110> in

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
and you go all in

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.820 
and you go all in
that's<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:59.060> chance<00:03:59.269> you<00:03:59.329> take

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
that's a chance you take

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.920 
that's a chance you take
and<00:04:02.110> you<00:04:03.110> know<00:04:03.200> it's<00:04:03.890> not<00:04:03.980> over<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:05.450> might<00:04:05.750> is

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
and you know it's not over that might is

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.930 
and you know it's not over that might is
over<00:04:06.260> we<00:04:06.680> still<00:04:06.830> have<00:04:06.950> grapes<00:04:07.220> hanging<00:04:07.490> there

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
over we still have grapes hanging there

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.380 
over we still have grapes hanging there
looking<00:04:08.210> good<00:04:09.880> just<00:04:10.880> waiting<00:04:11.090> for<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.270> next

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
looking good just waiting for the next

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.690 
looking good just waiting for the next
round<00:04:11.630> we're<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:12.830> in<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.070> field<00:04:13.250> and<00:04:13.610> we've

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
round we're just in the field and we've

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.460 
round we're just in the field and we've
been<00:04:13.790> picking<00:04:14.000> grapes<00:04:14.270> all<00:04:14.570> evening<00:04:14.780> so<00:04:15.170> now

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
been picking grapes all evening so now

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.920 
been picking grapes all evening so now
the<00:04:15.530> bins<00:04:15.920> actually<00:04:16.459> get<00:04:17.000> transported<00:04:17.570> down

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
the bins actually get transported down

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.080 
the bins actually get transported down
to<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.440> crush<00:04:18.620> pad<00:04:18.890> so<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.580> first<00:04:19.760> thing<00:04:19.970> they

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
to the crush pad so the first thing they

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.720 
to the crush pad so the first thing they
do<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.330> they<00:04:20.420> come<00:04:20.600> up<00:04:20.750> top<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.260> get<00:04:21.410> weighed

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
do is they come up top and get weighed

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.760 
do is they come up top and get weighed
so<00:04:22.730> we<00:04:22.820> take<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.030> weight<00:04:23.270> on<00:04:23.420> each<00:04:23.570> bin<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.590> then

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
so we take a weight on each bin and then

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.680 
so we take a weight on each bin and then
they<00:04:24.890> get<00:04:25.010> moved<00:04:25.220> down<00:04:25.430> here<00:04:25.910> into<00:04:26.150> position

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
they get moved down here into position

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.020 
they get moved down here into position
you<00:04:26.780> can<00:04:26.930> see<00:04:26.960> them<00:04:27.260> down<00:04:27.410> here<00:04:27.670> and<00:04:28.670> from

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
you can see them down here and from

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.360 
you can see them down here and from
there<00:04:29.210> they'll<00:04:29.420> get<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.690> actually<00:04:29.930> tipped

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
there they'll get to actually tipped

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.090 
there they'll get to actually tipped
into<00:04:31.370> this<00:04:31.690> conveyor<00:04:32.690> belt<00:04:32.960> which<00:04:33.200> I'll<00:04:33.380> bring

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
into this conveyor belt which I'll bring

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.190 
into this conveyor belt which I'll bring
them<00:04:34.250> up<00:04:34.430> here<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:35.330> drop<00:04:35.630> them<00:04:35.870> into<00:04:36.080> this

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
them up here and drop them into this

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.020 
them up here and drop them into this
next<00:04:36.500> conveyor<00:04:36.860> which<00:04:37.100> will<00:04:37.310> come<00:04:37.550> over<00:04:37.790> here

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
next conveyor which will come over here

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.930 
next conveyor which will come over here
and<00:04:38.210> drop<00:04:38.900> into<00:04:39.170> the<00:04:39.260> press<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.550> press<00:04:40.670> is

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
and drop into the press and the press is

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.210 
and drop into the press and the press is
where<00:04:41.120> once<00:04:42.020> we<00:04:42.140> haven't<00:04:42.440> filled<00:04:42.620> will<00:04:43.040> close

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
where once we haven't filled will close

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.760 
where once we haven't filled will close
the<00:04:43.370> doors<00:04:44.080> apply<00:04:45.080> about<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.380> hundred<00:04:45.740> and

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
the doors apply about a hundred and

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.550 
the doors apply about a hundred and
twenty<00:04:45.980> psi<00:04:46.580> or<00:04:47.090> six<00:04:47.450> bar<00:04:47.660> pressure<00:04:47.990> to<00:04:48.350> the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
twenty psi or six bar pressure to the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.140 
twenty psi or six bar pressure to the
whole<00:04:48.710> lot<00:04:48.950> and<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:50.120> extreme<00:04:50.570> pressure<00:04:50.900> will

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
whole lot and that extreme pressure will

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.030 
whole lot and that extreme pressure will
elicit<00:04:53.150> initially<00:04:53.840> nothing<00:04:54.230> it's<00:04:54.500> very<00:04:54.710> anti

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
elicit initially nothing it's very anti

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.610 
elicit initially nothing it's very anti
climatic<00:04:55.930> and<00:04:56.930> then<00:04:57.140> it<00:04:57.230> goes<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.410> little

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
climatic and then it goes a little

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.320 
climatic and then it goes a little
longer<00:04:57.980> and<00:04:58.160> it'll<00:04:58.490> drip<00:04:58.640> a<00:04:58.670> little<00:04:58.760> more<00:04:59.090> and

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
longer and it'll drip a little more and

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.940 
longer and it'll drip a little more and
then<00:04:59.420> we'll<00:04:59.540> crank<00:04:59.810> it<00:04:59.960> up<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.140> little<00:05:00.260> more<00:05:00.530> and

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
then we'll crank it up a little more and

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.970 
then we'll crank it up a little more and
that's<00:05:01.550> our<00:05:01.730> process<00:05:01.910> and<00:05:02.390> that<00:05:02.540> may<00:05:02.720> take

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
that's our process and that may take

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.770 
that's our process and that may take
half<00:05:03.980> a<00:05:04.100> day<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.430> may<00:05:04.550> take<00:05:04.820> two<00:05:05.360> weeks<00:05:05.510> it

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
half a day it may take two weeks it

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.210 
half a day it may take two weeks it
really<00:05:06.020> depends<00:05:06.350> on<00:05:06.410> how<00:05:06.560> cold<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:06.950> is<00:05:09.220> once

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
really depends on how cold it is once

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.740 
really depends on how cold it is once
we've<00:05:10.370> got<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.610> juice<00:05:10.820> out<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.419> frozen

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
we've got the juice out of the frozen

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.630 
we've got the juice out of the frozen
grapes<00:05:11.930> into<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:12.410> juice<00:05:12.560> pan<00:05:12.800> first<00:05:13.490> we<00:05:13.550> have

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
grapes into the juice pan first we have

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.130 
grapes into the juice pan first we have
to<00:05:13.730> warm<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:14.000> up<00:05:14.060> because<00:05:14.210> it'll<00:05:14.450> be<00:05:14.540> minus<00:05:14.870> six

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
to warm it up because it'll be minus six

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.200 
to warm it up because it'll be minus six
minus<00:05:15.350> eight<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:16.160> we<00:05:16.250> warm<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.580> up<00:05:16.700> then<00:05:16.970> we<00:05:17.060> add

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
minus eight so we warm it up then we add

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.610 
minus eight so we warm it up then we add
yeast<00:05:17.480> to<00:05:17.690> it<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.080> yeast<00:05:18.260> are<00:05:18.440> gonna

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
yeast to it and the yeast are gonna

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.230 
yeast to it and the yeast are gonna
basically<00:05:19.040> they're<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.820> mother<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:20.150> the

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
basically they're the the mother of the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.460 
basically they're the the mother of the
wine<00:05:20.390> if<00:05:20.570> you<00:05:20.600> will<00:05:20.810> they're<00:05:20.960> gonna<00:05:21.050> convert

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
wine if you will they're gonna convert

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.140 
wine if you will they're gonna convert
all<00:05:21.650> those<00:05:21.800> sugars<00:05:22.160> into<00:05:22.310> alcohol<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:22.850> carbon

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
all those sugars into alcohol and carbon

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.180 
all those sugars into alcohol and carbon
dioxide<00:05:23.470> leaving<00:05:24.470> some<00:05:24.680> they<00:05:24.890> won't<00:05:25.040> ferment

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
dioxide leaving some they won't ferment

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.470 
dioxide leaving some they won't ferment
it<00:05:25.400> completely<00:05:25.730> through<00:05:25.940> but<00:05:26.330> leave<00:05:26.450> some
