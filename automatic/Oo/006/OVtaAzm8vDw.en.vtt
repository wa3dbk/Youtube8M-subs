00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.270
 although they are great spectacular 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.039
 fantastic to see us more skinny and 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.359
 taller works a lot especially 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.260
 because I'm in the kitchen I want 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.780
 achieve something that I say I'm taller 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.080
 I have to be carrying my love reach me 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.300
 this 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.500
 towards life remember that things 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.850
 good come in tiny containers 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.559
 so I hope you love those 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.470
 tricks do not miss them and you want 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.130
 at the end for 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.290
 garments with high waists are 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.750
 excellent when it comes to lengthening the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.430
 Bone figure of the body longer because 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.400
 They give you the illusion of the legs 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.980
 very rich and much thinner everything 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.640
 that are pants shorts and skirts 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.850
 high waist are great a 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.290
 excellent option are the outfits 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.300
 monochromatic using many colors is 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.370
 how the figure falls short and shortens the 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.460
 body use only two colors as 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:17.360
 maximum but at the most it helps you 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.210
 keep everything in harmony a good idea 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.580
 to create vertical and elongated lines 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.220
 in your body is to keep the blazer on 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 bag or unbuttoned shirt 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.230
 the necks lengthen the neck and by 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.480
 ende give the illusion of more height 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.340
 use them in sacks dressed under better 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.420
 said in whatever you want you are going to see 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.720
 Excellent 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.759
 always wear tight clothes that are 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.880
 of your size because they create the 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.520
 illusion of much more height the clothes very 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.500
 release only to see how more 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.500
 short of what you really are 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.189
 we add the skinny jeans are not for 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.100
 all tastes because they are not always 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.110
 the option that most suits us but if 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.810
 find the one that is perfect for you 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.800
 will really make a difference 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.800
 making you see much more 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.239
 These pants lengthen the legs and 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.909
 therefore the figure looks for I have a pair 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.489
 that they reach the floor or exam a little 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:28.170
 shoes these pants with heels are 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:31.470
 they see incredible attracts attention to your 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.689
 better quality to highlight whether they are 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.769
 a nice and thin legs or the 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.989
 flat tummy 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.290
 rather, it highlights those areas with color 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.079
 and if you're wearing the loose scarf 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.639
 create long lines in your body 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.620
 anything to every one very close to 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.840
 neck can cut you making you more 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.890
 short and this does not only apply the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.350
 scarves on the necklaces also 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.020
 and 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.750
 if you are particularly short like me 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.120
 that to wear small prints is a 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.590
 custom to use large prints be 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.590
 cut mercilessly 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.180
 the easiest way to find 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.130
 centimeters are the heels can you 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.500
 choose between towering stilettos or 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.150
 platforms of different sizes choose 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.220
 those that make you feel better and more 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.890
 comfortable because it's not about killing us 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.330
 by the good voice girls this would be 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.430
