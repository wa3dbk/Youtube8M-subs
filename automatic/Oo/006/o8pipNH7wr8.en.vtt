ok here's what I'm going to try for

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.050 
ok here's what I'm going to try for
longer<00:03:16.390> lines<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:17.260> i<00:03:17.320> need<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.500> curve<00:03:21.060> it's

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
longer lines that i need to curve it's

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.250 
longer lines that i need to curve it's
going<00:03:22.210> to<00:03:22.240> take<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.450> regular<00:03:22.660> pants<00:03:23.110> look<00:03:23.200> I

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
going to take a regular pants look I

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.830 
going to take a regular pants look I
want<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.560> draw<00:03:23.710> a<00:03:23.740> line<00:03:24.040> here<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:25.750> it

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
want to draw a line here and have it

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.570 
want to draw a line here and have it
curve<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.350> like<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.800> so<00:03:27.790> I'm<00:03:27.940> going<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.210> and

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
curve in like that so I'm going to and

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.430 
curve in like that so I'm going to and
just<00:03:30.580> want<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.790> draw<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.330> line<00:03:31.780> along<00:03:32.170> their

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
just want to draw a line along their

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.860 
just want to draw a line along their
white<00:03:32.860> line<00:03:33.360> because<00:03:35.160> they<00:03:36.160> see<00:03:36.490> in<00:03:36.870> county

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
white line because they see in county

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.210 
white line because they see in county
roads<00:03:39.540> for<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.630> curb<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.260> white<00:03:41.680> line<00:03:41.920> along

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
roads for the curb the white line along

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.890 
roads for the curb the white line along
the<00:03:42.250> side<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:46.410> try<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.650> way<00:03:48.570> it's<00:03:49.570> made<00:03:49.750> it

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
the side so try it this way it's made it

00:03:49.900 --> 00:04:00.050 
the side so try it this way it's made it
an<00:03:50.050> eighth<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.470> an<00:03:50.590> inch<00:03:52.320> very<00:03:53.320> light<00:03:53.710> marking

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.060 

where<00:04:01.060> you're<00:04:01.210> an<00:04:01.360> eighth<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.630> an<00:04:01.990> inch<00:04:03.510> that

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.530 

and<00:04:09.070> take<00:04:09.310> my<00:04:09.720> painters<00:04:10.720> tape<00:04:10.960> I<00:04:12.480> don't<00:04:13.480> know

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
and take my painters tape I don't know

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.860 
and take my painters tape I don't know
how<00:04:13.690> well<00:04:13.900> this<00:04:13.990> is<00:04:14.050> going<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.290> work<00:04:14.470> but<00:04:14.860> good

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
how well this is going to work but good

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:23.600 
how well this is going to work but good
shot

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.770 

keep<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.360> down<00:04:24.599> right<00:04:25.229> along<00:04:25.530> there<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:26.659> have<00:04:27.659> I

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
keep it down right along there I have I

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.159 
keep it down right along there I have I
could<00:04:28.110> force<00:04:28.439> this<00:04:28.650> thing<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.949> bend<00:04:29.340> at<00:04:29.490> all

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.420 

well<00:04:34.169> maybe<00:04:34.349> now<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.620> mean<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:35.009> could<00:04:35.159> just<00:04:35.340> go

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
well maybe now I mean I could just go

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.850 
well maybe now I mean I could just go
ahead<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.669> free<00:04:36.030> hand<00:04:36.469> so<00:04:37.469> I<00:04:37.500> just<00:04:37.650> want<00:04:37.830> a

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
ahead a free hand so I just want a

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.649 
ahead a free hand so I just want a
little<00:04:37.979> curve<00:04:38.310> right<00:04:38.789> in<00:04:38.969> there<00:04:39.210> i<00:04:39.240> think<00:04:39.599> i

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
little curve right in there i think i

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.020 
little curve right in there i think i
can<00:04:39.780> freehand<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:41.069> won't<00:04:41.280> enough<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.669> fake<00:04:41.879> it

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
can freehand it won't enough to fake it

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:51.709 
can freehand it won't enough to fake it
see<00:04:45.030> what<00:04:45.180> i<00:04:45.240> do<00:04:45.449> is<00:04:45.780> my<00:04:50.180> white<00:04:51.180> pencil<00:04:51.449> and

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
see what i do is my white pencil and

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:57.830 
see what i do is my white pencil and
just<00:04:51.750> go<00:04:52.020> along<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.409> tape

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.620 

and<00:04:58.380> that

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.240 

I'm<00:05:06.080> actually<00:05:06.320> might<00:05:06.740> work<00:05:06.770> pretty<00:05:07.160> good

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:17.559 

like<00:05:11.250> that

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.179 

okay<00:05:18.319> and<00:05:20.349> it's<00:05:21.349> kind<00:05:21.589> of<00:05:21.619> free<00:05:21.830> hand<00:05:22.069> the

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:22.189 
okay and it's kind of free hand the

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:27.250 
okay and it's kind of free hand the
curve<00:05:22.719> and

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.290 

that

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.629 

here

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.420 

it'll<00:05:40.639> work<00:05:40.850> I<00:05:42.789> think<00:05:43.789> that<00:05:43.940> looks<00:05:44.150> fairly

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
it'll work I think that looks fairly

00:05:45.430 --> 00:06:03.129 
it'll work I think that looks fairly
yeah<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:59.470> just<00:06:00.470> need<00:06:00.680> to<00:06:00.800> be<00:06:01.720> this<00:06:02.720> piece<00:06:02.990> of

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
yeah I just need to be this piece of

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.050 
yeah I just need to be this piece of
tape<00:06:03.320> just<00:06:03.500> thin<00:06:03.830> enough<00:06:04.039> so<00:06:04.100> I<00:06:04.280> can<00:06:04.310> bend<00:06:05.000> it

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
tape just thin enough so I can bend it

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.760 
tape just thin enough so I can bend it
around<00:06:05.180> the<00:06:05.479> curve<00:06:05.780> so<00:06:06.169> if<00:06:06.259> we<00:06:06.410> just<00:06:06.560> go<00:06:06.680> ahead

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
around the curve so if we just go ahead

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.980 
around the curve so if we just go ahead
and<00:06:06.919> cut<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.160> thin<00:06:07.460> strip<00:06:07.910> this<00:06:08.389> will<00:06:08.570> be<00:06:08.720> a<00:06:08.750> bit

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
and cut a thin strip this will be a bit

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:19.019 
and cut a thin strip this will be a bit
more<00:06:10.810> minimal<00:06:11.810> to<00:06:11.960> bending

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:19.029 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:23.589 

that<00:06:20.589> tries
