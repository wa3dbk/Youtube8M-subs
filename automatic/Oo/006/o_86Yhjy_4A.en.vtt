00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.180
 before closing this newspaper know that it's been forty days since 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.100
 crowd but reassures with the Madrilenian at the Olympique de Marseille 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.539
 continues of course to support ecclestone olympian fans asked 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.580
 at the amended state in seeing their opinion on the situation of his post but also 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.100
 on the call for calm launched for the match at 3m atlético de madrid of 9 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.179
 next December 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.740
 years that followed 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.750
 to all these percent movements for his position because it's something 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.909
 incredible what he saw so we can not put himself in his place but 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.319
 but we can at least say to ourselves and write actions so that it goes ahead 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.640
 in a good way because it's still incredible that are still 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.070
 imprisoned today 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.260
 and compared to this match back against madrid that looks on very hot 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.730
 but I know it's especially hot on the ground 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.110
 with depth from marseille because I think the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.030
 best answer we can give 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.120
 what happened in the first match is percent as well as everything happens 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.429
 well and at best and is 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.850
 but we win on the ground I think it's 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.810
 that would be the answer because 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.440
 because I think man's violence at the places there in the stadiums 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.770
 to our missions france to show that they are fed up 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.080
 still a good quality that showed for the dr a major 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.010
 themes 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.610
 to make a tour and show on the ground and then the entrance to the city 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.050
 phocean of two men fall 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.050
 over six months and two years my thing 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.190
 that it can be fun 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.750
 and if in the positive surroundings they showed that my investigation 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.470
 for the carrier the revenues are stable once reprocessed 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.080
 the unemployment rate, which is likely to make everyone aware of what is happening 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.180
 past 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.850
 Its a story 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.270
 extra football even 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.270
 which takes too big proportions in France 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.430
 it is necessary that this shows a little more intelligence precisely 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.590
 that's what the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.410
 our supporters 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.390
 compared to the colors and what happens what surpasses in Spain 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.100
 six empty Esperanto supporters 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.760
 politics and violence 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.830
 labbé 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.690
 it will be part of the story 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.130
 it will be much more it will be much better 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.090
 and violence it's useless the important thing now that's what 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.090
 would solve the problem because if there is violence that has led 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.150
 the most tender figures that the mayor is going to support this match that will be 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.549
 very important i also hope that m 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:14.509
 the sentences 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.039
 the group of Marseille supporters 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.889
 he has the agreement as a starting point
