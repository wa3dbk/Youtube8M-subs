he<00:00:00.210> was<00:00:00.359> studying<00:00:00.570> the<00:00:01.350> whole<00:00:01.500> big<00:00:01.800> thing<00:00:01.829> was

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
he was studying the whole big thing was

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.519 
he was studying the whole big thing was
that<00:00:02.669> was<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.210> difference<00:00:03.389> between<00:00:03.720> come<00:00:04.230> for

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
that was the difference between come for

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.419 
that was the difference between come for
karate<00:00:05.390> come<00:00:06.390> from<00:00:06.830> okay<00:00:09.740> well<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.010> bottom

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
karate come from okay well the bottom

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.970 
karate come from okay well the bottom
line<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:11.910> calm<00:00:12.300> food<00:00:12.599> was<00:00:12.929> supposed<00:00:13.290> people<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
line was calm food was supposed people a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.910 
line was calm food was supposed people a
circular<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.849> dried<00:00:15.480> was<00:00:15.780> more<00:00:16.049> Angela<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
circular and dried was more Angela and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.510 
circular and dried was more Angela and
linear<00:00:17.390> then<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.779> few<00:00:19.380> years<00:00:19.439> later<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.279> found

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
linear then a few years later we found

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.220 
linear then a few years later we found
out<00:00:20.730> what's<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> difference<00:00:21.630> between<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
out what's the difference between the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.390 
out what's the difference between the
internal<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.010> external<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:24.830> kungfu<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
internal and the external the kungfu a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.640 
internal and the external the kungfu a
circular<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.359> has<00:00:27.570> still<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> lot<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> sharp

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
circular but it has still a lot of sharp

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.490 
circular but it has still a lot of sharp
angles<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> then<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.359> internal<00:00:31.019> styles<00:00:31.380> with

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
angles and then the internal styles with

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200 
angles and then the internal styles with
more<00:00:31.740> circling<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.640> got<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.820> barb

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
more circling and you got the barb

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.810 
more circling and you got the barb
language<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:34.530> takes<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.399> another<00:00:35.430> level

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
language then takes it to another level

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.680 
language then takes it to another level
so<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> main<00:00:37.559> thing<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.059> read<00:00:39.329> all

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
so but the main thing is if you read all

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.389 
so but the main thing is if you read all
this<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.620> physics<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.250> mechanics

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
this it's just physics and mechanics

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.389 
this it's just physics and mechanics
didn't<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.329> keep<00:00:42.629> pressing<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.980> sit<00:00:44.370> there

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
didn't I keep pressing is it sit there

from<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> strength<00:00:47.879> when<00:00:48.690> something<00:00:49.200> is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
from the strength when something is

force a lot more efficiently with a
greater<00:01:08.520> effect<00:01:09.290> then<00:01:10.850> got<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.150> angular

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
greater effect then got your angular

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.899 
greater effect then got your angular
motion<00:01:13.020> has<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.860> happened<00:01:14.299> of<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:16.909> inches

motion has just happened of you inches

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.230 
motion has just happened of you inches
or<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.330> momentum<00:01:18.960> that's<00:01:19.590> any<00:01:19.950> motion<00:01:20.490> done<00:01:21.060> in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
or so momentum that's any motion done in

or so momentum that's any motion done in
the<00:01:21.330> curve<00:01:21.740> can<00:01:22.740> generate<00:01:23.250> much<00:01:23.520> more

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the curve can generate much more

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.550 
the curve can generate much more
momentum<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.750> taking<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.229> more

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
momentum because it's taking up more

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.190 
momentum because it's taking up more
space<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> spiral<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.780> point<00:01:28.049> of

acceleration<00:01:32.340> into<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.720> walk<00:01:34.049> which<00:01:34.770> means<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
acceleration into a walk which means you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.460 
acceleration into a walk which means you
it<00:01:35.610> might<00:01:35.970> look<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.750> moving<00:01:36.930> slower

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
it might look like you're moving slower

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.609 
it might look like you're moving slower
but<00:01:37.920> you're<00:01:38.159> actually<00:01:38.369> moving<00:01:38.759> faster<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.810> if

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
but you're actually moving faster and if

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.260 
but you're actually moving faster and if
you<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> physics<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> matter<00:01:41.970> but

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you do the physics in the matter but

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.719 
you do the physics in the matter but
you'll<00:01:42.420> find<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.649> circular<00:01:44.280> movement

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
you'll find that a circular movement

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.499 
you'll find that a circular movement
movement<00:01:45.210> will<00:01:45.720> generate<00:01:46.259> much<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.950> force

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
movement will generate much more force

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.569 
movement will generate much more force
unless<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.200> shorter<00:01:49.590> period<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.040> time<00:01:50.100> and

your<00:02:03.540> structure<00:02:04.079> will<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.549> better<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.880> then

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
your structure will be better off then

will be free salary but we're a little
bit<00:02:54.900> if<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.440> first<00:02:55.739> we're<00:02:55.890> going<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.069> do<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
bit if I first we're going to do the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.610 
bit if I first we're going to do the
four<00:02:56.640> gates<00:02:57.049> okay<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.470> you'll

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
four gates okay so that you'll

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.559 
four gates okay so that you'll
understand<00:02:59.160> because<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.700> like<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.090> said<00:03:00.330> and

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
understand because and like I said and

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.970 
understand because and like I said and
fighting<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:03.150> sailors<00:03:04.110> at<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.410> Octagon

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
fighting like sailors at the Octagon

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.229 
fighting like sailors at the Octagon
there's<00:03:05.310> eight<00:03:05.580> directions<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.510> move<00:03:06.840> in

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
there's eight directions you can move in

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.319 
there's eight directions you can move in
when<00:03:09.239> you're<00:03:09.450> moving<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:11.700> have<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.120> realize

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
when you're moving you have to realize

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.390 
when you're moving you have to realize
that<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.959> eight<00:03:13.230> gates<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.799> teaching<00:03:14.280> you

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
that this eight gates is teaching you

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.090 
that this eight gates is teaching you
about<00:03:14.549> balance<00:03:15.299> because<00:03:16.140> when<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.560> set<00:03:16.799> up<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
about balance because when you set up a

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.370 
about balance because when you set up a
structure<00:03:17.430> if<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.570> want<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.870> cut<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.230> into

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
structure if you want to cut it into

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.650 
structure if you want to cut it into
angle<00:03:19.890> it's<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.519> slice<00:03:20.880> piece<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.420> pie

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
angle it's like a a slice piece of pie

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.690 
angle it's like a a slice piece of pie
so<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.590> have<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> solid<00:03:23.640> straight<00:03:24.510> square

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
so you have a solid straight square

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.670 
so you have a solid straight square
angular<00:03:26.700> force<00:03:27.060> no<00:03:27.840> matter<00:03:28.109> which<00:03:28.410> way<00:03:28.440> you

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
angular force no matter which way you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.479 
angular force no matter which way you
turn<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:30.239> there's<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.750> side<00:03:31.019> attack<00:03:31.489> JavaScript

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
turn so there's a side attack JavaScript

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.789 
turn so there's a side attack JavaScript
so<00:03:32.910> say<00:03:33.209> for<00:03:33.239> instance<00:03:33.450> when<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:33.959> do<00:03:34.290> an<00:03:34.440> arm

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
so say for instance when you do an arm

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.289 
so say for instance when you do an arm
motion<00:03:35.510> there's<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:38.160> divide<00:03:38.790> your<00:03:38.819> leg<00:03:39.269> up

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
motion there's a you divide your leg up

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.770 
motion there's a you divide your leg up
into<00:03:39.720> an<00:03:40.049> octagon<00:03:41.030> there<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> strength<00:03:42.540> or

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
into an octagon there is a strength or

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.110 
into an octagon there is a strength or
an<00:03:42.959> attack<00:03:43.319> but<00:03:43.980> see<00:03:44.190> then<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.430> have<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.850> turn<00:03:45.060> my

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
an attack but see then I have to turn my

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.000 
an attack but see then I have to turn my
senator<00:03:45.840> beat<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.230> handle<00:03:46.680> there's<00:03:46.859> no

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
senator beat that handle there's no

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.520 
senator beat that handle there's no
power<00:03:47.250> there's<00:03:47.910> no<00:03:48.060> power<00:03:48.180> when<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.019> shoulder
