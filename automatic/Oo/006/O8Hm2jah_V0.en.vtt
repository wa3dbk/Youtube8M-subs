00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.539
 she is dead is the web of tiny his veins and arteries 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.270
 in the depths of this organism an intricate network of blood vessels 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.270
 wraps the red muscle strips 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.840
 heating the shark's blood and maintaining its temperature up to 28 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.839
 degrees above that of the surrounding waters 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.730
 this may be the key to his ability to travel thousands of kilometers 

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.779
 furrowing the cold waters of the open ocean 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.650
 in Mexico the shark tracking is perfectly timed 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.020
 every year these white sharks arrive around September and leave at 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 day in the world 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.070
 but nobody knows why the world 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.070
 it's a mystery that these researchers hope to be able to solve if they get 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.330
 place a satellite tracker on one of these large targets will be able to 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 map the mysterious trips of these sharks 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.680
 according to the conditions in guadeloupe they are perfect they have the waters are 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.240
 crystalline 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.220
 there is only one problem these white Mexican sharks are huge this 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.610
 year there is the shark much older than the sharks that have 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.610
 studied in your country 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.050
 from itself that is great 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.770
 now we are ready listings 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.000
 the South African Estefan Swanson is the head of the fishermen 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.660
 the capture of 19 white sharks for scientific experiments 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.200
 and I've never seen a singing shark 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 45 meters and its execution of five meters 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.850
 but before 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.650
 it's a giant shark 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.970
 the most interesting dam turns out to be an entity 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.490
 from that corner shot 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.299
 It is estimated that it measures five meters and weighs more than one tonne 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.009
 sweet a recent scar on the left eye we really love 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.859
 Estefan prepare the fence 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.859
 the head of a blue tuna 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:22.409
 but capturing a shark of this size requires a change of plans 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:28.149
 players are the same they are villages that you will only use but I am in the n 1 colo 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.579
 is to make it safer and more resistant 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.579
 the smell of blue tuna attracts the shark to the hook 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.369
 of the big three 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.369
 it's very big and it's investigating mexico 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.699
 1 but when it is near the grave 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.699
 the shark turns around 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 his behavior is cautious the inquisitive 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.929
 one was wearing a black shirt 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:04.019
 maybe after a life fighting with live prey the white sharks 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.859
 learn not to trust 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.859
 last moment 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.339
 maybe the dissection team will have the answer 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.619
 are about to unveil the secrets of the grand slam brain 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.509
 on this path is the greatest mystery of all 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.839
 the mind of the shark 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.789
 what kind of intelligence cni to the sharp senses of the shark 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.989
 its long periods 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.859
 and its powerful attacks 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.389
 the brain is the most interesting the contact of the world investigate how it 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.580
 they feed and like nothing but none of that would happen 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.990
 without this thing that controls everything after hours cutting face to reach its 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.060
 objective on the part of the segarra genre and it is very interesting the majority of the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.050
 people believe that the brain of sharks like ours with game forms but 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.329
 It's really flattering and it has a way of getting there 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.780
 unlike the small sphere that is the human brain the huge brain 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.109
 of the white shark extends throughout the skull receiving and processing the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.109
 information that comes from his six encounters 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.840
 this brain has been evolving more than 400 million years with a goal 

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:30.840
 Clear 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.000
 to be the most powerful sensory machine in the ocean 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.269
 today the latest generation computers allow us to see the 

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:44.269
 Sophisticated club wiring 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.210
 the thin and elongated brain receives visual data from the eyes 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.870
 sounds 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.880
 and aquatic movements of the ears and the lateral line 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.789
 Nose colors and spots are factors 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.759
 of electrical impulses from a labyrinth of nerve cells 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.659
 it is evident that white sharks are not brainless predators 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.369
 they are highly developed creatures equipped with powerful tools to 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:16.559
 browse your hand 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:21.120
 still counting on such bulky senses and unequaled predatory powers 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.290
 these giants need our help to survive 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.509
 a come to the light of the same huge female continues to explore the fence 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:38.899
 today could be at any time if everyone after your visit 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.379
 smell electro receptors and other senses are working intensely 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.490
 until your brain makes a decision 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.520
 they must fail peace 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.949
 applied 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.949
 crisis 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.089
 the shark instinctively dives trying to free itself from the hooks 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:09.039
 if the results would be evicted let it go 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:11.270
 before this French company 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.370
 llanes I'm going to pay attention to reality 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.360
 but you have to start
