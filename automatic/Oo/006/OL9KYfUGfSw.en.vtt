00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
think of it this way in a full 18 player

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810 
think of it this way in a full 18 player
match<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> five<00:00:46.770> point<00:00:47.100> six<00:00:47.340> percent

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
chance of being first infected when two

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.189 
chance of being first infected when two
people<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.760> down<00:00:50.940> sights<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.390> each<00:00:51.510> other<00:00:51.719> they

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
people in down sights at each other they

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.720 
people in down sights at each other they
both<00:00:52.230> increase<00:00:52.860> their<00:00:53.039> chances<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.550> eight

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
both increase their chances to eight

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.340 
both increase their chances to eight
point<00:00:54.030> four<00:00:54.210> percent<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.809> being<00:00:55.199> infected

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
point four percent of being infected

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.200 
point four percent of being infected
within<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.039> first<00:00:56.340> eight<00:00:56.550> seconds<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
within the first eight seconds of the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.389 
within the first eight seconds of the
game<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.289> number<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.920> considering

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
game and that number is just considering

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.029 
game and that number is just considering
one<00:00:59.640> person<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.660> percent<00:01:01.140> jumps<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.649> with

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
one person that percent jumps up with

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.000 
one person that percent jumps up with
each<00:01:02.309> person<00:01:02.850> that's<00:01:03.120> around<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.589> instead

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
each person that's around you so instead

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
each person that's around you so instead
I<00:01:05.309> suggest<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:05.970> try<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> avoid<00:01:06.600> the

I suggest you try to avoid the
confrontation<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> sight<00:01:09.000> from

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
confrontation and get out of sight from

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.719 
confrontation and get out of sight from
anyone<00:01:09.570> else<00:01:09.799> then<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.220> focus<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.700> your

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
anyone else then you can focus on your

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.539

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
an arrow disappears near you because

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
an arrow disappears near you because
that's<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> location<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.610> first

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that's the location of the first

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.719

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
can focus on just one direction I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.109 
can focus on just one direction I
usually<00:01:43.740> try<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> venture<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:44.759> bit

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
usually try to venture out a little bit

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.389 
usually try to venture out a little bit
until<00:01:45.390> there's<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.380> few<00:01:46.799> more<00:01:47.009> infected

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
until there's a few more infected

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.850 
until there's a few more infected
hopefully<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.509> pull<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> few<00:01:49.020> kills<00:01:49.290> then

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
hopefully you can pull a few kills then

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.700 
hopefully you can pull a few kills then

I<00:02:09.500> make<00:02:10.190> sure<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.490> remember<00:02:10.700> where<00:02:11.060> that

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
I make sure to remember where that

I make sure to remember where that
lethal<00:02:11.570> equipment<00:02:11.810> was<00:02:12.260> if<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.860> get<00:02:13.070> infected

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400

I'm going to try and throw a knife it so

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.000 
I'm going to try and throw a knife it so
my<00:02:16.820> advice<00:02:16.850> instead<00:02:17.570> would<00:02:18.110> be<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.470> hold<00:02:18.620> on<00:02:18.830> to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
my advice instead would be to hold on to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.700 
my advice instead would be to hold on to
that<00:02:19.130> c4<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.910> Betty<00:02:20.150> or<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.570> claim<00:02:20.810> or<00:02:21.020> for

when<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.130> call<00:02:22.280> in<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.520> MOAB<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.930> one<00:02:24.260> second

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
when you call in a MOAB that one second

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.320 
when you call in a MOAB that one second
it<00:02:24.770> takes<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.130> call<00:02:25.310> animal<00:02:25.640> AB<00:02:25.760> can<00:02:26.030> be<00:02:26.150> long

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
it takes to call animal AB can be long

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.390 
it takes to call animal AB can be long
enough<00:02:26.540> for<00:02:26.780> four<00:02:27.290> or<00:02:27.320> five<00:02:27.470> infected<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.250> get

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
enough for four or five infected to get

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.390 
enough for four or five infected to get
really<00:02:28.790> close<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.390> sometimes<00:02:30.380> just<00:02:30.560> too

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
really close to you sometimes just too

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.550 
really close to you sometimes just too
many<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.940> close<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.810> can't<00:02:33.170> kill<00:02:33.380> all<00:02:33.530> of

many to close that you can't kill all of
them<00:02:33.770> with<00:02:33.950> your<00:02:34.100> gun<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:35.120> that's<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.570> perfect

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
them with your gun so that's a perfect

equipment whatever it is just throw it
real<00:02:40.700> quick<00:02:40.940> hopefully<00:02:41.180> if<00:02:41.450> quick-draw<00:02:41.840> Pro

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
real quick hopefully if quick-draw Pro

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.440 
real quick hopefully if quick-draw Pro
also<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.700> will<00:02:43.850> give<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.150> little<00:02:44.270> bit

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
also and it will give you a little bit

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.050 
also and it will give you a little bit
more<00:02:44.600> room<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.930> breathe<00:02:45.110> again<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:46.060> remember

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
more room to breathe again and remember

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.120 
more room to breathe again and remember
that<00:02:47.510> with<00:02:47.660> c4<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.350> can<00:02:48.500> hit<00:02:48.620> your<00:02:48.770> reload

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
that with c4 you can hit your reload

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.770 
that with c4 you can hit your reload
reload<00:02:49.160> button<00:02:49.670> really<00:02:49.940> quick<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.300> detonate

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
reload button really quick to detonate

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.930 
reload button really quick to detonate
that<00:02:50.990> c4<00:02:51.200> faster<00:02:51.950> than<00:02:52.190> hitting<00:02:52.580> your<00:02:52.790> toss

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940

is<00:05:35.940> definitely<00:05:36.449> the<00:05:36.599> kimbo<00:05:36.990> 57<00:05:37.590> pistols<00:05:38.009> the

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
is definitely the kimbo 57 pistols the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.580 
is definitely the kimbo 57 pistols the
reason<00:05:39.300> for<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.509> is<00:05:39.840> that<00:05:39.870> these<00:05:40.289> have<00:05:40.530> a

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
reason for that is that these have a

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.249 
reason for that is that these have a
super-fast<00:05:41.340> fire<00:05:41.610> rate<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:42.599> very<00:05:42.990> fast

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
super-fast fire rate and a very fast

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.830 
super-fast fire rate and a very fast
