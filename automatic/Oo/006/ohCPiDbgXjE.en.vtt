00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 servus and welcome to this 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.520
 video remains until the end then experience 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.080
 her general what's going on right here 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.030
 is and now for exciting 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.969
 new there is a new call of duty 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.139
 zombie future is robert started online 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.850
 the publisher is activision and yes that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.000
 developer studio is not 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.150
 sad but the dance and any one 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.010
 Japanese or Chinese 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 developer studio and there are couples 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.960
 nations to call of duty zombies truck 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.120
 Actually as well as everything and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710
 that made me suspicious why does 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.920
 track so what do I think so that is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.350
 from activisions page that the that 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.120
 had to pull that activision 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.820
 has that they have to give a bit 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.160
 but I believe in the story it will be 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.329
 No problems we drank for 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.460
 have secured themselves 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.020
 and I think that's good too 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.690
 is just an online one thing online 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.250
 and not really now 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.140
 be made megamÃ¤ÃŸig as if it were a 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.609
 new zombie game only is indeed in the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.379
 but not craig that's the shame 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.790
 but in any case it looks very good 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.080
 if you look like black 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.189
 ops 2 just futuristic but looks real 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.270
 not bad, they have too 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.970
 yellow and blue eyes again 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.470
 I believe these robot combo now 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.080
 not that it has anything to do with the story 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.280
 be for your own story and four 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.890
 characters there is a Japanese 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.610
 they look a bit like that on everyone 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.600
 If a woman falls a black one 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.420
 a no I just have to go to one 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.890
 cowboy and then another one 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.990
 Japanese or something, what exactly can you do 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.670
 You can see many new things 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.750
 not many new things many old ones 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.940
 things you can, for example, an old 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.369
 map and see the night of the undead in 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.479
 futuristic style 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.009
 but I do not think that will only after 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.869
 you play the ground sometimes 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.720
 I saw a big city 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.600
 there it will play and the graphic looks 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.130
 very good for an online game stop 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.729
 actually like call of duty black ops 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.149
 was a bit worse yes exactly 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:10.880
 you can not say more at the moment 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:12.890
 is only for china and yes on everyone 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.110
 not for us and america 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.610
 first thought for there is also 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.950
 is just now in the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.660
 beta and I link the page 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.430
 This Japanese side will be little 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.500
 understand because everything is in Chinese 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.870
 but you can watch videos there 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.750
 me synonymous the original video to the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.640
 I will link below and go 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.250
 a minute thirty looks up 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.650
 Anyway it is worth it for 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.390
 love the real call of duty combo and 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.579
 when it comes to us in europe 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.769
 you will know immediately and then you will 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.269
 I think it's time to pick it up 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.430
 looks pretty good and says for everyone 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.380
 how many you have to see the rule 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.590
 also and that surprised me because that 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.239
 roof ripped track only is caught 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.140
 apparently not so power-ups are there 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:01.730
 also cologne now there are also wall weeks 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.970
 there is also everything and that 's it 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.090
 i too so setting is a city yes 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.230
 exactly 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.180
 Everything is linked below and now 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.519
 to the channel why nothing comes 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.299
 the stupid is just I have an extreme 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.970
 here 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.160
 These also super great on the bands 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.980
 I'll have in my head at that time not 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.810
 hd pvr gaming edition bought the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.239
 compatible also with the he with the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.830
 external is no dear alex had to 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.160
 of course buy the cheaper ones 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.320
 and thus he has no hdmi connection at 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.280
 this hdtv and so can alex too 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.190
 do not make videos 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.510
 No I'm sorry I would really like 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.700
 I 've also tried it 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.580
 this upload studio 5 minutes only 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.980
 somehow it does not work 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.660
 and yes I'm still thinking about what 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.040
 I'm doing here and the storyline is 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.770
 currently set because I have none 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.490
 lust for more 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.030
 some may already know that 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.070
 half is already done anyway 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.100
 I just do not think so because the lust 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.950
 And he does me for all people 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.260
 who have wished most 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.980
 Michael already subscribes to the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.280
 were opinion 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.440
 I'm just so bad at those 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.300
 i will tell you newer my new one 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.840
 That's definitely on the website 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.330
 is very interesting and yes exactly me 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.860
 hope that will also start in europe 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.660
 That thing then I would be on everyone 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.250
 case worth it that was it from me we see 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.260
 We'll probably see you again someday 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.260
 so then also pure and servus
