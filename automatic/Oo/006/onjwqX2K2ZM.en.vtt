whatever it doesn't really matter the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.510 
whatever it doesn't really matter the
order<00:01:32.340> only<00:01:33.329> bad<00:01:33.600> thing<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.220> open

up<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:35.939> doors<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
up all these doors which kind of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
up all these doors which kind of
interferes<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.500> your<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.430> zombie

you<00:02:18.410> gotta<00:02:18.440> throw<00:02:18.709> your<00:02:18.890> grenades<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:20.050> you

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
you gotta throw your grenades and you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.870 
you gotta throw your grenades and you

have to blow up all the canisters I

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.300 
have to blow up all the canisters I
think<00:02:23.090> there's<00:02:23.239> six<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.600> them<00:02:23.709> but<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.040> I'll

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
think there's six of them but so I'll

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.850 
think there's six of them but so I'll
just<00:02:25.430> randomly<00:02:25.640> through<00:02:26.090> them<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:27.080> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
just randomly through them and then the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.190 
just randomly through them and then the
table<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:28.940> stick<00:02:29.299> out<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.720> cassette

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
table like stick out of the cassette

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.759 
table like stick out of the cassette
player<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.730> got<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.970> grab<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.690> think<00:02:33.530> I

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
player so you got to grab that I think I

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.890 
player so you got to grab that I think I
was<00:02:34.190> using<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.549> classic<00:02:35.209> controller<00:02:35.330> on<00:02:35.720> this

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
was using the classic controller on this

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.440 
was using the classic controller on this
and<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.890> just<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.340> hold<00:02:37.519> down<00:02:37.640> Y<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.239> think

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
and you just you hold down Y and I think

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.170 
and you just you hold down Y and I think
it's<00:02:38.569> just<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:40.190> regular<00:02:40.580> Wii<00:02:40.850> Remote

button<00:02:43.459> is<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.560> then<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:46.489> know<00:02:46.610> then<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
button is and then you know then you

probably<00:04:45.160> did<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.610> 20<00:04:45.760> times<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.510> it's<00:04:47.350> kind

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
probably did it 20 times and it's kind

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.110 
probably did it 20 times and it's kind
of<00:04:47.560> hard<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.770> tell<00:04:48.010> if<00:04:48.130> you<00:04:48.310> actually<00:04:48.490> do<00:04:48.910> get

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
of hard to tell if you actually do get

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.510 
of hard to tell if you actually do get

and that would unlock the other zombie
maps<00:05:53.789> but<00:05:54.389> we<00:05:54.810> don't<00:05:54.990> have<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.259> other<00:05:55.349> zombie

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
maps but we don't have the other zombie

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.040 
maps but we don't have the other zombie
maps<00:05:55.889> but<00:05:56.819> it<00:05:56.909> will<00:05:57.060> unlock<00:05:57.210> all<00:05:57.599> the<00:05:57.719> missions

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.050 
maps but it will unlock all the missions
for<00:05:58.259> you<00:05:58.319> so<00:05:59.129> you<00:05:59.189> go<00:05:59.400> ahead<00:05:59.460> and<00:05:59.580> do<00:05:59.699> that<00:05:59.729> and

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
be careful when you enter these codes

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.980 
be careful when you enter these codes
because<00:06:02.310> I<00:06:02.669> don't<00:06:03.569> know

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
because I don't know

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.990 
because I don't know
I<00:06:04.020> played<00:06:04.680> multiplayer<00:06:05.009> before<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.639> played<00:06:05.879> the

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
single-player and but I did enter the

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.189 
single-player and but I did enter the
code<00:06:08.849> before<00:06:09.180> I<00:06:09.360> played<00:06:09.539> single<00:06:09.840> player<00:06:10.050> and

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
code before I played single player and

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.559 
code before I played single player and
the<00:06:10.529> single-player<00:06:11.340> seems<00:06:11.699> to<00:06:11.849> freeze<00:06:12.180> up<00:06:12.360> on

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
the single-player seems to freeze up on

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.420 
the single-player seems to freeze up on
me<00:06:12.629> and<00:06:13.560> I<00:06:13.680> don't<00:06:13.740> know<00:06:13.949> if<00:06:14.039> it's<00:06:14.159> because<00:06:14.250> of

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
me and I don't know if it's because of

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.089 
me and I don't know if it's because of
these<00:06:14.490> codes<00:06:14.849> so<00:06:15.180> you<00:06:15.589> know<00:06:16.589> I'll<00:06:16.650> be<00:06:16.770> careful

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
these codes so you know I'll be careful

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.820 
these codes so you know I'll be careful
when<00:06:17.190> you<00:06:17.279> do<00:06:17.400> that<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:17.819> you<00:06:18.539> can<00:06:18.659> also<00:06:18.810> push<00:06:19.229> I

playing in the background it's kind of

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.930 
playing in the background it's kind of
annoying<00:06:23.789> but<00:06:24.750> anyways<00:06:25.020> you<00:06:25.680> can<00:06:25.800> push<00:06:26.009> 3<00:06:26.729> Ark

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
and then right here I'm typing in help

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.320 
and then right here I'm typing in help
and<00:06:36.690> that'll<00:06:37.229> bring<00:06:37.379> up<00:06:37.589> a<00:06:37.949> long<00:06:38.789> list<00:06:39.060> of
