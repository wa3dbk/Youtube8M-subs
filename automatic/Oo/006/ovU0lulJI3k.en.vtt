 District street Don difficult life is not 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.230
 simple children thanks in large part to this 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.510
 school boxing boys who are now with 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.470

 small halls here I am less she 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.340
 Convenience she so 2 balls probably 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.310

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.189
 workouts so she is born before 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.930

 hard everyday work 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.530
 but unlike many other species 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.849
 sport as strange as it may sound 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.430
 does the first place 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.639
 biomechanics from which it is impossible to become 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.169
 a good fighter with children of course much 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:25.209
 harder they work and mean how 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:28.310
 say psychological in general come 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.449
 movers want not fidgets 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.329
 general but with them of course harder to work 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:37.939
 they do not sit still, we look at it 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.379
 that let's say every child had 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.739
 slightly mobility of nerve processes 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.609
 that is, what a moving child means 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.260
 he already has the makings of boxing 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.260
 that child who is slow 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.180
 comes sleeping eyes you of course i 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.639
 nothing will come of it 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.370
 us today is a focused association 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.389
 coaches work in the same way 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.919

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.030
 junior school of olympic 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.840

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.900
 the neighborhood was directly 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.229
 Specialized Hall Boxing Hall Hall

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.470
 just today we will create an atmosphere 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:25.370
 which is 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.290
 will focus all areas of all our children 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.640
 direct gyms this is number one 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.640
 the challenge of our sports school 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.250
 old game between fighters 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.740
 held without gloves and different from 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.660
 the usual fight the presence of some rules 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.280
 which were first determined 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.200
 just before the fight 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.450
 they did not limit the duration 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.490
 a duel that always ended 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.250
 knockout besides punches 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.380
 elbow and head blows were allowed and you 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.810
 ranks and for us the rules of boxing appeared 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.810
 only in 1867 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.330
 many people ask such a question scary 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.710
 uncomfortable how it will affect health 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.030
