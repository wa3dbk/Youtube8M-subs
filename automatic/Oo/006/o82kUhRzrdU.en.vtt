00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
using icon packs sometimes I would go to

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.219 
using icon packs sometimes I would go to
my<00:03:56.909> phone<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.299> I'll<00:03:57.419> look<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.870> I'll<00:03:57.959> really

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
my phone and I'll look and I'll really

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.050 
my phone and I'll look and I'll really
have<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.590> study<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:59.129> know<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.549> figure<00:03:59.790> out

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
have to study you know to figure out

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.240 
have to study you know to figure out
which<00:04:00.590> application<00:04:01.590> I'm<00:04:01.709> looking<00:04:02.040> for

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
which application I'm looking for

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.780 
which application I'm looking for
because<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:03.090> icons<00:04:03.540> look<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:03.930> different<00:04:04.790> and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
because the icons look so different and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.490 
because the icons look so different and
it's<00:04:05.970> just<00:04:06.150> kind<00:04:06.359> of<00:04:06.479> it's<00:04:06.840> not<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.079> clear-cut

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
it's just kind of it's not a clear-cut

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.170 
it's just kind of it's not a clear-cut
design<00:04:08.099> in<00:04:08.280> terms<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.699> what<00:04:08.879> that<00:04:09.030> application

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
design in terms of what that application

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.710 
design in terms of what that application
is<00:04:09.840> at<00:04:10.139> least<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.799> me<00:04:10.949> but<00:04:11.940> with<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.269> icon

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
is at least to me but with this icon

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.170 
is at least to me but with this icon

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
here so that pretty much it blurs it by

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.590 
here so that pretty much it blurs it by
default<00:05:32.990> but<00:05:33.710> if<00:05:33.770> you<00:05:33.950> double<00:05:34.340> tap<00:05:34.370> it<00:05:34.790> it
