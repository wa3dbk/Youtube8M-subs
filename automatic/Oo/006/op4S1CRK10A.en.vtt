00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
talking about for a long time we said

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.639 
talking about for a long time we said
that<00:00:53.630> we<00:00:53.750> wouldn't<00:00:54.020> have<00:00:54.200> ground<00:00:54.469> deformation

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
that we wouldn't have ground deformation

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.950 
that we wouldn't have ground deformation
in<00:00:55.160> world<00:00:55.340> conflict<00:00:55.820> but<00:00:56.180> with<00:00:56.360> our<00:00:56.480> focus<00:00:56.750> on

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
in world conflict but with our focus on

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.110 
in world conflict but with our focus on
realistic<00:00:57.230> destruction<00:00:57.950> and<00:00:58.160> intensity<00:00:58.670> we

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
realistic destruction and intensity we

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.970 
realistic destruction and intensity we
eventually<00:00:59.360> decided<00:00:59.960> that<00:01:00.050> we<00:01:00.170> simply<00:01:00.530> had<00:01:00.770> to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
eventually decided that we simply had to

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.220 
eventually decided that we simply had to
add<00:01:01.129> some<00:01:01.460> real<00:01:01.640> damage<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.059> mother<00:01:02.390> earth

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
add some real damage to mother earth

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.149 

notice<00:01:10.960> how<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.109> ground<00:01:11.409> takes<00:01:11.679> just<00:01:11.890> as<00:01:12.009> much

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
notice how the ground takes just as much

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.969 
notice how the ground takes just as much
damage<00:01:12.340> as<00:01:12.729> everything<00:01:13.240> else<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.590> tanks<00:01:14.920> that

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
damage as everything else the tanks that

damage as everything else the tanks that
follow<00:01:15.310> will<00:01:15.520> now<00:01:15.640> have<00:01:15.789> to<00:01:15.909> drive<00:01:16.090> down<00:01:16.270> into

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
follow will now have to drive down into

follow will now have to drive down into
the<00:01:16.719> crater<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.320> then<00:01:17.469> up<00:01:17.649> again<00:01:17.890> on<00:01:18.039> the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
the crater and then up again on the

same way of course and there is no limit
to<00:01:22.030> how<00:01:22.090> much<00:01:22.240> deformation<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.869> can<00:01:23.049> add<00:01:23.170> in

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
to how much deformation you can add in
