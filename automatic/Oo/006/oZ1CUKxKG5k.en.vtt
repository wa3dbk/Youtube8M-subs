00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.250 
requesting this so here it is I'm gonna
start<00:00:15.179> by<00:00:15.299> breaking<00:00:15.630> them<00:00:15.719> down<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.900> little<00:00:16.049> bit

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
start by breaking them down a little bit

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.010 
start by breaking them down a little bit
this<00:00:16.619> primary<00:00:17.160> weapon<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:18.150> hand<00:00:18.420> cannon<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
this primary weapon is a hand cannon and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.359 
this primary weapon is a hand cannon and
you<00:00:19.170> see<00:00:19.350> me<00:00:19.470> charge<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:19.949> right<00:00:20.070> up<00:00:20.250> right

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
you see me charge it up right up right

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.769 
you see me charge it up right up right
there<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:20.910> see<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.300> affects<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
there and you can see it affects a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.720 
there and you can see it affects a
pretty<00:00:22.140> wide<00:00:22.410> area<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.100> charge<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
pretty wide area if you charge it up and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.439 
pretty wide area if you charge it up and
shoot<00:00:24.150> it

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
shoot it

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.960 
shoot it
it<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.230> pretty<00:00:25.590> slow<00:00:25.949> traveling<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.789> got

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
it is pretty slow traveling so you got

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.519 
it is pretty slow traveling so you got
to<00:00:27.060> really<00:00:27.180> time<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.660> out<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:27.930> your<00:00:28.080> targets

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
to really time it out with your targets

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
to really time it out with your targets
and<00:00:28.680> then<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.429> secondary<00:00:29.820> weapon<00:00:30.150> I'm<00:00:30.269> just

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
and then for secondary weapon I'm just

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.170 
and then for secondary weapon I'm just
using<00:00:30.660> heavy<00:00:31.320> machine<00:00:31.710> gun<00:00:31.859> right<00:00:32.009> now<00:00:32.180> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
using heavy machine gun right now and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.900 
using heavy machine gun right now and
for<00:00:33.960> his<00:00:34.050> primary<00:00:34.440> abilities<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.640> marked

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
for his primary abilities it's a marked

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.819 
for his primary abilities it's a marked
target<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.930> makes<00:00:37.170> sense<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.530> guess<00:00:37.680> since

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
target and it makes sense I guess since

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.880 
target and it makes sense I guess since
he's<00:00:37.920> an<00:00:38.100> assassin<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.670> market<00:00:39.000> targets<00:00:39.890> for

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and flak armor and for his ability the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.270 
and flak armor and for his ability the
secondary<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.500> I'm<00:00:46.620> using<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.129> grenade

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
secondary one I'm using the grenade

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.940

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
now it was kind of like the honeycomb

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
now it was kind of like the honeycomb
and<00:00:51.899> Street<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.559> although<00:00:53.280> that's<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and Street there although that's a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.000 
and Street there although that's a
pretty<00:00:53.850> good<00:00:54.170> secondary<00:00:55.170> ability<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.860> all

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
pretty good secondary ability for all

pretty good secondary ability for all
the<00:00:56.160> warriors<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.760> recommend<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.800> one<00:00:58.800> thing

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the warriors I recommend that one thing

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.830 
the warriors I recommend that one thing
that<00:00:59.100> he's<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.730> good<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.449> taking

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
damage and giving it out confuse the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
damage and giving it out confuse the
assassins<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:04.080> thing<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.470> he<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
assassins the one thing that he kind of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.490 
assassins the one thing that he kind of
hampers<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.600> mobility<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:07.170> didn't

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
hampers with is mobility they didn't

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.260 
hampers with is mobility they didn't
give<00:01:07.619> him<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.890> vehicle<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.520> Minnis<00:01:08.820> which<00:01:09.030> kind

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
give him a vehicle for Minnis which kind

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.730 
give him a vehicle for Minnis which kind
of<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.510> disappointing<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> me<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> cannot

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
of is disappointing to me so you cannot

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.310 
of is disappointing to me so you cannot
transform<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.600> you're<00:01:12.780> really<00:01:12.990> slow<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
transform and so you're really slow to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.570 
transform and so you're really slow to
get<00:01:13.500> around<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> map<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.100> got<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> lot

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
get around the map you got to do a lot

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
get around the map you got to do a lot
of<00:01:14.729> jumping<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.659> kind<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.140> gain<00:01:16.380> ground<00:01:16.590> with

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
of jumping to kind of gain ground with

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.830 
of jumping to kind of gain ground with
everybody<00:01:17.159> else<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.640> vehicles<00:01:18.090> but

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
everybody else going in vehicles but

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.780 
everybody else going in vehicles but
overall<00:01:19.200> he's<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> pretty<00:01:19.830> fun<00:01:20.040> player<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.580> play

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
overall he's a pretty fun player to play

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.469 
overall he's a pretty fun player to play
with<00:01:21.560> his<00:01:22.560> hand<00:01:22.830> cannon<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.400> alright<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> mean<00:01:24.270> I

machine gun but his hand cannon it can

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
machine gun but his hand cannon it can
be<00:01:28.470> devastating<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.579> some<00:01:29.850> good

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
just a little low on traveling so you're

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
just a little low on traveling so you're
gonna<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> deal<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.310> or<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.119> can

just shoot it rapidly like I just I'm
doing<00:01:38.549> there<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> works<00:01:39.210> pretty<00:01:39.299> well

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
doing there and that works pretty well

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.749 
doing there and that works pretty well
but<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.409> see<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> couldn't<00:01:41.369> turn<00:01:41.520> into<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
but you can see I couldn't turn into a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.399 
but you can see I couldn't turn into a
vehicle<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.390> couldn't<00:01:42.659> go<00:01:42.840> finish<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.290> guy

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
vehicle so I couldn't go finish that guy

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
vehicle so I couldn't go finish that guy
off<00:01:43.619> there<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:45.439> recommend<00:01:46.439> using<00:01:46.799> shockwave<00:01:47.520> in

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
off there I recommend using shockwave in

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.060 
off there I recommend using shockwave in
team<00:01:48.390> deathmatch<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.200> don't<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:49.860> recommend

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
team deathmatch I don't really recommend

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.460 
team deathmatch I don't really recommend
using<00:01:50.490> him<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.119> conquest<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.439> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
using him for conquest you have to be a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.770 
using him for conquest you have to be a
little<00:01:52.590> bit<00:01:52.710> more<00:01:52.860> mobile<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.670> conquest<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
little bit more mobile in conquest and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.899 
little bit more mobile in conquest and
since<00:01:55.229> he<00:01:55.290> doesn't<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> vehicle<00:01:55.890> form<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
since he doesn't have a vehicle form it

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.490 
since he doesn't have a vehicle form it
makes<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.360> lot<00:01:57.450> harder<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:57.960> around<00:01:58.049> I

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
makes it a lot harder to get around I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
makes it a lot harder to get around I
guess<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> could<00:01:59.520> use<00:01:59.670> him<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.060> kind<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.329> just

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
guess you could use him to kind of just

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.170 
guess you could use him to kind of just
sit<00:02:00.719> at<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.020> spot<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.710> conquest<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.549> you

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
sit at one spot and conquest but you

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.709 
sit at one spot and conquest but you
could<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.719> also<00:02:04.020> Megatron<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.310> warrior

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
could be also Megatron as a warrior

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.779 
could be also Megatron as a warrior
which<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.899> gives<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> tank<00:02:07.799> option<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.489> well

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
which it gives you a tank option as well

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.790 
which it gives you a tank option as well
so<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.030> maybe<00:02:09.270> recommend<00:02:09.780> him<00:02:10.020> less<00:02:10.530> for

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so I maybe recommend him less for

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.619 
so I maybe recommend him less for
conquest<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:12.000> he's<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.270> pretty<00:02:12.450> good<00:02:12.569> player

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
conquest but he's a pretty good player

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.990 
conquest but he's a pretty good player
for<00:02:12.989> team<00:02:13.140> deathmatch

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
for team deathmatch

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.479 
for team deathmatch
he's<00:02:15.000> strong<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.680> really<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.920> help<00:02:17.370> your

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
he's strong and really can help your

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.070 
he's strong and really can help your
teammates<00:02:17.819> out<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.239> mark<00:02:18.450> target<00:02:18.870> if

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080
