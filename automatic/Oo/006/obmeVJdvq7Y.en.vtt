this is an Android tablet the batteries
are<00:03:00.780> built-in<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.590> they<00:03:02.549> are<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:02.940> user

are built-in and they are not user
replaceable<00:03:04.080> there<00:03:04.620> might<00:03:04.739> be<00:03:04.769> some<00:03:05.040> way<00:03:05.190> to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
replaceable there might be some way to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.520 
replaceable there might be some way to
hack<00:03:05.580> into<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.330> unsolder<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.410> and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
hack into it and unsolder it and

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.410 
hack into it and unsolder it and
resolder<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.160> new<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:08.580> for<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.269> most

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
resolder the new one but for the most

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.360 
resolder the new one but for the most
part<00:03:09.510> they're<00:03:09.810> not<00:03:09.989> replaceable<00:03:10.380> this<00:03:11.010> one<00:03:11.220> is

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
part they're not replaceable this one is

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.789 
part they're not replaceable this one is
so<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:11.880> has<00:03:12.030> an<00:03:12.209> advantage<00:03:12.500> because<00:03:13.500> it

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
so this one has an advantage because it

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.000 
so this one has an advantage because it
has<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.130> rechargeable<00:03:14.730> batteries<00:03:15.620> as<00:03:16.620> far<00:03:16.890> as

even after I made the video was just

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.960 
even after I made the video was just
ridiculously<00:04:31.500> slow<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.520> couldn't<00:04:32.760> even

ridiculously slow and I couldn't even

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.390 
ridiculously slow and I couldn't even

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
stand using it the knobby when it

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.580
