they<00:03:54.470> didn't<00:03:54.680> have<00:03:54.800> a<00:03:54.830> battery<00:03:55.100> now<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.120> he

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
they didn't have a battery now that he

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.280 
they didn't have a battery now that he

electric<00:03:59.120> vehicle<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.630> big<00:03:59.930> problem<00:04:00.260> was

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
electric vehicle the big problem was

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.920 
electric vehicle the big problem was
they<00:04:00.500> don't<00:04:00.680> have<00:04:00.830> an<00:04:00.950> efficient

although most electric cars have no

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.030 
although most electric cars have no
tailpipe<00:04:04.680> because<00:04:05.680> they<00:04:05.800> don't<00:04:05.980> have

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
tailpipe because they don't have

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.340

emissions<00:04:06.580> from<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.910> vehicle<00:04:07.290> there's<00:04:08.290> a

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
emissions from the vehicle there's a

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.060 
emissions from the vehicle there's a

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the electricity to run the car so zero

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.310 
the electricity to run the car so zero
emission<00:04:20.170> is<00:04:20.350> a<00:04:20.859> little<00:04:21.790> bit<00:04:21.910> of<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.090> misnomer

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
emission is a little bit of a misnomer

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.980 
emission is a little bit of a misnomer
but<00:04:23.320> certainly<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.490> vehicle<00:04:25.000> itself<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.630> zero

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
but certainly the vehicle itself is zero

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.140 
but certainly the vehicle itself is zero
emission<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:26.620> it's<00:04:26.980> it's<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.430> step<00:04:27.700> along<00:04:27.880> the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
emission and it's it's a step along the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.970 
emission and it's it's a step along the
path<00:04:28.180> it's<00:04:28.690> kind<00:04:28.870> of<00:04:28.900> funny<00:04:29.080> helpful<00:04:29.410> for<00:04:29.560> well
