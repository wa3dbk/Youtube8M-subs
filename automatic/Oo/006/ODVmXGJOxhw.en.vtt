 one of them 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.660
 others look like another club 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.399

 a similar replacement in the city a lot 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.369
 something like cars are not leaders 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:25.419
 Austrian countries 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.119

 reported that a visit on a hillside moonstone 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.579

 at the meeting 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.120
 still the expedition of apollo nasa was 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.490
 well aware of

 in 1968 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.230
 nasa has published a list of mysterious 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.600

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.170
 the protocol is called chronologically

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.360
 among the five site 79 ty wagons of phenomena 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.350
 were called 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.380

 in electricity and figure 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.140
 still knowing craters and other observations are not

 on it is a bright star between people 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.739
 there was a real star 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.929
 this is a man 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.659
 less than two thousand years 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.659

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.849
 earlier law messaging 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.669
 about observations the opinion of hockey players more and more 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.279
 some

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.799
 with a request to send it for statistics 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.399

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.399
 power is not clear

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.849
 at the same time in different places

 sagging one then the other crater 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.889
 come to light and disappear without a trace 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.869
 some glowing spots 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:19.699
 now and then astronomers are watching them 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.199
 back from this kind of Russian verdict 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.969

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.549

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.349
 tailoring their love of money is out of the question 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.829
 since the same smart movies are exactly 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.659
 astronomers saw independently of 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.659

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.249

 flashed at the same time 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.969
 I photographed such an object and 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:53.389
 even wrote about it 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.429
 modern technical magazine 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.729
 it was about the same classic

 canada this figure in a luminous object 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.929
 was 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:04.439
 here 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.419
 I know that many colleagues saw something 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.829
 like 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.829
 nobody knows what it is 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.779

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.020
 nothing like that on the moon should be 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.629
 volcanic activity on them 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.960
 ended 2 billion years ago 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.770
 did not appear on the screen itself not 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.130
 quite different however he 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.330
 limited to first it would be 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.120
 order formed 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.789
 melting 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.979
 were also identified quite calmly 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.800
 crawled away here is this substance full 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.879
 there was no such surface 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.550
 would not be easy 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.520
 interpretation of observation here 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.500
 similar observations lie 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.650
 point of the bay 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.150
 it is very important to us 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.819
 but if not a goal of course that he 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.219
 but the lunar priest's husband bought 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.809
 it does not fit into today's scientific 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:27.330
 views changing cosmic 

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:28.839
 apparatus and allowed to get more 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.009
 detailed pictures of similar Pimen 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.789
 NASA experts carefully studied them 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.520
 to her 186 h 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.499
 after these anomalies and witnesses 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:42.580
 in identified 29 places 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.780
 at the place where women are now carriers 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.150
 anomalies appeared most clearly 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.499
 almost anyway 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.239
 in Moscow will take place in the salon on the spot stood 

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:56.919
 at 75 on alarming it would seem 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.789
 the situation was the flight of detention 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.479
 in the formed situation 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.770
 and not easy to satisfy 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.339
 scientific curiosity it means getting ahead 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:07.930
 fundamental rivals 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.770
 directions to get ahead on 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.639
 several decades 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:12.979
 seemed flying 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.689
 but the time has come to open which 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:16.490
 turn the worldview of all 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.849
 of humanity 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.300
 glory 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.779
 but something inexplicable was happening 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.239
 there was an impression that lunar customers 

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:26.949
 expeditions serious research 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.699
 no interest at all 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.599
 in this after completing lunar days 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.999
 experts admitted about it 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:36.229
 same regret spoke astronaut steel 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:36.960
 the message 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.919
 Russian scientists theologians 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.009
 being developed 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:44.770
 on its trust fund what was originally 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.039
 earlier 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.509
 military personnel 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.509
 training for the reason that 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.819
 there was a rivalry between the two 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.909
 largest countries has 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:58.309
 and in this race in this race of course 

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:01.309
 spent tremendous effort he served 

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:05.369
 it follows from the following meetings 

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:10.259
 if you do nothing 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:12.059
 in any case such a conclusion 

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:15.059
 pushed for many years 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.529
 all thursday 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:23.529
 lived at night 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:26.210
 after the first flights to the moon 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.580
 there was a feeling that the general public that 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.029
 it keeps back 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:32.939
 grounds for such suspicions were 

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:34.309
 every word of negotiation 

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:36.449
 astronaut with mission control center 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:38.199
 deserved seven o'clock not to love 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.619
 Elena heard a lot of interesting 

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:41.889
 for example last year
