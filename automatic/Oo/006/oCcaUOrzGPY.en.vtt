00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.060 
on a little bit so I've got this donkeys
on<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.140> leash

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
on the leash

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.279 
on the leash
it's<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> new<00:00:23.430> item<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.880> he's<00:00:24.750> kind<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.960> hanging

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
it's a new item and he's kind of hanging

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.620 
it's a new item and he's kind of hanging
from<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.760> some<00:00:27.000> water<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.449> glass

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
from it now I have some water and glass

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.009 
from it now I have some water and glass
under<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.230> because<00:00:28.380> sometimes<00:00:29.250> he<00:00:29.779> likes<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
under here because sometimes he likes to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.979 
under here because sometimes he likes to
just<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:31.800> gravity<00:00:32.219> he<00:00:32.790> likes<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.149> break<00:00:33.750> his

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
just from gravity he likes to break his

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.680 
just from gravity he likes to break his
leash<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> lock<00:00:36.180> stops<00:00:36.450> him<00:00:36.660> from

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
leash so so the lock stops him from

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
leash so so the lock stops him from
falling<00:00:37.050> too<00:00:37.170> far<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> water<00:00:37.890> prevents

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
falling too far and the water prevents

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.970 
falling too far and the water prevents
the<00:00:38.399> fall<00:00:38.550> damage<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.780> otherwise<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.680> goes<00:00:40.770> up

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
the fall damage but otherwise it goes up

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.740 
the fall damage but otherwise it goes up
and<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> normal<00:00:42.390> pinata

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
usually that would be controlled by a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.580 
usually that would be controlled by a
person<00:00:44.430> pulling<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.850> rope<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.329> down<00:00:45.590> but
