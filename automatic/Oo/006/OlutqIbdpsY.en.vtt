00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 I'm sick, but not for long. 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 I don't want to see leaves, hide those leaves. Hello. 

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:27.300
 Throw out mushrooms, mushrooms! 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.000
 I won't be here long. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 - Why didn't you tell me before? - That's not what I would say to everyone. 

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:41.000
 - As everyone, I'm your sister, you're crazy. - I'm going to die, and you're still calling me. 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.000
 Listen to me, I'm not gonna hold you here if it goes on like this. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.800
 I only work here the second day. 9 00: 00: 47,000 -&gt; 00: 00: 49,000 It's done, goodbye. 10 00: 00: 51,500 -&gt; 00: 00: 01,000 It's always been like this in Paris, constantly modernizing. Constant conflict of old and new. 

00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:03.000
 - I have become such a plague. - But not. 

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.500
 I'm in love, I feel like 15 years old. 

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:08.000
 Did you address her? 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.000
 Worse, I sent her a message. 

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:12.500
 I was impersonating a young guy. 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.000
 What did you write to her? 

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:20.000
 You are beautiful, I love you very much. 

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:22.500
 Doesn't it keep you alone? 

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:26.000
 I watch other people live. 

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.000
 - You think he's dating someone? - Possible. 

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.500
 - Why don't you go with anyone? - In my age? 

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:35.500
 You're 40 and you look good. 

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:38.000
 Use it. 

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.000
 - You're in love with Nicolas? - It does not matter. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.300
 - Being in love is beautiful. - Yes. 

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:46.500
 Yes. 

00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:50.000
 That's you. 

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:51.000
 You imagine something! 

00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:52.200
 You're in love. 

00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:57.000
 - What do you feel about her? - It is love. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.500
 - What will surprise me? - I'll dance for you. 

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.500
 - I completely forgot that it could be so nice. - That took so long? 

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.500
 Ah, very long ago, do you see the incomprehensible text on the table? The date is written inside. 

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:25.000
 It was in the Middle Ages. I have to look at my fossil bird to be sure. 

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:31.500
 - Miss. Do you like flowers? - Don't hit me. 

00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:35.000
 - Leave her alone, you have nothing else to do than to bother baby? - You're jealous. 

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:44.500
 - No, but I'd like to be like this girl. - You could sell anything to anyone, Mrs. Chatter. 

00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:46.300
 Do you want me to sell you something? 

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.000
 - You're here early, this morning 

00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:58.500
 - Are you sleepy? - Like you, what do you do then? 

00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:02.500
 - Is it true that Jesus doesn't exist? - Of course there is. 

00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:09.500
 - Do you see the Eiffel Tower there? - She comes with her sled to her and climbs after her. 

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:12.500
 These may be my last Christmas. 

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:17.500
 - Thank you. - Thank you too. 

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:24.500
 Do you go out with me for an hour and don't see me sick? 

00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:28.000
 I'll never be like you, normal guy. 

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:32.000
 What does a normal guy mean? 

00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:36.300
 None of them know their luck. 

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:40.500
 They walk, run, breathe. 

00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.500
 Live carefree in Paris. 

00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:49.000
 I'm a dad. 

00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:53.000
 I want to live. 

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.000
 Down, down, down. 

00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.000
 Arm, head, turn. ------------------------------ 1bd14c8d562a--
