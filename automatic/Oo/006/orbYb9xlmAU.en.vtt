hey guys what's up as you noticed I'm
back<00:00:08.950> in<00:00:09.100> the<00:00:09.160> lab<00:00:09.340> with<00:00:09.490> young<00:00:09.700> for<00:00:10.090> our<00:00:10.270> daily

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
back in the lab with young for our daily

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.480 
back in the lab with young for our daily
dose<00:00:10.900> of<00:00:11.080> young<00:00:11.260> we're<00:00:12.010> going<00:00:12.100> to<00:00:12.190> talk<00:00:12.369> about

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
dose of young we're going to talk about

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.670 
dose of young we're going to talk about
today<00:00:12.760> is<00:00:12.850> his<00:00:13.030> command<00:00:13.450> graph<00:00:13.680> obviously

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
today is his command graph obviously

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.160 
today is his command graph obviously
that's<00:00:14.949> how<00:00:15.100> it<00:00:15.219> looks<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:16.570> about<00:00:16.840> it's

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
that's how it looks it's about it's

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.630 
that's how it looks it's about it's
pretty<00:00:17.230> sliding<00:00:17.770> it's<00:00:17.890> ten<00:00:18.070> frames<00:00:18.400> in<00:00:18.520> AE

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
pretty sliding it's ten frames in AE

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.240 
pretty sliding it's ten frames in AE
2012<00:00:19.060> I<00:00:19.420> don't<00:00:19.570> really<00:00:19.690> remember<00:00:19.780> and<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.830> X<00:00:21.100> 1

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
2012 I don't really remember and the X 1

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.070 
2012 I don't really remember and the X 1
is<00:00:21.280> 7<00:00:21.490> which<00:00:21.880> is<00:00:21.910> pretty<00:00:22.210> slow<00:00:22.510> for<00:00:22.540> a<00:00:22.750> command

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
is 7 which is pretty slow for a command

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.080 
is 7 which is pretty slow for a command
grab<00:00:23.230> it's<00:00:23.830> not<00:00:23.980> hit<00:00:24.220> invincible<00:00:24.760> and<00:00:24.940> it's

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
grab it's not hit invincible and it's

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.780 
grab it's not hit invincible and it's
not<00:00:25.270> throw<00:00:25.510> invincible<00:00:26.160> which<00:00:27.160> means<00:00:27.460> you<00:00:27.640> can

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
not throw invincible which means you can

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.340 
not throw invincible which means you can
be<00:00:28.000> hit<00:00:28.240> out<00:00:28.360> of<00:00:28.390> it<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:28.840> you<00:00:28.930> can<00:00:29.050> be<00:00:29.170> thrown

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
be hit out of it and you can be thrown

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.720 
be hit out of it and you can be thrown
out<00:00:29.500> of<00:00:29.560> it<00:00:29.740> so<00:00:29.890> you<00:00:29.980> might<00:00:30.100> be<00:00:30.160> thinking<00:00:30.400> why

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
out of it so you might be thinking why

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.670 
out of it so you might be thinking why
would<00:00:30.910> I<00:00:30.940> use<00:00:31.090> a<00:00:31.120> slow<00:00:31.450> move<00:00:31.690> that<00:00:31.930> someone<00:00:32.529> can

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
would I use a slow move that someone can

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.010 
would I use a slow move that someone can
hit<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:32.980> throw<00:00:33.219> me<00:00:33.430> out<00:00:33.460> of<00:00:33.550> all<00:00:33.960> pretty<00:00:34.960> much

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
hit and throw me out of all pretty much

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.770 
hit and throw me out of all pretty much
because<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.760> get<00:00:36.909> you<00:00:37.089> can<00:00:37.210> get<00:00:37.329> good<00:00:37.449> damage

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
because you get you can get good damage

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.840 
because you get you can get good damage
off<00:00:37.929> it<00:00:38.109> if<00:00:38.230> it<00:00:38.350> lands<00:00:38.530> right<00:00:38.800> and<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.519> normal

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
off it if it lands right and the normal

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.829 
off it if it lands right and the normal
flow<00:00:39.969> me<00:00:40.120> does<00:00:40.269> one<00:00:40.480> time<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.489> yeah<00:00:45.269> why<00:00:46.269> do<00:00:46.390> 110

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
flow me does one time so yeah why do 110

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.529 
flow me does one time so yeah why do 110
damage<00:00:47.199> when<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:47.440> can<00:00:47.559> do<00:00:47.679> to<00:00:47.920> 10<00:00:48.100> right<00:00:48.539> how

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
damage when you can do to 10 right how

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.029 
damage when you can do to 10 right how
many<00:00:49.659> sound<00:00:49.899> take<00:00:50.109> a<00:00:50.140> good<00:00:50.289> philosophy<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.920> me

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
many sound take a good philosophy to me

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.459 
many sound take a good philosophy to me
anyway<00:00:51.999> so<00:00:52.269> when<00:00:52.539> when<00:00:52.929> do<00:00:53.019> you<00:00:53.109> use<00:00:53.260> this<00:00:53.409> you

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
anyway so when when do you use this you

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.079 
anyway so when when do you use this you
pretty<00:00:53.769> much<00:00:53.859> use<00:00:54.069> it<00:00:54.249> when<00:00:54.429> you<00:00:54.460> notice<00:00:54.819> your

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
pretty much use it when you notice your

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.579 
pretty much use it when you notice your
opponent<00:00:55.479> is<00:00:55.539> blocking<00:00:55.929> let's<00:00:56.199> say<00:00:56.289> you<00:00:56.350> do

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
opponent is blocking let's say you do

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.569 
opponent is blocking let's say you do
like<00:00:56.739> frame<00:00:57.039> traps<00:00:57.629> throughout<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.929> match

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
like frame traps throughout the match

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.559 
like frame traps throughout the match
like<00:01:00.579> that<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:01.059> obviously<00:01:01.210> he's<00:01:01.539> not

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
like that and obviously he's not

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.969 
like that and obviously he's not
blocking<00:01:01.899> but<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.120> a<00:01:04.150> frame<00:01:04.420> crab<00:01:04.979> don't

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
blocking but that is a frame crab don't

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.800 
blocking but that is a frame crab don't
like<00:01:06.100> that<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.580> you<00:01:06.970> notice<00:01:07.330> that<00:01:07.360> your

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
like that and you notice that your

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.840 
like that and you notice that your
opponent<00:01:08.080> gets<00:01:08.920> head<00:01:09.190> out<00:01:09.310> of<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.580> once<00:01:09.730> or

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
opponent gets head out of it once or

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.950 
opponent gets head out of it once or
twice<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.180> after<00:01:10.390> that<00:01:10.510> they<00:01:10.630> just<00:01:10.750> keep

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
twice and after that they just keep

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.440 
twice and after that they just keep
walking<00:01:11.440> so<00:01:12.040> then<00:01:12.280> instead<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.030> doing<00:01:13.360> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
walking so then instead of doing the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.970 
walking so then instead of doing the
frame<00:01:13.660> trap<00:01:13.870> you<00:01:14.020> wanna<00:01:14.260> just<00:01:14.470> come<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:14.800> grab

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
frame trap you wanna just come and grab

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.150 
frame trap you wanna just come and grab
if<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.760> know<00:01:15.880> if<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.060> kept<00:01:16.210> blocking<00:01:17.160> another

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
if you know if I kept blocking another

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.860 
if you know if I kept blocking another
time<00:01:18.400> i<00:01:18.430> like<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.820> use<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:19.270> after<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.600> safe

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
time i like to use it is after a safe

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.260 
time i like to use it is after a safe
jump<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:20.980> obviously<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:21.730> can't<00:01:21.910> save<00:01:22.090> em<00:01:22.120> for

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
jump so obviously you can't save em for

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.610 
jump so obviously you can't save em for
you<00:01:22.480> but<00:01:22.660> we're<00:01:22.780> using<00:01:22.900> him<00:01:23.140> as<00:01:23.170> an<00:01:23.350> example

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
you but we're using him as an example

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.130 
you but we're using him as an example
here<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.490> after<00:01:24.730> yun's<00:01:25.150> medium<00:01:25.570> kick<00:01:25.720> up<00:01:25.900> kicks

here so after yun's medium kick up kicks

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.130 
here so after yun's medium kick up kicks
if<00:01:26.650> you<00:01:26.860> do<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.390> neutral<00:01:28.390> jump<00:01:28.570> right<00:01:28.690> away<00:01:28.900> in<00:01:29.050> a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
if you do a neutral jump right away in a

if you do a neutral jump right away in a
medium<00:01:29.440> kick<00:01:29.620> or<00:01:29.830> pretty<00:01:30.340> much<00:01:30.430> any<00:01:31.290> jumping

medium kick or pretty much any jumping
attack<00:01:32.410> you<00:01:32.740> get<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.890> safe<00:01:33.100> jump<00:01:33.340> if<00:01:33.490> they<00:01:33.670> quick

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
attack you get a safe jump if they quick

almost like using the links into a
lookout<00:02:10.020> quit<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.979> command<00:02:11.370> grab<00:02:11.490> grab<00:02:11.700> some

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.040 
never seen someone mash out of it which
is<00:02:22.700> maybe<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.420> don't<00:02:24.720> people<00:02:24.870> just

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
is maybe you can but I don't people just

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.020 
is maybe you can but I don't people just
don't<00:02:25.320> do<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.500> unit<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.860> guess<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.760> that's<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
don't do this unit I guess so that's a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.310 
don't do this unit I guess so that's a
really<00:02:27.060> good<00:02:27.360> way<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.600> use<00:02:27.720> his<00:02:27.959> command<00:02:28.200> grab

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
really good way to use his command grab

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.050 
really good way to use his command grab
if<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.620> notice<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.220> save<00:02:29.459> jump<00:02:29.730> someone

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
if you notice that you save jump someone

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.110 
if you notice that you save jump someone
and<00:02:30.270> they<00:02:30.420> did<00:02:30.660> not<00:02:31.310> they<00:02:32.310> did<00:02:32.490> not<00:02:32.580> reversal

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
and they did not they did not reversal

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.330 
and they did not they did not reversal
you<00:02:33.410> can<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.530> come<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.800> got<00:02:34.980> them<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
you can you come and got them and the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.590 
you can you come and got them and the
thing<00:02:35.520> about<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.820> command<00:02:36.060> grab<00:02:36.240> is<00:02:36.390> if<00:02:36.510> you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
thing about the command grab is if you

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.260 
thing about the command grab is if you
look<00:02:36.750> at<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.790> inputs<00:02:38.790> right<00:02:38.970> there<00:02:39.150> on

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
look at the the inputs right there on

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.420 
look at the the inputs right there on
the<00:02:39.300> left<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:40.290> ends<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:40.680> back<00:02:40.950> which<00:02:41.280> is

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the left it ends with back which is

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.330 
the left it ends with back which is
blocked<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:41.880> let's<00:02:42.150> say<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.800> know<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.100> he

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
didn't press the kicks so you're still

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.840 
didn't press the kicks so you're still
blocking<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.739> wasn't<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:53.040> press<00:02:53.640> like

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
blocking I wasn't the press like

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.220 
blocking I wasn't the press like

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
so because the command grab ends with a

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.449 
so because the command grab ends with a
back<00:02:57.840> input<00:02:58.260> if<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.500> just<00:02:58.709> hold<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.070> for<00:02:59.280> like

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
you just hold it there and realize if

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.020 
you just hold it there and realize if
they<00:03:03.690> blocked<00:03:04.019> or<00:03:04.320> reversal<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.130> then<00:03:05.790> press

have<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> range<00:03:23.550> but<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.630> car<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.080> command

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
have a range but you can car the command

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.229 
have a range but you can car the command
goes<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:25.830> I'll<00:03:25.950> show<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.220> here<00:03:26.370> now<00:03:26.850> they're

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
goes so I'll show you here now they're

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.050 
goes so I'll show you here now they're

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
reached so how you Carter them if that's

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.670 
reached so how you Carter them if that's
the<00:03:30.300> normal<00:03:30.570> input<00:03:30.930> as<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.380> see<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.560> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
the normal input as you can see on the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.740 
the normal input as you can see on the
left<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.130> don't<00:03:32.970> know<00:03:33.030> why<00:03:33.120> I'm<00:03:33.239> pointing<00:03:33.420> at<00:03:33.660> it

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
left I don't know why I'm pointing at it

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.930 
left I don't know why I'm pointing at it
when<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.930> can't<00:03:34.110> see<00:03:34.290> me<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:35.489> if<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.760> just

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
that much right from here to Gary added

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.180 
that much right from here to Gary added
throw<00:04:16.419> range<00:04:16.660> which<00:04:16.840> is<00:04:16.959> really<00:04:17.109> good<00:04:17.320> i<00:04:17.560> like

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
throw range which is really good i like

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.550 
throw range which is really good i like
to<00:04:18.340> use<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.669> off<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:19.150> megan<00:04:19.419> punch<00:04:19.600> right<00:04:19.780> if

to use this off to megan punch right if

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.279 
to use this off to megan punch right if
you<00:04:20.680> press<00:04:20.889> to<00:04:21.039> meeting<00:04:21.310> punches<00:04:21.549> off<00:04:21.669> someone

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
you press to meeting punches off someone

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.980 
you press to meeting punches off someone
whether<00:04:23.289> they<00:04:23.470> hit<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.650> block<00:04:24.449> you<00:04:25.449> cannot<00:04:25.750> come

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
whether they hit a block you cannot come

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.360 
whether they hit a block you cannot come
and<00:04:26.139> grab<00:04:26.289> them<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:26.560> usually<00:04:26.830> people<00:04:27.100> want

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
and grab them and usually people want

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.469 
and grab them and usually people want
you<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.520> match<00:04:27.699> any<00:04:27.880> more<00:04:28.090> at<00:04:28.180> this<00:04:28.210> point

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
you to match any more at this point

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.820 
you to match any more at this point
because<00:04:28.570> you're<00:04:28.810> so<00:04:28.960> far<00:04:29.199> away<00:04:29.289> from<00:04:29.350> them<00:04:29.650> so

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
because you're so far away from them so

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.650 
because you're so far away from them so
why<00:04:30.070> mash<00:04:30.400> buttons<00:04:30.729> you<00:04:31.120> get<00:04:31.270> counter<00:04:31.539> here

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
why mash buttons you get counter here

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.930 
why mash buttons you get counter here
for<00:04:31.810> sure<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:34.510> actually<00:04:34.720> works<00:04:35.110> if<00:04:35.289> you<00:04:35.940> see

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
for sure so it actually works if you see

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.320 
for sure so it actually works if you see
it<00:04:37.030> doesn't<00:04:37.419> never<00:04:37.750> resist<00:04:38.199> and<00:04:39.210> we<00:04:40.210> you

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
it doesn't never resist and we you

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.029 
it doesn't never resist and we you
probably<00:04:40.630> won't<00:04:40.810> crowd<00:04:41.020> smash<00:04:41.350> captain<00:04:41.830> jab

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
probably won't crowd smash captain jab

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.670 
probably won't crowd smash captain jab
because<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:42.490> wouldn't<00:04:42.699> reach<00:04:42.850> either<00:04:43.680> see

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
because that wouldn't reach either see

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.580 
because that wouldn't reach either see
so<00:04:45.340> but<00:04:45.550> if<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.760> car<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:47.220> can<00:04:48.220> grab<00:04:48.430> them<00:04:49.590> but

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
so but if you car it can grab them but

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.830 
so but if you car it can grab them but
don't<00:04:50.740> do<00:04:50.889> two<00:04:51.099> quick<00:04:51.250> where<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.700> get<00:04:51.820> this

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
come and grab because it's also hard to

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.520 
come and grab because it's also hard to
mash<00:06:08.389> out<00:06:08.539> of<00:06:08.720> and<00:06:08.900> it<00:06:08.960> comes<00:06:09.139> out<00:06:09.260> fairly

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.379 
mash out of and it comes out fairly
quick<00:06:09.830> after<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.190> Box<00:06:10.430> done<00:06:10.700> you<00:06:11.210> don't

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
quick after the Box done you don't

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.330 
quick after the Box done you don't
cancel<00:06:11.599> it<00:06:11.870> obviously<00:06:12.229> because<00:06:12.740> then<00:06:13.010> you<00:06:13.130> get

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
cancel it obviously because then you get

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:20.040 
cancel it obviously because then you get
this<00:06:13.550> and<00:06:13.820> you<00:06:13.940> can<00:06:18.099> see<00:06:19.099> how<00:06:19.130> we<00:06:19.310> just<00:06:19.520> wish

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
this and you can see how we just wish

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.920 
this and you can see how we just wish
but<00:06:21.050> you<00:06:21.139> do<00:06:21.289> it<00:06:21.380> right<00:06:22.160> after<00:06:22.550> it<00:06:23.120> connects

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
but you do it right after it connects

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.950 
but you do it right after it connects
and<00:06:24.169> it's<00:06:24.289> really<00:06:24.620> hard<00:06:25.430> to<00:06:25.700> mash<00:06:26.060> out

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
and it's really hard to mash out

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.210 
and it's really hard to mash out
so<00:06:28.960> that's<00:06:29.320> another<00:06:29.500> good<00:06:29.650> reason<00:06:29.680> so<00:06:29.920> let's

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
so that's another good reason so let's

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.610 
so that's another good reason so let's
say<00:06:30.310> I<00:06:30.400> do<00:06:30.460> that<00:06:30.730> if<00:06:31.030> you<00:06:31.570> do<00:06:31.780> to<00:06:32.110> crouching
