00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
contribute to their melodies and so in

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.889 
contribute to their melodies and so in
practice<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.670> means<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> shields<00:00:48.750> are

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
practice that means that the shields are

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.160 
practice that means that the shields are
only<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:50.390> reducing<00:00:51.390> base<00:00:51.660> damage

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
only there for reducing base damage

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.810 
only there for reducing base damage
against<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> unit<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.050> terrible

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
against the unit and that is terrible

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.750 
against the unit and that is terrible
these<00:00:56.820> units<00:00:57.210> or<00:00:57.449> shock<00:00:58.079> units<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.680> my<00:00:59.340> opinion

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
these units or shock units in my opinion

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.020 
these units or shock units in my opinion
they<00:00:59.910> should<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.690> Francey<00:01:01.170> trait<00:01:02.030> makes

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
they should get the Francey trait makes

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.820 
they should get the Francey trait makes
absolutely<00:01:03.510> no<00:01:03.600> sense<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:04.170> units<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> are

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
absolutely no sense that units that are

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.910 
absolutely no sense that units that are
pure<00:01:05.100> shock<00:01:05.489> units<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.630> 200<00:01:07.200> weapons<00:01:07.530> that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
pure shock units with 200 weapons that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
pure shock units with 200 weapons that
live<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.369> die<00:01:08.460> by<00:01:08.670> their<00:01:08.850> charge<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.570> have

due to their shields it could probably

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.780 
due to their shields it could probably
be<00:01:21.450> 15<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.140> well<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.890> unbalanced<00:01:23.580> or

be 15 as well and not be unbalanced or

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.120 
be 15 as well and not be unbalanced or
too<00:01:23.970> much<00:01:24.150> because<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.470> imagine<00:01:25.680> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
too much because if you imagine that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.950 
too much because if you imagine that

would<00:01:41.880> still<00:01:42.509> mean<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.290> a

would still mean that they would have a
low<00:01:43.560> melee<00:01:43.799> defense<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.399> they<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.820> wouldn't

low melee defense but they just wouldn't

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.569 
low melee defense but they just wouldn't

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.420

as<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.180> shock<00:01:57.750> unit<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:58.740> also<00:01:58.950> give

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
as a shock unit but it will also give

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.609 
as a shock unit but it will also give
them<00:01:59.640> some<00:01:59.880> much-needed<00:02:00.619> survivability

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
them some much-needed survivability

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.499 
them some much-needed survivability
because<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> attrition<00:02:02.460> Kingdom<00:02:02.850> really

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
because the attrition Kingdom really

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.630

lacks<00:02:04.079> survivability<00:02:04.829> they<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
mercenary appetizer but I think just

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.969 
mercenary appetizer but I think just
adding<00:02:09.899> mercenary<00:02:10.379> hopper<00:02:10.619> ties<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
adding mercenary hopper ties is a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.850 
adding mercenary hopper ties is a
mistake<00:02:11.510> they<00:02:12.510> should<00:02:12.750> instead<00:02:13.290> look<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
mistake they should instead look to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.700

lack of attention in in my opinion and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.510 
lack of attention in in my opinion and
while<00:03:15.450> we're<00:03:15.690> at<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.320> room<00:03:16.440> fire<00:03:16.650> should

the Thracian warriors bit stronger

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.000 
the Thracian warriors bit stronger
without<00:03:33.959> making<00:03:34.470> them<00:03:34.590> completely

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
without making them completely

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.670 
without making them completely
overpowered<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.720> I'll<00:03:36.810> do<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.140> same<00:03:37.350> for

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
overpowered and I'll do the same for
