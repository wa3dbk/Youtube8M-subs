moment there in the designer window I'm
going<00:01:49.359> to<00:01:49.420> use<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.750> additional<00:01:50.200> settings

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
stand out a little bit more so I'm going

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.490 
stand out a little bit more so I'm going
to<00:02:15.250> use<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.580> outline<00:02:16.210> fill<00:02:16.630> option<00:02:17.290> at<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
to use this outline fill option at the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.440 
to use this outline fill option at the
bottom<00:02:17.770> there<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.520> really<00:02:18.790> make<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> text

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
bottom there to really make the text

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.900 
bottom there to really make the text
stand<00:02:19.690> out<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.260> I'm<00:02:21.250> just<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.610> change

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
could perhaps increase the line width to

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.690 
could perhaps increase the line width to
make<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.409> stand<00:02:32.650> out<00:02:32.860> even<00:02:32.890> more<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.489> looks

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
and now what I'm gonna do just to sort

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.250 
and now what I'm gonna do just to sort
of<00:02:36.489> make<00:02:37.030> things<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.329> bit<00:02:37.359> more<00:02:37.540> interesting<00:02:37.930> to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
of make things a bit more interesting to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.050 
of make things a bit more interesting to
jazz<00:02:38.530> things<00:02:38.560> up<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:39.010> little<00:02:39.099> bit<00:02:39.250> I'm<00:02:39.549> going<00:02:39.969> to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
jazz things up a little bit I'm going to

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.869 
jazz things up a little bit I'm going to
add<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> shape<00:02:41.049> into<00:02:41.469> our<00:02:41.590> design<00:02:41.920> here<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.430> I'm

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
add a shape into our design here and I'm

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.750 
add a shape into our design here and I'm
gonna<00:02:42.969> use<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.239> filled<00:02:44.049> circle<00:02:44.890> shape<00:02:45.189> so<00:02:45.730> I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
gonna use a filled circle shape so I

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.690 
gonna use a filled circle shape so I
just<00:02:46.000> click<00:02:46.299> my<00:02:46.480> filled<00:02:46.719> circle<00:02:47.170> shape<00:02:47.409> and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
just click my filled circle shape and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.039 
just click my filled circle shape and
then<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.879> just<00:02:49.209> draw<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.989> shape<00:02:51.900> roughly<00:02:52.900> where

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
then I just draw a shape roughly where

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.929 
then I just draw a shape roughly where
I'd<00:02:53.200> like<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:53.409> to<00:02:53.680> appear<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.639> design

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
I'd like it to appear in the design

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.179 
I'd like it to appear in the design
window<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.359> again<00:02:55.599> because<00:02:56.379> by<00:02:56.560> default<00:02:56.620> it's

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
window and again because by default it's

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.069 
window and again because by default it's
white<00:02:57.459> I'm<00:02:57.639> gonna<00:02:57.819> change<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.420> color<00:02:58.719> let's

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
white I'm gonna change that color let's

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.750 
white I'm gonna change that color let's
make<00:02:59.620> this<00:03:00.569> sort<00:03:01.569> of<00:03:01.629> ready<00:03:01.870> brown<00:03:02.200> color

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
make this sort of ready brown color

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.190 
make this sort of ready brown color
which<00:03:03.760> looks<00:03:03.969> nice<00:03:04.180> but<00:03:04.480> obviously<00:03:04.930> I'm<00:03:05.049> going

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
which looks nice but obviously I'm going

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.409 
which looks nice but obviously I'm going
to<00:03:05.260> need<00:03:05.409> to<00:03:05.500> move<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:06.069> shape<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.909> layer

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
to need to move that shape that layer

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.809 
to need to move that shape that layer
behind<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.349> text<00:03:08.769> that<00:03:08.889> we<00:03:09.010> created<00:03:09.340> first

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
behind the text that we created first

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.690 
behind the text that we created first
so<00:03:10.450> with<00:03:10.989> this<00:03:11.169> layer<00:03:11.439> still<00:03:11.859> selected<00:03:11.889> and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
so with this layer still selected and

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.909 
so with this layer still selected and
you<00:03:13.359> can<00:03:13.510> tell<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.139> selected<00:03:14.590> by<00:03:14.709> that

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
you can tell that it's selected by that

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.759 
you can tell that it's selected by that
dotted<00:03:15.370> black<00:03:15.849> line<00:03:16.019> around<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.260> edges<00:03:17.739> of

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
dotted black line around the edges of

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.369 
dotted black line around the edges of
the<00:03:18.040> object<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.819> we've<00:03:19.000> inserted<00:03:19.329> I'm<00:03:20.169> going

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
the object that we've inserted I'm going

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.890 
the object that we've inserted I'm going
to<00:03:20.500> use<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.950> Toback<00:03:21.760> button<00:03:22.239> over<00:03:22.629> here<00:03:22.659> on

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
to use the Toback button over here on

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.039 
to use the Toback button over here on
the<00:03:22.989> right<00:03:23.109> hand<00:03:23.139> side<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:24.930> clicking<00:03:25.930> that's

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
the right hand side and clicking that's

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.649 
the right hand side and clicking that's
going<00:03:26.349> to<00:03:26.409> move<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.919> back<00:03:27.239> right<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.389> the<00:03:28.510> back

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
going to move it back right to the back

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.959 
going to move it back right to the back
of<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.049> layers<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:29.889> we've<00:03:30.040> inserted<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:30.700> far

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:30.969 
of the layers that we've inserted so far

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.509 
of the layers that we've inserted so far
as<00:03:31.180> as<00:03:31.659> you<00:03:31.840> can<00:03:31.989> see<00:03:32.230> it's<00:03:32.859> nice<00:03:33.159> and<00:03:33.189> neatly

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
as as you can see it's nice and neatly

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.420 
as as you can see it's nice and neatly
behind<00:03:33.849> our<00:03:34.000> text<00:03:34.530> I'm<00:03:35.530> also<00:03:35.739> now<00:03:36.069> going<00:03:36.250> to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
behind our text I'm also now going to

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.759 
behind our text I'm also now going to
use<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.819> cursor<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.689> arrow<00:03:37.900> keys<00:03:38.379> on<00:03:38.409> my

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
use the cursor the arrow keys on my

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.729 
use the cursor the arrow keys on my
keyboard<00:03:39.239> just<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.449> position<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:41.440> exactly

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
keyboard just to position it exactly

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.059 
keyboard just to position it exactly
where<00:03:42.579> I'd<00:03:42.729> like<00:03:42.909> it<00:03:43.150> for<00:03:43.329> now<00:03:43.479> and<00:03:44.069> by

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
where I'd like it for now and by

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.339 
where I'd like it for now and by
clicking<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.819> dragging<00:03:45.849> on<00:03:46.419> an<00:03:46.870> element<00:03:47.229> on

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
clicking and dragging on an element on

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.589 
clicking and dragging on an element on
the<00:03:47.560> design<00:03:48.099> window<00:03:48.310> area<00:03:48.639> as<00:03:48.940> well<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.449> course

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
the design window area as well of course

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.189 
the design window area as well of course
we<00:03:49.959> can<00:03:50.139> move<00:03:50.590> layers<00:03:50.889> in<00:03:51.129> that<00:03:51.159> way<00:03:51.430> too<00:03:52.199> that

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
we can move layers in that way too that

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.750 
we can move layers in that way too that
looks<00:03:53.379> great<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:53.919> what<00:03:54.099> I'm<00:03:54.189> going<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.370> do<00:03:54.549> now

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
looks great but what I'm going to do now

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.270 
looks great but what I'm going to do now
just<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.209> blend<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.290> shape<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.949> which<00:03:57.129> I've

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
just to blend that shape in which I've

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.309 
just to blend that shape in which I've
now<00:03:57.400> selected<00:03:57.459> again<00:03:58.090> into<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.079> actual

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
now selected again into the actual

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.259 
now selected again into the actual
overall<00:03:59.590> design<00:04:00.010> I'm<00:04:00.459> going<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.879> use<00:04:01.060> the

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
overall design I'm going to use the

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.330 
overall design I'm going to use the
transparency<00:04:02.109> feature<00:04:02.530> which<00:04:02.949> if<00:04:03.099> I<00:04:03.189> just

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
transparency feature which if I just

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.580 
transparency feature which if I just
click<00:04:03.699> it<00:04:03.849> a<00:04:03.939> few<00:04:04.150> times<00:04:04.419> increase<00:04:05.379> the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
click it a few times increase the

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.800 
click it a few times increase the
transparency<00:04:05.829> effect<00:04:06.639> you<00:04:06.939> can<00:04:07.090> start<00:04:07.419> to<00:04:07.599> see

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
transparency effect you can start to see

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.170 
transparency effect you can start to see
the<00:04:07.989> image<00:04:08.319> behind<00:04:08.639> showing<00:04:09.639> through<00:04:09.970> that

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
the image behind showing through that

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.449 
the image behind showing through that
circle<00:04:10.689> shape<00:04:10.930> which<00:04:11.560> just<00:04:11.859> makes<00:04:12.069> it<00:04:12.220> look<00:04:12.370> a

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
circle shape which just makes it look a

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.610 
circle shape which just makes it look a
little<00:04:12.579> bit<00:04:12.759> more<00:04:12.909> professional<00:04:13.439> blends<00:04:14.439> it

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
little bit more professional blends it

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.199 
little bit more professional blends it
in<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.829> little<00:04:15.040> bit<00:04:15.159> more<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.579> design<00:04:15.909> and

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
in a little bit more to the design and

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.680 
in a little bit more to the design and
there<00:04:16.810> we<00:04:16.900> go<00:04:17.049> it's<00:04:17.169> coming<00:04:17.680> together<00:04:17.799> now

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
there we go it's coming together now

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.999 
there we go it's coming together now
finally<00:04:19.690> just<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.959> show<00:04:20.139> you<00:04:20.199> how<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.380> image

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
finally just to show you how the image

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.920 
finally just to show you how the image
tool<00:04:21.310> works<00:04:21.609> over<00:04:22.090> here<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.479> image<00:04:22.690> button

tool works over here the image button

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.320 
tool works over here the image button
I'm<00:04:23.380> going<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.889> insert<00:04:24.490> an<00:04:24.669> image<00:04:24.699> from<00:04:25.150> my

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
I'm going to insert an image from my

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.540 
I'm going to insert an image from my
hard<00:04:25.539> drive<00:04:25.810> I'm<00:04:26.259> just<00:04:26.770> going<00:04:26.949> to<00:04:27.039> select<00:04:27.250> a

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
hard drive I'm just going to select a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.460 
hard drive I'm just going to select a
pair<00:04:27.729> of<00:04:27.759> scissors<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.389> I<00:04:28.419> have<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:28.870> my<00:04:29.259> hard

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
pair of scissors that I have on my hard

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.680 
pair of scissors that I have on my hard
drive<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:29.889> in<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.669> same<00:04:30.909> way<00:04:31.120> we<00:04:31.300> can<00:04:31.449> click

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
drive and in the same way we can click

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.899 
drive and in the same way we can click
and<00:04:31.750> move<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.349> image<00:04:32.710> around<00:04:33.310> our<00:04:33.550> design

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
and move that image around our design

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.010 
and move that image around our design
I'm<00:04:34.900> also<00:04:35.440> going<00:04:35.979> to<00:04:36.070> use<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.759> rotate<00:04:37.240> tool<00:04:37.479> up

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
I'm also going to use the rotate tool up

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.520 
I'm also going to use the rotate tool up
here<00:04:38.620> in<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:39.130> menu<00:04:39.810> rotate<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:41.020> clockwise<00:04:41.169> and

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
here in the menu rotate it clockwise and

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.769 
here in the menu rotate it clockwise and
can<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:41.919> see<00:04:42.130> there's<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.400> hotkey<00:04:42.639> there<00:04:43.120> ctrl

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:43.779 
can you see there's a hotkey there ctrl

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.990 
can you see there's a hotkey there ctrl
W<00:04:43.960> most<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.710> tools<00:04:44.950> here<00:04:45.250> also<00:04:45.400> have<00:04:45.789> hot

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
W most of the tools here also have hot

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.399 
W most of the tools here also have hot
keys<00:04:46.240> so<00:04:46.450> you<00:04:46.479> can<00:04:46.599> short

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
keys so you can short

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.529 
keys so you can short
the<00:04:47.469> process<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.860> little<00:04:48.009> bit<00:04:48.309> I'm<00:04:49.059> just<00:04:49.179> going

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
the process a little bit I'm just going

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.070 
the process a little bit I'm just going
to<00:04:49.779> rotate<00:04:50.559> it<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:51.219> couple<00:04:51.610> of<00:04:51.699> times<00:04:51.939> just<00:04:52.269> to

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
to rotate it a couple of times just to

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.129 
to rotate it a couple of times just to
fit<00:04:53.469> my<00:04:53.619> design<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:53.949> little<00:04:54.309> better<00:04:55.139> now

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
fit my design a little better now

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.409 
fit my design a little better now
obviously<00:04:56.649> what<00:04:56.830> we<00:04:56.919> need<00:04:57.069> to<00:04:57.159> do<00:04:57.339> is<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:58.119> put

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
obviously what we need to do is to put

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.239 
obviously what we need to do is to put
it<00:04:58.539> behind<00:04:58.689> our<00:04:59.050> text<00:04:59.589> because<00:05:00.009> at<00:05:00.129> the<00:05:00.219> moment

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:00.249 
it behind our text because at the moment

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:03.809 
it behind our text because at the moment
it's<00:05:00.729> confusing<00:05:01.719> the<00:05:01.899> text<00:05:02.529> element<00:05:02.649> there<00:05:03.039> so

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
it's confusing the text element there so

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.199 
it's confusing the text element there so
I'm<00:05:04.089> going<00:05:04.449> to<00:05:04.889> use<00:05:05.889> the<00:05:06.189> two<00:05:06.519> back<00:05:06.849> feature

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:07.209 
I'm going to use the two back feature

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:11.909 
I'm going to use the two back feature
and<00:05:08.399> then<00:05:09.399> select<00:05:10.119> my<00:05:10.389> circle<00:05:10.989> and<00:05:11.110> send<00:05:11.739> that

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
and then select my circle and send that

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.139 
and then select my circle and send that
right<00:05:12.159> to<00:05:12.309> the<00:05:12.399> back<00:05:12.519> as<00:05:12.669> well<00:05:12.789> there<00:05:13.119> is

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:13.149 
right to the back as well there is

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:14.609 
right to the back as well there is
another<00:05:13.269> way<00:05:13.719> that<00:05:13.749> you<00:05:13.959> can<00:05:14.110> do<00:05:14.259> that<00:05:14.439> by

00:05:14.609 --> 00:05:14.619 
another way that you can do that by

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:16.139 
another way that you can do that by
holding<00:05:14.949> the<00:05:15.039> shift<00:05:15.249> key<00:05:15.369> to<00:05:15.610> send<00:05:15.819> it<00:05:15.969> one

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:16.149 
holding the shift key to send it one

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.359 
holding the shift key to send it one
layer<00:05:16.389> back<00:05:16.659> at<00:05:16.809> a<00:05:16.899> time<00:05:17.139> but<00:05:17.529> just<00:05:17.739> to<00:05:17.889> keep<00:05:18.219> it

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:18.369 
layer back at a time but just to keep it

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.069 
layer back at a time but just to keep it
simple<00:05:18.580> I've<00:05:18.939> used<00:05:19.179> the<00:05:19.360> two<00:05:19.599> back<00:05:19.749> button

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:20.079
