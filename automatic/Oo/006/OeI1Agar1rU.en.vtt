 plastic surgery between 2002 and 2004 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.040
 very good doctor pacheco what is the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.629
 trick that you use so that the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.180
 facial rejuvenation that makes 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.190
 longer time detail 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.500
 technical I learned a few years ago 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.409
 in the aesthetic surgery clinic of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.250
 doctor thomas reese and ashton is the 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.320
 rise of the muscles and especially of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.390
 that white capital that covers the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.659
 muscles that is called fascia with a 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.460
 non-absorbable material and of course 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.799
 it's more durable and that's how it's going to 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.140
 guarantee that the result I get 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.680
 after the surgery is going to keep 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.750
 in time 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.480
 It's a technical trick that has given me 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.580
 very good result doctor pacheco who has 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.230
 fact that facial rejuvenation is 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.720
 one of the processes that you most 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.870
 performed during the good year in first 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.820
 place for the results since the 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.400
 technique that has been modified has 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.430
 produced some results with some 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.050
 smaller scars more hidden 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.840
 with handling or treatment of the skin 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.619
 management and treatment of muscles and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.940
 of tone and skin quality that makes 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.440
 that with tricks that one is learning to 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.710
 as years go by and the 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.240
 procedures that makes the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.300
 procedure the result is long 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.670
 term then that likes a lot 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.920
 patient that is something stable that is not 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.350
 so notorious that the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.320
 change that is a common changes more 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.230
 natural to make her see more 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.000
 young but not with amazing changes 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.840
 doctor pacheco what are the changes 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.360
 most notorious 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 which can sense when the patient 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.230
 The procedure has finished 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.540
 changes that most excite the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.330
 patient after this surgery is that 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.420
 not only does he look younger, but he 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.569
 feel younger because he has lost his 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.750
 wrinkles signs that increase the years 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.489
 it is sought that in addition to eliminating 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.430
 wrinkles improve the quality of the skin 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:49.000
 usb the youngest woman with the best kind of 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.040
 skin and without the signs that reveal the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.500
 surgery because it's the scars that 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.870
 they are very small and they are very 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.239
 hidden hospitalization depends 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.610
 a lot of if that procedure is done 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.430
 alone or is accompanied by another 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.560
 example if the single procedure 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.269
 surgery for rejuvenation 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.769
 it lasts about four hours four 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.049
 hours and a half does not require 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.750
 hospitalization but if at the same time it is done 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.030
 some breast or abdomen surgery 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.829
 then it is going to lengthen the time 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.140
 that that already determines what is 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.510
 convenient for more security to 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.430
 the patient who stays hospitalized 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.790
 where will you have more control a 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.610
 better control of nursing of doctors 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.710
 that make her that 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.870
 the postoperative recovery 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.510
 sure good call then we're going 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.910

 the good surgery this patient went to 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.220
 me so that it will improve the crease this 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.170
 which is called nasogenian because the nose 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.360
 it's the cheek and the neck 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.140
