this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.469> video<00:00:01.650> by<00:00:01.890> rich<00:00:02.100> pin<00:00:02.340> today<00:00:02.550> we're

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
this is a video by rich pin today we're

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.740 
this is a video by rich pin today we're
working<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.659> automotive<00:00:04.440> a/c<00:00:04.830> condenser

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
working on a automotive a/c condenser

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.560 
working on a automotive a/c condenser
that's<00:00:06.750> what<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.080> piece<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.620> right<00:00:07.890> here<00:00:08.570> one

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
that's what this piece is right here one

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.510 
that's what this piece is right here one
of<00:00:09.630> its<00:00:09.840> main<00:00:10.110> jobs<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.540> to<00:00:13.040> disperse<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:15.030> heat

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
of its main jobs is to disperse the heat

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.870 
of its main jobs is to disperse the heat
that<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.810> refrigerant<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.880> disperse

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that is in the refrigerant and disperse

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.500 
that is in the refrigerant and disperse
that<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.710> refrigerant<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.939> go<00:00:24.119> back

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
that so the refrigerant can go back

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.370 
that so the refrigerant can go back
inside<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:26.189> car<00:00:26.789> where<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> evaporator<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
inside the car where the evaporator is

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.179 
inside the car where the evaporator is
so<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.099> wick<00:00:29.369> more<00:00:30.210> heat<00:00:30.539> from<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.800> car

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
so it can wick more heat from the car

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.180 
so it can wick more heat from the car
then<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.790> comes<00:00:33.090> back<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.540> transfers<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.190> back

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
then it comes back and transfers it back

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.110 
then it comes back and transfers it back
into<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.730> condenser<00:00:37.850> what<00:00:38.850> we're<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
into the condenser what we're going to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.470 
into the condenser what we're going to
do<00:00:39.270> today<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:40.219> we're<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.480> disassemble

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
do today is we're going to disassemble

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.400 
do today is we're going to disassemble
this<00:00:43.140> piece<00:00:43.500> right<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.450> this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.930> dryer

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
this piece right here this is the dryer

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.180 
this piece right here this is the dryer
and<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:49.410> dryers<00:00:49.890> job<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.719> make<00:00:51.960> sure<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and the dryers job is to make sure that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.590 
and the dryers job is to make sure that
there<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.520> no<00:00:53.750> moisture<00:00:55.370> inside<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
there is no moisture inside the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.619 
there is no moisture inside the
refrigerant<00:00:57.600> that's<00:00:58.140> inside<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.980> AC<00:00:59.969> system

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
refrigerant that's inside the AC system

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.630 
refrigerant that's inside the AC system
if<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.460> moisture<00:01:02.760> inside<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> system

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
if you have moisture inside the system

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.679 
if you have moisture inside the system
that<00:01:05.640> moisture<00:01:06.770> what<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:09.570> will

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that moisture what it will do is it will

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.980 
that moisture what it will do is it will
turn<00:01:10.110> into<00:01:10.229> acid<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> course<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.630> acid

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
turn into acid and of course the acid

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.990 
turn into acid and of course the acid
would<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.170> bad<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> system<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.880> we're

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
would be bad for the system so we're

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630 
would be bad for the system so we're
going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> take<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> pot<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:17.040> take<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
going to take a pot this and just take a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.490 
going to take a pot this and just take a
look<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.119> see<00:01:18.750> what<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> dryer<00:01:19.170> looks<00:01:19.470> like

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
look and see what the dryer looks like

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.010 
look and see what the dryer looks like
now<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.540> cut<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.720> end

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
now what I'm going to do is cut this end

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:41.020 
now what I'm going to do is cut this end

well I see we have a little burr right
here<00:03:16.599> with<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.810> hacksaw<00:03:17.379> went<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:19.900> need<00:03:20.110> to

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
here with a hacksaw went so we need to

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.100 
here with a hacksaw went so we need to
deburr<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.340> first<00:03:21.819> okay

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110

00:03:44.680 --> 00:04:19.409 
get something to catch that little
pellets<00:03:47.549> can<00:03:48.549> you<00:03:48.670> see<00:03:48.909> that<00:04:11.549> look<00:04:12.549> at<00:04:12.730> that

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:28.490 

there's<00:04:19.959> nothing<00:04:20.319> in<00:04:20.469> there

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:40.330 

the<00:04:29.570> pellets<00:04:32.600> if<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:33.780> can<00:04:33.990> see<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.320> out<00:04:34.590> there

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.300 

this<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:42.050> absorbent<00:04:43.160> material<00:04:44.960> that

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
this is the absorbent material that

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.870 
this is the absorbent material that
absorbs<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.910> moisture<00:04:50.480> pretty<00:04:51.480> ingenious

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
absorbs the moisture pretty ingenious

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.200 
absorbs the moisture pretty ingenious
the<00:04:53.880> little<00:04:54.120> pellets<00:04:55.670> were<00:04:56.670> right<00:04:57.000> between

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
the little pellets were right between

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.180 
the little pellets were right between
these<00:04:57.660> discs<00:04:58.230> right<00:04:58.410> here<00:04:59.150> and<00:05:00.150> we<00:05:00.270> got<00:05:00.390> little

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
these discs right here and we got little

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.100 
these discs right here and we got little
little<00:05:02.190> felt<00:05:02.660> pads<00:05:04.100> and<00:05:05.600> that's<00:05:06.600> where<00:05:06.870> they

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
little felt pads and that's where they

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.270 
little felt pads and that's where they
Oh<00:05:11.390> absorbent<00:05:12.390> beads<00:05:12.660> were<00:05:13.010> right<00:05:14.010> in<00:05:14.160> this

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
Oh absorbent beads were right in this

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.200 
Oh absorbent beads were right in this
