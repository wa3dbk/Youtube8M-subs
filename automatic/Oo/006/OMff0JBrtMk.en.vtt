 firefighter mühlacker on the spot against the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.230
 water masses are struggling in the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:32.400
 Fire station in chord of sandbags 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:35.069

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.500
 Saturdays rainfalls mean for the 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.269
 Volunteer Fire Department Mühlacker 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.510

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.030
 raising all available 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.230
 operational forces, we have 45 people of 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.890

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.220
 department mühlacker and 30 departments 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:00.750
 the department and a total of 90 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.530
 firefighters from mühlacker all 26 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.530
 used vehicles 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.359
 even if the rainfalls on saturday 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.579
 become less late in the afternoon 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.820
 the water masses are slow 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.070
 back and there is still enough to do 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.030
 around the water damage inside the 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.030
 eliminate buildings 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.380
 the situation also relaxes in enzberg 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.990
 to see against evening 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.319
 and after the water masses go back 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.959
 is the reason for digging 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.000
 notice unusual flooding 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.660
 the problem is more that the natural 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.040
 drain through the sewer 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.040
 Clogged schmidt with wood can 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.090
 we can do that here 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.320
 problem-all the trees and branches which 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.540
 lying here have clogged everything 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.550
 here and we are here now 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.090
 To correct cause here is the 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.340
 course expires after the clogged 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.950
 The water can be dredged freely 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.910
 drain off again as usual instead 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.040
 to look for a way across the street 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.430
 what remains are the necessary ones 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.430
 tidying work
