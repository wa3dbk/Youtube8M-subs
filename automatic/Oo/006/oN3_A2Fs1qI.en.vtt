00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
then you select the client you begin a

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.730 
then you select the client you begin a
session<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:14.020> what<00:00:14.920> I'm<00:00:15.040> showing<00:00:15.070> is<00:00:15.760> that<00:00:16.740> all

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
session and what I'm showing is that all

talked about theta before and if you can

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.959 
talked about theta before and if you can
see<00:00:52.479> you<00:00:53.079> see<00:00:53.319> at<00:00:53.379> their<00:00:53.530> very<00:00:53.739> long<00:00:54.489> waves

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969

spaced<00:00:55.719> far<00:00:56.049> apart<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.850> we<00:00:57.999> come<00:00:58.210> into

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:58.389 
spaced far apart and then we come into

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:00.569 
spaced far apart and then we come into
beta<00:00:58.780> which<00:00:59.079> is<00:00:59.229> which<00:00:59.620> or<00:00:59.769> waves<00:01:00.010> at<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.249> bunch

and<00:01:03.579> finally<00:01:04.479> high<00:01:04.750> beta<00:01:05.080> which<00:01:05.740> we<00:01:05.920> talked

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
and finally high beta which we talked

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.639 
and finally high beta which we talked
about<00:01:06.490> before<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:06.909> providing<00:01:07.649> anxiety

progressing and the more color and the
more<00:03:08.420> movement<00:03:08.959> means<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.650> higher<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.190> score

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
more movement means the higher the score

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.770 
more movement means the higher the score
right<00:03:11.780> now<00:03:11.989> she's<00:03:12.260> at<00:03:12.440> about<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.709> 29<00:03:13.400> 30<00:03:13.880> score

right now she's at about a 29 30 score
and<00:03:15.190> it's<00:03:16.190> still<00:03:16.549> very<00:03:16.790> positive<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.739> I'd

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
and it's still very positive and I'd

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.130 
and it's still very positive and I'd
like<00:03:18.920> you<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.430> show<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.700> again<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.019> the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
like you to show you again this is the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.680 
like you to show you again this is the
type<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.380> movement<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.220> see<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:23.359> enough

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
type of movement that you see and enough

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.280 
type of movement that you see and enough
of<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.870> movement<00:03:24.320> will<00:03:24.980> produce<00:03:25.329> a<00:03:26.329> sound<00:03:26.959> a

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
of that movement will produce a sound a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.590 
of that movement will produce a sound a
reward<00:03:27.739> that<00:03:28.220> Jane<00:03:28.640> hears<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:32.180> as<00:03:32.359> her

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
reward that Jane hears and that as her

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.640 
reward that Jane hears and that as her
mind<00:03:32.900> here<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:33.790> what<00:03:34.790> occurs<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.299> that<00:03:35.780> it

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
mind here is it what occurs is that it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.250 
mind here is it what occurs is that it
reinforces<00:03:37.239> where<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.450> mind<00:03:38.690> ought<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.140> be

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
reinforces where the mind ought to be

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.580 
reinforces where the mind ought to be
within<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.709> zone<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.139> mind<00:03:42.350> actually

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
within that zone and the mind actually

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.050 
within that zone and the mind actually
begins<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.400> change<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:46.060> electronic

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
begins to change and the electronic

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.390 
begins to change and the electronic
waves<00:03:47.359> that<00:03:48.019> we<00:03:48.260> see<00:03:48.530> as<00:03:48.680> theta<00:03:49.010> in<00:03:49.310> the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
waves that we see as theta in the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.360 
waves that we see as theta in the
beginning<00:03:49.900> become<00:03:50.900> much<00:03:51.380> more<00:03:51.650> beta<00:03:52.010> and

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
beginning become much more beta and

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.410 
beginning become much more beta and
allow<00:03:53.030> her<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:53.630> focus<00:03:54.560> more<00:03:54.859> to<00:03:55.430> be<00:03:55.670> more

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
allow her to focus more to be more

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.960 
allow her to focus more to be more
attentive<00:03:56.750> in<00:03:57.170> her<00:03:57.739> work<00:03:57.980> environment<00:03:58.730> and
