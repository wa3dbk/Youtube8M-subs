00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
guide so where you get your tip wraps

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.620 
guide so where you get your tip wraps
and<00:01:17.310> things<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.640> that'll<00:01:18.390> eliminate

and things like that that'll eliminate

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.810 
and things like that that'll eliminate
those<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.320> coming<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.250> down<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.610> rod<00:01:20.790> on

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
those and coming back down the rod on

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
those and coming back down the rod on
the<00:01:21.060> double<00:01:21.659> foot<00:01:21.840> guides<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.560> are

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the double foot guides there are

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.210 
the double foot guides there are
standard<00:01:23.700> Fuji<00:01:24.000> alka<00:01:24.390> night<00:01:24.509> guides<00:01:25.220> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
standard Fuji alka night guides the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.469 
standard Fuji alka night guides the
other<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.610> excellent<00:01:26.939> thing<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
other really excellent thing and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.719 
other really excellent thing and
probably<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.229> most<00:01:28.829> dramatic<00:01:29.369> thing<00:01:29.490> about

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
probably the most dramatic thing about

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.510 
probably the most dramatic thing about
the<00:01:29.820> new<00:01:29.909> IMX<00:01:30.360> series<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.049> actually<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the new IMX series is actually the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
the new IMX series is actually the
blanks<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> 15%<00:01:33.840> lighter<00:01:34.170> than<00:01:34.500> our

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
blanks are up to 15% lighter than our

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.190 
blanks are up to 15% lighter than our
original<00:01:34.710> IMX<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.939> obviously<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
original IMX so obviously that's a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.469 
original IMX so obviously that's a
really<00:01:37.500> big<00:01:37.680> deal<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.189> any<00:01:38.790> bass<00:01:39.030> fishermen

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
really big deal for any bass fishermen

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.670 
really big deal for any bass fishermen
out<00:01:39.540> there<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.110> get<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> rod<00:01:40.470> that's

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
out there if you can get a rod that's

want to go fast you want to go slow

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.000 
want to go fast you want to go slow
right<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.200> probably<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.770> number

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
right this is probably just the number

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.090 
right this is probably just the number
one<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.150> all-purpose<00:02:19.990> absolutely<00:02:20.680> and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
one for this all-purpose absolutely and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.860 
one for this all-purpose absolutely and
then<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.310> have<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.580> HD<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.390> seven<00:02:22.630> point

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
then you have the HD so the seven point

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.930 
then you have the HD so the seven point
two
