so as a star you probably see that in
the<00:00:21.119> reflection<00:00:22.189> that's<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> back<00:00:23.519> side<00:00:23.820> of

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the reflection that's the back side of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
back as they a custom made you can

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.200 
back as they a custom made you can
decide<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.480> want<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.689> full<00:00:30.929> shape<00:00:32.210> or

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
decide if you want to full shape or

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.780 
decide if you want to full shape or
something<00:00:33.390> more<00:00:33.719> concave<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> semi

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
something more concave this is a semi

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
something more concave this is a semi
traditional<00:00:36.600> shape<00:00:36.920> somewhere<00:00:37.920> between<00:00:39.710> this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
traditional shape somewhere between this

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.280 
traditional shape somewhere between this
is<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> full<00:00:41.219> concave<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.450> semi<00:00:42.719> traditional

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
is a full concave so semi traditional

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
is a full concave so semi traditional
someone<00:00:43.649> between<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> full<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> concave<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
someone between a full and a concave so

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.010 
someone between a full and a concave so
you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.690> all<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> woods

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you can see there that all the woods

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.130 
you can see there that all the woods
been<00:00:49.230> taken<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.210> which<00:00:51.210> reduces<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
been taken out of here which reduces the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.080 
been taken out of here which reduces the
weight<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.399> all<00:00:53.550> nice<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
weight but in here it's all nice and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.779 
weight but in here it's all nice and
full<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:55.230> means<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.890> pretty<00:00:56.370> much<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
full that means that pretty much on the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.080 
full that means that pretty much on the
face<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.360> you're<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.750> hitting<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
face if you're going to be hitting it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.310 
face if you're going to be hitting it
let's<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.079> hitting

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
let's see if you're going to be hitting

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.619 
let's see if you're going to be hitting
it<00:01:01.410> slightly<00:01:01.739> offset<00:01:02.300> it's<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.449> better

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
it slightly offset it's a better

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.200 
it slightly offset it's a better
performance<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.589> he<00:01:05.460> needs<00:01:05.700> somewhere<00:01:06.090> I'll

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
performance then he needs somewhere I'll

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
performance then he needs somewhere I'll
sit<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> concave<00:01:07.860> back<00:01:08.189> because<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
sit on the on a concave back because it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.350 
sit on the on a concave back because it
was<00:01:08.820> basically<00:01:09.240> less<00:01:09.960> wood<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:12.119> more

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
was basically less wood here the more

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.620 
was basically less wood here the more
more<00:01:12.750> wood<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> sides<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:15.060> but

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
more wood there on the sides there but

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.899 
more wood there on the sides there but
basically<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.470> middle<00:01:16.710> stays<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> same<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
basically the middle stays the same is

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
basically the middle stays the same is
in<00:01:18.090> publishing<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.750> same<00:01:19.650> sort<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.009> spine

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
in publishing the same sort of spine

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.450 
in publishing the same sort of spine
height<00:01:21.619> well<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> could<00:01:22.920> give<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.280> little

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
height well I could give you a little

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.969 
height well I could give you a little
rip<00:01:23.670> off<00:01:23.820> it'll<00:01:24.119> look<00:01:24.240> something<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
rip off it'll look something like this

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.100 
rip off it'll look something like this
basically<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:27.119> pick<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.630> sweet

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
basically what we do is we pick a sweet

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.130 
basically what we do is we pick a sweet
spot<00:01:28.380> let's<00:01:29.310> say<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.640> high<00:01:29.970> high<00:01:30.509> sweet<00:01:30.840> spot

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
spot let's say it's high high sweet spot

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.340 
spot let's say it's high high sweet spot
and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.520> decide<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.180> weight<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.750> how

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and then we decide what weight and how

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.700 
and then we decide what weight and how
much<00:01:34.500> concave<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.220> decide<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> put<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:35.970> there

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
much concave we decide to put in there

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.960 
much concave we decide to put in there

have a low sweet spot and then play a
poor<00:03:21.959> shot<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.610> just<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.000> sweet<00:03:24.390> spot<00:03:24.630> here

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
poor shot this is just a sweet spot here

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.259 
poor shot this is just a sweet spot here
it's<00:03:25.590> quite<00:03:25.860> low<00:03:26.070> this<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.940> going<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.120> be<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
it's quite low this is going to be the

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.120 
it's quite low this is going to be the
maximum<00:03:27.690> power<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.320> get<00:03:28.500> out<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.650> your<00:03:28.829> shots

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
maximum power you get out of your shots

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.910 
maximum power you get out of your shots
so<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.549> maximum<00:03:30.390> power<00:03:30.630> goes<00:03:31.500> into<00:03:31.829> it

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
so this maximum power goes into it

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.300 
so this maximum power goes into it
drives<00:03:33.079> but<00:03:34.079> if<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.380> see<00:03:34.560> here<00:03:34.769> if<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.040> drive

across<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.300> whole<00:05:02.630> handle<00:05:03.340> this<00:05:04.340> gives<00:05:04.640> it

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
across the whole handle this gives it

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.060 
across the whole handle this gives it
maneuverability<00:05:05.840> in<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.050> hands<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:06.980> you

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
maneuverability in the hands so you

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.610 
maneuverability in the hands so you
