00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.190 
hi this is Philip burn for phonescoop
com<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.730> today<00:00:02.879> I'm<00:00:03.000> taking<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.389> look<00:00:03.600> at<00:00:04.020> the

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
com and today I'm taking a look at the

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.070 
com and today I'm taking a look at the
pantech<00:00:04.650> ease<00:00:05.180> which<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.390> sort<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.870> simple

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
pantech ease which is sort of a simple

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.830 
pantech ease which is sort of a simple
messaging<00:00:07.680> phone<00:00:07.919> aimed<00:00:08.880> at<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> slightly

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
messaging phone aimed at a slightly

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.890 
messaging phone aimed at a slightly
older<00:00:09.960> crap<00:00:10.670> so<00:00:11.670> pantech<00:00:12.179> has<00:00:12.330> really<00:00:12.570> struck

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
older crap so pantech has really struck

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.110 
older crap so pantech has really struck
a<00:00:13.019> nice<00:00:13.230> balance<00:00:13.559> with<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:13.950> ease<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.250> think<00:00:14.910> it

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
a nice balance with the ease I think it

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.010 
a nice balance with the ease I think it
doesn't<00:00:15.839> exactly<00:00:16.020> look<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.949> sort<00:00:17.190> of

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
doesn't exactly look like the sort of

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.450 
doesn't exactly look like the sort of
grandparents<00:00:19.020> phones<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.859> might<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.130> seen

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
grandparents phones you might have seen

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.670 
grandparents phones you might have seen
in<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> past<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> jitterbug<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.529> not

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
in the past like the jitterbug it's not

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.279 
in the past like the jitterbug it's not
really<00:00:22.890> goofy<00:00:23.519> looking<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.750> buttons<00:00:25.109> are

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
really goofy looking the buttons are

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.820 
really goofy looking the buttons are
nice<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> wide<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.460> easy<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.910> press<00:00:27.180> but

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
nice and wide and easy to press but

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.560 
nice and wide and easy to press but
they're<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:28.980> too<00:00:29.730> large<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.330> looks<00:00:30.510> like

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
they're not too large that it looks like

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.500 
they're not too large that it looks like
a<00:00:30.660> kid's<00:00:31.019> phone<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.340> keyboard<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.300> think

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
a kid's phone the keyboard here I think

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.150 
a kid's phone the keyboard here I think
it<00:00:33.600> could<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.410> bigger<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.920> keys

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
it could be a little bit bigger the keys

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.340 
it could be a little bit bigger the keys
could<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> little<00:00:35.820> wider<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.110> like

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
could be a little wider but I do like

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.340 
could be a little wider but I do like
the<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:37.739> large<00:00:38.250> text<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.660> keyboard<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the very large text on the keyboard the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.889 
the very large text on the keyboard the
large<00:00:40.559> font<00:00:41.010> size<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.850> they<00:00:42.570> keep<00:00:42.750> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
large font size and they keep it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.270 
large font size and they keep it
relatively<00:00:43.230> simple<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:43.950> aren't<00:00:44.100> too<00:00:44.250> many

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
relatively simple there aren't too many

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.720 
relatively simple there aren't too many
shortcut<00:00:45.090> keys<00:00:45.469> there's<00:00:46.469> two<00:00:46.710> zoom<00:00:47.039> keys<00:00:47.430> down

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
shortcut keys there's two zoom keys down

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.670 
shortcut keys there's two zoom keys down
here<00:00:48.180> unfortunately<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.140> don't<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.440> enough

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
here unfortunately they don't get enough

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.670 
here unfortunately they don't get enough
use<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.760> phone<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> otherwise<00:00:52.379> they

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
use on this phone but otherwise they

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.520 
use on this phone but otherwise they
keep<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> nice<00:00:53.460> simple<00:00:54.149> design<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
keep it to a nice simple design that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.770 
keep it to a nice simple design that
should<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:55.980> easy<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.370> anyone<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.820> now

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
should be easy for anyone to use now

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
should be easy for anyone to use now
there<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.050> two<00:00:58.109> distinct<00:00:58.770> menu<00:00:59.070> designs<00:00:59.460> on

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
there are two distinct menu designs on

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.660 
there are two distinct menu designs on
the<00:00:59.969> pantech<00:01:00.510> ease<00:01:00.829> there's<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.160> easy<00:01:02.370> mode

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the pantech ease there's the easy mode

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.060 
the pantech ease there's the easy mode
and<00:01:03.000> there's<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> advanced<00:01:03.899> mode<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and there's the advanced mode and the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.770 
and there's the advanced mode and the
advanced<00:01:05.339> mode<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> exactly<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> same<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
advanced mode is exactly the same as the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.630 
advanced mode is exactly the same as the
menus<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.229> you'll<00:01:07.380> find<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> pantech

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
menus that you'll find on the pantech

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.940 
menus that you'll find on the pantech
pursuit<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:10.110> focused<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> easy

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
pursuit so I really focused on the easy

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.070 
pursuit so I really focused on the easy
mode<00:01:11.340> which<00:01:11.670> i<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> more<00:01:12.570> aimed<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
mode which i think is more aimed at this

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
mode which i think is more aimed at this
target<00:01:13.500> audience<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> main

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
target audience as you can see the main

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.080 
target audience as you can see the main
menu<00:01:15.659> has<00:01:15.990> some<00:01:16.200> very<00:01:16.530> large<00:01:16.920> buttons<00:01:17.520> easy<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
menu has some very large buttons easy to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.420 
menu has some very large buttons easy to
read<00:01:18.299> easy<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.780> press<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> few

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
read easy to press there are a few

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.190 
read easy to press there are a few
features<00:01:20.670> missing<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.570> instance<00:01:21.869> in

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
features missing for instance in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.469 
features missing for instance in
messaging<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.520> don't<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.880> an<00:01:24.030> instant

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
messaging you don't get an instant

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.600 
messaging you don't get an instant
messaging<00:01:24.960> application<00:01:25.680> unless<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
messaging application unless you're in

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.710 
messaging application unless you're in
advanced<00:01:27.119> mode<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:29.060> while<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> did<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.570> this

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
advanced mode and while I did like this

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.780 
advanced mode and while I did like this
phone<00:01:30.960> overall<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.770> thought<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
phone overall I thought that the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
phone overall I thought that the
messaging<00:01:33.470> functions<00:01:34.470> really<00:01:34.920> could<00:01:35.130> have

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
messaging functions really could have

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.969 
messaging functions really could have
been<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> bit<00:01:36.119> more<00:01:36.299> powerful<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:37.380> just

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
been a bit more powerful I think just

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
been a bit more powerful I think just
because<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.400> easy<00:01:38.610> doesn't<00:01:38.909> mean<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.270> has<00:01:39.299> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
because it's easy doesn't mean it has to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.069 
because it's easy doesn't mean it has to
be<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.990> basic<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.829> instance<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.759> your<00:01:42.689> inbox

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
be so basic for instance in your inbox

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.960 
be so basic for instance in your inbox
you<00:01:43.320> don't<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.649> threaded<00:01:44.009> messaging<00:01:44.610> every

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you don't get threaded messaging every

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.139 
you don't get threaded messaging every
message<00:01:45.360> shows<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.899> individually<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.149> so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
message shows up individually here so

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.389 
message shows up individually here so
when<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.110> tap<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> message<00:01:49.890> it'll<00:01:50.130> read<00:01:50.310> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
when you tap on a message it'll read it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:58.149 
when you tap on a message it'll read it
out

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.630 

but<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> can't<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.670> all<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.060> messages<00:02:00.569> in<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
but you can't see all the messages in a

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.249 
but you can't see all the messages in a
conversational<00:02:02.640> format<00:02:03.179> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.079> on

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
conversational format you can on

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.499 
conversational format you can on
advanced<00:02:04.829> mode<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.060> seems<00:02:06.240> weird

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
advanced mode and it just seems weird

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
advanced mode and it just seems weird
that<00:02:06.659> pantech<00:02:07.439> left<00:02:07.679> this<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> easy

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
that pantech left this out on the easy

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160 
that pantech left this out on the easy
mode<00:02:08.789> since<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.269> not<00:02:09.450> really<00:02:09.690> an<00:02:09.780> advanced

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
mode since it's not really an advanced

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.050 
mode since it's not really an advanced
feature<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.649> think<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.129> makes<00:02:11.280> messaging<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
feature I think it makes messaging a

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
feature I think it makes messaging a
little<00:02:12.330> easier<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.780> fact<00:02:13.019> I<00:02:13.319> really<00:02:13.739> don't

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
little easier in fact I really don't

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.160 
little easier in fact I really don't
like<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.069> AT&amp;T<00:02:14.580> charges<00:02:14.819> extra<00:02:15.599> for<00:02:15.780> its

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
like that AT&amp;T charges extra for its

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.800 
like that AT&amp;T charges extra for its

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
have and that just seems a bit

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.470 
have and that just seems a bit
unreasonable<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.230> me<00:02:25.760> now<00:02:26.760> on<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> easy<00:02:27.180> side

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480

you also lack the music player I don't
think<00:02:32.069> that's<00:02:32.160> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.549> too<00:02:32.819> much<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.030> an

think that's going to be too much of an

in this phone but it is available on the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.370 

the<00:02:48.640> only<00:02:48.850> omission<00:02:49.270> on<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.540> easy<00:02:49.720> mode<00:02:50.020> that

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
the only omission on the easy mode that

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.400 
the only omission on the easy mode that
I<00:02:50.620> really<00:02:51.340> was<00:02:51.490> missing<00:02:51.750> was<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.810> social

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
I really was missing was the social

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.160 
I really was missing was the social
networking<00:02:53.800> there<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.820> social<00:02:55.660> net<00:02:55.930> app

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
networking there is a a social net app

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.500 
networking there is a a social net app
on<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.920> advanced<00:02:57.460> side<00:02:57.700> which<00:02:58.030> can<00:02:58.270> check

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
on the advanced side which can check

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.560 
on the advanced side which can check
status<00:02:58.810> updates<00:02:59.350> for<00:02:59.650> MySpace<00:03:00.250> Twitter<00:03:00.570> and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
status updates for MySpace Twitter and

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.860 
status updates for MySpace Twitter and
Facebook<00:03:03.090> but<00:03:04.090> unfortunately<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:04.810> missing

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
Facebook but unfortunately it's missing

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.990 
Facebook but unfortunately it's missing
on<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.470> easy<00:03:05.650> side<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.340> think<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.820> there

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
on the easy side and I think that there

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.180 
on the easy side and I think that there
are<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.450> few<00:03:07.900> older<00:03:08.500> folks<00:03:08.770> out<00:03:08.980> there<00:03:09.130> who

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
are a few older folks out there who

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.100 
are a few older folks out there who
might<00:03:09.490> be<00:03:09.640> interested<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:10.270> keeping<00:03:10.630> up<00:03:10.930> with

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
might be interested in keeping up with

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.530 
might be interested in keeping up with
status<00:03:11.500> updates<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.160> think<00:03:12.850> social<00:03:13.180> networks

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
status updates I think social networks

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.330 
status updates I think social networks
are<00:03:13.720> catching<00:03:14.110> on<00:03:14.200> just<00:03:14.530> enough<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.100> drive

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
are catching on just enough to drive

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.790 
are catching on just enough to drive
some<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.700> these<00:03:15.850> phone<00:03:16.120> sales<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:16.930> if<00:03:17.530> you're

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
some of these phone sales so if you're

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.990 
some of these phone sales so if you're
looking<00:03:18.070> for<00:03:18.100> those<00:03:18.310> features<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.880> might

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
looking for those features you might

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.060 
looking for those features you might
have<00:03:19.210> to<00:03:19.360> dip<00:03:19.540> into<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.140> advanced<00:03:20.620> mode<00:03:20.800> for

have to dip into the advanced mode for
that

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.050 

and<00:03:31.629> so<00:03:32.590> that's<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.980> pantech<00:03:33.370> ease<00:03:33.549> i<00:03:33.610> think

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
and so that's the pantech ease i think

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.750 
and so that's the pantech ease i think
pantech<00:03:34.450> has<00:03:34.569> done<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.780> nice<00:03:35.019> job<00:03:35.080> of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
pantech has done a nice job of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.100 
pantech has done a nice job of
simplifying<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:37.000> feature<00:03:37.209> phone<00:03:37.599> so<00:03:37.930> it's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
simplifying the feature phone so it's

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.949 
simplifying the feature phone so it's
easier<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.650> use<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.390> wish<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.599> some<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:40.900> these

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
easier to use I wish that some of these

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.869 
easier to use I wish that some of these
advanced<00:03:41.590> features<00:03:41.950> from<00:03:42.129> advanced<00:03:42.519> mode

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
made their way into the easy mode but it

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.229 
made their way into the easy mode but it
isn't<00:03:44.920> too<00:03:45.040> hard<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.459> switch<00:03:45.700> back<00:03:45.909> and<00:03:45.970> forth

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
isn't too hard to switch back and forth

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.580 
isn't too hard to switch back and forth
if<00:03:46.629> you<00:03:46.750> want<00:03:46.900> something<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.260> little<00:03:47.379> bit

better and overall I'd say this is a
