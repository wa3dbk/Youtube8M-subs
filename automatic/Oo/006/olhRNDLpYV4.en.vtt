00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 we need real soil under the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.359
 feet and only goes by two three 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.570
 years in a row in the first league 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.130
 to play along and then we will 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.240
 So see how we 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.710
 basic requirements the good 70,000 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.250
 members we have stadium full 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.600
 we have a young viable one 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.789
 team today and and then we have to 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.010
 but someday formulate new goals 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.269
 definitely not next two years 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.990
 next year it is about the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.520
 to stay great 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.340
 if we then as ninth in the class 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.070
 stay or is worth fourteen 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.680
 must be as meaningless the time was simple 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.200
 ready for us so it has a lot 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.750
 disappointments 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.000
 Cologne has not been for 20 years 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.430
 single-digit first league if you are here 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.899
 Asked above now, everyone would have believed that way 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.280
 I do not exist so there are fans of us 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.440
 which has never been a successful one 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.379
 season really did experience so so 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.359
 therefore, the time was ripe with 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.850
 People come and other goals 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.590
 formulate as a commitment we are in two 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.750
 years if we german champion or 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 cup winner or would be champions league 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.310
 win and we have our goals 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.200
 the feasible and have the feasible 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.540
 also formulated and will be supported 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 both from fans and for me you 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.080
 clearly also from the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.909
 media landscape in cologne yes, too 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.189
 always as cool as if it were so hot 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.060
 and so complicated would be the will 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.670
 will be carried 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.799
 that's very pleasant and so on 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.000
 not as excited as many of them 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.259
 outside he believes he made it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.360
 an expectation to bring cologne 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.579
 which is realistic and that's what it is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.110
 entire environment has become quiet and we 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.840
 have two years ago with ingolstadt 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.950
 played there i want to believe now 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.090
 won the single market only 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.090
 once on goal and we were very 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.590
 And yet you have to say the year 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.640
 then very stable in the league 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.120
 held and now again a step 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.680
 made 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.330
 that says great there you can already 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.110
 look and can get that one 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
 or others look 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.800
 now it's seven points 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.210
 of course already relaxed there you go in 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.100
 the country break where can 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.570
 breathe deeply and can concentrate on the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.450
 to prepare next games 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.100
 Overall, that is certainly for one 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.250
 first will probably do that that way 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.250
 developed
