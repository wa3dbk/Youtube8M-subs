and spray the ceiling with enough water

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.229 
and spray the ceiling with enough water
so<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:12.290> popcorn<00:02:12.800> darkens<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.519> becomes<00:02:13.909> damp

so the popcorn darkens and becomes damp

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.809 
so the popcorn darkens and becomes damp
the<00:02:15.200> ceiling<00:02:15.590> should<00:02:15.739> absorb<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.340> majority
