00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.950
 [Music] 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.889
 There is no way you are far from the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.130
 science I think there is a monitoring 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 of your workouts the follow-up 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.460
 analysis of physiological responses 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.770
 happen daily 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.869
 this allows you to direct 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.850
 to differentiate between groups of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 athletes and that's what we've been looking for 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.439
 to do is to try alongside the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.330
 rear of the departments that make up 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.520
 the inter the physiology nutrition 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.320
 clear and clear physiotherapy 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 physical preparation to make sure that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.760
 integration within this department 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.980
 as much information as possible so that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.250
 you can optimize your work 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.469
 so my my, my way of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.680
 working my style of work is 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.270
 of course demands a lot from the athletes but 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.340
 accompanied by information 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.469
 accompanied by science so that people 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.079
 get good results there 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:05.000
 the structure that was not provided 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:08.430
 was with the best possible conditions 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.310
 we had the return of players 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.590
 dedication and commitment 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.520
 commitment is important in this 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.799
 time 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.659
 when the season starts well 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.000
 when you make the adjustments at the beginning 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
 facilitates the whole process 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.310
 we are very pleased with the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.680
 delivery with what the players 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.659
 developed is of course just the beginning 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.040
 but we started well 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.829
 we had two priorities first 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.259
 were the central adaptations 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.460
 works that had a direction 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.009
 cardiopulmonary resuscitation with the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.049
 aerobic performance 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.780
 we started with a bit more speed 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.310
 low but at the end 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.049
 at the end of the week already with 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.350
 velocities close to the velocities of 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.490
 game and special attention to the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.219
 force question 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.909
 we seek to give a general basis also 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.439
 levels of muscular resistance but 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.079
 already entering the works of force 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.030
 in the work of maximum force and 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.619
 this will have a twist when we 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.479
 we went back to porto alegre 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.009
 these were the two issues that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.560
 were on the agenda during this week 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.239
 I think the important thing now 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.830
 we continue the physical work 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.860
 mainly to make the athletes 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.120
 if you now recover your actions 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.120
 specific games 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.340
 there were few ball jobs and this 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.390
 will have one a priority already in the next 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.010
 week 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.470
 we believe that in the next two 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.660
 weeks there will be an evolution 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.040
 even more so that athletes will already have 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.040
 conditions to withstand 90 minutes
