reason my trigger finger I tend to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.420 
reason my trigger finger I tend to
develop<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.690> blister<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.010> just

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
develop a little blister because I just

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.250 
develop a little blister because I just
don't<00:00:59.550> shoot<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.059> much<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> regular<00:01:00.809> basis

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
don't shoot that much in a regular basis

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.439 
don't shoot that much in a regular basis
in<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:01.890> setting<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:02.940> gloves<00:01:03.120> kind<00:01:03.390> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
in one setting so these gloves kind of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
in one setting so these gloves kind of
saved<00:01:03.690> my<00:01:03.840> bacon<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.439> sense<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
saved my bacon in that sense that I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
saved my bacon in that sense that I
didn't<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.700> prevented<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.360> blister<00:01:06.780> from

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
didn't you know prevented a blister from

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.240 
didn't you know prevented a blister from
getting<00:01:07.350> worse<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.740> even<00:01:07.979> forming<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:10.250> so

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
getting worse or even forming and so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.190 
getting worse or even forming and so
yeah<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.360> usually<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> use<00:01:13.049> them

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
yeah so that's usually what I use them

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.810 
yeah so that's usually what I use them
for<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.740> wear<00:01:13.890> them<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> winter<00:01:14.430> time<00:01:14.640> if

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
for I do wear them in the winter time if

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.190 
for I do wear them in the winter time if
I'm<00:01:14.970> shooting<00:01:15.119> outdoors<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> kind<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.990> takes

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
I'm shooting outdoors it kind of takes

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.070 
I'm shooting outdoors it kind of takes
the<00:01:16.290> wind<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.979> least<00:01:17.159> off<00:01:17.400> them<00:01:17.580> they're<00:01:17.729> not

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
the wind at least off them they're not

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.420 
the wind at least off them they're not
as<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.439> they're<00:01:19.830> pretty<00:01:19.860> thin<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
as you can see they're pretty thin and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.920 
as you can see they're pretty thin and
form-fitting<00:01:21.060> they're<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.360> meant<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> keep

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
form-fitting they're not meant to keep

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.350 
form-fitting they're not meant to keep
your<00:01:22.140> hands<00:01:22.320> warm<00:01:22.470> by<00:01:22.950> any<00:01:23.130> means<00:01:23.340> their<00:01:24.150> main

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
your hands warm by any means their main

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.550 
your hands warm by any means their main
I<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:24.960> they're<00:01:25.049> mainly<00:01:25.200> kind<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I think they're mainly kind of a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.679 
I think they're mainly kind of a
protective<00:01:26.100> gloves<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> keep<00:01:27.509> your

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
protective gloves just to keep your

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.120 
protective gloves just to keep your
hands<00:01:27.869> from<00:01:28.049> getting<00:01:28.259> cut<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.860> Nicks<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
hands from getting cut up and Nicks and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.510 
hands from getting cut up and Nicks and
scratches<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.759> whatnot

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
scratches and whatnot

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.270 
scratches and whatnot
so<00:01:33.799> with<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.950> being<00:01:35.130> said<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:36.680> usually<00:01:37.680> will

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so with that being said I usually will

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.730 
so with that being said I usually will
get<00:01:38.369> into<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> characteristics<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.740> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
get into the characteristics of the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.639 
get into the characteristics of the
glove<00:01:40.950> itself<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.810> starting<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
glove itself so I'm starting out as I

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
glove itself so I'm starting out as I
said<00:01:43.920> before<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.430> very<00:01:44.700> form-fitting

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
said before it is a very form-fitting

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120 
said before it is a very form-fitting
glove<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.689> designed<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.320> purpose<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.979> give

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
glove that's designed on purpose to give

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.380 
glove that's designed on purpose to give
you<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:48.049> no<00:01:49.049> glove<00:01:49.670> feeling<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> speak

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
you that no glove feeling so to speak

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.730 
you that no glove feeling so to speak
like<00:01:51.420> you're<00:01:51.720> shooting<00:01:51.990> without<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.530> but

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
like you're shooting without them but

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.440 
like you're shooting without them but
let's<00:01:53.399> face<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.149> still<00:01:54.360> have

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
let's face it and you still have

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.850 
let's face it and you still have
something<00:01:54.630> covering<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.079> hands<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.560> there's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
something covering your hands so there's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.590 
something covering your hands so there's
still<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:56.880> feeling<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.360> you're

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
still you know feeling like you're

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.719 
still you know feeling like you're
wearing<00:01:57.960> gloves<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:59.130> probably<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
wearing gloves but it's probably the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.600 
wearing gloves but it's probably the
closest<00:02:00.270> I've<00:02:00.450> ever<00:02:00.630> worn<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.560> being<00:02:02.100> without

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.969 

let's<00:02:05.610> see<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.560> let's<00:02:07.560> talk<00:02:07.649> about<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
let's see here so let's talk about the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.740 
let's see here so let's talk about the
fingers<00:02:08.310> themselves<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> joints<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.720> can

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
fingers themselves the joints you can

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.400 
fingers themselves the joints you can
see<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.140> there<00:02:10.289> are<00:02:10.379> segments<00:02:10.950> in

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
see that there are segments in

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.310 
see that there are segments in
fingers<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:13.180> kind<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.420> helps<00:02:13.630> with<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.930> you

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
fingers that kind of helps with the you

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.980 
fingers that kind of helps with the you
know<00:02:14.350> mobility<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.130> your<00:02:15.460> hand<00:02:15.990> especially

with your trigger finger

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.400 
with your trigger finger

trigger fingers has an extra segment so

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.050 
trigger fingers has an extra segment so
