00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
first of the drm let's take a look at

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
first of the drm let's take a look at
the<00:00:43.290> picture<00:00:43.710> first<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.610> opinion<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:45.090> looks

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the picture first in my opinion it looks

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
the picture first in my opinion it looks
a<00:00:45.450> lot<00:00:45.720> like<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.320> lsat<00:00:46.980> with<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.640> profiling

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
a lot like the lsat with the profiling

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500 
a lot like the lsat with the profiling
of<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.720> with<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.110> magazine<00:00:49.769> with<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.640> sights

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
of it with the magazine with the sights

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
of it with the magazine with the sights
and<00:00:51.720> also<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.410> bow<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.949> gun<00:00:53.220> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and also with the bow of the gun it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
and also with the bow of the gun it
looks<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:53.610> lot<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> LSAT<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:54.900> hoping

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
looks a lot like the LSAT and I'm hoping

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.490 
looks a lot like the LSAT and I'm hoping
and<00:00:55.620> praying<00:00:56.339> that<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.150> not<00:00:57.540> as<00:00:57.660> powerful<00:00:57.960> as

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and praying that is not as powerful as

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.710 
and praying that is not as powerful as
the<00:00:58.710> lsat<00:00:59.070> from<00:00:59.250> black<00:00:59.430> ops<00:00:59.640> 2<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.420> you

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
the lsat from black ops 2 because if you

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.420 
the lsat from black ops 2 because if you
play<00:01:00.870> black<00:01:01.080> ops<00:01:01.110> 2<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.650> you<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
play black ops 2 a lot you know the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.479 
play black ops 2 a lot you know the
target<00:01:02.820> finder<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.899> lsat<00:01:04.410> did<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.250> go

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
target finder and the lsat did not go

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.249 
target finder and the lsat did not go
well<00:01:05.520> together<00:01:05.910> at<00:01:06.270> all<00:01:06.300> because<00:01:06.810> people

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
well together at all because people

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.499 
well together at all because people
would<00:01:07.410> camp<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.280> would<00:01:08.460> wreck<00:01:08.940> your<00:01:09.180> day

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
would camp and they would wreck your day

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.630 
would camp and they would wreck your day
with<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.899> gun<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.410> hoping<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.490> as

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
with this gun so I'm hoping it's not as

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.969 
with this gun so I'm hoping it's not as
powerful<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.660> lsat<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.289> all<00:01:13.440> ranges<00:01:13.800> in

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
powerful as the lsat out all ranges in

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.469 
powerful as the lsat out all ranges in
black<00:01:14.190> ops<00:01:14.369> 2<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:14.759> I'm<00:01:14.820> definitely<00:01:15.030> trying<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
black ops 2 but I'm definitely trying to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.760 
black ops 2 but I'm definitely trying to
think<00:01:15.660> they're<00:01:15.840> trying<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.080> bring<00:01:16.229> an<00:01:16.410> lsat

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
think they're trying to bring an lsat

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.950 
think they're trying to bring an lsat
back<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.940> br<00:01:18.330> em<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.690> it<00:01:18.750> says

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
back to it that is a br em and it says

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.990
