00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.920 
now one thing that was a big difference
maker<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:12.830> before<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.940> flipped<00:02:15.270> our<00:02:15.450> axles

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
maker is before we flipped our axles

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
lowest setting of the hitch we were

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.400 
lowest setting of the hitch we were
still<00:02:21.060> kind<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.390> getting<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.690> rake<00:02:21.930> effect

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
still kind of getting the rake effect

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.610

and you know the back end of the trailer
was<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.160> low<00:02:26.400> because<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.540> trailer<00:02:28.350> we<00:02:28.470> had<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
was so low because the trailer we had to

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.460 
was so low because the trailer we had to
get<00:02:28.890> up<00:02:29.100> onto<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.640> trucks<00:02:29.970> hitch<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:31.050> right

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
get up onto the trucks hitch so right

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.350 
get up onto the trucks hitch so right
now<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.850> perfectly<00:02:33.570> level

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
now it's it's perfectly level

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.720 
now it's it's perfectly level
really<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> only<00:02:36.959> area<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.709> may<00:02:38.519> have

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
really the only area that I may have

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.880 
really the only area that I may have
noticed<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.600> little<00:02:39.870> bit<00:02:40.080> was<00:02:40.350> around<00:02:40.709> a

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
noticed it a little bit was around a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.970 
noticed it a little bit was around a
windy<00:02:41.550> section<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:43.320> interstate<00:02:43.530> where<00:02:43.890> as

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
windy section of the interstate where as

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.600 
windy section of the interstate where as
we<00:02:44.130> are<00:02:44.190> about<00:02:44.400> 50<00:02:44.760> 55<00:02:45.769> I've<00:02:46.769> driven<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.250> area

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
we are about 50 55 I've driven that area

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.210 
we are about 50 55 I've driven that area
before<00:02:48.209> when<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.170> axles<00:02:49.560> were<00:02:49.680> not<00:02:49.860> flipped

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
before when the axles were not flipped

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.910 
before when the axles were not flipped
and<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.970> still<00:02:51.209> felt<00:02:51.480> kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.810> wobbly

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
and it still felt kind of wobbly

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.560 
and it still felt kind of wobbly
so<00:02:53.400> again<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.610> haven't<00:02:53.910> really<00:02:54.060> noticed<00:02:54.090> a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
so again I haven't really noticed a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.930 
so again I haven't really noticed a
anything<00:02:54.870> also<00:02:55.770> when<00:02:56.160> we<00:02:56.280> are<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.490> national

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
anything also when we are on national

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.420 
anything also when we are on national
forest<00:02:57.390> land<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:58.770> know<00:02:58.860> we<00:02:59.040> had<00:02:59.220> some

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
forest land you know we had some

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.240 
forest land you know we had some
off-axis<00:03:00.230> roads<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.530> stuff<00:03:01.710> that<00:03:01.740> we<00:03:01.980> were<00:03:02.100> on

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
off-axis roads and stuff that we were on

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.690 
off-axis roads and stuff that we were on
and<00:03:02.520> driving<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.060> ruts<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:04.530> may<00:03:04.920> visually

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
and driving on ruts and it may visually

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.670 
and driving on ruts and it may visually
look<00:03:06.000> like<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.660> campers<00:03:07.050> gonna<00:03:07.230> tilt<00:03:07.470> over

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
look like the campers gonna tilt over

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.790 
look like the campers gonna tilt over
because<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.460> center<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.850> gravity<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.390> higher

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
because the center of gravity is higher

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.490 
because the center of gravity is higher
but<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:11.250> can't<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:13.020> doesn't<00:03:13.170> feel<00:03:13.320> that

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
but you can't it it doesn't feel that

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.770 
but you can't it it doesn't feel that
way<00:03:13.740> at<00:03:14.040> all<00:03:14.190> actually<00:03:14.730> driving<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.510> doesn't

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
way at all actually driving it doesn't

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.410 
way at all actually driving it doesn't
feel<00:03:16.080> like<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:16.830> gonna<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.460> at<00:03:17.610> all<00:03:17.700> and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
feel like it's gonna do that at all and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.880 
feel like it's gonna do that at all and
it<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.170> just<00:03:19.770> such<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> good<00:03:20.580> feeling<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:22.860> know

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
it is just such a good feeling to know

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.880 
it is just such a good feeling to know
that<00:03:23.160> when<00:03:23.850> we're<00:03:24.060> going<00:03:24.270> on<00:03:24.600> those<00:03:24.900> roads<00:03:25.350> and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
that when we're going on those roads and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.890 
that when we're going on those roads and
when<00:03:26.160> I'm<00:03:26.280> going<00:03:26.700> on<00:03:26.850> dips<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.540> streets

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
when I'm going on dips on the streets

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.460 
when I'm going on dips on the streets
and<00:03:28.110> all<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.410> stuff<00:03:28.970> there<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.000> not<00:03:30.470> pretty

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
and all that stuff there is not pretty

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.940 
and all that stuff there is not pretty
much<00:03:31.650> not<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> chance<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.910> am<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.480> to

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
much not a chance that I am going to

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.449 
much not a chance that I am going to
scrape<00:03:34.950> my<00:03:35.160> rear<00:03:35.459> Jack's<00:03:35.880> or<00:03:36.209> my<00:03:36.540> dump<00:03:36.900> tanks

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
scrape my rear Jack's or my dump tanks

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.260 
scrape my rear Jack's or my dump tanks
that<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.520> a<00:03:39.060> great<00:03:39.660> feeling<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.489> nice<00:03:41.820> to

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
that is a great feeling it is so nice to

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.780 
that is a great feeling it is so nice to
not<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.350> worry<00:03:43.739> about<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.250> and

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
not have to worry about that and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.360 
not have to worry about that and
constantly<00:03:45.420> check<00:03:45.720> my<00:03:45.930> mirrors<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:47.010> see<00:03:47.220> if

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
constantly check my mirrors to see if

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.199 
constantly check my mirrors to see if
