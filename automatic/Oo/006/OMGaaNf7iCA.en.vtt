00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
like English there are always two ways

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.899

lowercase this is the uppercase alpha

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.859 
lowercase this is the uppercase alpha
yep<00:01:37.810> it's<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.439> same<00:01:38.649> as<00:01:38.859> the<00:01:39.009> English<00:01:39.189> a<00:01:39.869> let's

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
yep it's the same as the English a let's

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.440 
yep it's the same as the English a let's
handwrite<00:01:41.320> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.140 

alpha<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:47.100> here's<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.220> lowercase<00:01:48.520> alpha

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
alpha and here's the lowercase alpha

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.330 
alpha and here's the lowercase alpha
this<00:01:49.780> is<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:49.990> little<00:01:50.290> different<00:01:50.710> from<00:01:50.830> English

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
this is a little different from English

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
but you can see the similarities right

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.830 
but you can see the similarities right
it<00:01:53.980> is<00:01:54.160> handwritten<00:01:54.580> like<00:01:55.120> this

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.890 

alpha<00:01:59.980> let's<00:02:00.980> do<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:01.280> again

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.010 

upper<00:02:05.710> case

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.670 

and<00:02:09.820> lower<00:02:10.820> case<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.930> can<00:02:12.140> now<00:02:12.350> write<00:02:12.650> your

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
and lower case you can now write your

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.930 
and lower case you can now write your
first<00:02:13.160> letter<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.580> Greek<00:02:13.820> good<00:02:14.600> let's<00:02:15.440> move<00:02:15.680> on

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
the second letter is a consonant knee

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.790
