this just right for just watch out for
the<00:01:17.090> super<00:01:17.450> mutants<00:01:17.870> in<00:01:17.990> here<00:01:18.610> you'll<00:01:19.610> be<00:01:19.640> just

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
the super mutants in here you'll be just

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.080 
the super mutants in here you'll be just
fine<00:01:20.590> especially<00:01:21.590> especially<00:01:22.250> for<00:01:22.880> in<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
fine especially especially for in the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.230 
fine especially especially for in the
higher<00:01:23.330> levels<00:01:24.250> okay<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:25.310> we're<00:01:25.880> at<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.060> West

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
higher levels okay so we're at the West

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.450 
higher levels okay so we're at the West
Wing<00:01:26.450> go<00:01:27.230> to<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.500> second<00:01:27.920> terminal<00:01:28.310> right

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
Wing go to the second terminal right

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:39.390 
Wing go to the second terminal right
here<00:01:28.730> and<00:01:30.760> pick<00:01:31.760> number<00:01:33.160> 0<00:01:34.160> 0<00:01:34.370> 2<00:01:35.890> then<00:01:37.330> 053<00:01:38.330> and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
here and pick number 0 0 2 then 053 and

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.640 
here and pick number 0 0 2 then 053 and
then<00:01:40.400> pick<00:01:41.290> 002<00:01:42.290> confirmed<00:01:43.810> now<00:01:44.810> go<00:01:45.290> down<00:01:45.470> this

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
then pick 002 confirmed now go down this

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.880 
then pick 002 confirmed now go down this
little<00:01:45.920> hole<00:01:46.190> right<00:01:46.220> here<00:01:47.470> until<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.590> get<00:01:48.710> to

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
little hole right here until you get to

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.680 
little hole right here until you get to
this<00:01:48.980> little<00:01:49.250> rocket<00:01:49.730> ship<00:01:49.940> or<00:01:50.210> whatever<00:01:50.540> it

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
this little rocket ship or whatever it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.970 
this little rocket ship or whatever it
is<00:01:51.670> making<00:01:52.670> sure<00:01:52.820> um<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:54.320> kill<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.680> super

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
is making sure um to kill the super

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.340 
is making sure um to kill the super
mutants<00:01:55.310> before<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:55.880> come<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.210> here<00:01:56.390> I<00:01:56.630> think

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
mutants before you come in here I think

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.410 
mutants before you come in here I think
there's<00:01:57.530> about<00:01:57.650> three<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:58.430> room<00:01:58.670> I'm<00:01:59.240> not

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
there's about three in this room I'm not

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.610 
there's about three in this room I'm not
sure<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:01.360> go<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:02.690> terminal<00:02:02.930> is<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.530> only

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
sure and go to this terminal is the only

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.560 
sure and go to this terminal is the only
terminal<00:02:04.220> in<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:04.430> room<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:04.970> that's<00:02:05.960> good

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
terminal in this room so that's good

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.790 
terminal in this room so that's good
pick<00:02:08.570> number<00:02:08.869> 003<00:02:09.710> then<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.960> think<00:02:11.960> it's<00:02:12.080> 11<00:02:12.530> 3

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
pick number 003 then I think it's 11 3

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.970 
pick number 003 then I think it's 11 3
or<00:02:13.420> 1<00:02:14.420> 19<00:02:14.750> or<00:02:14.959> something<00:02:15.260> like<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.709> then

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
or 1 19 or something like that and then

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.460 
or 1 19 or something like that and then
get<00:02:16.250> passcode<00:02:17.320> but<00:02:18.320> no<00:02:18.950> it's<00:02:19.190> 113<00:02:20.350> once<00:02:21.350> you

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
get passcode but no it's 113 once you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.130 
get passcode but no it's 113 once you
get<00:02:21.590> past<00:02:21.620> code<00:02:22.690> usually<00:02:23.690> it'll<00:02:23.810> give<00:02:23.989> you<00:02:24.110> a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
get past code usually it'll give you a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.140 
get past code usually it'll give you a
map<00:02:24.350> marker<00:02:24.709> but<00:02:24.920> not<00:02:25.100> me<00:02:25.280> because<00:02:25.640> I've

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
map marker but not me because I've

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.300 
map marker but not me because I've
already<00:02:26.540> discovered<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.410> location<00:02:27.590> but

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
already discovered the location but

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.580 
already discovered the location but
you'll<00:02:29.239> get<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.540> map<00:02:29.840> code<00:02:30.110> if<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.380> did

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
you'll get a map code if you did

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.449 
you'll get a map code if you did
everything<00:02:30.830> right<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.830> guys<00:02:34.040> name<00:02:34.430> is
