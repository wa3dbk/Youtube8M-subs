planting some arugula we took out the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.779 
planting some arugula we took out the
lettuce<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> front<00:00:14.570> it<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.780> very<00:00:16.049> tasty

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
lettuce in the front it was very tasty

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
lettuce I look down the length of the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.120 
lettuce I look down the length of the
table<00:00:24.600> now<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.710> see<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:27.380> it's<00:00:28.380> green

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
table now you can see that it's green

table now you can see that it's green
all<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> way<00:00:29.550> down<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:31.170> snow<00:00:31.439> peas<00:00:31.740> are

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
all the way down the snow peas are

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.600 
all the way down the snow peas are
getting<00:00:32.309> taller<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.950> I'll<00:00:34.950> show<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.309> those

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
getting taller and I'll show you those

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.630 
getting taller and I'll show you those
in<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> minute<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:38.540> bok<00:00:39.540> choy<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.469> chard<00:00:41.219> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
in a minute the bok choy and chard and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.590 
in a minute the bok choy and chard and
kale<00:00:42.530> keep<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.770> producing<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.090> we've<00:00:45.270> been

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
kale keep on producing and we've been

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.069 
kale keep on producing and we've been
harvesting<00:00:46.820> individual<00:00:47.820> leaves<00:00:48.059> off<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.809> we

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
harvesting individual leaves off and we

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
harvesting individual leaves off and we
just<00:00:49.320> cut<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> leaves<00:00:50.039> off<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.610> dinner<00:00:50.789> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
just cut the leaves off for dinner and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.299 
just cut the leaves off for dinner and
then<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.420> grow<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:55.879> brassicas<00:00:57.260> the

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
then they grow back the brassicas the

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.150 
then they grow back the brassicas the
cabbage<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.489> especially<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.270> napa<00:01:00.510> cabbage

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
cabbage and especially the napa cabbage

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.850 
cabbage and especially the napa cabbage
are<00:01:02.160> still<00:01:02.670> having<00:01:03.030> problems<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.660> aphids<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.320 

we're<00:01:07.860> probably<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.790> harvest

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
we're probably going to just harvest

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810 
we're probably going to just harvest
those<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.720> leaves<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.110> great<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.369> just

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
those the leaves look great so just

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.030 
those the leaves look great so just
harvest<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> wash<00:01:12.990> them<00:01:13.020> off<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> get

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
harvest them and wash them off and get

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.580 
harvest them and wash them off and get
that<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> little

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that out but we are going to do a little

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.249 
that out but we are going to do a little
experiment<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.640> some<00:01:17.670> ladybugs<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.990> see

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
experiment with some ladybugs and see

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.350 
experiment with some ladybugs and see
how<00:01:19.439> well<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.680> works<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.520> broccoli<00:01:24.090> as

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
how well that works and the broccoli as

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.690 
how well that works and the broccoli as
i<00:01:24.540> said<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.700> doing<00:01:26.700> great<00:01:26.909> super<00:01:27.630> tall<00:01:28.700> chives

i said is doing great super tall chives
are<00:01:30.860> here<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.549> beets<00:01:33.150> are<00:01:33.630> also<00:01:33.960> doing<00:01:34.439> great

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
are here the beets are also doing great

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
are here the beets are also doing great
The<00:01:35.880> Onion's<00:01:36.270> behind<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> beets<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.350> doing

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
The Onion's behind the beets are doing

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.950 
The Onion's behind the beets are doing
okay<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.250> they're<00:01:38.610> getting<00:01:38.759> shaded<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.659> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
okay but they're getting shaded so that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
okay but they're getting shaded so that
didn't<00:01:40.619> work<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.040> great<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.430> probably<00:01:41.640> should

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
didn't work so great we probably should

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.899 
didn't work so great we probably should
have<00:01:41.970> turned<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.420> around<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:44.159> lettuce

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
have turned that around the lettuce

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.139 
have turned that around the lettuce
starts<00:01:45.659> remember<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.710> seed<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.729> put

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
into the gravel rocks about two weeks

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.700 
into the gravel rocks about two weeks
ago<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:53.040> they're<00:01:53.310> coming<00:01:53.670> up<00:01:53.820> nicely<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> this

lettuce patch in about no maybe 2-3
weeks<00:02:01.770> we'll<00:02:02.070> be<00:02:02.100> able<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> start<00:02:02.659> harvesting

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
weeks we'll be able to start harvesting

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.749 
weeks we'll be able to start harvesting
some<00:02:04.290> baby<00:02:04.530> greens<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:07.640> let<00:02:08.640> me

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
some baby greens out of here and let me

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.789 
some baby greens out of here and let me
come<00:02:09.030> around

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
come around

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:17.100 
come around
here<00:02:12.540> I'm<00:02:13.540> just<00:02:13.810> throwing<00:02:15.030> some<00:02:16.030> seed<00:02:16.450> down<00:02:16.810> on

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
here I'm just throwing some seed down on

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.789 
here I'm just throwing some seed down on
the<00:02:17.260> gravel<00:02:21.269> little<00:02:22.269> tiny<00:02:22.510> seeds<00:02:22.930> down<00:02:23.319> at<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
the gravel little tiny seeds down at the

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:31.319 
the gravel little tiny seeds down at the
moisture<00:02:24.280> line<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:27.120> then<00:02:29.280> cover<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.430> back

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
moisture line and then cover it back

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.069 
moisture line and then cover it back
over<00:02:31.750> again<00:02:32.170> with<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.470> gravel<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.190> is

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
over again with the gravel so this is

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.800 
over again with the gravel so this is
just<00:02:35.079> to<00:02:35.260> get<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.590> seed<00:02:35.829> down<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.519> where<00:02:37.530> gets

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
just to get the seed down to where gets

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.780 
just to get the seed down to where gets
exposed<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.650> water<00:02:41.890> on<00:02:42.190> every<00:02:42.489> flood

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
exposed to the water on every flood

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.369 
exposed to the water on every flood
cycle<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.269> is<00:02:46.480> basically<00:02:46.930> what<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.230> did

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
cycle and this is basically what I did

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.339 
cycle and this is basically what I did
two<00:02:48.370> weeks<00:02:48.400> ago<00:02:48.790> with<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.540> lettuce<00:02:50.079> so<00:02:50.260> we're

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
two weeks ago with the lettuce so we're

going to see if this works Cesar four

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.819 
going to see if this works Cesar four
varieties<00:02:53.079> of<00:02:53.829> irregular<00:02:55.260> here's<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.379> water

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
varieties of irregular here's the water

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:03.420 
varieties of irregular here's the water
coming<00:02:57.609> in<00:02:57.849> from<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.239> pond<00:02:58.480> and<00:03:00.060> back<00:03:01.060> here<00:03:02.430> we

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
coming in from the pond and back here we

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.190 
coming in from the pond and back here we
have<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.940> snow<00:03:04.239> peas<00:03:04.569> three<00:03:05.049> different

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
have the snow peas three different

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.390 
have the snow peas three different
varieties<00:03:06.129> and<00:03:10.079> see<00:03:11.079> boy<00:03:11.470> they<00:03:11.769> just<00:03:12.040> really

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
varieties and see boy they just really

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.569 
varieties and see boy they just really
blend<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.120> but<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.739> see<00:03:15.099> that<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:18.430> have<00:03:18.459> a

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
blend in but you can see that we have a

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.300 
blend in but you can see that we have a
bunch<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:19.090> snow<00:03:19.720> peas<00:03:19.989> these<00:03:20.799> guys<00:03:21.040> should

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
bunch of snow peas these guys should

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.879 
bunch of snow peas these guys should
climb<00:03:21.579> six<00:03:21.970> feet<00:03:22.180> tall<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.569> they're<00:03:23.410> just

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
climb six feet tall so they're just

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.119 
climb six feet tall so they're just
getting<00:03:24.340> started<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:26.319> hopefully<00:03:26.530> we'll<00:03:26.829> get

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
getting started and hopefully we'll get

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.940 
getting started and hopefully we'll get
a<00:03:27.370> lot<00:03:27.639> of<00:03:27.669> snow<00:03:28.060> peas<00:03:28.329> out<00:03:28.569> of<00:03:28.780> them<00:03:28.959> probably

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
a lot of snow peas out of them probably

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.099 
a lot of snow peas out of them probably
could<00:03:30.280> have<00:03:30.310> planted<00:03:30.639> them<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> little<00:03:31.450> earlier

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
could have planted them a little earlier

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:40.110 
could have planted them a little earlier
but<00:03:32.910> he<00:03:33.910> did<00:03:34.180> what<00:03:34.450> we<00:03:34.480> did<00:03:34.599> and<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:38.549> that's<00:03:39.549> it

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
but he did what we did and so that's it

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.530 
but he did what we did and so that's it
we<00:03:40.480> hope<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.690> get<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:42.489> film<00:03:42.790> covering<00:03:43.359> on

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
we hope to get the film covering on

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
we hope to get the film covering on
here's<00:03:43.989> look<00:03:44.319> down<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.919> table<00:03:45.310> again<00:03:45.430> and

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
here's look down the table again and

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.789 
here's look down the table again and
again<00:03:47.560> as<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:47.919> said<00:03:47.949> the<00:03:48.459> hoops<00:03:48.790> are<00:03:50.819> two<00:03:51.819> feet

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
again as I said the hoops are two feet

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.500 
again as I said the hoops are two feet
above<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.859> ground<00:03:54.129> surface<00:03:54.879> or<00:03:55.329> a<00:03:55.359> little

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
above the ground surface or a little

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.960 
above the ground surface or a little
more<00:03:55.629> than<00:03:55.989> that

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
more than that

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.560 
more than that
and<00:03:59.220> so<00:04:00.220> that's<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:01.140> for<00:04:02.140> this<00:04:02.260> update
