00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
to figure out what is it that puts me in

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.030 
to figure out what is it that puts me in
that<00:01:57.240> zone<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.259> exactly<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
that zone and that's exactly what you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.200 
that zone and that's exactly what you
should<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.280> when<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.490> comes<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.790> poker<00:02:00.060> right

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
so you should figure out what are these

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.959 
so you should figure out what are these
variables<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.520> they're<00:02:02.610> different<00:02:02.820> for

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
variables and they're different for

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.520 
variables and they're different for
everybody<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.570> mean<00:02:03.960> some<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.320> might<00:02:04.500> be

thing that you know those are prophets
and<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.050> for<00:02:23.320> me<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.440> know<00:02:23.590> nighttime<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.400> good

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
and like for me I know nighttime is good

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.520 
and like for me I know nighttime is good
so<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.180> know<00:02:25.330> like<00:02:25.690> between<00:02:26.050> like<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.410> know

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
so I know like between like you know

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.010 
so I know like between like you know
like<00:02:27.370> 1:00<00:02:27.670> a.m.<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.150> 4:00<00:02:28.420> a.m.<00:02:28.450> when<00:02:28.900> my

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
like 1:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. when my

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.750 
like 1:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. when my
office<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.500> really<00:02:29.770> quiet<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.310> can<00:02:30.340> blast

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
office is really quiet and I can blast

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.640 
office is really quiet and I can blast
the<00:02:31.000> music<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.450> put<00:02:31.660> myself<00:02:31.780> in<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.260> zone

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
the music I put myself in the zone

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.470 
the music I put myself in the zone
so<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:33.040> online<00:02:33.250> poker<00:02:33.640> would<00:02:33.850> become<00:02:34.150> legal

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
so if online poker would become legal

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.910 
so if online poker would become legal
again<00:02:34.720> I'd<00:02:34.900> be<00:02:34.960> playing<00:02:35.290> between<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.650> hours

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
again I'd be playing between the hours

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.350 
again I'd be playing between the hours
of<00:02:36.040> 1:00<00:02:36.190> a.m.<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.610> 4:00<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:36.940> 4:00<00:02:37.330> a.m.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
of 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 and 4:00 a.m.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.030 
of 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 and 4:00 a.m.
that's<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.870> times<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.290> play<00:02:38.530> because<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.980> know

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
that's the times I play because I know

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.920 
that's the times I play because I know
that<00:02:39.250> would<00:02:39.370> be<00:02:39.490> my<00:02:39.640> zone<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.420> try<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.660> figure

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
that would be my zone so try to figure

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.960 
that would be my zone so try to figure
it<00:02:41.020> out<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.230> really<00:02:41.620> ask<00:02:41.920> yourself<00:02:42.460> what<00:02:42.760> are

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
it out so I really ask yourself what are

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.820 
it out so I really ask yourself what are

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.410 
those things that put you in that state
and<00:02:45.190> when<00:02:45.340> you're<00:02:45.460> not<00:02:45.580> in<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.790> state<00:02:46.030> don't

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and when you're not in that state don't

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.750 
and when you're not in that state don't
play<00:02:46.600> poker<00:02:46.870> or<00:02:47.200> work<00:02:47.740> or<00:02:47.980> trying<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.460> do<00:02:48.550> those
