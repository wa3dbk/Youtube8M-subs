00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.660
 do not 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.710
 or the people who are in love with me 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.900
 you comment see the statistics of this 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.119
 road to walk and good since it is the only thing 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.040
 that I have touched on this account has been the 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.410
 remington absolutely nothing more and the 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.470
 three streaks of casualties that you have seen 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.809
 nothing absolutely nothing else then we are going to 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.809
 see them let's see the races 1 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.980
 the statistics are of a 1.91 that 6 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.830
 that there were a couple of missions that killed 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.800
 enough and we had to die for 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.410
 power 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.000
 do the revenge is that the rate of 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.350
 wins and losses of 0 21 so that 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.110
 you see with the people who always put me 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.780
 one action per thousand 524 that's because 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.600
 that I can much hot spot and those 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.280
 600 casualties with the remington as we are going to 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.680
 see let's see through your mind with keep 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.050
 we do not have two low turbos that I do not know 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.760
 exactly when I've done them seriously 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.080
 I do not have and I have no idea I think 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.360
 it will have been a knock down I think they are 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.560
 both in the same game if someone does not 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.659
 he knows that he tells me because he is 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.580
 incredible I have no idea of truth that 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.800
 is that I do not remember an inexorable 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.570
 I know if it's when I almost say to see if I 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.690
 sack the nuclear with the warbler would be 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.179
 pretty epic and 48 shots the head the 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.640
 most used weapons 583 with the bust 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.259
 and 00 so those guns are there 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.369
 of ornament because I have not touched another weapon 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.350
 other than the tool I played 16 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.600
 forgive a hot spot two games in 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.979
 domain and one down confirmed the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.250
 measures that we have with these that you see 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.100
 36 bloodthirsty two low turbos six 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.380
 furious casualties 23 triple casualties 77 double 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.840
 low 11 more parties good what are you 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.719
 watching over there I'll leave it for a while 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.399
 video if you want to see it two ruthless 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.509
 some time he pulled me out also did not 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.780
 agreement and 583 losses with the remington a 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.780
 low casualty rate of 174 and a 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.100
 accuracy of 65 percent and 44 shots to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.630
 sometimes you see that it does not touch any other 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.709
 arm what I 'm going to do to teach you 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.759
 this so you can see what I do not know see everything 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.920
 from start to finish until the 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.840
 statistics the equipment that used already 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.730
 you know what these three things are 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.739
 I put the text in the pomegranate 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.470
 kill nothing with the heartfelt grenade and 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.880
 shocked that you usually get to 7 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.480
 only stunned at the 7 ball and the streaks 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.170
 these three gusts that thrown 79 wow is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.190
 sent 191 stocks one sun 55 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.190
 CÃ¡ceres bed all 26 and 28 will attack 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.290
 everyone who killed 37 and that's all that's 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.870
 everything that has been done in this 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.629
 account but if you want to see anything else 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.210
 he had absolutely nothing else be the 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:49.580
 rest you see there are 80,000 points 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.260
 thirty-nine games that because I had 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.020
 to do at the beginning some 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.180
 remington also assists with better to 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.850
 principle to be able to create the class 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.620
 etcetera I made some games for that and 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.640
 so many games so nothing kids 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.650

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.440

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.040
