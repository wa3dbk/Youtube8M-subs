00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello good evening I do not know what 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.580
 time it is but in any case you are 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.060
 sure and monthly it's arnaud tsamer and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.060
 I kiss you 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.770
 the promised thing story in fact this is 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 a game does not come on stage as a 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.270
 arnaud tsamer it is I interpret a 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.620
 character who is not very far in 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.090
 the form of what I am against 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.070
 on the in the background it is very far 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.600
 since it's an eco teacher it's a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.790
 high school teacher going on stage 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.230
 because they did not do it on purpose he 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.900
 promised to his best friend that he was going 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.120
 play his one man show in his place and he 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.260
 made this promise of course without doing 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.760
 but he still did it 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.449
 this promise and so he's obligated to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.100
 keep his promise 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.079
 so they go on stage to play a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.030
 show while he is not comedian 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.500
 and he is obliged to keep this promise 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.300
 because the mate in question he is 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.239
 death 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.949
 seguin I arrived at the hospital she 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.540
 was there lying on his deathbed 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.830
 everything and I leave remy a step of evil 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.960
 immediately at the head everywhere with the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.430
 incessant beeps salary beeps china 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.960
 who measured and she is holding besides 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.250
 in this kind of situation I do not know 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.710
 not what is the most disturbing if 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.940
 it's like seeing your dying friend or beeping 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.990
 beep to his ashes it must be a turn 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.630
 some time it's beep 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.810
 beep it's rather reassuring 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.020
 it's continuous bill it's more pleasant 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.670
 in the ear 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.049
 does it imply is really damn 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.450
 many 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.119
 it's true that it's a little bit 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.429
 a little weird but it has the merit 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.799
 to attract attention in any case from 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.899
 public and that's exactly 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.729
 why we did it with françois 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.149
 rollin and arnaud joyet who are both 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.929
 co authors 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.259
 we thought that the most 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.000
 unstoppable to go on stage and for 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.679
 captivate public attention it was 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.470
 to talk about something strong the 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.179
 theme of death is enough and 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.910
 loud enough for us to say ben 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.579
 yes he was forced to go what my 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.569
 first show 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.000
 actually I played like a lot 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.849
 comedians who started I played on 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.799
 the bide on the staging of the bide 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.500
 it's a form of humor that can 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.849
 seem a little bit of ease in 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.379
 anyway it's not when we 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.569
 start to really work it and to 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.250
 does it become very effective that this 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.870
 who is more bide actually who has not 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.400
 of emptiness at all and in fact when 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.180
 françois rollin saw my first 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.150
 show 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.859
 he told me if you come as a 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.680
 arnaud tsamer we propose this humor 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.870
 there we can tell you I have come 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.220
 see a comedian so you can not me 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.440
 propose to show that 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.120
 bides unless at the end you tell me 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.040
 you show me that you really know 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.690
 to make ventriloquism the guitar and 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.940
 those things that I did not know did he 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.739
 told me if you want to play it on 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.870
 numbers a little bit missed and put 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.579
 on stage things a little missed it takes 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.239
 that the character you are playing has 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.799
 not a comedian 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.500
 we have to say low it's normal 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.650
 the poor guy obviously since he 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.720
 is not a comedian and therefore a teacher 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.370
 of eco a high school teacher world on stage 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.169
 is effective and obviously it's not 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.489
 that it's not very successful what makes 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.440
 since he is an eco teacher he is not 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.639
 comedian then after we can say yes 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.959
 but what we need on stage 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.519
 does not care if he's on stage and that's 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.060
 where the theme of death is 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.410
 unstoppable 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.389
 well he's on stage because he did 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.190
 a promise to a dead friend 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.519
 okay so ok so there everything stands 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.739
 so well gentlemen I consider myself 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.520
 that ventriloquism is no longer a 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.370
 disciplined 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.910
 at how would I say is no longer a 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.860
 shit discipline practiced by 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.330
 old- fashioned old- fashioned old and besides 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.860
 besides, moreover, that sense there are 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:59.170
 ventriloquists in the room and well I 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:02.990
 their southern Shiites so yeah then 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.700
 so to do this I'm going to take 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.660
 this stuffed load 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:14.360
 I will put it like this 1 next 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:18.080
 I put his hand in his stomach 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.030
 here and I'll go offer you this 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.360
 number you're going to see it's going to be fine 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.360
 pouilly 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:31.530
 I grew up in a very 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.169
 comfortable finally here I missed 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.430
 nothing things have ever happened to me 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.340
 serious in life 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.169
 I have never been a victim of injustice and 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.090
 so I have nothing to claim 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.190
 I do not have gold and I have no origin 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:52.050
 particular or in any case 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.910
 interesting to talk I have no jets 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.860
 not quite particular life course 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.270
 to laugh at it is in any case to have 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.340
 the claim to think that it can 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.810
 interest people so well I'm doing 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.250
 the absurd because I do not want to 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.630
 to talk about something else because 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.979
 I do not feel legitimate talked about 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.210
 I feel no policy has legitimate 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.220
 talked about religion I do not feel 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.979
 little to legitimate policy talked about the 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.009
 company that surrounds me I am nobody 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.870
 to say that it's good that's bad I 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.940
 see here I am I am nobody what 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.080
 so well I'm going to laugh and I'm going to do 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.400
 I will try as I still 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.199
 want to make people laugh because 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.699
 I think it's something that 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.710
 is noble and that's what I want 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.919
 to do well I'll make them laugh 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.750
 that's talking about something else and so 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.759
 using absurd using 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.020
 a slightly surreal humor and in 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.520
 trying to offer them things 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.440
 that's why I'm always looking for 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.199
 to be a bit original in form because 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.360
 only because as on the bottom I 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.889
 nothing to say nothing really very 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.270
 powerful as a message to pass 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.560
 France must be original to 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.289
 that it touches people was telling me my 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.729
 little falcon where were you spent is this 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.530
 that demand besides tonight my 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.530
 little feng shui or was of the past 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:05.899
 because I say yes to 12 220 he 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:07.129
 gives no Christmas then after it goes very 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.240
 quickly in the head to mons imagine everything and 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.039
 anytime if it is facing 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.360
 at home he falls on the river party 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.949
 party wii party left and gone to 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.569
 right it barely whips away super party 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.029
 far we do not know it's boring this thing 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.999
 files or a ray bill for me do not me 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:25.580
 not leave in this disarray 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:28.159
 you enjoyed it so obviously it does not 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.589
 will not answer it's a plush see 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.179
 it's completely inert stop I him 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:34.309
 fires violently on the tail bombay no 

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:36.709
 not even protest 1 because this is 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:45.139
 not alive even though it's very very good 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:47.389
 imitated by the way a change in the 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.419
 show is where it has evolved a lot 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.830
 since a year and a half is that 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.240
 it's that I'm more comfortable with myself 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.269
 my public relation and that I 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.959
 allow in my role as a teacher 

00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:01.219
 high school I allow myself here to be 

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:03.740
 that's more with the audience so 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:06.879
 the show takes in thick it takes 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.879
 in thickness thanks to what
