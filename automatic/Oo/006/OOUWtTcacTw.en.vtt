00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
we're gonna go from there pretty much

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.810 
we're gonna go from there pretty much
gonna<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.150> same<00:00:30.390> pivots<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.820> swivel

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
gonna have the same pivots and swivel

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.520 
gonna have the same pivots and swivel
plates<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.270> stuff<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> middle<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.320> my

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
plates and stuff in the middle like my

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.959 
plates and stuff in the middle like my
four-wheel-drive<00:00:34.950> did<00:00:35.550> we're<00:00:35.670> gonna<00:00:35.820> keep

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
four-wheel-drive did we're gonna keep

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.850 
four-wheel-drive did we're gonna keep
the<00:00:36.149> same<00:00:36.180> design<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.380> probably<00:00:37.649> enough<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the same design it's probably enough to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
the same design it's probably enough to
get<00:00:37.980> length<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.430> some<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:39.210> couple<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.989> things

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
get length and some a couple of things

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.619 
get length and some a couple of things
might<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.710> changed<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.460> there

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
might have to get changed here and there

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.520 
might have to get changed here and there
but<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.750> gonna<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.899> basically<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.500> same

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
but it's gonna be basically the same

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.010 
but it's gonna be basically the same
deal<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:45.120> anyways<00:00:45.420> I'm<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.809> working

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
deal so anyways I'm going to be working

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
deal so anyways I'm going to be working
on<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> next<00:00:47.910> couple

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
right hand depending on which way you're

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.270 
right hand depending on which way you're
looking<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.860> able<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
looking at it I was able to get the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760 
looking at it I was able to get the
brake<00:01:11.430> band<00:01:11.610> off<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.750> drum<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.740> a

brake band off and the drum but have a
look<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> axle<00:01:14.540> as<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.780> could<00:01:15.930> see<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:17.460> got

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
look at the axle as you could see it got

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.340 
look at the axle as you could see it got
loose<00:01:17.909> over<00:01:18.330> time<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:18.780> someone<00:01:18.990> was<00:01:19.170> using

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
loose over time when someone was using

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.859 
loose over time when someone was using
it<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.759> keyway<00:01:21.090> ended<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.360> breaking<00:01:21.600> off

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it and the keyway ended up breaking off

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.899 
it and the keyway ended up breaking off
a<00:01:21.900> piece<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> axle<00:01:23.250> would<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.759> be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
a piece out of the axle would you be

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.080 
a piece out of the axle would you be
these<00:01:24.119> two<00:01:24.299> pieces<00:01:24.509> right<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.700> here's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
these two pieces right here and here's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.700 
these two pieces right here and here's
the<00:01:27.270> key<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.810> was<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> which<00:01:28.409> there's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the key way that was in it which there's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.560 
the key way that was in it which there's
really<00:01:28.890> not<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> whole<00:01:29.549> heck<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.000> lot<00:01:30.030> left<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
really not a whole heck of a lot left to

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.200 
really not a whole heck of a lot left to
it<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.470> pretty<00:01:31.650> tough<00:01:31.890> shape<00:01:32.210> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it so it's in pretty tough shape and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.300 
it so it's in pretty tough shape and
because<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.750> these<00:01:33.900> pieces<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.770> getting

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
because of these pieces here getting

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.819 
because of these pieces here getting
wedged<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> was<00:01:37.409> using<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
wedged up like this when I was using the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.080 
wedged up like this when I was using the
puller<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:39.270> impact<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:41.670> ended<00:01:42.030> up

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
puller and the impact it ended up

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660 
puller and the impact it ended up
breaking<00:01:42.329> part<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> brake<00:01:44.280> drum<00:01:44.310> off

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
breaking part of the brake drum off

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.870 
breaking part of the brake drum off
because<00:01:45.630> they<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.990> pried<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> right<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:46.880> but

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
because they just pried it right up but

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.910 
because they just pried it right up but
on<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.630> tractor<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.229> only<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.619> brakes

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
on this tractor we can only have brakes

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.530 
on this tractor we can only have brakes
on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> rear<00:01:50.280> transmission<00:01:51.060> which<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.240> going

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
on the rear transmission which is going

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.899 
on the rear transmission which is going
to<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.680> we're<00:01:52.799> using<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.790> I'm

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
to be this one that we're using so I'm

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.010 
to be this one that we're using so I'm
going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> need<00:01:54.299> only<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.780> need<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
brake drums on the back and for the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.859 
brake drums on the back and for the
front<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:57.030> probably<00:01:57.240> going<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> take<00:01:57.659> off

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
gonna get some wheel horse hubs because

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
gonna get some wheel horse hubs because
they're<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> flat<00:02:03.659> hubs<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.590> simple

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
they're just the flat hubs really simple

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.230 
they're just the flat hubs really simple
and<00:02:05.280> we're<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:05.759> those<00:02:06.000> for

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and we're just going to use those for

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.210 
and we're just going to use those for
the<00:02:06.299> front<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.869> I'm<00:02:06.960> gonna<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.350> should<00:02:08.190> have

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the front so I'm gonna have should have

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.529 
the front so I'm gonna have should have
another<00:02:08.520> good<00:02:08.759> hub<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.239> front

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
another good hub on the front

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.820 
another good hub on the front
transmission<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> other<00:02:10.259> one<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:10.619> in

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
transmission the other one I have up in

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.910 
transmission the other one I have up in
the<00:02:10.920> shed

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
the shed

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.160 
the shed
but<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.490> also<00:02:12.670> noticed<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.569> one<00:02:13.750> was<00:02:13.900> broken

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
but I also noticed this one was broken

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.809 
but I also noticed this one was broken
for<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> while<00:02:14.709> because<00:02:15.130> he<00:02:15.220> could<00:02:15.459> see<00:02:15.670> it's

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
for a while because he could see it's

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.270 
for a while because he could see it's
dirty<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.510> there<00:02:16.959> where<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.709> know<00:02:17.830> goes<00:02:18.099> down

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
dirty in there where you know goes down

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.960 
dirty in there where you know goes down
into<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.520> break<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:20.489> even<00:02:21.489> still<00:02:21.760> when

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
into the break so even still when

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.610 
into the break so even still when
someone<00:02:22.300> was<00:02:22.450> using<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.200> was<00:02:23.290> starting

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
someone was using this it was starting

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.320 
someone was using this it was starting
to<00:02:23.709> crack<00:02:23.920> itself<00:02:24.250> apart<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:24.940> it's<00:02:25.150> not<00:02:25.270> a

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
to crack itself apart so it's not a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.860 
to crack itself apart so it's not a
complete<00:02:25.930> loss<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:28.150> anyways<00:02:28.540> we're<00:02:28.780> gonna

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
complete loss but anyways we're gonna

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.020 
complete loss but anyways we're gonna
get<00:02:29.050> started<00:02:29.530> by<00:02:29.739> pulling<00:02:30.100> off<00:02:30.250> these<00:02:30.520> axle

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
get started by pulling off these axle

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.610 
get started by pulling off these axle
housings<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.020> way<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.230> can<00:02:32.319> get<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
housings so that way we can get to the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:51.059 
housings so that way we can get to the
differential<00:02:33.040> alright<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:33.970> got<00:02:34.209> all<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.480> bolts

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.140 

let's<00:02:52.069> gonna<00:02:52.220> hope<00:02:53.500> zoom<00:02:54.500> out<00:02:54.680> there<00:02:55.120> get<00:02:56.120> a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
let's gonna hope zoom out there get a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.710 
let's gonna hope zoom out there get a
pretty<00:02:56.390> fair<00:02:56.780> amount<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:58.120> gunk<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.299> there<00:02:59.510> so

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
pretty fair amount of gunk in there so

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.990 
pretty fair amount of gunk in there so
that's<00:02:59.780> all<00:02:59.989> gonna<00:03:00.170> have<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.319> get<00:03:00.440> wiped<00:03:00.650> out

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
that's all gonna have to get wiped out

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.460 
that's all gonna have to get wiped out
and<00:03:02.000> that's<00:03:02.180> for<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.390> axle<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.110> doesn't<00:03:03.379> look

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
and that's for the axle it doesn't look

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.770 
and that's for the axle it doesn't look
too<00:03:03.650> bad

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
too bad

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.930 
too bad
got<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.810> lot<00:03:06.019> of<00:03:06.049> grease<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.069> stuff<00:03:07.549> left<00:03:07.790> in

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
got a lot of grease and stuff left in

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.800 
got a lot of grease and stuff left in

one<00:03:12.049> when<00:03:12.379> I<00:03:12.470> got<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:12.980> had<00:03:13.129> a<00:03:13.160> lot<00:03:13.489> of

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
one when I got this and had a lot of

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.160 
one when I got this and had a lot of
leaves<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.390> stuff<00:03:14.629> in<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.019> as<00:03:15.079> you

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
leaves and the stuff in it and as you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.289 
leaves and the stuff in it and as you
could<00:03:15.319> see<00:03:15.530> it's<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.920> lot<00:03:16.579> still<00:03:16.910> in<00:03:17.060> there<00:03:17.269> and

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
could see it's a lot still in there and

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.569 
could see it's a lot still in there and
I<00:03:17.420> gave<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.780> washout<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.769> really<00:03:19.459> gotta

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
I gave it a washout but I really gotta

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.920 
I gave it a washout but I really gotta
get<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:19.819> differential<00:03:20.450> out<00:03:20.599> so<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.780> could

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
get this differential out so I could

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.449 
get this differential out so I could
scrape<00:03:21.170> everything<00:03:21.530> else<00:03:21.829> out<00:03:22.069> of<00:03:22.099> it

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
scrape everything else out of it

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.059 
scrape everything else out of it
so<00:03:23.090> anyways<00:03:23.390> we'll<00:03:23.569> flip<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:23.959> around<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.680> we

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
so anyways we'll flip this around and we

00:03:25.069 --> 00:04:00.970 
so anyways we'll flip this around and we
could<00:03:25.220> pull<00:03:25.400> off<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.700> other<00:03:25.849> side

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.620 

only<00:04:01.980> gonna<00:04:02.100> have<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.460> run<00:04:02.640> off<00:04:02.790> run<00:04:03.360> some

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
only gonna have to run off run some

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.650 
only gonna have to run off run some
sandpaper<00:04:03.990> over<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.590> axle<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.040> get<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.280> out

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
sandpaper over that axle to get it out

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.320 
sandpaper over that axle to get it out
but<00:04:07.040> all<00:04:08.040> that's<00:04:08.430> gonna<00:04:08.610> have<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.820> get<00:04:09.030> cleaned

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
but all that's gonna have to get cleaned

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.570 
but all that's gonna have to get cleaned
up<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:10.110> might<00:04:10.290> even<00:04:10.470> take<00:04:10.800> the

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
up and I might even take the

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.130 
up and I might even take the
differential<00:04:12.000> here<00:04:12.390> apart<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.840> get<00:04:12.960> to<00:04:13.020> the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
differential here apart to get to the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
spider gears to see how they look inside

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.970 
spider gears to see how they look inside
you<00:04:15.510> can<00:04:15.630> see<00:04:15.780> they're<00:04:15.930> still<00:04:16.170> needs<00:04:16.500> left<00:04:16.769> in

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
you can see they're still needs left in

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.300 
you can see they're still needs left in
there<00:04:18.170> in<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.320> worm<00:04:19.530> gear<00:04:19.739> doesn't<00:04:20.040> look<00:04:20.130> too

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
there in the worm gear doesn't look too

there in the worm gear doesn't look too
bad<00:04:20.340> except<00:04:20.850> for<00:04:20.880> all<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.120> junk<00:04:21.360> around<00:04:21.540> it

bad except for all the junk around it
and<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:24.000> was<00:04:24.180> also<00:04:24.360> repaired<00:04:24.900> here<00:04:25.230> this

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
and this was also repaired here this

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.730 
and this was also repaired here this
bolt<00:04:25.710> or<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:26.910> boss<00:04:27.870> was<00:04:28.200> around<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.620> or

bolt or this boss was around it or
whatever<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.040> want<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.280> call<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.640> so

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
whatever you want to call it so

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.270 
whatever you want to call it so
hopefully<00:04:31.140> if<00:04:31.230> that's<00:04:31.380> still<00:04:31.590> strong<00:04:32.010> it's

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
hopefully if that's still strong it's

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.890 
hopefully if that's still strong it's
not<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.730> it's<00:04:32.910> not<00:04:33.030> too<00:04:33.210> bad<00:04:33.390> I'm<00:04:33.570> gonna<00:04:33.660> put

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
not and it's not too bad I'm gonna put

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.750 
not and it's not too bad I'm gonna put
some<00:04:34.110> metal<00:04:34.470> patch<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.100> fill<00:04:35.310> around<00:04:35.580> there

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
some metal patch and fill around there

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.760 
some metal patch and fill around there
and<00:04:35.850> smooth<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.300> out<00:04:36.390> so<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:37.410> know<00:04:37.500> it'll<00:04:37.710> be

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
and smooth it out so I know it'll be

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.100 
and smooth it out so I know it'll be
sealed<00:04:38.250> sealed<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.570> then<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:39.750> won't<00:04:39.900> have<00:04:40.020> to

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
sealed sealed and then I won't have to

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.130 
sealed sealed and then I won't have to
worry<00:04:40.290> about<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.760> as<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.510> can<00:04:42.630> see<00:04:42.690> the

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
worry about that and as you can see the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.250 
worry about that and as you can see the
Swift<00:04:43.500> Matic<00:04:43.920> dogs<00:04:44.630> aren't<00:04:45.630> actually<00:04:46.050> in<00:04:46.110> too

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
Swift Matic dogs aren't actually in too

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.080 
Swift Matic dogs aren't actually in too
bad<00:04:46.410> of<00:04:46.560> shape<00:04:46.590> they<00:04:47.400> have<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.580> little<00:04:47.880> bit<00:04:48.000> of

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
but they're not you know I had an angle

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.420 
but they're not you know I had an angle
or<00:04:52.140> anything<00:04:52.320> like<00:04:52.560> that<00:04:52.620> they<00:04:53.040> still<00:04:53.280> have<00:04:53.370> a

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
or anything like that they still have a

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.790 
or anything like that they still have a

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
nice fairly true square to them so I'll

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.530 
nice fairly true square to them so I'll
probably<00:04:55.920> just<00:04:56.100> file<00:04:56.370> those<00:04:56.610> up<00:04:56.820> nicely<00:04:57.090> and

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
probably just file those up nicely and

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.980 
probably just file those up nicely and
those<00:04:58.500> should<00:04:58.710> be<00:04:58.830> all<00:04:58.920> set<00:04:59.450> so<00:05:00.450> anyways<00:05:00.780> I'll

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
those should be all set so anyways I'll

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.409 
those should be all set so anyways I'll
get<00:05:01.170> this<00:05:01.670> axle<00:05:02.670> cleaned<00:05:02.910> up<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.240> then<00:05:03.360> I

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
get this axle cleaned up and then I

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.760 
get this axle cleaned up and then I
should<00:05:03.480> be<00:05:03.630> able<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:03.870> slip<00:05:04.080> slip<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.620> whole

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770

all<00:05:06.570> right<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.169> differential<00:05:07.890> is<00:05:08.070> out<00:05:08.450> and

all right the differential is out and

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.050 
all right the differential is out and
after<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:10.919> could<00:05:11.100> really<00:05:11.280> look<00:05:11.430> at<00:05:11.580> them<00:05:11.760> dogs

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
after I could really look at them dogs

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.060 
after I could really look at them dogs
I'm<00:05:12.480> definitely<00:05:12.990> happy<00:05:13.320> with<00:05:13.350> them<00:05:13.650> they're

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
I'm definitely happy with them they're

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.420 
I'm definitely happy with them they're
in<00:05:14.250> great<00:05:14.550> shape<00:05:14.760> as<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.240> had<00:05:15.360> said<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:16.040> also<00:05:17.040> got

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
in great shape as I had said I also got

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.480 
in great shape as I had said I also got
the<00:05:17.730> shifting<00:05:18.210> fork<00:05:18.540> out<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.800> all<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.370> other

inside of this housing doesn't look too

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.650 
inside of this housing doesn't look too
bad<00:05:28.650> it's<00:05:29.040> got<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.250> usual<00:05:29.640> junk<00:05:29.970> inside<00:05:30.390> of<00:05:30.570> it

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.200 
bad it's got the usual junk inside of it
and<00:05:31.020> that<00:05:31.310> lever<00:05:32.310> there<00:05:32.580> doesn't<00:05:32.940> look<00:05:33.060> too

gonna<00:05:35.820> find<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.210> hole<00:05:36.240> where<00:05:36.660> that<00:05:36.810> bolt<00:05:37.080> goes

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
gonna find the hole where that bolt goes

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.430 
gonna find the hole where that bolt goes
which<00:05:38.700> is<00:05:38.880> right<00:05:39.150> there<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:41.610> guys<00:05:41.790> can<00:05:42.060> see<00:05:42.270> it

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
which is right there you guys can see it

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.690 
which is right there you guys can see it
so<00:05:43.440> I<00:05:43.470> don't<00:05:43.560> have<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.830> wipe<00:05:44.010> that<00:05:44.040> off<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:44.580> see

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
so I don't have to wipe that off and see

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.610 
so I don't have to wipe that off and see
if<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:44.850> can<00:05:45.000> find<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.330> crack<00:05:45.630> anywhere<00:05:46.110> hopefully
