00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.770 
that on to where both of these eye
shadows<00:02:19.780> met<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.400> lid<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:22.300> help<00:02:22.330> blend

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
shadows met on the lid to help blend

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.660 
shadows met on the lid to help blend
them<00:02:23.020> into<00:02:23.170> one<00:02:23.440> another<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:24.040> really

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
them into one another and that really

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.880 
them into one another and that really
helped<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.960> create<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.500> seamless

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
helped to create that seamless

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.890 
helped to create that seamless
transition<00:02:27.760> from<00:02:27.970> super<00:02:28.360> mom<00:02:28.510> into

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
transition from super mom into

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.180 
transition from super mom into
fashionista<00:02:29.590> when<00:02:29.890> you're<00:02:30.010> blending

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
fashionista when you're blending

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.800 
fashionista when you're blending
eyeshadows<00:02:30.730> together<00:02:31.030> like<00:02:31.240> this<00:02:31.390> on<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.630> lid

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
eyeshadows together like this on the lid

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.660 
eyeshadows together like this on the lid
I<00:02:31.990> find<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.530> helps<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.860> apply<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> little

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
I find that it helps to apply a little

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.760 
I find that it helps to apply a little
bit<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.270> lid<00:02:34.480> wipe<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.320> brush<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.650> any

bit on to the lid wipe the brush of any

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.550 
bit on to the lid wipe the brush of any
excess<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.190> then<00:02:36.430> use<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> blank<00:02:37.030> brush<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.810> Pat

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
excess and then use a blank brush to Pat

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.960 
excess and then use a blank brush to Pat
in<00:02:38.770> between<00:02:39.100> all<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.520> colors<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:39.820> that

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
in between all of the colors so that

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.480 
in between all of the colors so that
they<00:02:40.240> blend<00:02:40.540> into<00:02:40.780> one<00:02:40.900> another<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:42.400> I'm
