the 2 and now our alpha 3 and what's

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.570 
the 2 and now our alpha 3 and what's
different<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:13.530> really<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> lot<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.309> bug<00:00:14.549> fixes

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
different is really a lot of bug fixes

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.820 
different is really a lot of bug fixes
so<00:00:15.210> they've<00:00:15.839> improved<00:00:16.350> panning<00:00:16.770> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
so they've improved panning and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
so they've improved panning and
scrolling<00:00:17.220> they've<00:00:17.520> improved<00:00:17.880> startup<00:00:18.420> time

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
scrolling they've improved startup time

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.279 
scrolling they've improved startup time
revised<00:00:19.320> theme<00:00:20.180> improved<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.420> polish<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
revised theme improved you I polish and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.620 
revised theme improved you I polish and
things<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.949> overall<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.090> too

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
things like that overall it's not too

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.750 
things like that overall it's not too
too<00:00:25.050> different<00:00:25.470> from<00:00:25.680> alpha<00:00:26.130> 2<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.580> if<00:00:26.640> you've

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
too different from alpha 2 so if you've

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000 
too different from alpha 2 so if you've
tested<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.660> before<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.109> very<00:00:28.289> similar<00:00:28.590> but

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
tested that before it's very similar but

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.259 
tested that before it's very similar but
we'll<00:00:29.160> take<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> look<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:29.760> if<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.000> notice

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
we'll take a look and see if we notice

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.870 
we'll take a look and see if we notice
anything<00:00:30.660> terribly<00:00:31.439> different<00:00:31.820> okay<00:00:32.820> so

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
anything terribly different okay so

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
anything terribly different okay so
let's<00:00:33.149> test<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.809> improve<00:00:34.170> startup<00:00:34.559> time

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
let's test out that improve startup time

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.049 
let's test out that improve startup time
we're<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> tap<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.520> little<00:00:35.700> fennec

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we're going to tap on this little fennec

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:48.470 
we're going to tap on this little fennec
icon<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:37.680> how<00:00:37.890> long<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.129> takes

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 

okay<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.410> was<00:00:49.500> about<00:00:49.649> 11<00:00:50.160> seconds<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
okay so that it was about 11 seconds and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.010 
okay so that it was about 11 seconds and
if<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:50.970> think<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> opera<00:00:51.660> mobile<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
if you think about it opera mobile is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.470 
if you think about it opera mobile is
about<00:00:52.200> six<00:00:52.559> seconds<00:00:52.950> so<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.220> still<00:00:53.430> slow<00:00:53.790> but

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
about six seconds so it's still slow but

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
about six seconds so it's still slow but
compared<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> previous<00:00:55.680> alphas<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> fennec

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
compared to previous alphas of fennec

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
compared to previous alphas of fennec
it's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> lot<00:00:56.970> faster<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.110> let's<00:00:58.290> go<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.470> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
it's a lot faster so let's go to a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.710 
it's a lot faster so let's go to a
website<00:00:58.770> let's<00:00:59.160> start<00:00:59.430> off<00:00:59.579> by<00:00:59.879> tapping<00:01:00.600> on

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.590 
the right of that is really the first
screen<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.490> we<00:03:21.730> saw<00:03:21.940> with<00:03:22.150> all<00:03:22.360> of<00:03:22.480> the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
screen that we saw with all of the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.280 
screen that we saw with all of the
options<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:23.230> change<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.800> various<00:03:24.210> settings

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
options to change the various settings

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.110 
options to change the various settings
so<00:03:26.290> fennec<00:03:26.650> alpha<00:03:26.980> 3<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.460> not<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.880> much

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
so fennec alpha 3 is not that much

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.880 
so fennec alpha 3 is not that much
better<00:03:28.300> than<00:03:28.540> previous<00:03:28.990> versions<00:03:29.020> there<00:03:29.800> are

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
better than previous versions there are

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.620 
better than previous versions there are
probably<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.370> lot<00:03:30.550> of<00:03:30.700> under<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:30.970> hood<00:03:31.240> bug

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
probably a lot of under the hood bug

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.410 
probably a lot of under the hood bug
fixes<00:03:32.140> but<00:03:32.350> from<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.040> end-user<00:03:33.490> perspective

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
fixes but from the end-user perspective

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.210 
fixes but from the end-user perspective
it's<00:03:35.050> really<00:03:35.290> not<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.470> different<00:03:35.950> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
it's really not that different and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.520 
it's really not that different and
there's<00:03:36.340> still<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.610> lot<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.480> room<00:03:37.900> left<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.320> make

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
there's still a lot of room left to make

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.800 
there's still a lot of room left to make
improvement<00:03:39.130> obviously<00:03:40.120> this<00:03:40.240> is<00:03:40.390> an<00:03:40.480> alpha

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
improvement obviously this is an alpha

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.080 
improvement obviously this is an alpha
it's<00:03:40.960> not<00:03:41.140> even<00:03:41.350> in<00:03:41.470> beta<00:03:41.680> yet<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.760> Mozilla

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
it's not even in beta yet so the Mozilla

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.870 
it's not even in beta yet so the Mozilla
developers<00:03:43.630> know<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:44.080> but<00:03:44.830> at<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:45.610> point

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
developers know this but at this point

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.580 
developers know this but at this point
there's<00:03:46.210> still<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.600> lot<00:03:46.900> left<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.290> be<00:03:47.350> desired

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
there's still a lot left to be desired

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.130 
there's still a lot left to be desired
and<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:48.610> it's<00:03:48.910> far<00:03:49.210> from<00:03:49.420> being<00:03:49.630> able<00:03:49.960> to<00:03:50.050> be

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
and and it's far from being able to be

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.950 
and and it's far from being able to be
used<00:03:50.350> as<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:51.130> daily<00:03:51.400> driver<00:03:51.840> because<00:03:52.840> there's

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
used as a daily driver because there's

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.660 
used as a daily driver because there's
just<00:03:53.020> so<00:03:53.320> many<00:03:53.470> problems<00:03:53.800> with<00:03:54.040> bugs<00:03:54.340> and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
just so many problems with bugs and

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.520 
just so many problems with bugs and
things<00:03:54.880> just<00:03:55.090> not<00:03:55.270> working<00:03:55.750> very<00:03:55.780> well<00:03:56.020> so

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
things just not working very well so

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.810 
things just not working very well so
we'll<00:03:56.650> keep<00:03:56.740> an<00:03:56.890> eye<00:03:57.010> on<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.220> development<00:03:57.700> of

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
we'll keep an eye on the development of

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.730 
we'll keep an eye on the development of
Venice<00:03:58.210> we'll<00:03:58.420> be<00:03:58.540> back<00:03:58.720> when<00:03:59.020> there<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.500> new

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
Venice we'll be back when there is a new

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.570 
Venice we'll be back when there is a new
build<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.130> talk<00:04:00.310> about<00:04:00.460> that's<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.300> for<00:04:01.480> now
