00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
anti spin path on the floor my hope is

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
anti spin path on the floor my hope is
going<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.390> left<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.170> walking<00:01:22.439> left

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
going right to left but I'm walking left

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.270 
going right to left but I'm walking left
right<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.750> open<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.170> into<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.710> I'm

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
right and as I open up into this I'm

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.569 
right and as I open up into this I'm
turning<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.720> I'm<00:01:27.810> also<00:01:28.049> walking<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
turning but I'm also walking in the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
turning but I'm also walking in the
circle<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.090> I've<00:01:30.210> imagined<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> floor

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
circle that I've imagined on the floor

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:48.540 
circle that I've imagined on the floor
or<00:01:32.040> rocking<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.329> out

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.730 

I<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:51.640> most<00:01:51.910> about<00:01:52.120> teaching<00:01:52.960> from<00:01:53.380> here<00:01:53.620> is

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
I like most about teaching from here is

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.950 
I like most about teaching from here is
that<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.980> beginner<00:01:54.310> kalka<00:01:54.970> walkin<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.660> just

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
that a beginner kalka walkin and just

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.540 
that a beginner kalka walkin and just
feed<00:01:56.320> her<00:01:56.440> being<00:01:56.680> at<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.920> waist<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.400> one

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
feed her being at the waist in one

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.450 
feed her being at the waist in one
direction<00:01:57.730> and<00:01:58.270> still<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.980> get<00:01:59.980> something<00:02:00.190> out

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
direction and still I get something out

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.550 
direction and still I get something out
of<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.580> material<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:02.170> when<00:02:02.290> you<00:02:02.380> get

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
of the material but when you get

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.650 
of the material but when you get
students<00:02:02.980> in<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:04.120> have<00:02:04.240> been<00:02:04.390> hoping

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
students in that you have been hoping

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.600 
students in that you have been hoping
for<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.930> while<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.470> have<00:02:06.070> some<00:02:06.100> tricks<00:02:06.460> under

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
for a while and have some tricks under

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.370 
for a while and have some tricks under
their<00:02:06.850> sleeves<00:02:07.240> they<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.480> apply<00:02:07.690> this<00:02:07.810> to

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
their sleeves they can apply this to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.010 
their sleeves they can apply this to
those<00:02:08.560> things<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.490> it<00:02:10.210> changes<00:02:10.570> things<00:02:10.780> up

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
those things and it changes things up

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:23.809 
those things and it changes things up
and<00:02:11.320> make<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.400> little<00:02:12.550> more<00:02:12.730> interesting

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.479 

and<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.269> when<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.450> teach<00:02:25.569> many<00:02:26.049> zits<00:02:26.500> it's<00:02:26.860> all

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
and so when I teach many zits it's all

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
access points and all the different

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.229 
access points and all the different
currents<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.519> brakes<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.090> the

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
currents and the brakes and the

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.479 
currents and the brakes and the
directions<00:02:35.049> and<00:02:35.379> opposing<00:02:35.920> currents<00:02:36.250> and

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
directions and opposing currents and

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.030 
directions and opposing currents and
they<00:02:36.670> all<00:02:36.819> apply<00:02:37.230> they<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.410> get<00:02:38.590> taught<00:02:38.890> a
