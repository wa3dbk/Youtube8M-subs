00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:03.780
 personally so literally run over outwardly 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.010
 there is our guarantee only 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:14.400
 need to communicate with a knife is our every 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:17.360
 the lesson goes directly to the liner with 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.640
 indicating the serial number is important 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.009
 subframe on site and with measurement 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.200
 the hardness of each particular 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.220
 some kind of krynka 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 specifically for this steel 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.479
 data exactly the knife is made of material and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.630
 steel ua-ix r7 and hardening 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.299
 was produced to level 65 half 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.220
 threshold kulu 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.630
 this vice, that is, it is with me and 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.340
 Northerners are now here was not just to sgn 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.420
 in principle , we have not been to the steppe 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.189
 periodically well, as a water utility, we do not 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.990
 got fruit for president january 9 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.060
 14 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:20.080
 years and here it comes with 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:20.080
 wooden box all the lamps are visible 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.849
 surely that immediately draws the virus 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.420
 quality polishing quality polishing on 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:44.160
 just phenomenal that is so 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:56.610
 polishing it but not on one 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:56.610
 the best mirror is just tire noise 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.950
 to the shallow structure is extremely nice 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.580
 Actively direct this feel 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.580
 almost imperceptibly 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:29.150
 here stingray leather no axial screws 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.150
 There is no such construction practically 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.849
 monolithic is very good for us here especially 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.200
 no more talk about him like that 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:47.250
 never would you just admire it 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.450
 polishing for what it looks like with a point 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.459
 view directly opinion of the data 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.989
 Knives are good remarkably less 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.750

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.409
 the beginning of the video go see me sukova 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.409

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:08.819
 there was a rockstead knife tire on our channel 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:21.750
 with steel in xr 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:24.030
 7 das to her that black blade to each 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.919
 I wish the threshold study to fuck personal 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.460
