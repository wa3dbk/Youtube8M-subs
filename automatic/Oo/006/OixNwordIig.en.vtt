00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.200
 the UK turned out 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.700
 art specialist in building 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.410
 Potemkin villages guests large 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.560
 the eight is supposed to see only that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.910
 that the host allowed 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.830
 secret service finger and here at every turn 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.359
 northern ireland at a time big 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.070
 eight actually became a zone 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.529
 barbed wire 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.140
 the organizers have spent millions of pounds 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.120
 sterling but hold yourself worthy 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.950
 it is a fact now they still could not 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.020
 Russian President Putin the day before 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.539
 had to stay overnight in london 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.739
 because the venue 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.600
 it turned out simply not ready 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.100
 organizational trouble by the way 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.930
 pale against the background of what 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.399
 information atmosphere passes itself 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 summit american and british 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.019
 special services as writes English newspapers 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.030
 at past such meetings auditioned 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.980
 conversations of members of foreign delegations 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.170
 the scandal will definitely spoil the mood 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.239
 leaders while discussing an already 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.640
 extremely difficult theme of the situation around 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.200
 Syria bright red suitcase British 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.630
 premier cameron is bringing his suggestions 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.040
 to resolve the Syrian problem they 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.259
 however in many respects coincide with 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.880
 American line a few days 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.680
 before the summit they said they were starting 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.869
 arm the Syrian militants 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490
 since the authorities of the country have brightly crossed you 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.040
 the red line was applied chemical 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.140
 weapons strongly oppose such 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.630
 approaches are essentially only Russia 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 supply weapons to militants to break 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.200
 international law 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.390
 firm position of the Russian leadership 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.430
 causes obvious irritation in many 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.390
 how was the question put to Putin 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.790
 from bbc 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.560
 remind site Prime Minister Cameron 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.630
 said in the past that those who 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.390
 supports the president of al-assad 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.700
 blood of syrian children russia arms 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.530
 one of the parties to the conflict is not hypocritical 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.509
 while criticizing those who intend to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.170
 arm the other side and about 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.840
 of whose hands are the blood of citizens in that 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.710
 number and children i think that you won't 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:11.060
 deny 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:14.390
 blood on the arms on both sides and always 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.910
 the question is who is to blame for it 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.000
 I think that you will not deny that 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.030
 hardly worth supporting people who 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.320
 not only kill their enemies but 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.210
 hide their bodies and eat them 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.970
 entrails in front of the public and under 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.570
 cameras you want to support these people 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.410
 do you want these people to supply weapons 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:39.440
 but then it probably hardly has any 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.980
 the attitude towards human values 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.260
 who have been preaching for hundreds of years 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.800
 confessed in europe by russia 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.600
 delivers weapons to a legitimate 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.890
 to the Syrian government in full 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.150
 Compliance with international standards 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.340
 right we don't break anything i want it 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.350
 emphasize nothing 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.540
 however as for the essence of the problem i 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:11.380
 I think that we should not think about 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:14.870
 this we all need to think about the victims 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.910
 the number of which is multiplied and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.510
 the result of the civil war which 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.500
 in fact ra goes to Libya and 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.730
 the result of the application of rocket and bomb 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.160
 strikes across this country we are all 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.030
 must think about this before 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.280
 of all but of course about it first 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.690
 queue should think those who are involved 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:47.170
 to this tragedy think about it and 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.170
 pray for the salvation of your soul
