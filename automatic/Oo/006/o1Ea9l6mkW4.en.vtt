thing<00:00:52.600> everything<00:00:53.050> was<00:00:53.170> done<00:00:53.320> via<00:00:53.559> CAD<00:00:53.800> so

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
thing everything was done via CAD so

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.940 
thing everything was done via CAD so
everything<00:00:54.940> was<00:00:55.090> built<00:00:55.360> in<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.630> computer<00:00:56.350> so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
everything was built in the computer so

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.680 
everything was built in the computer so
therefore<00:00:57.489> everything<00:00:57.610> fits<00:00:58.210> you<00:00:58.390> know<00:00:58.480> all

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
therefore everything fits you know all

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.180 
therefore everything fits you know all
your<00:00:58.870> parameters<00:00:59.050> are<00:00:59.559> they<00:00:59.770> built<00:01:00.010> this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
your parameters are they built this

whole turbo setup in the computer then

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.489 
whole turbo setup in the computer then
started<00:01:03.790> making<00:01:04.089> pieces<00:01:04.449> apart<00:01:04.749> exactly<00:01:05.350> this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:05.499 
started making pieces apart exactly this

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.590 
started making pieces apart exactly this
entire<00:01:05.920> system<00:01:06.399> has<00:01:06.429> about<00:01:06.759> seven<00:01:07.119> fixtures

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
entire system has about seven fixtures

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.739 
entire system has about seven fixtures
to<00:01:08.409> create<00:01:08.859> the<00:01:09.189> entire<00:01:09.459> kit<00:01:09.700> how<00:01:10.270> much<00:01:10.450> boost

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
to create the entire kit how much boost

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.690 
to create the entire kit how much boost
is<00:01:11.049> this<00:01:11.200> put<00:01:11.439> out<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.829> smallest<00:01:12.219> amount<00:01:12.639> of

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
is this put out the smallest amount of

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.399 
is this put out the smallest amount of
those<00:01:12.850> let's<00:01:13.090> go<00:01:13.209> there<00:01:13.479> okay<00:01:13.959> make<00:01:14.170> about

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
those let's go there okay make about

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.260 
those let's go there okay make about
four<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.770> half<00:01:14.799> pounds<00:01:15.340> that's<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.969> least

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
four and a half pounds that's the least

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.209 
four and a half pounds that's the least
amount<00:01:16.539> of<00:01:16.659> boots<00:01:16.840> it'll<00:01:17.049> make<00:01:17.200> okay<00:01:17.619> at<00:01:17.979> that

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
amount of boots it'll make okay at that

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.219 
amount of boots it'll make okay at that
boost<00:01:18.459> rating<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:18.999> makes<00:01:19.209> about<00:01:19.450> 620

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
boost rating it makes about 620

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.099 
boost rating it makes about 620
horsepower<00:01:20.319> to<00:01:20.709> the<00:01:20.740> tires<00:01:20.829> on<00:01:21.310> stock<00:01:21.579> motor

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
horsepower to the tires on stock motor

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.019 
horsepower to the tires on stock motor
then<00:01:23.109> we<00:01:23.619> have<00:01:23.770> upgraded<00:01:24.279> turbos<00:01:24.639> all<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.969> way

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.029 
then we have upgraded turbos all the way

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:27.239 
then we have upgraded turbos all the way
up<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.209> the<00:01:25.299> Garrett<00:01:25.630> GT<00:01:25.959> 35<00:01:26.409> hours<00:01:26.649> which<00:01:27.069> is

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
up to the Garrett GT 35 hours which is

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.099 
up to the Garrett GT 35 hours which is
the<00:01:27.340> race<00:01:27.520> kit<00:01:27.819> job<00:01:28.119> which<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.479> can<00:01:28.749> make<00:01:28.869> all

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
the race kit job which you can make all

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:30.719 
the race kit job which you can make all
the<00:01:29.200> way<00:01:29.259> up<00:01:29.349> to<00:01:29.439> 30<00:01:29.649> pounds<00:01:29.829> of<00:01:30.009> boost<00:01:30.099> okay<00:01:30.670> so

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
the way up to 30 pounds of boost okay so

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.699 
the way up to 30 pounds of boost okay so
now<00:01:31.029> guys<00:01:31.270> think<00:01:31.779> about<00:01:31.840> this<00:01:32.170> if<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.499> want<00:01:32.649> to

00:01:32.699 --> 00:01:32.709 
now guys think about this if you want to

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:34.109 
now guys think about this if you want to
do<00:01:32.770> 30<00:01:32.979> pounds<00:01:33.399> of<00:01:33.459> boost<00:01:33.609> you<00:01:33.819> got<00:01:33.939> to<00:01:34.029> do

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
do 30 pounds of boost you got to do

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.489 
do 30 pounds of boost you got to do
engine<00:01:34.420> we're<00:01:34.569> just<00:01:34.749> letting<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.139> know<00:01:35.170> that

mandrel bent what materials are we using
here<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.270> actual<00:01:43.539> header<00:01:43.810> primary<00:01:44.349> tubes<00:01:44.560> are

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
here the actual header primary tubes are

here the actual header primary tubes are
14<00:01:45.219> gauge<00:01:45.490> 304<00:01:46.179> stainless<00:01:46.270> steel<00:01:46.719> that's<00:01:46.840> a

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
14 gauge 304 stainless steel that's a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.929 
14 gauge 304 stainless steel that's a
pretty<00:01:47.229> heavy<00:01:47.409> yes<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:48.039> minimum<00:01:48.459> we<00:01:48.549> used<00:01:48.759> was

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
pretty heavy yes the minimum we used was

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.480 
pretty heavy yes the minimum we used was
a<00:01:48.969> 16<00:01:49.450> gauge<00:01:49.749> material<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:50.889> everything's

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
a 16 gauge material so everything's

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.580 
a 16 gauge material so everything's
thick<00:01:51.789> it<00:01:51.969> keeps<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.270> heat<00:01:52.419> in<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:53.020> aluminum

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
thick it keeps the heat in the aluminum

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.159 
thick it keeps the heat in the aluminum
is<00:01:53.740> also<00:01:54.340> mandrel<00:01:54.700> bent<00:01:54.880> 16<00:01:55.810> gauge<00:01:55.929> aluminum

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:56.169 
is also mandrel bent 16 gauge aluminum

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:58.589 
is also mandrel bent 16 gauge aluminum
