 there were some very rainy days at 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.910
 principle everyone was happy because 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.970
 the reservoirs filled up and the drought 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.910
 it ended but the scientists we 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.390
 they explained why one day's water 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.840
 for another it evaporated from a day to 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.869
 another the water went away we are already a heat 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.780
 enormous nobody explained it the 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.540
 temperatures were shooting fields of 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.540
 wheat burned the animals had not 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.990
 shadow that will shelter the supplies 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 of food ran out but a 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.770
 scientist almost in a bud of madness 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.460
 he said there was an area in the panel 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.540
 his laboratory that at a certain time saw 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.570
 how it increased 40 degrees 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.270
 they quickly sent a group of 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.960
 investigation to see what it is that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.230
 it happened as the heat progressed was

 there was no trace of nature and they did not 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.340
 credit to what they saw a volcano had 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.890
 appeared from nowhere and automatically 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.670
 the legend came alive grau don 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.520
 primigenio appeared ejecting lava to 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.480
 every scream that hit the first blow 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.480
 with his huge claw quartered two of 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.650

 they went running splashed with blood 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.270
 when it hit the cracking earth 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.540
 the thousand parts causing huge cracks 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.170
 of an infinite depth people 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.660
 He was trying to hold on but the heat 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.410
 it was so intense that it melted in the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.920
 hands 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.319

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.720
 belongs its continents 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.989
 to be continue
