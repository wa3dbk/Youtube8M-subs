00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:03.470
 Mohring people 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.610
 When I've built my friend's route percent is with me people's problems 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.550
 surfaced and said something mean force I would also place though 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.729
 media 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.849
 that does not escape because I've installed six gigabytes 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:20.019
 and there I put some chancellors and then I'm a few 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.110
 Tips encountered 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.189
 mm and the one is just the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.649
 my percent resulted in aggression holding more memory 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.130
 so that goes with the 32-bit version and with the 64-bit version and you should 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.510
 this tip I show you here so with this command line 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.080
 you should really only with the 32-bit as with the 64-bit version 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.180
 if you also have four Gear Bikes memory installed 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.400
 one so puts here 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.130
 So yours is a normal right click 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.160
 on the Western European on new and then you have a text document 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.160
 we do not need that 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.520
 when I've already done that this is this 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.990
 and I open the window with the EEG 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.040
 "He does not need another program, please do not ask me how 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.490
 I can only use Windows for other operating systems 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.490
 and then you can see the magnifying glass so much better 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.940
 and there is the following sentence inside year then here was this Minor SC Dixie Mix 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.880
 2048 m 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.740
 there are just two songs for Torso 2048 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.750
 and then Minor is Exter CEST and then again in 2048 there is then again 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.760
 for the samples 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.170
 similar to work 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.720
 - Jarolim then comes the father lives where their team AXA is stored so 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.340
 because of that, Westrup is with me, even though the flood pulls Jusos 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.310
 then percent here does not come then or usernames of course 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.390
 everyone has to sign up for Windows with their own 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.560
 given in their name 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.830
 Now you can register here 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.300
 then the head and thank you Excel meets and then just come 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.300
 a reintroduction of signs to that was already 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.340
 so do not say that again 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.760
 that just me here my ideas usernames and e- 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.069
 and you will hardly believe my computer has 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:16.729
 Kuhn 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.269
 we save the whole thing with it 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.060
 namely at the save files 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.059
 under 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.359
 At least now I'm looking for it if I'm from school 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.999
 supposedly the whole thing a name and I call that crucial league 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.059
 at 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:35.589
 Year a few 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:36.769
 Stuttgart 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.219
 and now the most important thing in the whole thing comes in the extreme point 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.329
 Beat games 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.139
 that's a dax-start Oliver Sack - so he orders from the top down 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.339
 to act down AP 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:55.949
 and percent as I said I do not remember as points the artec then have 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.779
 you lost then it does not work 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:04.109
 How do you tie that before the BIRT point? Leave that to the US Hurricane Center 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.259
 you can do as you like 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.289
 so loads are saved for asthma 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:12.509
 when can you close this one for now I'll just pull the youth moves 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:13.989
 Warner 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.319
 wrong key 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.299
 and we pull 2 ​​gigawatts of world here 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.860
 Year was starter pumps because we make a right click on it and Münsingen 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.439
 we do that again 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.069
 at the tests of if obscured create and so a shortcut 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.659
 Store ever something normal 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.829
 and the link I do for the reason when I right-click on it 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.760
 make and select the properties then I can namely the window this 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.999
 around two gigawatts of Jaber al percent 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.639
 two gigabytes of year was starting point bakes 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.309
 that I can, that is, the window if I look at the statements he 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:52.499
 minimized under pressure 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:56.219
 l change that I can start the window minimized and that's what 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.699
 I would otherwise like to have a fancy black up here 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.499
 window 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.499
 when clicking we just take over 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.559
 yes, and we also want to show it another symbol 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:12.289
 for millions also a button 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:17.059
 and then we get that on it too then this message comes to the 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:20.739
 Keep that Airrail that the file itself contains no bogey 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.189
 does not do anything but acknowledge the charts okay 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.799
 and then we go to the bowling of this party looking for 

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:29.550
 search 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.970
 Percent is already here on my desktop and then I just want to 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.470
 the community exe from Florida he is an icon all three grand with inside 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.889
 in this excel 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.900
 and as we can see, here we have the icon in the beginner again 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.809
 OK 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:44.919
 take over again 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.169
 click and go and now we have that too 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.650
 here with the with the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.939
 my heads up income 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.800
 and then you can also SUV States, there are sometimes the screen buys 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.379
 Dell then show the same again how the whole is started so should here 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.039
 that really only use if at least four gigawatts installed here 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.889
 The occasion does not really make sense 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.889
 So I took a double click on it 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:11.559
 as you can see 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:13.919
 my powers are started 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.370
 and the window bakes these two opponents at eat-star's point 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.690
 that is this window is minimized started so now stands nothing 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.559
 other than what you see here now this little we enable in there 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.460
 have written in there 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.430
 so that too 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.970
 I'd better do that here and then I'll start my five goals and 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.970
 to show how it costs to go against it 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.349
 so o'meara are winners 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.319
 because my test field always started because I have nice lawn here and then sees 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.249
 that he is better off 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:54.819
 and I have a used one now 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:01.759
 one percent came from 15 percent so just under 300 mg of breaks 962 a loan 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.379
 more mobile sites allocated storage 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:11.059
 are Umut Kocin 962 that will come out when you set two gigawatts old 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.500
 I hope he has the KEF one or the other, otherwise I can out me 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.740
 of My Mojo as is mainly from the long Mainka 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.379
 around 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:25.479
 Train rides can happen very quickly because the Cheonan Sunshine probably 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.610
 somehow not unloaded properly anyway 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.979
 I also help myself so I can drive my tracks better and 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.139
 maybe it helps too 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.879
 As I said the whole thing is for the singleplayer it is for the server 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.269
 a bit different Anderson Anderson not so much different 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:45.479
 but I just wanted you to do that simply because I explained to myself as well 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.539
 Games for gasoline explains quickly 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:50.819
 I'll say goodbye then, too
