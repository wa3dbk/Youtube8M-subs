 Good day to all k.F. 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.490
 we all play from the company of big ben 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 interactive toy called version 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.100
 four 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.850
 fia world rally championship 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.400
 this is a racing simulator rally racing 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.949
 it turns out before it was such more 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.520
 decent race think order remembers 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.170
 Ildar dadin lord pro 4 in general this 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.920
 such more active which is not 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.350
 impressed 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.719
 it was more normal on the charts 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.800
 average check was gameplay pretty 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.730
 dying imba 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.809
 Well let's evaluate this game and 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.960
 let's say its pluses 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.399
 that is, the main ones that should be in 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 car simulators ie racing 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.210
 simulators keep empty yes it's fanged 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.510
 click 200 labor usual couple of modes 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.579
 arcade mode ie 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.000
 vsero race to the passage of a career 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.720
 can as that same distillation in our 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.960
 mexico filling machine let's 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.090
 this is the first this plot the plot here 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.369
 especially nothing that is ordinary 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.409
 championship which need to pass 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.210
 constantly chase chase chase no 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.060
 special hard diversity to disassemble 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.920
 all cards only 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.240
 the second thing which will be appreciated 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 the simulator is music i.e. axis with 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.840
 record and skins how much 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.479
 realistic voice switch 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.360
 gears and that is when you press 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.020
 gas is pressing this so that was the atmosphere 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.329
 feel atmosfernost Game Well 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.000
 plot we have estimated there is not much 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.830
 someone tough for a place let's not sound 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.760
 very much 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.190
 None so sounds pretty good of course 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.130
 honestly especially when it slows down 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.410
 Shift gears very cool clan 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.260
 adults well damn what he say honestly 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.140
 I really like the sound there is no 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:11.030
 tough music that is no soundtracks 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.610
 can be heard generally accompanied by pure gps 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.320
 bazaar and all this can be 4 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.200
 repeaters there is ism so hard 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.510
 Honestly, then we go through gimp rand 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.710
 more well tell you 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.640
 cards are different cards in large which 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.500
 associated with the rally competition stupidly 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.360
 just go by the doctors tie in turn 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.720
 rides like pretty pretty heavy where 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 forest and moan did meter twenty 200 then 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.450
 there is also an eye 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.340
 diameter 200 you live and you need to keep up 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.890
 turning it all children is very much a share 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.959
 cool that is, there is still possible from 1 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.790
 faces if you have a steering wheel it at all 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.200
 very cool know what real 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.330
 simulator that is very realistic to me 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.790
 really like it very realistic as 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.310
 class well what about grafon 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.350
 let's leave the harpoon hot let's go now about 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.720
 to grafon and what have all gone so that if 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.360
 open his face much to find fault that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.790
 For example, the picture is very just here 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.489
 this can tell one of 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.079
 best simulator because previous 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.469
 terrace that went out in the near 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:22.109
 time they are not very crazy 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:24.379
 no such progress tape is good 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:28.890
 brighter 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:32.099
 let rotate along much like hard 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.709
 very quickly the parachute will not fly off 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.040
 a little bit he tells me believed and where 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.790
 bite yes very tense let's 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.220
 we turn and then the developers are very 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.870
 promised what it is, whether it is from the series 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.590
 the whole series of these races will be the best 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.629
 Well I do not know 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.389
 then there is multiply, that is, on one 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.220
 card up to 16 players can play people 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.889
 Presenting with chums for spikes 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.400
 but I think that minus big in this game 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.739
 it's a crooked port that is to say it's crooked 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.379
 it feels that from smelling on smell 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.030
 poorly translated yet and that it was 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.830
 real hard sport it can it and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.150
 separate came on like wine 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:18.269
 because but the guy has a thorn port at 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.280
 pretty very people simple easy very 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.959
 convenient to manage honestly tell me 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.200
 like 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.990
 the only one and what it is nothing . started 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.780
 take no thief exactly started 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.620
 and this brain dirt was a layer of clay 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.620
 really 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.139
 and that the animation of the car to me is also very 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.870
 I like pancake because it merges 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.580
 This pancake is with him as this would 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.830
 Slam your camera even better when 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.199
 somewhere really the camera is brighter from it 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.319
 some shitty 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.669
 let's turn around dan dugan eye like 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.530
 it is necessary so it is a switch to 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.689
 following in Kandy if there was not in 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.389
 a box of automatics tying him with a tie 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:02.180
 hard there is one minus is grafon 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.849
 I think it is that the animation is free 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.449
 decent and drawing cars yet 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:12.020
 road texture 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:14.690
 the school is black and one more 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.080
 hand wheel is very hard to look honestly 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.629
 very hard rollers little fit well 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.139
 oak realism is a very smooth simulator and 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:26.599
 this is your plus so you can play 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.289
 This game guys would cadet husband advise 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:33.800
 ka ka have a drive drive rick really 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:36.199
 tense google at 12 and at speed 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.250
 turning it all that is in a jiffy do 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:43.400
 very quickly class by class he was 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:47.419
 everybody since it was another 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.360
 Simulator all very I do not know how 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:53.060
 shoot a movie very steamed reading it 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.529
 it's really stressful because there 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.440
 a lot about how to be sought as a 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:03.169
 deciphered this rally and found 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.539
 In general, well, you can say with you was p. 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.129
 everybody see you soon everyone is this pear 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.580
