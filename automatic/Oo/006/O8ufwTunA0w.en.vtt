00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
bit of nerves as well so we needed to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.900 
bit of nerves as well so we needed to
really<00:00:43.710> put<00:00:44.010> them<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.250> their<00:00:44.399> back<00:00:44.489> foot<00:00:44.670> but

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
we never managed to do that and they

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
we never managed to do that and they
were<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.309> they<00:00:47.460> gain<00:00:47.670> momentum<00:00:47.820> from

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
were they get they gain momentum from

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.360

second half in that respect they didn't
extend<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.820> lead<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.360> you've<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.079> take

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
extend the lead so you've got to take

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.780 
extend the lead so you've got to take
that<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> positive<00:01:37.619> from<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.400> second<00:01:38.670> half

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that as a positive from that second half

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.170 
that as a positive from that second half
of<00:01:38.939> course<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.360> guess<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:40.729> try<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> try<00:01:42.119> an

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of course I guess but try it you try an

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.080 
of course I guess but try it you try an
ollie<00:01:42.509> Friday<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:44.610> putting<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
ollie Friday that and not putting a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.370 
ollie Friday that and not putting a
performance<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> first<00:01:46.200> off

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
performance like that in the first off

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.300 
performance like that in the first off
it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
it
you<00:01:47.880> won't<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.570> against<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.170> he'll

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you won't be up against a up he'll

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.100 
you won't be up against a up he'll
struggle<00:01:49.500> after<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
struggle after that but you know like I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.749 
struggle after that but you know like I
said<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.380> did<00:01:52.530> come<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> second<00:01:53.280> off<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
said we did come out in a second off and

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.480 
said we did come out in a second off and
how'd<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:53.939> go<00:01:54.710> choosing<00:01:55.710> act<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.039> course<00:01:56.189> so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
how'd it go choosing act of course so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.980 
how'd it go choosing act of course so
you<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.729> an<00:01:56.820> opportunity<00:01:57.030> straightaway<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
you get an opportunity straightaway to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.289 
you get an opportunity straightaway to
were<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.560> hopefully<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> first<00:01:59.909> goal<00:02:00.149> of
