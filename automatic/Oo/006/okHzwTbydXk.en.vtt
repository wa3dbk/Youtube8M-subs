I<00:00:23.160> pre-programmed<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.150> grapes<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.510> thought

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
I pre-programmed with grapes I thought

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.359 
I pre-programmed with grapes I thought
were<00:00:24.779> perfect<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.470> compares<00:00:25.830> against

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
were perfect so it compares against

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.070 
were perfect so it compares against
those<00:00:26.640> grapes<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.300> if<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> match

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
those grapes and if it's not a match

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.380 
those grapes and if it's not a match
it'll<00:00:28.650> pick<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.250> out<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.210> where<00:00:30.359> all

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
it'll pick that out so this is where all

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
it'll pick that out so this is where all
the<00:00:30.689> images<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:31.170> taken<00:00:31.320> right<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the images are taken right this is the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.010 
the images are taken right this is the
nuts<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.940> bolts<00:00:33.059> event<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.870> makes

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
nuts and bolts event this is what makes

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.549 
nuts and bolts event this is what makes
it<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.260> possible<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:36.329> robot<00:00:36.809> takes<00:00:37.140> pictures

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
it all possible the robot takes pictures

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.850 
it all possible the robot takes pictures
at<00:00:37.739> 10,000<00:00:38.700> frames<00:00:38.910> per<00:00:39.239> second<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.860> analyzes

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
at 10,000 frames per second and analyzes

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.700 
at 10,000 frames per second and analyzes
them<00:00:41.070> instantly<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.540> picture<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.050> taken<00:00:43.079> it

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
them instantly the picture was taken it

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
them instantly the picture was taken it
was<00:00:43.829> accepted<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.640> was<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> match<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
was accepted it was a match to what I

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.740 
was accepted it was a match to what I
said<00:00:46.469> was<00:00:46.649> okay<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.219> then<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.149> berries<00:00:48.480> will

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
said was okay and then the berries will

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.709 
said was okay and then the berries will
come<00:00:49.170> across<00:00:49.520> onto<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.670> conveyor<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.480> be

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
come across onto this conveyor and be

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
come across onto this conveyor and be
dumped<00:00:52.110> into<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.739> bins<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.340> good<00:00:53.670> fruit<00:00:53.910> if

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
dumped into the bins of good fruit if

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
dumped into the bins of good fruit if
it's<00:00:54.420> rejected<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.079> doesn't<00:00:55.350> match<00:00:55.559> there'll

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
it's rejected and doesn't match there'll

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.500 
it's rejected and doesn't match there'll
be<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.070> puff<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> air<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> comes<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.239> blasts

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
be a puff of air that comes and blasts

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540 
be a puff of air that comes and blasts
out<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:58.199> doesn't<00:00:58.500> magic<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> puff<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
out what doesn't magic just a puff of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.279 
out what doesn't magic just a puff of
air

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
air

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.290 
air
yeah<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:00.920> what's<00:01:01.100> all<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:01.219> mark<00:01:01.670> this<00:01:02.089> is

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
yeah so what's all this mark this is

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.910 
yeah so what's all this mark this is
what<00:01:02.539> was<00:01:02.660> rejected<00:01:03.109> I<00:01:03.320> definitely<00:01:03.859> don't

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
what was rejected I definitely don't

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.910 
what was rejected I definitely don't
want<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:04.189> going<00:01:04.430> into<00:01:04.640> my<00:01:04.790> tank<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.799> old

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
want that going into my tank and the old

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.499 
want that going into my tank and the old
math<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.340> there<00:01:07.549> was<00:01:07.640> hand<00:01:07.850> sorting<00:01:08.240> and

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
math is there was hand sorting and

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.749 
math is there was hand sorting and
people<00:01:08.780> using<00:01:09.020> pumps<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:09.740> there's<00:01:10.399> different

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
people using pumps and there's different

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.670 
people using pumps and there's different
things<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.270> affected<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.899> condition<00:01:12.590> of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
things that affected the condition of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.859 
things that affected the condition of
the<00:01:12.770> grapes<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.340> allows<00:01:13.670> me<00:01:13.909> as<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.630> owners

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
the grapes this allows me as the owners

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.480 
the grapes this allows me as the owners
like<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.110> sell<00:01:15.259> me<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.409> have<00:01:15.619> no<00:01:15.649> diseases<00:01:16.250> and

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
like to sell me to have no diseases and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.850 
like to sell me to have no diseases and
the<00:01:17.060> critics<00:01:17.420> why<00:01:17.869> are<00:01:17.930> they<00:01:18.170> skeptical<00:01:18.649> of

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the critics why are they skeptical of

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.859 
the critics why are they skeptical of
this<00:01:19.250> new<00:01:19.430> optics<00:01:19.880> order<00:01:20.210> is<00:01:20.360> it<00:01:20.509> just<00:01:20.659> because

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
this new optics order is it just because

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.480 
this new optics order is it just because
it<00:01:21.020> goes<00:01:21.170> against<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.619> tradition<00:01:22.039> I<00:01:22.220> think

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
it goes against the tradition I think

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.219 
it goes against the tradition I think
they<00:01:22.580> like<00:01:22.789> that<00:01:22.820> whole<00:01:23.149> element<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.750> romance

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
they like that whole element of romance

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.539 
they like that whole element of romance
a<00:01:24.409> tradition<00:01:24.830> of<00:01:24.920> actually<00:01:25.280> having<00:01:25.399> people

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
a tradition of actually having people

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.330 
a tradition of actually having people
sorting<00:01:29.439> this<00:01:30.439> is<00:01:30.619> really<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.950> old<00:01:31.100> way<00:01:31.310> of

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
sorting this is really the old way of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.370 
sorting this is really the old way of
doing<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.789> this<00:01:31.909> is<00:01:32.090> how<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.300> do<00:01:32.539> it<00:01:32.569> so<00:01:32.869> much<00:01:33.259> I

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
doing it this is how you do it so much I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.990 
doing it this is how you do it so much I
really<00:01:33.619> have<00:01:33.770> my<00:01:33.950> own<00:01:34.069> Lucille<00:01:34.429> Ball<00:01:34.640> moment

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
really have my own Lucille Ball moment

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.590 
really have my own Lucille Ball moment
Rainier<00:01:35.240> old<00:01:35.659> school<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:38.000> there's<00:01:38.300> probably

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
Rainier old school and there's probably

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.740 
Rainier old school and there's probably
enough<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.990> do<00:01:39.200> I'd<00:01:39.830> say<00:01:40.330> I'd<00:01:41.330> say<00:01:41.539> there's

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
enough to do I'd say I'd say there's

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.059 
enough to do I'd say I'd say there's
probably<00:01:42.050> three<00:01:42.259> or<00:01:42.319> four<00:01:42.440> bottles<00:01:42.890> an

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
probably three or four bottles an

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.279 
probably three or four bottles an
Americans<00:01:43.909> drink<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.300> lot<00:01:44.600> more<00:01:44.840> than<00:01:45.080> just

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
Americans drink a lot more than just

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.120 
Americans drink a lot more than just
three<00:01:45.649> or<00:01:45.830> four<00:01:45.860> bottles<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:46.850> thirst<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:47.750> only

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130
