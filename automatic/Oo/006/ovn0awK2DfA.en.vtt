00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.749 

and<00:00:01.070> now<00:00:02.070> let<00:00:02.280> me<00:00:02.399> show<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.700> connection<00:00:03.149> for

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
and now let me show the connection for

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.600 
and now let me show the connection for
the<00:00:05.759> LEDs<00:00:06.629> in<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> series<00:00:10.160> so<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.190> give<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
the LEDs in the series so I give the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.150 
the LEDs in the series so I give the
circuit<00:00:12.090> here

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
circuit here

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.700 
circuit here
one<00:00:14.160> LED

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:32.479 

two<00:00:22.710> LEDs<00:00:26.269> really<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.449> okay<00:00:31.070> here<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.279> must

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
two LEDs really this okay here we must

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.829 
two LEDs really this okay here we must
have<00:00:32.699> at<00:00:33.449> least<00:00:34.730> 10<00:00:35.730> volts<00:00:36.680> DC<00:00:38.300> because<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
have at least 10 volts DC because the

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.079 
have at least 10 volts DC because the
volts<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.690> serious<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
volts in a serious we here we have to

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.880 
volts in a serious we here we have to
Adam<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.670> add<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> product<00:00:48.420> voltage<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
Adam so we add a product voltage and the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.579 
Adam so we add a product voltage and the
current<00:00:50.010> remains<00:00:50.489> constant<00:00:51.440> array<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
current remains constant array is the

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.709 
current remains constant array is the
same<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.220> if<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:53.940> zero<00:00:54.899> point<00:00:55.199> zero<00:00:56.719> two

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
same so if we have zero point zero two

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
same so if we have zero point zero two
male<00:00:58.530> arms<00:00:59.340> yeah<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.199> same<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:02.219> all

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
male arms yeah this is the same for all

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.740 
male arms yeah this is the same for all
the<00:01:03.019> silk<00:01:04.019> weed<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> voltage<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:06.360> said<00:01:06.600> is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the silk weed but the voltage we said is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.029 
the silk weed but the voltage we said is
3<00:01:07.080> 3<00:01:07.560> 3

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
3 3 3

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.340 
3 3 3
it<00:01:08.850> means<00:01:09.179> 9<00:01:09.990> volts<00:01:10.830> drop<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it means 9 volts drop so we have the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:23.480 
it means 9 volts drop so we have the
formula<00:01:14.570> air<00:01:16.880> vs<00:01:17.880> minus<00:01:18.800> V<00:01:19.800> D<00:01:21.619> divided<00:01:22.619> by<00:01:22.649> zero

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
formula air vs minus V D divided by zero

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.889 
formula air vs minus V D divided by zero
point<00:01:23.789> zero<00:01:24.420> two<00:01:26.239> amps<00:01:28.160> which<00:01:29.160> means<00:01:29.459> 10<00:01:29.970> minus

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
point zero two amps which means 10 minus

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.919 
point zero two amps which means 10 minus
9<00:01:31.369> all<00:01:32.369> divided<00:01:33.179> by<00:01:33.300> zero<00:01:33.810> point<00:01:34.170> zero<00:01:35.069> two

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
9 all divided by zero point zero two

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.160 
9 all divided by zero point zero two
amps

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
amps

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.940 
amps
one<00:01:38.300> zero<00:01:39.300> two<00:01:39.479> point<00:01:39.720> zero<00:01:42.289> must<00:01:43.289> be<00:01:45.770> let<00:01:46.770> me

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
one zero two point zero must be let me

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.229 
one zero two point zero must be let me
calculate<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.360> cannot<00:01:49.369> make<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.429> big<00:01:50.970> mistake

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:53.239 
calculate so I cannot make a big mistake

00:01:53.239 --> 00:02:05.960 
calculate so I cannot make a big mistake
point<00:01:54.239> to<00:01:54.509> 50<00:01:55.170> ohms<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:59.989> 50<00:02:00.989> ohms

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.240 

okay<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:08.340> seen<00:02:08.760> on<00:02:09.540> YouTube<00:02:10.260> many<00:02:10.530> movies

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
okay I have seen on YouTube many movies

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.670 
okay I have seen on YouTube many movies
about<00:02:11.490> how<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> connect<00:02:12.240> LEDs<00:02:14.150> but<00:02:15.150> not<00:02:15.650> all<00:02:16.650> of

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
about how to connect LEDs but not all of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.700 
about how to connect LEDs but not all of
them<00:02:17.010> tell<00:02:17.550> you
