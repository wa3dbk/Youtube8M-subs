00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
I don't know how you're going to do it

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.210 
I don't know how you're going to do it
without<00:00:25.660> of<00:00:25.930> it<00:00:26.050> so<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.930> get<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:29.439> head

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
without of it so you get the head

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:39.299 
without of it so you get the head
completely<00:00:31.000> saturated<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:34.000> water<00:00:38.309> all

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
completely saturated with water all

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:47.100 
completely saturated with water all
around<00:00:44.310> she's<00:00:45.310> got<00:00:45.520> nice<00:00:45.790> long<00:00:46.090> hair<00:00:46.540> so<00:00:47.020> this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
around she's got nice long hair so this

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:57.900 
around she's got nice long hair so this
could<00:00:47.320> take<00:00:47.500> a<00:00:47.560> second

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.060 

by<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:58.969> way<00:00:59.179> this<00:00:59.359> has<00:00:59.539> been<00:00:59.719> hard<00:00:59.989> I<00:01:00.379> know<00:01:00.440> the

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
by the way this has been hard I know the

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.549 
by the way this has been hard I know the
idea<00:01:01.219> of<00:01:01.670> watching<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.660> error<00:01:02.899> may<00:01:03.170> seem<00:01:03.379> like

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
idea of watching the error may seem like

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.679 
idea of watching the error may seem like
how<00:01:03.829> am<00:01:03.890> I<00:01:04.040> going<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.220> do<00:01:04.369> that<00:01:04.580> it's<00:01:05.269> really

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
how am I going to do that it's really

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.639 
how am I going to do that it's really
really<00:01:05.990> easy<00:01:07.420> when<00:01:08.420> I<00:01:08.479> first<00:01:08.750> got<00:01:08.899> my<00:01:09.110> wigs<00:01:09.380> I

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
really easy when I first got my wigs I

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.710 
really easy when I first got my wigs I
thought<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.159> I<00:01:10.189> would<00:01:10.490> just<00:01:10.700> take<00:01:11.479> her<00:01:11.689> back

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
thought that I would just take her back

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.399 
thought that I would just take her back
to<00:01:12.670> Vika<00:01:13.670> absolutely<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.780> I've<00:01:14.930> heard<00:01:15.200> you

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
although they're watching me care for it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:18.940 
although they're watching me care for it
because<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:17.899> thought<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:18.470> know<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.619> little<00:01:18.860> bit

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
because I thought you know a little bit

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.430 
because I thought you know a little bit
intimidated<00:01:19.520> about<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.729> process<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:20.990> you

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
intimidated about the process but you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.840 
intimidated about the process but you
know<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:21.680> should<00:01:21.890> know<00:01:22.039> how<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.250> care<00:01:22.610> for<00:01:22.640> it

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
know you should know how to care for it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.469 
know you should know how to care for it
yourself

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
yourself

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.109 
yourself
and<00:01:23.600> not<00:01:23.720> realize<00:01:24.049> somebody<00:01:24.470> else<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:28.119> she's

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
and not realize somebody else so she's

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:39.639 
and not realize somebody else so she's
good<00:01:30.429> she<00:01:31.429> looks<00:01:31.670> marvelous<00:01:32.289> see<00:01:33.289> that<00:01:38.649> that

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
good she looks marvelous see that that

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:48.460 
good she looks marvelous see that that
good<00:01:39.940> so<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:46.369> I<00:01:47.299> guess<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.869> most<00:01:47.990> important

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
good so and I guess the most important

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.830 
good so and I guess the most important
point<00:01:48.709> of<00:01:48.830> this<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.250> really<00:01:50.000> try<00:01:50.240> not<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.600> rub

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
point of this is really try not to rub

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.279 
point of this is really try not to rub
anything<00:01:52.030> directly<00:01:53.030> into<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:55.130> cap<00:01:56.289> whether

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
anything directly into the cap whether

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.350 
anything directly into the cap whether
it<00:01:57.560> be<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.979> conditioner<00:01:58.490> or<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.909> shampoo<00:01:59.330> you

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
it be the conditioner or the shampoo you

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.699 
it be the conditioner or the shampoo you
want<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.690> get<00:01:59.810> too<00:01:59.959> close<00:02:00.170> because<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.590> can

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
want to get too close because you can

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.469 
want to get too close because you can
actually<00:02:01.009> loosen<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.429> knots<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.970> think<00:02:02.390> it's

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
actually loosen the knots I think it's

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.330 
actually loosen the knots I think it's
more<00:02:02.660> important<00:02:03.229> with<00:02:03.349> the<00:02:03.410> conditioner<00:02:03.890> but

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
more important with the conditioner but

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.339 
more important with the conditioner but
I<00:02:04.399> kind<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.759> follow<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:05.390> well<00:02:05.629> with<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
I kind of follow that as well with the

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.300 
I kind of follow that as well with the
shampoo<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:07.459> in<00:02:07.700> case<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:09.800> just<00:02:10.039> start

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
taking like a small section of the hair

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.979

and then is working the shampoo all the
way<00:02:15.110> through<00:02:15.379> it<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.950> when<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:16.129> get<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.459> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
way through it and when I get to the

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
like the top where it has actually the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.610 
like the top where it has actually the
you<00:02:19.610> know<00:02:19.700> closest<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.239> these<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:21.050> scalp<00:02:21.379> I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.520 
you know closest to these this scalp I
just<00:02:22.129> kind<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.599> pull<00:02:23.599> out<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.050> hair<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.319> little

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
just kind of pull out the hair a little

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.890 
just kind of pull out the hair a little
bit<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:24.920> then<00:02:25.580> place<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.090> shampoo<00:02:26.510> into<00:02:26.690> it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
bit and then place the shampoo into it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.020 
bit and then place the shampoo into it
so<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.110> I'm<00:02:27.349> not<00:02:27.379> like<00:02:27.709> going<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.030> rubbing

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
so that I'm not like going like rubbing

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.729 
so that I'm not like going like rubbing
into<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.780> don't<00:02:29.959> also<00:02:30.200> don't<00:02:30.470> want<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
into it and you don't also don't want to

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.740 
into it and you don't also don't want to
do<00:02:30.860> like<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.220> swirling<00:02:31.849> motion<00:02:32.000> like

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
do like a swirling motion like

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.510 
do like a swirling motion like
in<00:02:32.990> our<00:02:33.170> own<00:02:33.290> heads<00:02:33.530> because<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.310> think<00:02:34.370> that

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
in our own heads because I think that

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.070 
in our own heads because I think that
could<00:02:34.760> just<00:02:34.910> tangle<00:02:35.270> everything<00:02:35.630> up<00:02:35.780> and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
could just tangle everything up and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.420 
could just tangle everything up and
probably<00:02:36.500> that's<00:02:36.770> why<00:02:36.920> they<00:02:36.950> tell<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.250> not<00:02:37.310> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
probably that's why they tell you not to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.670 
probably that's why they tell you not to

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
do it and also loosen the knot so we

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.020 
do it and also loosen the knot so we
don't<00:02:42.830> want<00:02:43.010> my<00:02:43.130> hair<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.400> fall<00:02:43.550> out<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:43.880> her
