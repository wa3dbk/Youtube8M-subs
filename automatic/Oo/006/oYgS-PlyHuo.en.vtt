I'll kind of hidden just shaved these a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.060 
I'll kind of hidden just shaved these a
little<00:01:37.920> bit<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.220> detail<00:01:38.610> my<00:01:38.729> fee<00:01:39.830> I'll<00:01:40.830> clean

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
little bit of detail my fee I'll clean

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.590 
little bit of detail my fee I'll clean
it<00:01:41.100> up

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
it up

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.050 
it up
also<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.720> I'll<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.670> these<00:01:44.670> would<00:01:45.030> just

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
also what I'll do is these would just

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.020 
also what I'll do is these would just
pretty<00:01:45.330> much--he<00:01:45.479> metal<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.729> scale

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
pretty much--he metal so the scale

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
pretty much--he metal so the scale
thickness<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.630> incorrect<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.380> I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
thickness is incorrect so what I do I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.719 
thickness is incorrect so what I do I
try<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.830> trim<00:01:53.100> down<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:55.369> trim<00:01:56.369> down<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
try and trim down that trim down this

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.350 
try and trim down that trim down this
edge<00:01:56.910> here<00:01:56.940> so<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.390> looks<00:01:57.540> much<00:01:57.899> much<00:01:58.110> thinner

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.010 

to<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.450> thin<00:02:03.750> these<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:04.880> my<00:02:05.880> technique<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to be thin these are my technique it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.469 
to be thin these are my technique it
takes<00:02:07.290> some<00:02:07.530> time<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:08.070> super<00:02:08.970> hard<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> really

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
takes some time but super hard to really

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.780 
takes some time but super hard to really
speak<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.170> fun<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> slowly<00:02:11.430> run<00:02:13.430> knife

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.710 

along<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.970> edge<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.360> needs<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.989> be<00:02:19.019> thin

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.240 

after<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:25.019> do<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.350> few<00:02:25.500> times<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:29.190> just

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
after you do it a few times you just

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.620 
after you do it a few times you just
need<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.820> on<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.030> pretty<00:02:30.330> much<00:02:30.450> these

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
need to do it on this pretty much these

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.660 
need to do it on this pretty much these
two<00:02:30.690> edges<00:02:30.959> here<00:02:34.070> I've<00:02:35.070> made<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.580> way

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
two edges here I've made on all the way

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.800 
two edges here I've made on all the way
through<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.440> just<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.650> stage<00:02:37.890> here

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
through that just a stage here

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.430 
through that just a stage here
nice<00:02:39.810> ot<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:41.160> take<00:02:41.340> up<00:02:41.519> some<00:02:41.730> meat<00:02:43.579> over

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
nice ot just take up some meat over

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.110 
nice ot just take up some meat over
tender<00:02:46.440> back<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:49.519> focusing<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:50.700> made<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.060> a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
tender back and focusing but made it a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.110 
tender back and focusing but made it a
bit<00:02:51.269> thinner<00:02:53.329> she<00:02:54.329> paint<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.970> even<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
bit thinner she paint that and even the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.699 
bit thinner she paint that and even the
point<00:02:57.420> I'm<00:02:58.350> supposed<00:02:58.860> to<00:03:00.049> this<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.200> how<00:03:01.410> thick

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
point I'm supposed to this is how thick

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.710 
point I'm supposed to this is how thick
he<00:03:02.579> came<00:03:02.820> off

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
he came off

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.190 
he came off
a<00:03:08.000> big<00:03:09.000> difference<00:03:09.330> little<00:03:09.870> things<00:03:10.050> like<00:03:10.140> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
a big difference little things like that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.160 
a big difference little things like that
make<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.650> look<00:03:10.740> much<00:03:10.890> much<00:03:11.190> more<00:03:11.430> realistic

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
make it look much much more realistic

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.700 
make it look much much more realistic
well<00:03:13.170> I'll<00:03:13.860> finish<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.610> slide<00:03:14.880> up<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.530> get

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
well I'll finish this slide up and I get

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.880 
well I'll finish this slide up and I get
going<00:03:16.860> on<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.040> side<00:03:17.420> geez<00:03:18.420> guys<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:19.110> that's

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
going on that side geez guys so that's

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.340 
going on that side geez guys so that's
the<00:03:20.210> result<00:03:21.210> that<00:03:21.510> there<00:03:21.660> she<00:03:21.810> looks<00:03:21.990> on<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
the result that there she looks on the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.150 
the result that there she looks on the
yeah<00:03:22.500> think<00:03:23.130> how<00:03:23.700> much<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.970> first<00:03:24.120> thing<00:03:25.160> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
yeah think how much the first thing the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.450 
yeah think how much the first thing the
track<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:26.610> opposed<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:29.100> that's<00:03:29.250> pretty

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
track as opposed to and that's pretty

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.570 
track as opposed to and that's pretty
small<00:03:29.970> but<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.780> small<00:03:31.080> piece<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:34.580> anyone

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
small but this small piece here anyone

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.050 
small but this small piece here anyone
interested<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.240> outside<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.970> end<00:03:38.970> of

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
interested so this outside of the end of

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.580 
interested so this outside of the end of
it<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.360> don't<00:03:39.570> bring<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.959> back<00:03:40.080> too<00:03:40.260> much<00:03:40.410> of

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
it so don't bring it back too much of

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.520 
it so don't bring it back too much of
probably<00:03:41.370> about<00:03:41.490> five<00:03:41.760> millimeters<00:03:42.060> pass

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
probably about five millimeters pass

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.440 
probably about five millimeters pass
just<00:03:43.530> thin<00:03:43.740> it<00:03:43.770> out<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.980> bit<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.209> doesn't

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
just thin it out a bit so it doesn't

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.740 
just thin it out a bit so it doesn't
just<00:03:45.810> look<00:03:46.020> like<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.260> big<00:03:46.560> block<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:47.750> plastic

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
just look like a big block of plastic

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.380 
just look like a big block of plastic
like<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.800> said<00:03:49.980> before<00:03:50.100> there's<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:51.150> real

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
like I said before there's a the real

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.810 
like I said before there's a the real
tanks<00:03:51.660> would<00:03:51.750> be<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:52.110> shape<00:03:53.100> metal<00:03:53.280> wouldn't

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
tanks would be a shape metal wouldn't

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.990 
tanks would be a shape metal wouldn't
say<00:03:53.910> he<00:03:54.209> knows<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:54.660> probably<00:03:55.670> 10<00:03:56.670> mils<00:03:56.910> thick

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
say he knows but probably 10 mils thick

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.740 
say he knows but probably 10 mils thick
or<00:03:57.270> so<00:03:57.650> wrong

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
or so wrong

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.870 
or so wrong
won't<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.900> thinner<00:04:01.080> there<00:04:01.260> like<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:04.880> in

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
won't you thinner there like that in

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:14.600 
won't you thinner there like that in
focus<00:04:07.310> looks<00:04:08.310> much<00:04:08.489> much<00:04:08.670> better<00:04:11.810> yeah<00:04:13.489> like<00:04:14.489> I

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
focus looks much much better yeah like I

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.539 
focus looks much much better yeah like I
said<00:04:14.640> before<00:04:15.150> I'd<00:04:15.239> love<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:16.160> take<00:04:17.160> this<00:04:17.310> whole

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
said before I'd love to take this whole

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.599 
said before I'd love to take this whole
fender<00:04:18.000> off<00:04:18.120> he<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:18.979> it<00:04:19.979> could<00:04:20.160> spare<00:04:20.400> these

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
fender off he but it could spare these

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.400 
fender off he but it could spare these
nicely<00:04:21.120> tanks<00:04:21.660> they're<00:04:21.810> assembled<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:24.260> have<00:04:25.260> to

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
nicely tanks they're assembled I have to

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.690 
nicely tanks they're assembled I have to
cut<00:04:25.560> all<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.890> as<00:04:26.070> well<00:04:26.190> which<00:04:26.340> I'm<00:04:26.430> not<00:04:26.550> gonna

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
cut all this as well which I'm not gonna

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.560 
cut all this as well which I'm not gonna
do<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:26.940> obviously<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:28.290> don't<00:04:28.350> have<00:04:28.500> no

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
do that obviously you don't have no

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.020 
do that obviously you don't have no
whole<00:04:30.570> side<00:04:31.350> details<00:04:31.860> as<00:04:32.010> well<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:33.000> other

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
whole side details as well the other

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.840 
whole side details as well the other
element<00:04:33.870> in<00:04:33.960> plate<00:04:36.140> I'll<00:04:37.140> do<00:04:37.260> this<00:04:37.380> side<00:04:37.850> Bend

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
element in plate I'll do this side Bend

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.159 
element in plate I'll do this side Bend
him<00:04:38.970> up<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.180> bit<00:04:39.330> that's<00:04:39.450> a<00:04:39.570> benefit<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:40.050> when

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
him up a bit that's a benefit of when

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.460 
him up a bit that's a benefit of when
you<00:04:40.290> thin<00:04:40.560> these<00:04:40.800> here<00:04:41.630> they<00:04:42.630> can<00:04:43.080> bend<00:04:43.320> much

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
you thin these here they can bend much

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.560 
you thin these here they can bend much
easier<00:04:43.890> as<00:04:44.340> well<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:44.880> don't<00:04:45.030> need<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.419> get

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
easier as well so don't need to get

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.020 
easier as well so don't need to get
crazy<00:04:45.690> for<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.050> heat<00:04:46.229> gun<00:04:46.610> so<00:04:47.610> I'll<00:04:47.760> do<00:04:47.910> this

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
crazy for the heat gun so I'll do this

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.810 
crazy for the heat gun so I'll do this
side<00:04:49.520> maybe<00:04:50.520> bend<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.940> few<00:04:52.520> here<00:04:53.520> is<00:04:53.610> around

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
side maybe bend a few here is around

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.690 
side maybe bend a few here is around
here<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.270> couple<00:04:55.010> of<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.100> back<00:04:56.250> ones<00:04:56.460> and

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
here a couple of the back ones and

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.170 
here a couple of the back ones and
that's<00:04:57.540> it<00:04:58.160> so<00:04:59.160> he's<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.580> end<00:04:59.669> result<00:05:00.000> guys

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
that's it so he's the end result guys

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.090 
that's it so he's the end result guys
I've<00:05:00.600> actually<00:05:00.840> seen<00:05:01.200> that<00:05:01.500> pretty<00:05:01.740> well<00:05:04.100> you

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
I've actually seen that pretty well you

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.380 
I've actually seen that pretty well you
see<00:05:05.310> that<00:05:07.130> hand<00:05:08.130> under<00:05:08.550> so<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:08.940> can<00:05:09.060> see<00:05:09.270> it

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
see that hand under so you can see it

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.890 
see that hand under so you can see it
yeah<00:05:09.900> be<00:05:10.020> with<00:05:10.169> that

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
yeah be with that

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.570 
yeah be with that
no<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.530> think<00:05:11.890> it's<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.130> first<00:05:12.340> time<00:05:12.490> in

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
no I think it's the first time in

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.160 
no I think it's the first time in
history<00:05:12.730> that<00:05:12.940> I've<00:05:13.360> actually<00:05:13.570> haven't<00:05:13.990> cut

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
history that I've actually haven't cut

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.620 
history that I've actually haven't cut
myself<00:05:15.090> using<00:05:16.710> one<00:05:17.710> of<00:05:17.770> these<00:05:18.360> blades<00:05:19.360> which

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
myself using one of these blades which

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.810 
myself using one of these blades which
is<00:05:19.780> amazing<00:05:20.200> so<00:05:21.060> yeah<00:05:22.060> with<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.840> quick<00:05:23.020> tip<00:05:23.170> guys

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
is amazing so yeah with a quick tip guys

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.890 
is amazing so yeah with a quick tip guys
always<00:05:24.820> looks<00:05:24.970> much<00:05:25.150> more<00:05:25.360> realistic<00:05:25.570> when

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
always looks much more realistic when

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.640 
always looks much more realistic when
you<00:05:26.110> thin<00:05:26.560> out<00:05:27.210> these<00:05:28.210> edges<00:05:28.420> as<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.140> comparison

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
you thin out these edges as a comparison

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.160 
you thin out these edges as a comparison
I'll<00:05:29.890> show<00:05:30.040> you<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.250> original<00:05:30.930> earth<00:05:31.930> think

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
I'll show you the original earth think

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.020 
I'll show you the original earth think
it<00:05:32.260> was<00:05:33.750> there<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:34.840> go
