00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.370 
the shape and then dimension okay and
this<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.760> use<00:01:05.939> work<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.659> most<00:01:06.900> simple

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
this we use work for most simple

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.039 
this we use work for most simple
drawings<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.850> only<00:01:09.150> cases<00:01:09.390> where<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.840> may

want<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.350> wait<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.650> dimensioning<00:01:11.580> certain

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
want to wait on dimensioning certain

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.550 
want to wait on dimensioning certain
items<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> very

items is when you have a very

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.310 
items is when you have a very
complicated<00:01:14.040> sketch<00:01:14.840> where<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> get

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
complicated sketch where you want to get

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.679 
complicated sketch where you want to get
the<00:01:16.619> basic<00:01:17.100> shape<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> sketch<00:01:17.850> done<00:01:18.180> first

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the basic shape of the sketch done first

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.929 
the basic shape of the sketch done first
and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.830> dimension<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.549> that's<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and then dimension it but that's not the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
and then dimension it but that's not the
case<00:01:21.210> today<00:01:21.570> we're<00:01:22.049> gonna<00:01:22.140> dimension<00:01:22.650> things

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
dimension I forgot to mention my line so

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.949 
dimension I forgot to mention my line so
I'm<00:03:25.680> going<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.860> dimension<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.370> now<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.790> click<00:03:27.780> on

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
I'm going to dimension it now I click on

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.680 
I'm going to dimension it now I click on
the<00:03:28.080> line

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
the line

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:37.190 
the line
the<00:03:30.690> line<00:03:30.900> it's<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:32.459> line<00:03:32.640> itself<00:03:36.080> so<00:03:37.080> you<00:03:37.140> can

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the line it's the line itself so you can

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.310 
the line it's the line itself so you can
see<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.650> we're<00:03:37.770> gonna<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.870> default

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
see that we're gonna the default

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.590 
see that we're gonna the default
dimension<00:03:40.860> for<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.100> wine<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.670> from<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.090> top<00:03:42.360> to

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
dimension for a wine is from the top to

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.020 
dimension for a wine is from the top to
the<00:03:42.720> bottom<00:03:43.130> but<00:03:44.130> in<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.430> case<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.880> that

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
the bottom but in this case is that

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.070 
the bottom but in this case is that
really<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:46.730> size<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.940> line<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.240> is<00:03:48.390> not<00:03:48.420> so

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
really the size of the line it is not so

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.930 
really the size of the line it is not so
I<00:03:49.110> went<00:03:49.320> ahead<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.500> double<00:03:49.890> clicked<00:03:50.190> we'll

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
I went ahead and double clicked we'll

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.830 
I went ahead and double clicked we'll
learn<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.090> little<00:03:51.360> bit<00:03:51.450> more<00:03:51.510> about

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
learn a little bit more about

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.320 
learn a little bit more about
dimensioning<00:03:52.440> later<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:52.860> but<00:03:53.700> for<00:03:53.940> now<00:03:54.000> we're

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
dimensioning later on but for now we're

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.520 
dimensioning later on but for now we're
gonna<00:03:54.420> do<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.780> height<00:03:55.020> of<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.350> line

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
gonna do the height of the line

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.820 
gonna do the height of the line
regardless<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.670> fact<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.330> is

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
regardless of the fact that it is

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.140 
regardless of the fact that it is
slanted<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.370> doesn't<00:03:59.610> give<00:03:59.730> us<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.850> length

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
slanted so it doesn't give us the length

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.790 
slanted so it doesn't give us the length
of<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.450> line<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.870> gives<00:04:00.990> us<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.320> height<00:04:01.560> of

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
of the line it gives us the height of

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.960 
of the line it gives us the height of
the<00:04:01.890> line<00:04:02.070> as<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.430> see<00:04:02.700> from<00:04:02.820> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
the line as you can see from the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.160 
the line as you can see from the
dimensioning<00:04:03.450> line<00:04:03.630> so<00:04:03.810> we're<00:04:03.900> gonna<00:04:03.990> make

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
dimensioning line so we're gonna make

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
dimensioning line so we're gonna make
that<00:04:05.420> one-inch<00:04:06.420> exactly<00:04:08.450> okay

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
that one-inch exactly okay

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.920 
that one-inch exactly okay
so<00:04:10.490> next<00:04:11.120> we're<00:04:11.330> going<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.570> mention<00:04:11.720> our

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
so next we're going to mention our

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.410 
so next we're going to mention our
circle<00:04:12.380> so<00:04:13.310> we're<00:04:13.430> going<00:04:13.520> to<00:04:13.580> we're<00:04:14.060> going<00:04:14.360> to

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
green checkmark next we're gonna create

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.630 
green checkmark next we're gonna create
an<00:04:43.100> arc<00:04:43.340> it's<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.700> three-point<00:04:44.450> arc<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:46.520> we're

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
an arc it's a three-point arc so we're

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.020 
an arc it's a three-point arc so we're
gonna<00:04:46.730> click<00:04:47.030> once<00:04:49.420> we're<00:04:50.420> gonna<00:04:50.480> click<00:04:50.810> twice

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
gonna click once we're gonna click twice

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.300 
gonna click once we're gonna click twice
and<00:04:53.030> then<00:04:53.270> we<00:04:53.450> just<00:04:53.630> pull<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.470> third<00:04:54.740> line<00:04:55.040> out

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
and then we just pull the third line out

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.970 
and then we just pull the third line out
enough<00:04:55.670> the<00:04:56.120> further<00:04:56.570> we<00:04:56.840> pull<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.380> more<00:04:57.650> like

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
enough the further we pull the more like

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.460 
enough the further we pull the more like
a<00:04:58.010> circle<00:04:58.490> it's<00:04:58.610> gonna<00:04:58.760> become<00:04:59.120> so<00:05:00.110> we<00:05:00.200> can<00:05:00.320> go

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
a circle it's gonna become so we can go

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.500 
a circle it's gonna become so we can go
ahead<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.800> pull<00:05:01.070> that<00:05:01.520> line<00:05:01.820> any<00:05:02.090> way<00:05:02.270> that<00:05:02.420> we

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
ahead and pull that line any way that we

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.780 
ahead and pull that line any way that we
want<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:03.230> arc<00:05:03.410> finally<00:05:04.280> when<00:05:04.430> we're<00:05:04.580> ready

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
want the arc finally when we're ready

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.490 
want the arc finally when we're ready
we're<00:05:05.390> gonna<00:05:05.450> go<00:05:05.660> ahead<00:05:05.720> and<00:05:05.930> click<00:05:08.170> the<00:05:09.170> arc

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
we're gonna go ahead and click the arc

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.920 
we're gonna go ahead and click the arc
we're<00:05:09.890> going<00:05:10.070> to<00:05:10.190> dimension<00:05:10.730> as<00:05:10.850> a<00:05:10.910> radius<00:05:11.720> of

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
we're going to dimension as a radius of

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.290 
we're going to dimension as a radius of
the<00:05:11.990> arc<00:05:12.260> so<00:05:12.830> if<00:05:12.920> we<00:05:13.040> click<00:05:13.250> on<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.700> arc<00:05:13.880> itself

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
the arc so if we click on the arc itself

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.420 
the arc so if we click on the arc itself
and<00:05:14.960> we<00:05:15.080> pull<00:05:15.290> it<00:05:15.410> out<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:15.740> see<00:05:16.010> that<00:05:16.280> that's

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
and we pull it out you see that that's

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.310 
and we pull it out you see that that's
the<00:05:16.670> radius<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.330> arc<00:05:17.480> this<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:18.020> center

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
the radius the arc this is the center

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.170 
the radius the arc this is the center
point<00:05:18.500> in<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.680> middle<00:05:18.890> and<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.730> radio<00:05:20.030> of<00:05:20.090> the

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
point in the middle and the radio of the

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.450 
point in the middle and the radio of the
our<00:05:20.270> radius<00:05:20.750> of<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:20.930> arc<00:05:21.080> right<00:05:21.290> now<00:05:21.410> is<00:05:21.560> 0.64

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
our radius of the arc right now is 0.64

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.820 
our radius of the arc right now is 0.64
so<00:05:22.700> we're<00:05:22.790> gonna<00:05:22.880> click<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:24.530> set<00:05:24.710> the

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
so we're gonna click to set the

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.620 
so we're gonna click to set the
dimension<00:05:25.250> double<00:05:25.730> click<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.000> edit<00:05:26.120> it<00:05:26.480> and

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
dimension double click to edit it and

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.950 
dimension double click to edit it and
we're<00:05:26.930> gonna<00:05:27.020> make<00:05:27.200> it<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.410> one<00:05:27.710> inch<00:05:28.960> radius

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
we're gonna make it a one inch radius

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.600 
we're gonna make it a one inch radius
this<00:05:30.230> time<00:05:30.530> so<00:05:30.710> it's<00:05:30.800> going<00:05:30.890> to<00:05:30.980> be<00:05:31.040> twice<00:05:31.340> as

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
this time so it's going to be twice as

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.100 
this time so it's going to be twice as
big<00:05:31.820> as<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.030> circle<00:05:33.700> okay<00:05:35.020> finally<00:05:36.020> we're

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
big as the circle okay finally we're

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.920 
big as the circle okay finally we're
gonna<00:05:36.230> do<00:05:36.470> in<00:05:36.590> a<00:05:36.650> limp<00:05:36.919> up<00:05:37.130> ellipse<00:05:38.090> I'm<00:05:38.780> gonna

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
gonna do in a limp up ellipse I'm gonna

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.320 
gonna do in a limp up ellipse I'm gonna
click<00:05:39.290> once<00:05:39.590> and<00:05:39.890> notice<00:05:40.760> that<00:05:40.880> if<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.090> want

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
click once and notice that if I want

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.580 
click once and notice that if I want
some<00:05:41.540> help<00:05:41.750> on<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:41.990> ellipse<00:05:42.320> I<00:05:42.590> just<00:05:42.800> have<00:05:42.950> to

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
some help on the ellipse I just have to

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.260 
some help on the ellipse I just have to
pause<00:05:45.590> my<00:05:45.890> mouse<00:05:46.070> over<00:05:46.280> the<00:05:46.490> ellipse<00:05:46.730> control

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
pause my mouse over the ellipse control

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.960 
pause my mouse over the ellipse control
and<00:05:47.630> it<00:05:47.840> will<00:05:47.990> give<00:05:48.200> me<00:05:48.230> more<00:05:48.650> help<00:05:48.919> so<00:05:49.760> it's<00:05:49.910> a

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
and it will give me more help so it's a

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.570 
and it will give me more help so it's a
three<00:05:50.300> clicks<00:05:50.720> for<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.080> ellipse<00:05:51.490> so<00:05:52.490> we're

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
three clicks for the ellipse so we're

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.360 
three clicks for the ellipse so we're
gonna<00:05:52.669> click<00:05:52.910> once<00:05:53.240> click<00:05:56.020> twice<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.470> then<00:05:58.160> we

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
gonna click once click twice and then we

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.730 
gonna click once click twice and then we
pull<00:05:58.760> the<00:05:59.240> ellipse<00:05:59.570> up<00:05:59.840> and<00:06:00.140> we<00:06:00.350> can<00:06:00.500> make<00:06:00.620> it

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
pull the ellipse up and we can make it

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.890 
pull the ellipse up and we can make it
exactly<00:06:00.860> the<00:06:01.340> size<00:06:01.550> that<00:06:01.730> we<00:06:01.790> want<00:06:01.880> and<00:06:02.750> we<00:06:02.870> can

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
exactly the size that we want and we can

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.280 
exactly the size that we want and we can
click<00:06:03.290> there<00:06:04.150> okay<00:06:05.150> now<00:06:05.360> there<00:06:06.050> are<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.140> number

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
click there okay now there are a number

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.420 
click there okay now there are a number
of<00:06:06.440> different<00:06:06.740> things<00:06:06.919> of<00:06:07.040> course<00:06:07.190> that<00:06:07.370> you

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
of different things of course that you

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.670 
of different things of course that you
can<00:06:07.490> select<00:06:07.820> on<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.180> ellipse<00:06:08.500> so<00:06:09.500> in<00:06:09.560> this

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
can select on the ellipse so in this

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.630 
can select on the ellipse so in this
case<00:06:11.169> we're<00:06:12.169> gonna<00:06:12.260> we<00:06:12.980> can<00:06:13.160> either<00:06:13.280> do<00:06:13.520> the

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
case we're gonna we can either do the

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.980 
case we're gonna we can either do the
height<00:06:13.850> of<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.150> ellipse<00:06:14.419> which<00:06:14.750> we're<00:06:14.900> going

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
height of the ellipse which we're going

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.989 
height of the ellipse which we're going
to<00:06:15.050> set<00:06:15.260> at<00:06:15.380> 0.5
