which<00:01:56.340> i<00:01:56.520> think<00:01:56.579> would<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:56.909> quite<00:01:57.090> cool<00:01:57.420> which

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
which i think would be quite cool which

hasn't been confirmed or anything
it's<00:01:58.979> simply<00:01:59.490> speculation<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.329> perhaps<00:02:00.960> some

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it's simply speculation is perhaps some

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's simply speculation is perhaps some

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
but perhaps

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.540 
but perhaps
than<00:02:12.470> your<00:02:12.590> own<00:02:12.680> create<00:02:12.950> class<00:02:13.250> at<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
ops 2 multiplayer video I explained the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.060 
ops 2 multiplayer video I explained the
new<00:02:19.970> crater<00:02:20.270> class<00:02:20.540> system<00:02:20.930> having<00:02:21.380> 10<00:02:21.710> points

per class to spend on different items

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.050 
per class to spend on different items
perhaps<00:02:24.920> if<00:02:25.100> they<00:02:25.160> carried<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.580> over<00:02:25.610> in

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
perhaps if they carried that over in

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.510 
perhaps if they carried that over in
some<00:02:26.360> form<00:02:26.690> into<00:02:27.170> black<00:02:27.350> ops<00:02:27.560> 2<00:02:27.740> zombies<00:02:28.160> so

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
some form into black ops 2 zombies so

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.620 
some form into black ops 2 zombies so
you<00:02:28.610> could<00:02:28.730> spend<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.060> certain<00:02:29.240> amount<00:02:29.420> of

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
you could spend a certain amount of

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.270 
you could spend a certain amount of
points<00:02:29.840> on<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> class<00:02:30.530> at<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.860> beginning<00:02:30.950> of

points on a class at the beginning of
each<00:02:31.430> round<00:02:31.460> that'd<00:02:32.360> be<00:02:32.540> really<00:02:32.720> cool

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
each round that'd be really cool

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.600 
each round that'd be really cool
meaning<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.770> wouldn't<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.130> have<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.400> start

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
meaning you wouldn't just have to start

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.670 
meaning you wouldn't just have to start
