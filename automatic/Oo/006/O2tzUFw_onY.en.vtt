now you have a large spring at each calm
so<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> camber<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.630> rome<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so if the camber of the rome as you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.130 
so if the camber of the rome as you
taking<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> calm<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.850> drive<00:01:45.060> into<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
taking in the calm and drive into it so

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.630 
taking in the calm and drive into it so
there's<00:01:46.409> an<00:01:46.530> equal<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:46.950> opposite<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.579> is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
there's an equal and opposite this is

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.149 
there's an equal and opposite this is
the<00:01:47.790> pressure<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:48.960> your<00:01:49.079> left<00:01:49.229> buttock<00:01:49.710> if

mobile wait for it no I'm serious but

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.289 
mobile wait for it no I'm serious but
them<00:01:54.740> because<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.130> does<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.579> an<00:01:56.700> equal<00:01:57.149> balance
