00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.580
 In general, removing the bumper on the patriot 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.529
 not just just elementary shoot 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.330
 radiator grill on top of self-tapping screws and 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.600
 when you unscrew them and there will be a bottom 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.010
 two samorezika them slightly where to find 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.820
 cap and twist 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.430
 and then the whole bumper is mounted on here 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.000
 these two bolts 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:38.820
 here one can see him without a wind 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.449
 bolts the whole thing on 13 of all this 4 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 nuts and what time the mankam cat goes 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.960
 wires 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.089
 to remove without problems that restore 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.839
 hooked before unhooking it 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:58.729
 here with the first stage 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:03.750
 for installation winch electric winch 12 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:09.000
 Something there are my bumper here so removed 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.260
 the view from us acquired a weasel formidable on 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.810
 the final stage of the winch has already put 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:21.570
 here is the standard bracket 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:25.530
 can be found on the forum drawings all here 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.940
 In the car, the old native protection from below 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.400
 I removed the bolt this one we get 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.550
 holes fasteners 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.550
 this one they were there further 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:47.740
 it will be visible or not 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.990
 there inside the bolt need to drill ram bolts 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.619
 on 12 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.780
 Respectively drill 12 I drilled 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.560
 bore 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:03.869
 a good drill 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:08.709
 be ordinary then periodically surround 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.989
 so it looks without a bumper standard 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.080
 standard wiring that came with this 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.819
 winch principle enough for dark 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.430
 battery labor here will be 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:26.340
 quick shot plus then make winch 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:31.180
 Works checked yet such a moment there 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.940
 there is a minus under the motor 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.940
 its terminal is necessary initially before installation 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.670
 winch attach all contacts 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.950
 it is better to lithologize the oil so that 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.110
 it says contact was in principle 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.000
 probably all a little bit still take off later 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:56.140
 when we cut out the bumper everything became very 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.060
 even nice and compact here's another one 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:05.620
 such a moment this is the construction 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.489
 cable box of Chinese origin 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.640
 sex will not wind up correctly 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.260
 will hurt the box shuffling over this 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.850
 inspect the winch neatly 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.850
 reel one kind of review 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.460
 what else did I not like about this 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:29.510
 Winches are plastic sleeves here 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.470
 here on the rollers probably later 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.330
 grind some other god forbid they 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:43.730
 take off understands then unpacks 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:45.500
 time will tell here probably until everything is 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.270
 so look us installed and 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:58.490
 bumper and on top more precisely under it electric 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:04:02.660
 winch 12 then cut out of course with us 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.030
 the world neatly many fashionable look in 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.390
 principle is normal under the number at all 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.390
 good music 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.340
 lattice until the top is not well here you are 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.959
 can see after setting the number 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.060
 there will be a very small edge which 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.060
 sees the hidden car shop practically
