00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.600
 is over 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.600
 there is such a wonderful tool 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:34.620
 burdock oil with grapefruit extract 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.960
 companies as first to me very 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.910
 I liked it but to be honest 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 some other manufacturers I don't 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.530
 tried on my hair 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.640
 since I'm sorry to be in the role 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.620
 guinea pig but not myself 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:04.979
 my hair now I'll show you my 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:10.799
 shampoo came use balm clean 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.470
 line but here is wheat and flax 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.049
 somehow I am not particularly impressed with me 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.750
 I liked this clean red line 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:25.080
 strength 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:28.430
 with nettles loved this 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.430
 avocado balsam conditioner 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:38.720
 I also liked this one 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 conditioner for colored hair 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.820
 The clasps there could be sharpened blueberries 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.740
 her safflower but tell you the truth 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:55.549
 recommendations 1 youtube blogger 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.740
 I will not call uniq I do not want her and 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:03.850
 honestly just like natura siberica 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.520
 shampoo for tired and weak hair 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.410
 Rhodiola pink lemongrass to me at all 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.190
 I did not like what I've got 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:17.410
 every voice and began to climb with a terrible 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.420
 I used strength here before 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 so here is the means for this truth man 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:28.480
 women's shampoo is now on sale in 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.600
 Letuale not and I have a discount 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.350
 card so i usually more often 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:44.319
 total there acquiring 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:46.630
 imagine all sorts of goods but I am now very 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.260
 I liked it right now in the first years 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.030
 you know your hair is very dry and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.120
 requires additional care not only 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.480
 here wash yes here with some means 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.489
 good but also oil because we face 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.790
 we try to apply 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.780
 all sorts of hair masks not a bit 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.260
 require less care 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.290
 so we must try, too, their ballast 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:22.150
 do ida my kitty my darling 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:24.910
 my q case is my case both estrus is so well 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.280
 I also want to share here but my advice 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.650
 now summer and really that's how 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:37.180
 Anya Turkish wright says not 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.799
 it is worth using a hair dryer in the summer but if I 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.680
 honestly use hair dryer only in those 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.540
 cases when here in winter in Russia 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.350
 a little cool and bye hair 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.790
 dry out 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:56.100
 then you can and waver now 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:58.959
 how i curl my hair yes i'm not a hair dryer 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.819
 long hair is difficult to put me 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.950
 as an old man I have long been 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:12.060
 there are such here 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:14.160
 heated hair rollers I boil them and 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.380
 my beauty keeps 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.060
 for example, well , the whole week is not at all and 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.640
 my hair every day 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.170
 I do n't understand why we do it 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.070
 from one side to accumulate on them 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.130
 a lot of dirt on the other hand 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.660
 also very frequent washing dry it 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.650
 use these detergents 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.590
 By means I consider it absolutely not to 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.130
 what and so wind the curler 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.490
 i can hold them if it's ther i 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.170
 I can hold them a new 20 minutes all and 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.960
 I am so elegant 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:54.480
 and if here such here it is just run 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:58.290
 You can give a sweetheart beer 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.630
 if there is, if there is no beer, then slightly 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.900
 wet hair but they lived the Incas therefore 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.990
 you can wear them 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.390
 Well, let's say the day clocked but for now 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.720
 hair will dry out and they all and so on 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.430
 the street is warm they dry out very quickly and 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.360
 firstly hair they do not spoil 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.630
 a little load for them secondly you 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.940
 literally two hours and you are irresistible in no 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.880
 one puddle 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.590
 well that's all i wanted to tell you 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:34.650
 like subscribe to my channel 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:38.500
 I will share my acquisitions 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:42.430
 Well, I will recommend you exactly 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.669
 what I liked and here is nature 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.370
 siberica don't know anyone like me this 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.680
 shampoo did not fit 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.560
 but already throwing too kind of a pity 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.270
 over live use because i'm very 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.960
 economical woman and I think 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:03.340
 impractical to throw this 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:07.990
 shampoo bought means use to not 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:13.230
 said the husband that you or I there is a spender to 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.230
 yes so here so far so far
