00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
same time see that's really really

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.360 
same time see that's really really
useful<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.590> quite<00:02:20.830> nice<00:02:20.980> because<00:02:21.220> he

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
useful and it's quite nice because he

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.110 
useful and it's quite nice because he
also<00:02:21.580> has

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
also has

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.539 
also has
for<00:02:22.420> gt86<00:02:22.930> balance<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.099> that's<00:02:24.250> not<00:02:24.400> too<00:02:24.519> bad

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
for gt86 balance and that's not too bad

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.640 
for gt86 balance and that's not too bad
as<00:02:24.849> well<00:02:25.000> when<00:02:25.150> he's<00:02:25.239> dribbling<00:02:25.450> also<00:02:26.440> is

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
as well when he's dribbling also is

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.860 
as well when he's dribbling also is
heading<00:02:27.069> he<00:02:27.280> pretty<00:02:27.549> much<00:02:27.640> wins<00:02:27.940> lots<00:02:28.750> and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
heading he pretty much wins lots and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.289 
heading he pretty much wins lots and
lots<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.140> headers<00:02:29.409> he<00:02:29.560> things<00:02:29.830> only<00:02:30.069> only<00:02:30.760> 510

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
lots of headers he things only only 510

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.050 
lots of headers he things only only 510
511<00:02:31.569> I<00:02:31.900> think<00:02:32.080> he<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:33.430> considering<00:02:33.879> that

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
511 I think he is and considering that

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.899 
511 I think he is and considering that
he's<00:02:34.569> 99<00:02:35.080> jumping<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.769> helped<00:02:36.129> so<00:02:36.370> much<00:02:36.580> just

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
he's 99 jumping that helped so much just

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.580 
he's 99 jumping that helped so much just
have<00:02:37.030> 78<00:02:37.450> heading<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.019> think<00:02:38.200> there's<00:02:38.379> in<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
have 78 heading I think there's in the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.860 
have 78 heading I think there's in the
card<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.040> also<00:02:40.000> has<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> power<00:02:40.390> had<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.599> trait

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
card and also has the power had a trait

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.780 
card and also has the power had a trait
so<00:02:41.290> just<00:02:41.470> went<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.680> lot<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.860> headers<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.459> then

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
so just went a lot of headers and then

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.819 
so just went a lot of headers and then
if<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.390> opportunity<00:02:43.840> comes<00:02:43.989> he<00:02:44.560> will<00:02:44.590> win<00:02:44.799> a

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
if the opportunity comes he will win a

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.280 
if the opportunity comes he will win a
lot<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.010> hitters<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.430> he<00:02:46.030> will<00:02:46.180> score<00:02:46.360> them<00:02:46.659> so

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
lot of hitters and he will score them so

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.660 
lot of hitters and he will score them so
yeah<00:02:47.409> he's<00:02:47.590> greater<00:02:47.860> heading<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.400> playing

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
yeah he's greater heading and playing

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.330 
yeah he's greater heading and playing
them<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.480> other<00:02:49.599> players<00:02:50.129> one<00:02:51.129> thing

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
them on to the other players one thing

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.890 
them on to the other players one thing
though<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.459> did<00:02:51.819> notice<00:02:51.970> was<00:02:52.329> a<00:02:52.360> massive

to<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.299> what<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.450> wants<00:03:19.659> to<00:03:19.720> do<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.079> can

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
to you what you wants to do you can

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.569 
to you what you wants to do you can
finesse<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.859> that<00:03:21.129> would<00:03:21.220> pretty<00:03:21.370> much<00:03:21.489> go

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
finesse it and that would pretty much go

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.250 
finesse it and that would pretty much go
at<00:03:21.819> every<00:03:21.970> single<00:03:22.120> go<00:03:22.480> in<00:03:22.599> every<00:03:22.750> single<00:03:23.109> time

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
at every single go in every single time

on<00:03:23.440> his<00:03:23.560> left<00:03:23.769> foot<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:25.359> could<00:03:25.510> also

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
on his left foot and you could also

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.809 
on his left foot and you could also
power<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.859> would<00:03:26.950> usually<00:03:27.370> soft

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
power it and that would usually soft

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.400 
power it and that would usually soft
just<00:03:27.970> go<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.209> straight<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.690> top<00:03:28.870> corner<00:03:29.049> past

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
just go and straight the top corner past

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.690 
just go and straight the top corner past

now<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.580> do<00:04:48.729> I<00:04:48.759> think<00:04:48.910> he's<00:04:49.180> worth<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.600> well

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
now and do I think he's worth it well

now and do I think he's worth it well
the<00:04:49.810> positives<00:04:50.289> he's<00:04:50.530> got<00:04:50.710> amazing<00:04:50.889> Pacey<00:04:51.340> as

the positives he's got amazing Pacey as
a<00:04:51.669> clinical<00:04:52.150> finisher<00:04:52.539> is<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.259> long<00:04:53.710> shots

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979

a clinical finisher is it long shots
have<00:04:54.160> approved<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.699> lot<00:04:54.880> from<00:04:55.270> his<00:04:55.509> normal<00:04:55.660> Kyle

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
have approved a lot from his normal Kyle

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.540 
have approved a lot from his normal Kyle
and<00:04:56.199> he<00:04:56.259> can<00:04:56.440> now<00:04:56.590> score<00:04:56.919> some<00:04:57.100> decent<00:04:57.430> long

more<00:04:59.410> than<00:04:59.530> you'd<00:04:59.620> expect<00:05:00.039> with<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.310> 99

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
more than you'd expect with that 99

more than you'd expect with that 99
jumping<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.930> negatives<00:05:02.320> is<00:05:02.560> very<00:05:02.830> expensive

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
jumping the negatives is very expensive

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.249 
jumping the negatives is very expensive
he<00:05:03.910> sometimes<00:05:04.180> does<00:05:04.570> get<00:05:04.750> lost<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.110> didn't

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
he sometimes does get lost I didn't

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:06.870 
he sometimes does get lost I didn't
really<00:05:05.350> talk<00:05:05.680> much<00:05:05.740> about<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.460> but<00:05:06.699> some

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
really talk much about that but some

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.580 
really talk much about that but some
games<00:05:07.120> he<00:05:07.360> did<00:05:07.509> kind<00:05:07.660> of<00:05:07.720> get<00:05:07.810> lost<00:05:08.050> up<00:05:08.289> front

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
games he did kind of get lost up front

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.990 
games he did kind of get lost up front
and<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.099> wouldn't<00:05:09.370> really<00:05:09.520> get<00:05:09.669> much<00:05:09.789> the

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
and you wouldn't really get much the

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.550 
and you wouldn't really get much the
ball<00:05:10.180> didn't<00:05:10.780> really<00:05:10.930> notice<00:05:11.110> him<00:05:11.289> in<00:05:11.380> games

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
ball didn't really notice him in games

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.379 
ball didn't really notice him in games
it's<00:05:11.770> not<00:05:11.919> too<00:05:12.130> bad<00:05:12.280> he<00:05:12.669> did<00:05:12.820> for<00:05:12.970> a<00:05:13.030> week<00:05:13.210> at

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
it's not too bad he did for a week at

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.060 
it's not too bad he did for a week at
times<00:05:13.599> against<00:05:13.960> sort<00:05:14.349> of<00:05:14.410> stronger<00:05:14.680> defenders

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
times against sort of stronger defenders

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.339 
times against sort of stronger defenders
like<00:05:15.130> really<00:05:15.580> Pacey<00:05:15.820> ones<00:05:16.120> like<00:05:16.240> e<00:05:16.389> arte<00:05:16.750> as<00:05:16.960> he

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
like really Pacey ones like e arte as he

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.680 
like really Pacey ones like e arte as he
does<00:05:17.500> only<00:05:17.650> have<00:05:17.830> 56<00:05:18.160> strength<00:05:18.699> and<00:05:18.940> obviously

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
does only have 56 strength and obviously

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.749 
does only have 56 strength and obviously
the<00:05:19.840> two<00:05:20.050> star<00:05:20.320> weak<00:05:20.440> effort<00:05:20.590> that's<00:05:21.430> not<00:05:21.729> very

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
the two star weak effort that's not very

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.939 
the two star weak effort that's not very
good<00:05:21.970> either<00:05:22.270> but<00:05:22.810> do<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.110> think<00:05:23.199> he's<00:05:23.500> worth<00:05:23.680> it

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
good either but do I think he's worth it

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.070 
good either but do I think he's worth it
well<00:05:24.340> most<00:05:24.880> of<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.120> guys<00:05:25.150> or<00:05:25.660> a<00:05:25.720> lot<00:05:25.900> of<00:05:25.990> you
