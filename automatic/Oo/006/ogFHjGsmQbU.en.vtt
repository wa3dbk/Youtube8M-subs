00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
mentally this year's you know last year

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.430 
mentally this year's you know last year
we<00:00:41.790> didn't<00:00:42.089> really<00:00:42.269> have<00:00:42.479> any<00:00:42.659> expectation<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
we didn't really have any expectation to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.820 
we didn't really have any expectation to
do<00:00:43.589> well<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.510> suppose<00:00:45.510> coming<00:00:45.930> off<00:00:46.049> flashy<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
do well I suppose coming off flashy you

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.060 
do well I suppose coming off flashy you
know<00:00:46.979> what<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.720> look<00:00:48.720> a<00:00:48.989> couple<00:00:49.830> of<00:00:49.949> new

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
know what a look a couple of new

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.439 
know what a look a couple of new
additions<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.549> our<00:00:50.640> team<00:00:50.940> which<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.239> think

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
additions to our team which I think

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.630 
additions to our team which I think
really<00:00:51.690> makes<00:00:52.140> us<00:00:52.440> true<00:00:52.949> contenders<00:00:53.400> for<00:00:53.549> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
really makes us true contenders for the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.780 
really makes us true contenders for the
school<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.330> to<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.659> win<00:00:54.839> this<00:00:54.930> hope<00:00:55.170> so

I've<00:01:18.450> realized<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:19.189> rugby<00:01:20.189> teams<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.670> been

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

he's<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> real<00:01:21.659> family<00:01:21.869> man<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> think

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
he's a real family man so I think

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.849 
he's a real family man so I think
families<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.119> his<00:01:24.240> key<00:01:24.740> aspects<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.399 
families are one of his key aspects of
the<00:01:26.340> game<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.579> he<00:01:26.880> gets<00:01:27.719> our<00:01:27.869> partners<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the game that he gets our partners you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.709 
the game that he gets our partners you
know<00:01:28.469> kids<00:01:28.859> involved<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.460> well<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.880> he<00:01:30.420> created

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
know kids involved as well so he created

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.789 
know kids involved as well so he created
said<00:01:31.109> family<00:01:31.829> culture

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.719 

definitely<00:01:35.799> you<00:01:35.890> know<00:01:35.979> I<00:01:36.009> think<00:01:36.219> in<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.549> past

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
definitely you know I think in the past

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.190 
definitely you know I think in the past
it's<00:01:37.000> always<00:01:37.090> been<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.450> know<00:01:37.600> just<00:01:37.869> frankly

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
it's always been you know just frankly

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.050 
it's always been you know just frankly
focus<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.799> always<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.460> try<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.670> getting<00:01:39.909> to

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
focus and always just try and getting to

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.819 
focus and always just try and getting to
know<00:01:40.090> each<00:01:40.240> other<00:01:40.509> but<00:01:40.780> suppose<00:01:41.500> it's<00:01:41.710> much

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
know each other but suppose it's much

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.380 
know each other but suppose it's much
easier<00:01:41.860> getting<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.610> know<00:01:42.729> people<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.270> know

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
easier getting to know people you know

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.330 
easier getting to know people you know
when<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.659> know<00:01:43.780> not<00:01:44.229> only<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.560> wives<00:01:45.100> and

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
when you know not only the wives and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.010 
when you know not only the wives and
partners<00:01:45.520> but<00:01:45.939> also<00:01:46.060> their<00:01:46.270> kids<00:01:46.539> and<00:01:46.780> you
