nail there's little spots shine only the
spot<00:01:08.880> file<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.479> away<00:01:12.290> when<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.439> apply<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> tip

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
spot file it away when you apply a tip

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.080 
spot file it away when you apply a tip
under<00:01:14.760> pressure<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> tip<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:18.330> crack<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:20.090> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
under pressure the tip will crack or the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.780 
under pressure the tip will crack or the
nail<00:01:21.420> plate<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:22.500> come<00:01:22.740> loose<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.549> nail

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
nail plate will come loose of the nail

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.700 
nail plate will come loose of the nail
bed<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.530> then<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.159> cause<00:01:26.430> only<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.000> lysis

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
bed and then it can cause only you lysis

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.249 
bed and then it can cause only you lysis
so<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.340> important<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.600> tip<00:01:30.869> will

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
so it's very important that the tip will

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.810 
so it's very important that the tip will
fit<00:01:31.560> perfectly<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:34.500> tip<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.220> too<00:01:35.610> much

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
fit perfectly so this tip is too much

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.160 
fit perfectly so this tip is too much
pressure<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.540> need<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> take<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.950> bigger<00:01:38.280> size

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
pressure I need to take a bigger size

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.289 
pressure I need to take a bigger size
and<00:01:41.170> now<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.439> can<00:01:41.740> see<00:01:42.009> that<00:01:42.700> there's<00:01:43.030> no

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
and now you can see that there's no

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.749 
and now you can see that there's no
pressure<00:01:43.600> riddle<00:01:44.079> and<00:01:44.320> this<00:01:44.710> tip<00:01:44.979> will<00:01:45.460> fit

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
pressure riddle and this tip will fit

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.889 
pressure riddle and this tip will fit
perfectly

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
perfectly

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.550 
perfectly
now<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.380> next<00:01:47.740> step<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.880> fit<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.720> natural

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
now the next step to fit the natural

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.600 
now the next step to fit the natural
nail<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.490> contact<00:01:51.939> area<00:01:52.149> in<00:01:52.600> this<00:01:53.110> line

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
nail in the contact area in this line

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.600 
nail in the contact area in this line
the<00:01:54.610> contact<00:01:55.060> area<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.719> tip<00:01:56.110> only<00:01:56.610> files

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
the contact area of the tip only files

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.440 
the contact area of the tip only files
the<00:01:58.030> natural<00:01:58.420> nails<00:01:58.710> straight<00:01:59.710> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:01.299> bit

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
the natural nails straight a little bit

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.649 
the natural nails straight a little bit
shorter<00:02:01.899> take<00:02:02.799> away<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.130> dust<00:02:03.399> I'm<00:02:04.390> gonna

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
shorter take away the dust I'm gonna

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.139 
shorter take away the dust I'm gonna
file<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.500> little<00:02:05.950> bit<00:02:06.069> of<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.280> corners<00:02:06.700> and

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
file a little bit of the corners and

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.820 
file a little bit of the corners and
then<00:02:07.360> I'm<00:02:07.600> gonna<00:02:07.840> fit<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:09.369> tip<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:10.810> sure<00:02:10.840> that

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
then I'm gonna fit the tip be sure that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.860 
then I'm gonna fit the tip be sure that
there<00:02:12.099> is<00:02:12.280> no<00:02:12.910> air<00:02:13.239> between<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:14.380> tip<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
there is no air between the tip and the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.860 
there is no air between the tip and the
natural<00:02:16.870> nail<00:02:17.080> okay<00:02:18.010> now<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:19.150> part<00:02:19.480> fits

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
natural nail okay now that part fits

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.670 
natural nail okay now that part fits
perfectly<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.540> now<00:02:22.720> it's<00:02:22.900> very<00:02:23.140> important

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
perfectly so now it's very important

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.080 
perfectly so now it's very important
that<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.010> cut<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.970> little<00:02:25.000> piece<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:29.799> tip

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
that you cut a little piece of the tip

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.660 
that you cut a little piece of the tip
now<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.630> file<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.380> tip<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:33.220> contact

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
now I have to file the tip the contact

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.039 
now I have to file the tip the contact
area<00:02:34.500> perfectly<00:02:35.549> around<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:37.420> natural<00:02:37.870> nail

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
area perfectly around the natural nail

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.309 
area perfectly around the natural nail
and<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.950> lower<00:02:39.190> arch<00:02:39.519> line<00:02:39.849> here<00:02:40.360> has<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.079> fit

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
and the lower arch line here has to fit

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.300 
and the lower arch line here has to fit
perfectly<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:43.180> straight<00:02:43.540> line<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:44.799> first

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
perfectly in a straight line so first

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.030 
perfectly in a straight line so first
I'm<00:02:45.670> gonna<00:02:46.090> file<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:47.410> line

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.830 

so<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.760> will<00:02:51.970> be<00:02:52.090> straight<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> look<00:02:54.840> this

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
so it will be straight have a look this

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.410 
so it will be straight have a look this
is<00:02:56.079> one<00:02:56.349> straight<00:02:56.709> line<00:02:57.060> look<00:02:58.060> at<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.269> other

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
contact area of the tip now you can see

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.020 
contact area of the tip now you can see
here<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:34.000> little<00:04:34.510> line<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.800> line<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.820> can

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
here a little line and that line you can

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
here a little line and that line you can
file<00:04:37.360> away<00:04:38.130> carefully<00:04:39.130> on<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.090> horizontal

movement<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:43.229> there<00:04:44.229> you<00:04:44.409> go

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
movement and there you go

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.860 
movement and there you go
take<00:04:46.240> away<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:47.500> dust<00:04:47.710> underneath<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.610> tip

take away the dust underneath the tip

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.860 
take away the dust underneath the tip
and<00:04:50.039> this<00:04:51.039> is<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.370> way<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.849> apply<00:04:52.210> it<00:04:52.270> and

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
and this is the way you apply it and

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.629 
and this is the way you apply it and
blending<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.770> tip<00:04:53.979> on<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.789> nose<00:04:54.940> ring

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.420 

I<00:04:57.669> have<00:04:58.509> here<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:59.050> very<00:04:59.979> tiny<00:05:00.370> air<00:05:01.180> bubble<00:05:01.629> I

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
I have here a very tiny air bubble I

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.540 
I have here a very tiny air bubble I
file<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.639> tip<00:05:04.050> transparent<00:05:05.250> so<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.280> air

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
file the tip transparent so the air

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.140 
file the tip transparent so the air
bubble<00:05:06.939> is<00:05:07.150> very<00:05:07.629> very<00:05:07.990> thin<00:05:08.439> I<00:05:11.550> open<00:05:12.550> only<00:05:12.789> the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
bubble is very very thin I open only the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.029 
bubble is very very thin I open only the
top<00:05:13.419> layer<00:05:13.659> of<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.259> plastic<00:05:15.009> I<00:05:16.800> take<00:05:17.800> the

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
top layer of the plastic I take the

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:24.179 
top layer of the plastic I take the
fiber<00:05:18.310> phase<00:05:19.080> that's<00:05:20.080> a<00:05:20.229> very<00:05:20.530> fluid<00:05:20.949> glue<00:05:23.189> and

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
fiber phase that's a very fluid glue and

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.279 
fiber phase that's a very fluid glue and
let<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.490> glue<00:05:24.699> run<00:05:25.270> into<00:05:26.129> the<00:05:27.129> air<00:05:27.280> bubble<00:05:27.699> and

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
let the glue run into the air bubble and

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.339 
let the glue run into the air bubble and
now<00:05:29.289> I<00:05:30.129> let<00:05:30.610> it<00:05:30.729> dry<00:05:30.759> or<00:05:31.509> spray<00:05:32.020> it<00:05:32.080> with

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
now I let it dry or spray it with

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.429 
now I let it dry or spray it with
spray-on<00:05:32.889> activator<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:34.029> then<00:05:34.779> I<00:05:34.900> can<00:05:35.110> file

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:35.439 
spray-on activator and then I can file

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:41.610 
spray-on activator and then I can file
it<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:36.069> I<00:05:36.639> solved<00:05:37.029> my<00:05:37.150> problem<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:41.139> glue<00:05:41.349> is

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
it and I solved my problem the glue is
