00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.690
 probably all childhood dreamed of 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.050
 some radio control toys 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:16.619
 got me to myself 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:28.680
 helicopter tailored nice to her 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:33.270
 get to play here would give it 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.630
 the pilot ordered a helicopter on trial 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.379
 one of my friends is already a whole 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.980
 a month to use it a game like this 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.320
 bought a small helicopter for 18 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.739
 dollars is about 550 rubles for our 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.640
 money well what can i say i am very 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.300
 such a good model for such money 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:01.670
 made of metal with plastic 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.670
 whether those are small 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:15.180
 you remote pretty charger beat kim en 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:19.470
 Kim connector we will see the helicopter itself 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.549
 near on this helicopter already and grants 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.270
 in the summer month from knocking the walls and all sorts 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.549
 other things 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.909
 propeller though that very well she 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.750
 here you can see a few monuments 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:42.150
 from the side and so nothing has fallen since 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.470
 two meters in height 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.170
 remote control speed switch 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.549
 this joystick directs it to us 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.740
 need forward back here is six 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:02.570
 finger batteries still have a compartment 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.070
 side is very bad so opens 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.160
 From the same battery, the chick can be charged 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.739
 helicopter itself we did not try not 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.660
 charged probably will quickly 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.940
 discharge sticking as well after 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.209
 purchases of 6 batteries have never been delivered 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.900
 did not change in the cult 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:24.599
 in this helicopter there is a battery for 350 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.970
 A milliamp clock of one charge is enough 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:33.840
 for six to eight minutes of flight well, most 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.110
 10 become here and there is a light in front 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.410
 and immediately turned off became a little bit 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.280
 longer for what else to say so that 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.690
 made strong well now somewhere 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.600
 fell off the rear wing that whether someone 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.590
 there is nothing like back here and it works 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.870
 without him as I said charge from 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.650
 and espero removal 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:06.870
 the helicopter charge about 50 minutes before 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.290
 50 minutes full charge I charge 8-10 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:14.250
 minutes we fly here there is a button 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.290
 turn on turn off the remote here 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.840
 a little bit there is an adjustment left-right 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.780
 depending on how summer is from your 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.970
 the device itself is also a helicopter 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.019
 switch button 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.670
 shutdown right here on this side 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.670
 charger connector 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.690
 let's see some sort 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.639
 In general, a good toy turned out 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:25.770
 to summarize, it turned out quite very 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.900
 good toy 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.810
 You can give the child a very worth 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.819
 inexpensively 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.499
 what else would i like to say 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:41.219
 that this unit should not be used 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:43.749
 outdoors indoor only 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:47.319
 because it blows any gust of wind 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:50.050
 even if the room is someone nearby 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.870
 for example, a child is running by a detachment of his 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.169
 blows the wind so 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.449
 used only in rooms such 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:02.409
 helicopter and so it is a good toy 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:06.009
 for a relatively small price to the word 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.930
 say we have such a helicopter 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:12.150
 somewhere around three times as expensive 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.839
 one and a half thousand rubles for 550 rubles 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.839
 very good toy
