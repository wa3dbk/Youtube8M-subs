00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
the ability to take a card that is

essentially<00:00:46.579> one<00:00:46.880> or<00:00:47.000> two<00:00:47.150> dollars<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.930> turn

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.170 
essentially one or two dollars and turn
it<00:00:48.290> into<00:00:48.410> a<00:00:48.560> fifteen<00:00:49.130> thirty<00:00:49.490> dollar<00:00:49.820> card

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
your eye on some of these cards you

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.880

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
should pick up some you should sell

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.200 
should pick up some you should sell
immediately<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.579> then<00:01:01.670> some<00:01:01.880> you<00:01:02.030> should

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
immediately and then some you should

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.090 
immediately and then some you should
also<00:01:02.329> just<00:01:02.660> consider<00:01:02.960> holding<00:01:03.140> on<00:01:03.380> to<00:01:03.560> the

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
also just consider holding on to the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.010 
also just consider holding on to the
first<00:01:04.309> card<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:04.640> want<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.850> talk<00:01:04.970> about<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.420> Dante

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
first card I want to talk about is Dante

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.590 
first card I want to talk about is Dante
and<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.800> know<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:07.250> said<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:07.729> in<00:01:08.030> another<00:01:08.300> video

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
and you know I said it in another video

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.360 
and you know I said it in another video
I<00:01:09.020> really<00:01:09.350> couldn't<00:01:09.530> believe<00:01:09.860> that<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.159> heart

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
I really couldn't believe that the heart

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.520 
I really couldn't believe that the heart
and<00:01:10.580> soul<00:01:10.760> of<00:01:10.820> arguably<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.810> best<00:01:12.050> deck<00:01:12.350> of

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
and soul of arguably the best deck of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.410 
and soul of arguably the best deck of
the<00:01:12.650> format<00:01:13.070> was<00:01:13.100> continuing<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.880> dip<00:01:14.270> in

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
the format was continuing to dip in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.210 
the format was continuing to dip in
price<00:01:14.659> like<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:14.960> just<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.260> didn't<00:01:16.010> make<00:01:16.190> sense

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
price like it just it didn't make sense

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.080 
price like it just it didn't make sense
i<00:01:16.820> mean<00:01:16.930> Dante<00:01:17.930> is<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.890> card<00:01:19.190> where<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.760> really

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
i mean Dante is a card where you really

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.730 
i mean Dante is a card where you really
can't<00:01:20.420> play<00:01:20.630> burning<00:01:20.930> abyss<00:01:21.020> unless<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.710> have

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
can't play burning abyss unless you have

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.130 
can't play burning abyss unless you have
three<00:01:22.190> copies<00:01:22.430> he<00:01:22.820> is<00:01:23.000> that<00:01:23.360> vital<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
three copies he is that vital to the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.289 
three copies he is that vital to the
deck<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:25.100> looks<00:01:25.280> like<00:01:25.340> Dante<00:01:25.760> has<00:01:25.880> finally

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
deck and it looks like Dante has finally

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.149 
deck and it looks like Dante has finally
started<00:01:26.510> to<00:01:26.659> rebound<00:01:27.049> i<00:01:27.290> mean<00:01:27.409> this<00:01:27.530> card<00:01:27.860> was

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
started to rebound i mean this card was

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.490 
started to rebound i mean this card was
as<00:01:28.700> cheap<00:01:28.729> as<00:01:29.090> fifty<00:01:29.450> dollars<00:01:29.869> about<00:01:30.260> a<00:01:30.290> week

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
as cheap as fifty dollars about a week

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.100 
as cheap as fifty dollars about a week
ago<00:01:30.590> now<00:01:30.920> it's<00:01:31.100> about<00:01:31.159> 58<00:01:31.790> bucks<00:01:32.150> I<00:01:32.450> think<00:01:32.960> that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
ago now it's about 58 bucks I think that

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.170 
ago now it's about 58 bucks I think that
Dante<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.619> going<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.070> kind<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.340> taper<00:01:34.610> off<00:01:34.880> at

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
Dante is going to kind of taper off at

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.020 
Dante is going to kind of taper off at
about<00:01:35.270> 60<00:01:35.840> 32<00:01:36.200> $65<00:01:37.010> so<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.190> think<00:01:37.310> if<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.850> have

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
about 60 32 $65 so I think if you have

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.450 
about 60 32 $65 so I think if you have
Dante's<00:01:38.479> as<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:38.840> do<00:01:38.900> just<00:01:39.260> go<00:01:39.799> ahead<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.040> hold

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
Dante's as I do just go ahead and hold

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.640 
Dante's as I do just go ahead and hold
them<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.880> don't<00:01:41.240> think<00:01:41.450> there<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.750> any<00:01:42.110> reason

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
them I don't think there is any reason

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.060 
them I don't think there is any reason
for<00:01:42.790> burning<00:01:43.790> abyss<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.510> I<00:01:44.930> mean<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.470> don't<00:01:45.920> see

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
for burning abyss to I mean I don't see

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.620 
for burning abyss to I mean I don't see
the<00:01:46.220> deck<00:01:46.460> really<00:01:46.640> falling<00:01:47.090> off<00:01:47.240> just<00:01:47.479> because

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
the deck really falling off just because

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.390 
the deck really falling off just because
if<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.320> look<00:01:48.500> at<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.740> first<00:01:48.979> after<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
if you look at the first after the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.950 
if you look at the first after the
format<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.030> only<00:01:50.299> deck<00:01:50.479> that's<00:01:50.630> going<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.869> be

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
format the only deck that's going to be

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.719 
format the only deck that's going to be
introduced<00:01:51.409> into<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.650> game<00:01:51.890> its<00:01:52.100> heroes<00:01:52.430> and

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
introduced into the game its heroes and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.090 
introduced into the game its heroes and
I<00:01:53.060> would<00:01:53.450> just<00:01:53.570> imagine<00:01:54.229> in<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.590> matchup<00:01:54.830> is

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
I would just imagine in that matchup is

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.950 
I would just imagine in that matchup is
pretty<00:01:55.369> much<00:01:55.520> dark<00:01:55.909> lord<00:01:56.150> bus<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:56.750> still

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
pretty much dark lord bus and you still

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.260 
pretty much dark lord bus and you still
have<00:01:57.049> things<00:01:57.200> like<00:01:57.409> evac<00:01:57.979> device<00:01:58.310> or<00:01:58.729> you<00:01:59.150> know

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
have things like evac device or you know

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.450 
have things like evac device or you know
firelake<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.229> kind<00:02:00.439> of<00:02:00.500> counter<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.040> dark<00:02:01.250> law

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
firelake to kind of counter the dark law

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.820 
firelake to kind of counter the dark law
so<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:02.299> know<00:02:02.420> I<00:02:02.450> think<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.960> Dante<00:02:03.409> is<00:02:03.560> still

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
so you know I think that Dante is still

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.890 
so you know I think that Dante is still
going<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.040> be<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.340> really<00:02:04.820> high<00:02:05.060> demand<00:02:05.570> spot

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
going to be in a really high demand spot

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.570 
going to be in a really high demand spot

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
basically tr0 in Japan and Konami had to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.039 
basically tr0 in Japan and Konami had to
pretty<00:02:35.610> much<00:02:35.790> bring<00:02:36.120> down<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.480> ban<00:02:36.720> hammer

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049

pretty much bring down the ban hammer
and<00:02:37.440> kind<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.040> smashed<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.549> deck<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.879> that

and kind of smashed the deck so that
everything<00:02:39.329> else<00:02:39.660> could<00:02:39.810> compete<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.440> think

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
everything else could compete I think

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.860 
everything else could compete I think
the<00:02:41.099> question<00:02:41.549> is<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.000> be<00:02:42.090> how<00:02:42.450> much<00:02:42.690> is

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
market is kind of flooded with them

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.080 
market is kind of flooded with them
because<00:02:46.319> when<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.160> reprint<00:02:47.640> comes<00:02:47.849> out

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
because when that reprint comes out

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.210 
because when that reprint comes out

preparation of rights I would flip them
as<00:02:54.660> soon<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.379> possible<00:02:55.859> because<00:02:55.980> every<00:02:56.549> day

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
as soon as possible because every day

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.940 
as soon as possible because every day
that<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:56.879> wait<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.510> card<00:02:57.810> has<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.470> car<00:02:58.890> is

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that you wait the card has the car is

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.289 
that you wait the card has the car is
potentially<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.760> go<00:02:59.849> down<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.180> I

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
potentially going to go down like I

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.089 
potentially going to go down like I
don't<00:03:00.359> see<00:03:00.750> any<00:03:01.019> way<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.560> preparations

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
don't see any way that preparations

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.220 
don't see any way that preparations
could<00:03:02.340> go<00:03:02.459> up<00:03:02.670> because<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.629> reprint<00:03:04.109> is

that artifacts like pure artifacts can

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.420 
that artifacts like pure artifacts can
actually<00:03:39.780> be<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> very<00:03:40.349> fun<00:03:40.650> deck<00:03:40.889> i<00:03:41.069> think<00:03:41.280> that

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
they can be competitive and i'm not just

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.409 
they can be competitive and i'm not just
putting<00:03:43.739> them<00:03:43.859> in<00:03:44.069> a<00:03:44.099> category<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.329> know

putting them in a category of you know

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.120 
putting them in a category of you know
50<00:03:45.810> other<00:03:45.930> decks<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.349> I<00:03:46.440> think<00:03:46.620> artifacts

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
50 other decks like I think artifacts

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.339 
50 other decks like I think artifacts
can<00:03:47.340> have<00:03:47.549> some<00:03:48.180> pretty<00:03:48.419> decent<00:03:48.660> matchups

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
can have some pretty decent matchups

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.199 
can have some pretty decent matchups
against<00:03:49.829> back<00:03:50.099> row<00:03:50.310> heavy<00:03:50.519> decks<00:03:50.819> or<00:03:51.000> decks

that need the pendulum and stuff like

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.159 
that need the pendulum and stuff like
that<00:03:52.799> because<00:03:53.519> ignition<00:03:54.359> is<00:03:54.510> good<00:03:54.690> double

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
that because ignition is good double

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.930 
that because ignition is good double
cyclone<00:03:55.319> is<00:03:55.680> good<00:03:55.889> and<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.400> know<00:03:56.489> yadda<00:03:56.730> yadda

cyclone is good and you know yadda yadda
yadda<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.510> think<00:03:58.079> that<00:03:58.349> right<00:03:59.040> after<00:03:59.370> the

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
yadda I think that right after the

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.909 
yadda I think that right after the
heroes<00:03:59.940> come<00:04:00.180> out<00:04:00.359> I<00:04:00.720> think<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.440> these<00:04:01.560> cards

heroes come out I think that these cards

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.099 
heroes come out I think that these cards
pretty<00:04:02.370> much<00:04:02.579> everything<00:04:03.180> artifact<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.870> going

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
pretty much everything artifact is going

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.229 
pretty much everything artifact is going

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
job of constructs so you know you

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.959

is live and something that you can play
I<00:05:13.229> think<00:05:13.439> that<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:13.620> lot<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:13.889> schönwald<00:05:14.099> players

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
I think that a lot of schönwald players

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.820 
I think that a lot of schönwald players
are<00:05:14.759> going<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.180> start<00:05:15.330> realizing<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.169> they

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
are going to start realizing that they

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.740 
are going to start realizing that they
don't<00:05:17.039> want<00:05:17.129> to<00:05:17.430> have<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.729> set<00:05:18.000> back<00:05:18.300> row<00:05:18.509> at

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
don't want to have to set back row at

don't want to have to set back row at
all<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.050> mean<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:19.560> off<00:05:19.710> chance<00:05:19.740> that<00:05:20.099> you

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
all I mean the off chance that you

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.740 
all I mean the off chance that you
happen<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.639> draw<00:05:20.819> that<00:05:21.000> one<00:05:21.210> core<00:05:21.479> is

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
happen to draw that one core is

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.050 
happen to draw that one core is
unfortunate<00:05:22.439> but<00:05:22.589> outside<00:05:22.949> of<00:05:22.979> that<00:05:23.129> you<00:05:23.909> know

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
unfortunate but outside of that you know

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.209 
unfortunate but outside of that you know
you<00:05:24.120> basically<00:05:24.449> just<00:05:24.779> wondering<00:05:25.319> swing<00:05:26.009> swing

40 sacrifice is a little over twelve
dollars<00:05:55.620> and<00:05:55.800> I<00:05:56.490> think<00:05:56.909> that<00:05:57.060> you're<00:05:57.210> starting

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
dollars and I think that you're starting

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.420 
dollars and I think that you're starting
to<00:05:57.599> see<00:05:57.719> a<00:05:57.750> little<00:05:58.229> bit<00:05:58.379> of<00:05:58.469> a<00:05:58.589> bounce-back<00:05:58.949> I

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
to see a little bit of a bounce-back I

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.219 
to see a little bit of a bounce-back I
think<00:05:59.969> that<00:06:00.089> a<00:06:00.120> lot<00:06:00.180> of<00:06:00.330> Klee<00:06:00.599> players<00:06:00.899> were

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
think that a lot of Klee players were

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.050 
think that a lot of Klee players were
scared<00:06:01.710> because<00:06:02.370> they<00:06:02.610> thought<00:06:02.789> that<00:06:02.849> they

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
scared because they thought that they

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.059 
scared because they thought that they
were<00:06:03.149> going<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.330> lose<00:06:03.539> vanity<00:06:04.110> scout<00:06:04.560> or<00:06:04.830> skill

drain to the banned list maybe all of

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:08.570 
drain to the banned list maybe all of

the<00:06:28.680> earth<00:06:28.860> and<00:06:29.129> never<00:06:29.639> be<00:06:29.819> seen<00:06:30.000> again

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
the earth and never be seen again

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.209 
the earth and never be seen again
because<00:06:30.599> they've<00:06:31.020> shown<00:06:31.439> that<00:06:31.649> they<00:06:31.800> can<00:06:31.949> play

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:32.219 
because they've shown that they can play

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.579 
because they've shown that they can play
against<00:06:32.639> nick<00:06:32.789> cloth<00:06:33.029> and<00:06:33.300> i<00:06:33.959> think<00:06:34.289> that<00:06:34.469> this

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:34.589 
against nick cloth and i think that this

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:36.649 
against nick cloth and i think that this
would<00:06:34.800> be<00:06:34.830> without<00:06:35.129> a<00:06:35.399> doubt<00:06:35.669> my<00:06:35.849> biggest<00:06:36.479> pick

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
would be without a doubt my biggest pick

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.089 
would be without a doubt my biggest pick
up<00:06:36.839> i'm<00:06:36.990> actually<00:06:37.199> going<00:06:37.469> to<00:06:37.560> take<00:06:37.680> my<00:06:37.860> four

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:38.490 
up i'm actually going to take my four
down<00:06:38.250> say

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500

down say
is<00:06:38.560> and<00:06:38.770> just<00:06:38.920> try<00:06:39.070> and<00:06:39.130> get<00:06:39.280> as<00:06:39.370> much<00:06:39.520> clean

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
is and just try and get as much clean

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.490 
is and just try and get as much clean
stuff<00:06:40.090> as<00:06:40.180> possible<00:06:40.270> because<00:06:40.750> you're

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
stuff as possible because you're

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.140 
stuff as possible because you're
starting<00:06:41.770> to<00:06:42.010> see<00:06:42.190> that<00:06:42.370> the<00:06:42.490> cards<00:06:42.790> are<00:06:42.910> going

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
starting to see that the cards are going

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.590 
starting to see that the cards are going
up<00:06:43.300> in<00:06:43.480> price<00:06:43.510> and<00:06:44.040> that<00:06:45.040> huge<00:06:45.520> dip<00:06:46.090> that<00:06:46.300> huge

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
up in price and that huge dip that huge

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.900 
up in price and that huge dip that huge
tank<00:06:46.960> that<00:06:47.170> cleaves<00:06:47.530> took<00:06:47.800> where<00:06:48.400> a<00:06:48.640> lot<00:06:48.880> of

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
tank that cleaves took where a lot of

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.790 
tank that cleaves took where a lot of
their<00:06:49.090> cards<00:06:49.420> were<00:06:49.570> losing<00:06:49.930> you<00:06:50.080> know<00:06:50.110> forty

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
their cards were losing you know forty

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.830 
their cards were losing you know forty
fifty<00:06:51.220> percent<00:06:51.700> of<00:06:51.820> their<00:06:51.910> value<00:06:52.270> I<00:06:52.420> think

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
fifty percent of their value I think

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.810 
fifty percent of their value I think
they're<00:06:53.050> going<00:06:53.230> to<00:06:53.470> start<00:06:53.710> trending<00:06:54.160> upwards

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
they're going to start trending upwards

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.760 
they're going to start trending upwards
especially<00:06:55.330> if<00:06:55.420> they<00:06:55.540> end<00:06:55.720> up<00:06:55.900> winning<00:06:56.530> a

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
especially if they end up winning a

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.380 
especially if they end up winning a
major<00:06:57.040> event<00:06:57.310> in<00:06:57.640> the<00:06:57.820> first<00:06:58.030> half<00:06:58.180> of<00:06:58.330> the

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
major event in the first half of the

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.090 
major event in the first half of the
format<00:06:58.810> so<00:06:59.020> let<00:06:59.560> me<00:06:59.620> know<00:06:59.710> what<00:06:59.740> you<00:06:59.950> guys

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
format so let me know what you guys

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.520 
format so let me know what you guys
think<00:07:00.430> I<00:07:00.670> think<00:07:00.940> that<00:07:01.120> there<00:07:01.330> is<00:07:01.360> um<00:07:01.840> a<00:07:02.140> lot<00:07:02.410> of

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
think I think that there is um a lot of

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.920 
think I think that there is um a lot of
fluctuations<00:07:03.160> to<00:07:03.370> come<00:07:03.580> but<00:07:04.330> I<00:07:04.600> don't<00:07:04.750> even

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
fluctuations to come but I don't even

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.540 
fluctuations to come but I don't even
think<00:07:05.080> that<00:07:05.350> a<00:07:05.470> lot<00:07:05.650> of<00:07:05.710> them<00:07:05.920> are<00:07:06.160> going<00:07:06.340> to<00:07:06.430> be

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
think that a lot of them are going to be

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.940 
think that a lot of them are going to be
because<00:07:06.700> of<00:07:06.940> neck<00:07:07.690> lofts<00:07:07.960> and<00:07:08.380> you<00:07:08.620> know<00:07:08.710> rich

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950 
because of neck lofts and you know rich

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.620 
because of neck lofts and you know rich
will<00:07:09.100> be<00:07:09.190> sore<00:07:09.340> anything<00:07:09.580> I<00:07:09.670> think<00:07:09.910> that<00:07:10.090> a<00:07:10.240> lot

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 
will be sore anything I think that a lot

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.640 
will be sore anything I think that a lot
of<00:07:10.690> them<00:07:10.840> are<00:07:10.990> just<00:07:11.020> going<00:07:11.290> to<00:07:11.350> come<00:07:11.500> from

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
of them are just going to come from

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.830
