there-there's<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.409> expand<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
there-there's really I expand it a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.280 
there-there's really I expand it a
little<00:01:08.130> bit<00:01:08.490> more<00:01:08.670> into<00:01:08.880> about<00:01:09.060> five<00:01:09.330> key<00:01:09.840> key

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
little bit more into about five key key

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.010 
little bit more into about five key key
points<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.119> for<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> shoe<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:12.720> needs<00:01:12.930> a
