00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
even do it again but I've made the delay

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.080 
even do it again but I've made the delay
will<00:01:11.930> be<00:01:12.079> quite<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.530> bit<00:01:12.920> so<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.670> how<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:13.909> do

will be quite a bit so this is how I do
it<00:01:14.240> ah<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:15.500> see<00:01:15.680> what<00:01:15.799> I<00:01:15.829> did<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:16.670> heard

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
it ah you see what I did that so I heard

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.090 
it ah you see what I did that so I heard
the<00:01:17.090> piece<00:01:17.240> of<00:01:17.450> dirt<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.500> move<00:01:18.650> backwards

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
the piece of dirt and I move backwards

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.710 
the piece of dirt and I move backwards
now<00:01:19.909> I<00:01:20.210> haven't<00:01:20.450> yet<00:01:20.720> tried<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:22.640> do<00:01:22.760> this<00:01:25.720> with

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
now I haven't yet tried to do this with

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.149 
now I haven't yet tried to do this with
a<00:01:26.750> longer<00:01:27.170> delay<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.620> don't<00:01:27.830> know<00:01:27.890> if<00:01:27.980> it<00:01:28.070> would

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
a longer delay I don't know if it would

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.430 
a longer delay I don't know if it would
work<00:01:28.220> i'm<00:01:28.610> sure<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:28.880> would<00:01:29.000> be<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:30.140> this<00:01:30.380> is

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
work i'm sure it would be but this is

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.530 
work i'm sure it would be but this is
how<00:01:30.530> do<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.159> we've<00:01:31.850> got<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.030> few<00:01:32.180> things<00:01:32.210> going

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
how do so we've got a few things going

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.930 
how do so we've got a few things going
on<00:01:32.690> here<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.020> first<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.500> all<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:33.890> bud<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.520> bud

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
on here so first of all is a bud a bud

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.860 
on here so first of all is a bud a bud
bu<00:01:35.390> d<00:01:35.600> block<00:01:35.870> update<00:01:36.530> detector<00:01:37.370> now<00:01:38.240> these<00:01:38.659> are

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
bu d block update detector now these are

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.660 
bu d block update detector now these are
very<00:01:39.020> very<00:01:39.380> funny<00:01:39.650> contraptions<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.310> i<00:01:40.430> tried

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
very very funny contraptions and i tried

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.180 
very very funny contraptions and i tried
to<00:01:40.700> do<00:01:40.909> one<00:01:41.030> over<00:01:41.210> here<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:41.479> is<00:01:41.630> etho<00:01:42.190> as

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
to do one over here this is etho as

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.450 
to do one over here this is etho as
ethos<00:01:43.940> original<00:01:44.360> design<00:01:44.830> but<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.010> problem

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
ethos original design but the problem

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.080 
ethos original design but the problem
with<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.729> is<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.180> it<00:01:48.159> doesn't<00:01:49.159> work<00:01:49.340> well<00:01:49.729> in

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
with it is that it doesn't work well in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.260 
with it is that it doesn't work well in
the<00:01:50.390> new<00:01:50.540> minecraft<00:01:51.020> update<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.090> water

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
the new minecraft update so the water

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.180 
the new minecraft update so the water
normally<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:54.110> water<00:01:54.290> just<00:01:54.560> flows<00:01:54.890> straight

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
normally the water just flows straight

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.030 
normally the water just flows straight
ahead<00:01:55.549> normally<00:01:56.120> only<00:01:56.330> but<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.530> keeps<00:01:57.770> flowing

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
ahead normally only but it keeps flowing

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.130 
ahead normally only but it keeps flowing
now<00:01:58.220> because<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.670> update<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.869> actually

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
now because of the update so actually

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.500 
now because of the update so actually
i've<00:02:00.680> turned<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.460> basically<00:02:01.909> turned<00:02:02.210> itself

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
i've turned it's basically turned itself

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.230 
i've turned it's basically turned itself
into<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:02.810> clock<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.640> i<00:02:04.670> had<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.940> find<00:02:05.000> another

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
into a clock so i had to find another

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.149 
into a clock so i had to find another
design<00:02:06.159> destroy<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:08.780> design

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.159 
design destroy that and this design

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.390 
design destroy that and this design
essentially<00:02:10.159> is<00:02:10.459> fooling<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.510> game<00:02:11.689> mainly

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
essentially is fooling the game mainly

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.490 
essentially is fooling the game mainly
so<00:02:13.400> what<00:02:13.670> we've<00:02:13.790> got<00:02:13.819> here<00:02:14.030> below<00:02:14.689> I<00:02:14.959> mean

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
so what we've got here below I mean

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.289 
so what we've got here below I mean
above<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.069> piece<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.489> all<00:02:16.640> we<00:02:16.939> have<00:02:17.150> a

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
above this piece of all we have a

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.699 
above this piece of all we have a
vertical<00:02:17.750> sticky<00:02:18.439> piston<00:02:19.159> pointing<00:02:19.760> down<00:02:20.709> so

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
vertical sticky piston pointing down so

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.910 
vertical sticky piston pointing down so
once<00:02:22.430> there<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.910> block<00:02:23.300> update<00:02:23.750> when<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.680> for

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
once there is a block update when we for

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.890 
once there is a block update when we for
example<00:02:24.980> how<00:02:25.490> this<00:02:25.730> piece<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.150> grass

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
example how this piece of grass

piston will be pushed down the current
will<00:02:42.349> travel<00:02:42.920> through<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.250> block<00:02:43.640> from<00:02:43.970> this

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
will travel through the block from this

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.699 
will travel through the block from this
redstone<00:02:44.930> torch<00:02:45.879> into<00:02:46.879> here<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.599> then<00:02:48.590> it

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
redstone torch into here and then it

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.860 
redstone torch into here and then it
will<00:02:48.799> travel<00:02:49.129> down<00:02:49.280> be<00:02:50.269> right<00:02:50.480> be<00:02:50.569> like<00:02:50.599> well

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
will travel down be right be like well

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.740 
will travel down be right be like well
so<00:02:51.019> how<00:02:51.200> come<00:02:51.470> how<00:02:52.069> can<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.250> reset<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:53.000> God<00:02:53.359> how

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
so how come how can you reset it God how

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.679 
so how come how can you reset it God how
do<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.959> reset<00:02:54.409> it<00:02:54.470> well<00:02:55.280> once<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.269> block<00:02:56.659> is

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
do you reset it well once this block is

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.759 
do you reset it well once this block is
pushed<00:02:57.109> down<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:59.299> current<00:02:59.959> obviously<00:03:00.620> will

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
pushed down the current obviously will

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.220 
pushed down the current obviously will
travel<00:03:01.129> through<00:03:01.310> here<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.700> down<00:03:01.909> here<00:03:02.109> but<00:03:03.109> it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
travel through here and down here but it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.160 
travel through here and down here but it
also<00:03:03.440> travels<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.280> into<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.359> repeater<00:03:05.810> which

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
also travels it into this repeater which

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.379 
also travels it into this repeater which
will<00:03:07.069> then<00:03:07.220> power<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.730> block<00:03:07.970> which<00:03:08.209> will

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
will then power this block which will

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.849 
will then power this block which will
power<00:03:08.599> this<00:03:08.810> redstone<00:03:09.170> which<00:03:09.440> will<00:03:09.590> switch

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
power this redstone which will switch

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.429 
power this redstone which will switch
off<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.190> torch<00:03:10.549> which<00:03:11.329> will<00:03:11.569> also<00:03:12.139> power

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
off this torch which will also power

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.099 
off this torch which will also power
this<00:03:12.799> redstone<00:03:13.370> repeater<00:03:13.849> which<00:03:14.180> will<00:03:14.930> then

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
this redstone repeater which will then

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.679 
this redstone repeater which will then
push<00:03:15.470> this<00:03:15.739> piston<00:03:16.220> out<00:03:16.370> for<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:16.639> tick<00:03:16.909> and<00:03:17.150> then

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
push this piston out for a tick and then

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.569 
push this piston out for a tick and then
back<00:03:17.989> again<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.500> then<00:03:18.920> this<00:03:19.040> block<00:03:19.280> will<00:03:19.310> not

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
back again and then this block will not

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.960 
back again and then this block will not
go<00:03:19.700> down<00:03:19.909> if<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.900> call<00:03:21.230> any<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.970> so

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
go down if you call any of that so

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.490 
go down if you call any of that so
basically<00:03:23.540> what<00:03:24.049> we're<00:03:24.170> doing<00:03:24.349> we're

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
basically what we're doing we're

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.470 
basically what we're doing we're
tricking<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.370> vertical<00:03:25.819> sticky<00:03:26.120> piston

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
tricking this vertical sticky piston

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.849 
tricking this vertical sticky piston
into<00:03:26.659> thinking<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.260> there's<00:03:27.530> something

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
into thinking that there's something

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.099 
into thinking that there's something
here<00:03:28.099> and<00:03:28.310> because<00:03:29.090> there's<00:03:29.209> something<00:03:29.659> here

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
here and because there's something here

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.159 
here and because there's something here
I<00:03:30.519> this<00:03:31.519> piston<00:03:32.150> being<00:03:32.329> extended<00:03:32.720> but<00:03:33.019> it's

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
I this piston being extended but it's

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.610 
I this piston being extended but it's
not<00:03:33.379> actually<00:03:33.859> extended<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:36.319> piston

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
not actually extended this the piston

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.159 
not actually extended this the piston
won't<00:03:36.859> push<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.370> block<00:03:37.579> down<00:03:37.959> until<00:03:38.959> there's

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
won't push the block down until there's

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.629 
won't push the block down until there's
an<00:03:39.290> update<00:03:39.470> until<00:03:39.949> it<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.220> game<00:03:40.370> actually

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
an update until it the game actually

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.050 
an update until it the game actually
realizes<00:03:41.419> oh<00:03:41.540> wait<00:03:41.900> there's<00:03:42.290> nothing<00:03:42.470> below

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
realizes oh wait there's nothing below

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.789 
realizes oh wait there's nothing below
so<00:03:44.060> by<00:03:44.239> doing<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.629> it's<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.989> very<00:03:45.379> very<00:03:45.470> short

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
so by doing that it's a very very short

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.059 
so by doing that it's a very very short
tick<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:47.329> once<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:48.199> have<00:03:48.409> got<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.799> power

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
tick so once you have got the power

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.220 
tick so once you have got the power
traveling<00:03:49.549> here<00:03:49.909> the<00:03:50.540> blocks<00:03:50.780> been<00:03:50.989> pushed

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
traveling here the blocks been pushed

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.250 
traveling here the blocks been pushed
down<00:03:51.319> power<00:03:52.190> travels<00:03:52.639> here<00:03:52.879> it<00:03:53.690> will<00:03:53.930> switch

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
down power travels here it will switch

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.619 
down power travels here it will switch
this<00:03:54.590> power<00:03:55.459> this<00:03:55.639> block<00:03:55.970> which<00:03:56.269> will<00:03:56.419> power

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
this power this block which will power

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.360 
this power this block which will power
this<00:03:56.780> redstone<00:03:57.109> which<00:03:57.530> will<00:03:57.769> switch<00:03:57.979> this

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
this redstone which will switch this

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.890 
this redstone which will switch this
torch<00:03:58.669> off<00:03:59.349> so<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:00.620> piston<00:04:01.129> won't<00:04:01.340> go<00:04:01.699> down

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
torch off so the piston won't go down

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.509 
torch off so the piston won't go down
but<00:04:02.900> then<00:04:03.169> it<00:04:03.349> will<00:04:03.440> travel<00:04:03.829> into<00:04:04.069> this<00:04:04.190> block

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
but then it will travel into this block

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.479 
but then it will travel into this block
and<00:04:04.790> then<00:04:05.000> into<00:04:05.269> this<00:04:05.389> repeater<00:04:06.250> so<00:04:07.250> this

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
and then into this repeater so this

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.819 
and then into this repeater so this
piston<00:04:08.060> will<00:04:08.299> go<00:04:08.419> which<00:04:08.629> by<00:04:09.139> that<00:04:09.169> really

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
piston will go which by that really

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.819 
piston will go which by that really
quickly<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:11.209> then<00:04:11.269> this<00:04:11.750> this<00:04:12.199> piston<00:04:12.650> is

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
quickly and then this this piston is

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.319 
quickly and then this this piston is
actually<00:04:13.190> being<00:04:13.310> powered<00:04:13.639> right<00:04:13.909> now<00:04:14.060> right

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
actually being powered right now right

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.180 
actually being powered right now right
there's<00:04:14.659> there<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.079> torch<00:04:15.440> here<00:04:15.769> powering

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
there's there is a torch here powering

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.879 
there's there is a torch here powering
the<00:04:16.370> block<00:04:16.549> adjacent<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.299> piston<00:04:17.889> but

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
the block adjacent to the piston but

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.830 
the block adjacent to the piston but
because<00:04:19.729> we've<00:04:19.909> confused<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.479> game<00:04:20.659> it

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
because we've confused the game it

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.719 
because we've confused the game it
doesn't<00:04:20.930> realize<00:04:21.289> this<00:04:21.470> one<00:04:21.590> until<00:04:24.400> we<00:04:25.400> power

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
doesn't realize this one until we power

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.690 
doesn't realize this one until we power
it<00:04:25.849> so<00:04:26.479> let<00:04:26.659> me<00:04:26.690> just<00:04:26.870> do<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.169> again

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
it so let me just do that again

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.440 
it so let me just do that again
if<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.720> caught<00:04:30.050> any<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:32.330> will

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
if you caught any of that you will

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.640 
if you caught any of that you will
realize<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.530> uh<00:04:34.480> what's<00:04:35.480> going<00:04:35.600> on<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.380> if<00:04:36.560> I

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
realize that uh what's going on so if I

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.160 
realize that uh what's going on so if I
just<00:04:36.830> put<00:04:36.980> that<00:04:37.010> back<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:40.450> can<00:04:41.450> even<00:04:41.600> just<00:04:41.960> do

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
just put that back I can even just do

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.130 
just put that back I can even just do
this<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.770> be<00:04:42.890> honest<00:04:43.070> we<00:04:43.240> let<00:04:44.240> me<00:04:44.330> just<00:04:44.480> put<00:04:44.660> f1

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
this to be honest we let me just put f1

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.300 
this to be honest we let me just put f1
so<00:04:45.350> you<00:04:45.440> can<00:04:45.590> see<00:04:45.920> it<00:04:47.530> so<00:04:48.530> if<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.710> caught<00:04:49.010> any

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
so you can see it so if you caught any

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.510 
so you can see it so if you caught any
of<00:04:49.640> that<00:04:49.930> its<00:04:50.930> pitch<00:04:51.140> pistons<00:04:51.860> pushing<00:04:52.280> this

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
of that its pitch pistons pushing this

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.330 
of that its pitch pistons pushing this
block<00:04:52.790> down<00:04:53.440> power<00:04:54.440> quickly<00:04:54.830> goes<00:04:55.010> through

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
block down power quickly goes through

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.060 
block down power quickly goes through
done<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.330> power<00:04:56.540> goes<00:04:56.750> around<00:04:57.070> Ching

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
done that power goes around Ching

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.570 
done that power goes around Ching
quickly<00:04:58.670> after<00:04:59.150> this<00:04:59.270> has<00:04:59.420> gone<00:04:59.570> back<00:04:59.780> up<00:04:59.960> and

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
quickly after this has gone back up and

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.810 
quickly after this has gone back up and
then<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:02.210> circuits<00:05:02.570> reset<00:05:03.520> so<00:05:04.520> then<00:05:04.640> what's

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
then the circuits reset so then what's

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.460 
then the circuits reset so then what's
going<00:05:05.030> on<00:05:05.120> here<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.540> huge<00:05:05.810> scream<00:05:06.170> lead<00:05:06.290> your

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
going on here I huge scream lead your

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.890 
going on here I huge scream lead your
computer<00:05:06.830> screens<00:05:07.330> how<00:05:08.330> do<00:05:08.390> you<00:05:08.600> make<00:05:08.750> this

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
computer screens how do you make this

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.600 
computer screens how do you make this
door<00:05:09.170> open<00:05:09.530> well<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.130> current<00:05:10.430> travels

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
door open well the current travels

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.940 
door open well the current travels
through<00:05:10.940> here<00:05:11.090> into<00:05:11.360> this<00:05:11.630> repeater<00:05:12.020> probably

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
through here into this repeater probably

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.790 
through here into this repeater probably
hpl<00:05:13.340> maximum<00:05:13.700> in<00:05:13.790> LA<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.210> then<00:05:15.170> we<00:05:15.380> use<00:05:15.560> my

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
hpl maximum in LA and then we use my

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.710 
hpl maximum in LA and then we use my
favorite<00:05:16.400> thing<00:05:16.820> in<00:05:16.970> red<00:05:17.150> stone<00:05:17.360> of<00:05:17.390> all<00:05:17.510> time

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
favorite thing in red stone of all time

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.490 
favorite thing in red stone of all time
and<00:05:17.900> inverter<00:05:18.460> so<00:05:19.460> currently<00:05:20.080> we've<00:05:21.080> got<00:05:21.110> two

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
and inverter so currently we've got two

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.980 
and inverter so currently we've got two
inverters<00:05:21.800> going<00:05:22.190> on<00:05:22.280> here<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.630> redstone

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
inverters going on here so the redstone

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.710 
inverters going on here so the redstone
signal<00:05:24.230> travel<00:05:25.120> over<00:05:26.120> here<00:05:26.300> into<00:05:26.660> this

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
signal travel over here into this

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.810 
signal travel over here into this
repeater<00:05:27.140> and<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.980> will<00:05:28.070> power<00:05:28.310> this<00:05:28.520> block

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
repeater and it will power this block

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.850 
repeater and it will power this block
and<00:05:29.150> because<00:05:29.870> that<00:05:30.020> block<00:05:30.200> is<00:05:30.320> now<00:05:30.440> powered

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
and because that block is now powered

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.520 
and because that block is now powered
this<00:05:31.100> torch<00:05:31.400> will<00:05:31.580> switch<00:05:31.880> off<00:05:32.120> so<00:05:32.420> then<00:05:33.350> this

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
this torch will switch off so then this

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.270 
this torch will switch off so then this
current<00:05:33.950> here<00:05:34.310> will<00:05:35.060> switch<00:05:35.330> off<00:05:36.070> so<00:05:37.070> then

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
current here will switch off so then

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.340 
current here will switch off so then
this<00:05:37.430> block<00:05:37.790> is<00:05:37.820> no<00:05:38.180> longer<00:05:38.450> powered<00:05:38.810> so<00:05:39.230> the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
this block is no longer powered so the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.440 
this block is no longer powered so the
torch<00:05:39.680> will<00:05:39.980> then<00:05:40.130> switch<00:05:40.460> on<00:05:40.670> and<00:05:40.910> this<00:05:41.060> torch

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
torch will then switch on and this torch

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.330 
torch will then switch on and this torch
is<00:05:41.660> underneath<00:05:42.290> the<00:05:42.350> block<00:05:42.740> which<00:05:43.010> has<00:05:43.190> the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
is underneath the block which has the

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.500 
is underneath the block which has the
door<00:05:44.920> so<00:05:45.920> this<00:05:46.160> this<00:05:46.490> door<00:05:46.790> here<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.240> block

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
door so this this door here the block

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.780 
door so this this door here the block
beneath<00:05:47.750> it<00:05:48.170> has<00:05:48.470> this<00:05:48.680> tour<00:05:48.980> so<00:05:49.250> once<00:05:49.430> this

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
beneath it has this tour so once this

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.540 
beneath it has this tour so once this
torch<00:05:50.180> is<00:05:50.390> switched<00:05:50.660> on<00:05:51.100> then<00:05:52.100> the<00:05:52.340> door<00:05:52.520> will

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
torch is switched on then the door will

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.070 
torch is switched on then the door will
open<00:05:52.700> but<00:05:53.240> because<00:05:53.390> it's<00:05:53.540> only<00:05:53.750> for<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.050> short

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
open but because it's only for a short

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.040 
open but because it's only for a short
amount<00:05:54.560> of<00:05:54.860> time<00:05:55.360> the<00:05:56.360> door<00:05:56.540> then<00:05:56.780> quickly

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
amount of time the door then quickly

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.070 
amount of time the door then quickly
closed<00:05:57.410> so<00:05:58.400> actually<00:05:58.880> it's<00:05:59.150> quite<00:05:59.420> I<00:05:59.870> think

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
closed so actually it's quite I think

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.450 
closed so actually it's quite I think
it's<00:06:00.200> quite<00:06:00.290> cool<00:06:00.590> system<00:06:01.010> because<00:06:01.310> it's

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
it's quite cool system because it's

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.950 
it's quite cool system because it's
quite<00:06:01.670> brief<00:06:01.970> and<00:06:02.240> I'm<00:06:02.930> sure<00:06:03.170> if<00:06:03.350> you<00:06:03.470> did<00:06:04.960> yet

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
quite brief and I'm sure if you did yet

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.450 
quite brief and I'm sure if you did yet
you<00:06:06.200> could<00:06:06.350> even<00:06:06.470> add<00:06:06.740> a<00:06:06.770> delay<00:06:07.010> you<00:06:07.280> might

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
you could even add a delay you might

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.850 
you could even add a delay you might
even<00:06:07.490> be<00:06:07.790> able<00:06:07.910> to<00:06:08.150> add<00:06:08.990> more<00:06:09.290> of<00:06:09.470> a<00:06:09.530> delay<00:06:09.800> to

even be able to add more of a delay to

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.610 
even be able to add more of a delay to
allow<00:06:10.340> you<00:06:10.400> to<00:06:10.580> actually<00:06:11.000> go<00:06:11.300> in<00:06:11.480> more<00:06:12.350> but<00:06:12.530> i'm

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
hope you can follow along is very

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.380 
hope you can follow along is very
complicated<00:06:51.960> and<00:06:52.290> if<00:06:53.100> you<00:06:53.400> guys<00:06:53.640> do<00:06:54.000> find<00:06:54.270> this

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.390 
complicated and if you guys do find this

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.360 
complicated and if you guys do find this
very<00:06:54.720> complicated<00:06:55.170> then<00:06:55.560> all<00:06:55.770> i<00:06:55.800> can<00:06:56.100> say<00:06:56.340> is

very complicated then all i can say is

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.570 
very complicated then all i can say is
follow<00:06:56.970> the<00:06:57.270> design<00:06:57.630> and<00:06:58.190> then<00:06:59.190> just<00:06:59.430> let

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
follow the design and then just let

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.310 
follow the design and then just let

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
minecraft do the understanding if you do

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.530 
minecraft do the understanding if you do
want<00:07:01.500> to<00:07:01.530> understand<00:07:02.070> however<00:07:02.340> is<00:07:02.730> quite<00:07:03.210> it's

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
want to understand however is quite it's

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.330 
want to understand however is quite it's
quite<00:07:03.630> simple<00:07:04.050> if<00:07:04.320> you<00:07:04.470> do<00:07:04.650> know<00:07:04.800> the<00:07:04.950> basics

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
quite simple if you do know the basics

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.600 
quite simple if you do know the basics
of<00:07:05.460> redstone<00:07:06.230> so<00:07:07.230> all<00:07:07.740> we're<00:07:08.070> doing<00:07:08.340> is<00:07:08.430> we're

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
of redstone so all we're doing is we're

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.010 
of redstone so all we're doing is we're
tricking<00:07:09.030> the<00:07:09.150> game<00:07:09.360> we're<00:07:09.540> tricking<00:07:09.870> this

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
tricking the game we're tricking this

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.330 
tricking the game we're tricking this
vertical<00:07:10.440> piston<00:07:10.800> into<00:07:10.950> thinking<00:07:11.310> that

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
vertical piston into thinking that

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.560 
vertical piston into thinking that
there's<00:07:11.580> something<00:07:11.880> here<00:07:12.120> when<00:07:12.420> there

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
there's something here when there

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.900 
there's something here when there
actually<00:07:12.930> isn't<00:07:13.310> so<00:07:14.310> i'll<00:07:14.400> just<00:07:14.460> give<00:07:14.730> you<00:07:14.760> a

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910 
actually isn't so i'll just give you a

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.150 
actually isn't so i'll just give you a
bit<00:07:15.150> of<00:07:15.180> a<00:07:15.360> spin<00:07:16.260> around<00:07:16.380> you<00:07:16.620> can<00:07:16.770> pause<00:07:17.010> your

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
bit of a spin around you can pause your

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.400 
bit of a spin around you can pause your
video<00:07:17.310> any<00:07:17.670> time<00:07:17.970> just<00:07:18.180> to<00:07:18.360> check<00:07:18.410> the

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.410 
video any time just to check the

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.940 
video any time just to check the
redstone<00:07:19.860> whilst<00:07:20.280> you<00:07:20.430> build<00:07:20.670> it<00:07:21.000> and<00:07:21.740> this<00:07:22.740> is

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 
redstone whilst you build it and this is

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.320 
redstone whilst you build it and this is
what's<00:07:23.160> good<00:07:23.340> about<00:07:23.430> this<00:07:23.580> is<00:07:23.940> that<00:07:24.000> it's

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
what's good about this is that it's

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.970 
what's good about this is that it's
