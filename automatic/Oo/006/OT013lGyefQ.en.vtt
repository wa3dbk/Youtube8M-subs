00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
which is a DVR which basically keeps a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
which is a DVR which basically keeps a
backup<00:00:44.210> in<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.510> memory<00:00:45.930> card<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.850> an

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
backup in a memory card so that is an

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.439 
backup in a memory card so that is an
awesome<00:00:48.840> feature<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.620> itself<00:00:50.449> apart

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
awesome feature you know of itself apart

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.090 
awesome feature you know of itself apart
from<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.930> delivering<00:00:52.379> awesome<00:00:52.829> picture

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
from it just delivering awesome picture

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.139 
from it just delivering awesome picture
quality<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.559> how<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.590> works<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
quality so how that works is that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.650 
quality so how that works is that
basically<00:00:58.609> if<00:00:59.609> someone<00:01:00.000> cuts<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.480> power<00:01:01.520> this

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
basically if someone cuts the power this

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.580 
basically if someone cuts the power this
goes<00:01:03.660> inside<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:06.049> destroys<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.350> main

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
goes inside and destroys the main

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130 
goes inside and destroys the main
recording<00:01:08.479> section<00:01:09.479> where<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:09.869> recording

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
recording section where you're recording

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.600 
recording section where you're recording
your<00:01:10.409> data<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:11.369> your<00:01:11.400> own<00:01:12.000> server<00:01:13.400> what<00:01:14.400> this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
your data on your own server what this

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.999 
your data on your own server what this
does<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.630> still<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> backup<00:01:16.350> within

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
does is it's still got a backup within

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.399 
does is it's still got a backup within
the<00:01:17.159> camera<00:01:17.520> itself<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.390> there's<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.140> little

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the camera itself so there's a little

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.090 
the camera itself so there's a little
slot<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.890> think

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
slot in here it's just up and I think

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.230 
slot in here it's just up and I think
it's<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> bub<00:01:24.060> there<00:01:26.240> somewhere

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
it's on just on the bub there somewhere

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.200 
it's on just on the bub there somewhere
around<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:29.299> basically

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
around here that you can basically

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.090 
around here that you can basically
insert<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.390> memory<00:01:33.600> card<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:34.860> too<00:01:34.979> many

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
insert a memory card so not too many

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.340 
insert a memory card so not too many
burglars<00:01:35.700> would<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.570> outside<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
burglars would think to go outside and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.940 
burglars would think to go outside and
then<00:01:37.909> look<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.119> memory<00:01:39.540> card<00:01:39.840> where<00:01:40.740> I'm

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
then look for a memory card where I'm

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.980 
then look for a memory card where I'm
containing<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.610> footage<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> thought<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
containing the footage so I thought that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.609 
containing the footage so I thought that
was<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> fantastic<00:01:43.850> function<00:01:45.020> or<00:01:46.020> feature<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
excellent and in one of the functions it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.950 
excellent and in one of the functions it
needs<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.159> requires<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.700> 10<00:02:06.540> by<00:02:06.750> 100

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
needs to have is it requires a 10 by 100

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.219 
needs to have is it requires a 10 by 100
Ethernet<00:02:07.710> cap<00:02:08.580> 5<00:02:08.789> wiring<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.899> wireless

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
