00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone with you ester and today wanted 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.600
 would tell you about 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.480
 seems to me a common problem 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.710
 gamers at least i'm very into it 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 now caught myself 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.199
 in general, I had a monitor here 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.720
 an old monitor with such a connector 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.010
 so pretty narrow and bundled when 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.590
 I bought a new computer from me 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.710
 adapter I think like most of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.779
 you when buying a computer you more important 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.090
 it's more important for me to connect it 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.009
 and potestit and it does not matter what it is 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.469
 you connectors go to they went to 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.010
 ass can make well so did yam 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.680
 and half a year I now sat with vidyuhi for 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.539
 17 to the kings I sat with vidyuhi for 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.629
 two thousand and in general I tell you why 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.640
 and how to fix it in general when you 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.160
 connect directly here through this 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.960
 wiring to the motherboard, that is, only to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.469
 it can be connected as I understood through 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.899
 this connector you are hinting like hell 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.820
 torment because here you connect usb 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.610
 adapters connects immediately to 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.740
 video card, I would now walk all 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.979
 turned out and tell you to compare 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.650
 what was left for me and the wolf was with me 20 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.159
 fps at minimum settings when 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.689
 training with minimal resolution 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.820
 screen 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.380
 I honestly tell you a little bit 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.900
 burnt well as a bit 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.939
 burned and I was looking for half a day in what 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.439
 problem my friend left solutions but 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.960
 it turned out that this is not the same 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.820
 and then I thought why not 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.549
 potest this garbage because 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.619
 read on the forum which is quite important well 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.710
 In general, those telling the result was 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.460
 I have 400 fps when loading Volga that is 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.960
 main menu 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.600
 and now has become 2200 that is increased 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.750
 time in five just performance 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.659
 my computer and all why because this 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.020
 Adapter on yes guys they like me 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.659
 half a year to sit and stream dota at 60fps 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 when he had you see it on thirty in 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.469
 general now i hope i will have 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.329
 More streams will naturally shoot 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.789
 and the wolf because I have now 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.930
 normal computer as it was normal 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.510
 always but i'm up to a bit no 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.190
 in this moment, okay, thanks for all 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.380
 viewing will show you now how it is 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.260
 connects then see if we 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.670
 this is now going to connect the shit 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.190
 connects a but at least in my 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.220
 comp my top case 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.710
 but as you can see from the bottom there are two connectors 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.950
 but no fatty and so for them we 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.360
 use an adapter for tea and by the way 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.520
 I'll tell you, snapping has become much 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.850
 better than me video grief themselves did not see that 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.370
 I need a monitor from but not much 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.450
 we twist that is simply attach 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.440
 pedal twist 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.250
 from there so now we make one 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.250
 two connectors 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.190
 Now we look at the monitor of Walla all 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.350
 earned and now showing you fps in 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.220
 wolf guys no joke i mean quality 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.470
 got really better god between feeling 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.900
 I see points on the monitor, okay, all 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:17.019
 tuned so look see 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:23.019
 now and see up to 2200 fps like 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.810
 I ordered those 2700 as you guys 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.940
 was 400 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.310
