00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
reload perk so they can be different but

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.210 
reload perk so they can be different but
we're<00:02:41.690> specifically<00:02:42.349> going<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.860> talk<00:02:43.040> about

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
we're specifically going to talk about

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.890 
we're specifically going to talk about
the<00:02:43.370> quartermaster<00:02:44.120> ones<00:02:44.300> here's<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.690> grim

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the quartermaster ones here's the grim

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.150 
the quartermaster ones here's the grim
citizen<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.500> when<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.680> put<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:45.920> side-by-side

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
citizen and when you put it side-by-side

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.300 
citizen and when you put it side-by-side
with<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.700> Galahad<00:02:47.150> look<00:02:47.390> at<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:48.310> striking

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
with a Galahad look at that striking

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.830 
with a Galahad look at that striking
resemblance<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.030> does<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.299> a<00:02:50.330> lower<00:02:50.540> clip

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
resemblance it does have a lower clip

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.930 
resemblance it does have a lower clip
now<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.709> one<00:02:51.860> does<00:02:52.010> have<00:02:52.160> persistence<00:02:52.790> as

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
now this one does have persistence as

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.460 
now this one does have persistence as
well<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.480> more<00:02:53.660> accurate<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.110> longer<00:02:54.350> it's

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
well it's more accurate the longer it's

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.509 
well it's more accurate the longer it's
fired<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:55.010> does<00:02:55.130> have<00:02:55.310> flared<00:02:55.730> magwell<00:02:55.940> and

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
fired it does have flared magwell and

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.370 
fired it does have flared magwell and
that<00:02:58.519> is<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.910> quicker<00:02:59.420> reload<00:02:59.810> speed<00:03:00.019> I<00:03:00.080> can<00:03:00.260> see

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
that is a quicker reload speed I can see

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.380 
that is a quicker reload speed I can see
it<00:03:00.470> really<00:03:00.950> Max's<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.580> out<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.940> then<00:03:02.209> light

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
it really Max's it out and then light

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.140 
it really Max's it out and then light
weight<00:03:02.569> plus<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.110> agility<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.700> last<00:03:04.940> one

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
weight plus to agility and last one

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.800 
weight plus to agility and last one
makes<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.780> switch<00:03:06.290> weapons<00:03:06.500> faster<00:03:07.160> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
makes you switch weapons faster and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.150 
makes you switch weapons faster and
that's<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.870> single<00:03:09.110> point<00:03:09.440> sling<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:09.980> its

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.809 
laser but why this gun is shunned away
our<00:03:29.870> shine<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.590> look<00:03:30.829> down<00:03:31.010> upon<00:03:31.069> is<00:03:31.549> because

our shine and look down upon is because

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.330 
our shine and look down upon is because
of<00:03:31.850> its<00:03:32.030> low<00:03:32.209> low<00:03:32.450> clip<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.870> 23<00:03:33.190> that's<00:03:34.190> why<00:03:34.310> I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
of its low low clip of 23 that's why I

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.309 
of its low low clip of 23 that's why I
call<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:35.060> true<00:03:35.299> niche<00:03:35.510> weapon<00:03:35.900> because<00:03:36.140> its

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
call it a true niche weapon because its

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.229 
call it a true niche weapon because its
last<00:03:36.650> perk<00:03:36.980> for<00:03:37.190> its<00:03:37.340> called<00:03:37.549> feeding<00:03:37.910> frenzy

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
last perk for its called feeding frenzy

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.180 
last perk for its called feeding frenzy
and<00:03:38.390> we<00:03:38.900> start<00:03:39.140> getting<00:03:39.200> kills<00:03:39.560> with<00:03:39.739> this<00:03:39.950> gun

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
and we start getting kills with this gun

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.309 
and we start getting kills with this gun
you<00:03:40.519> get<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.670> faster<00:03:41.150> reload<00:03:41.480> for<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.870> short<00:03:42.139> time

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
you get a faster reload for a short time

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.620 
you get a faster reload for a short time
so<00:03:43.280> if<00:03:43.579> you're<00:03:43.730> really<00:03:43.850> accurate<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:44.480> can

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
so if you're really accurate and can

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.660 
so if you're really accurate and can
kill<00:03:44.870> people<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.380> mean<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:46.010> reload<00:03:46.280> can<00:03:46.459> save

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
kill people I mean the reload can save

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.240 
kill people I mean the reload can save
you<00:03:46.819> it<00:03:47.060> also<00:03:47.720> has<00:03:47.989> perfect<00:03:48.470> balance<00:03:48.620> it

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
you it also has perfect balance it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.500 
you it also has perfect balance it
that's<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.790> one<00:03:49.880> with<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.060> stability<00:03:50.450> has

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
that's the one with the stability has

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.420 
that's the one with the stability has
extremely<00:03:50.989> low<00:03:51.230> recoil<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.799> can<00:03:51.950> also<00:03:52.069> have<00:03:52.250> hit

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
extremely low recoil I can also have hit

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.819 
extremely low recoil I can also have hit
a<00:03:52.720> hammer<00:03:53.720> forged<00:03:54.109> that's<00:03:54.530> where<00:03:54.739> it

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
a hammer forged that's where it

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.319 
a hammer forged that's where it
increases<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.459> range<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.790> accuracy<00:03:56.060> and

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
increases that range and accuracy and

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.759 
increases that range and accuracy and
then<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.569> single<00:03:56.870> point<00:03:57.019> sling<00:03:57.230> which<00:03:57.530> makes

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
then the single point sling which makes
