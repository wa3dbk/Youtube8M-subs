Hitachi<00:00:51.770> turrible

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
Hitachi turrible

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.880 
Hitachi turrible
however<00:00:54.079> they<00:00:55.079> ended<00:00:55.289> up<00:00:55.379> shipping<00:00:55.680> me

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
however they ended up shipping me

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160 
however they ended up shipping me
something<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.059> little<00:00:57.719> different

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
something that's just a little different

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
something that's just a little different
and<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.949> don't<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.340> at<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.579> point<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.969> it

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
and I don't know at this point that it

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.189 
and I don't know at this point that it
is<00:01:00.239> original<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:02.280> moulding<00:01:03.199> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
is original because the moulding is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.039 
is original because the moulding is
completely<00:01:04.860> different<00:01:05.040> than<00:01:05.540> per<00:01:06.540> se<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
completely different than per se this

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.179 
completely different than per se this
one<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.560> totally<00:01:07.830> thrashed<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:10.100> here<00:01:11.100> we

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
one that's totally thrashed so here we

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:11.510 
one that's totally thrashed so here we
go

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
go

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
go
this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.880> what<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.720> makes<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
this is what we have that makes this

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.429 
this is what we have that makes this
different<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.259> all

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
different from this and so this is all

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.520 
different from this and so this is all
this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.040> my<00:01:17.189> old<00:01:17.369> turbo<00:01:17.960> number<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
this is my old turbo number one if you

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.100 
this is my old turbo number one if you
look<00:01:19.770> at<00:01:20.040> these<00:01:20.400> numbers<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.110> they're

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
look at these numbers here they're

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
look at these numbers here they're
parallel<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> flange<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
parallel to the flange here on the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.070 
parallel to the flange here on the
original<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.590> numbers<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.689> parallel<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
original the numbers are parallel to the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.890 
original the numbers are parallel to the
flow<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> air<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.720> on

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
flow of air so as you can see that's on

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.200 
flow of air so as you can see that's on
the<00:01:31.020> side<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:32.250> addition<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the side in addition to that the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
the side in addition to that the
markings<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.110> side<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> flange<00:01:34.829> on

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
markings on this side of the flange on

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.530 
markings on this side of the flange on
your<00:01:36.090> exhausts<00:01:36.600> I'd<00:01:36.750> say<00:01:37.740> HT<00:01:38.430> 15<00:01:39.000> B<00:01:39.240> that's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
your exhausts I'd say HT 15 B that's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.990 
your exhausts I'd say HT 15 B that's
what<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:43.670> doesn't<00:01:44.670> have

are all beveled also the number two post
the<00:02:29.900> bulk<00:02:30.350> post<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.940> original<00:02:32.450> has<00:02:32.750> a

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
the bulk post on the original has a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.370 
the bulk post on the original has a
different<00:02:34.210> design<00:02:35.210> to<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.520> this<00:02:37.520> one<00:02:38.380> number

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
different design to it this one number

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.520 
different design to it this one number
one<00:02:39.680> number<00:02:39.890> two<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:41.209> pretty<00:02:41.780> much<00:02:41.930> like<00:02:42.260> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
one number two is pretty much like the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.550 
one number two is pretty much like the
rest<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.940> that's<00:02:44.270> very<00:02:44.480> inconsistent<00:02:45.110> and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
rest so that's very inconsistent and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.910 
rest so that's very inconsistent and
then<00:02:45.680> also<00:02:45.890> look<00:02:46.880> at<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.120> difference<00:02:47.540> between

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
then also look at the difference between

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.699 
then also look at the difference between
the<00:02:48.920> inlet<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.570> first<00:02:50.570> bolt<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.200> mean<00:02:51.500> I

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
the inlet and the first bolt I mean I

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.840 
the inlet and the first bolt I mean I
can<00:02:51.890> put<00:02:52.270> almost<00:02:53.270> three<00:02:53.750> fingers<00:02:54.110> in<00:02:54.290> here

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
can put almost three fingers in here

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.400 
can put almost three fingers in here
over<00:02:55.850> here<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:58.600> can<00:02:59.600> put<00:02:59.750> four<00:02:59.989> fingers<00:03:00.380> in

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
over here I can put four fingers in

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.570 
over here I can put four fingers in
there<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:02.560> something's<00:03:03.560> wrong<00:03:03.739> here<00:03:04.100> this<00:03:04.130> is

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
there so something's wrong here this is

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.270 
there so something's wrong here this is
either<00:03:04.790> fake<00:03:05.239> or<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.480> knockoff<00:03:05.900> just<00:03:06.770> maybe

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
either fake or a knockoff just maybe

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.880 
either fake or a knockoff just maybe
made<00:03:07.519> in<00:03:07.670> China<00:03:07.970> somewhere<00:03:08.769> there's<00:03:09.769> no

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
made in China somewhere there's no

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.390 
made in China somewhere there's no
