00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello very good to all guys and girls 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.600
 and we are here again starting the one 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.580
 boxing week and today it has touched 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.010
 josh and isolate a game that comes out the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.750
 Friday but that I have been able to acquire already and 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 good so tomorrow we have titan fail 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.730
 and on Friday we have the dark souls 2 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.020
 but first let's proceed with this one 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.020
 boxing inside intro 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.320
 ok guys, here we would have the 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.540
 I play yes and apart from that I have not 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.269
 commented before with the reservation they gave us 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.309
 an egg characteristic of the character of 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.379
 play games as you know in almost 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.170
 all nintendo games always give 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.620
 an accessory to store cartridges worth 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.890
 because this had been an egg 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.890
 let's open it and remove the plastic 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.350
 and that's the way the box would be, the truth is that the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.150
 design is pretty beautiful I like it a lot 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.110
 especially the fact that it's like 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.290
 hand painted 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.150
 and it would be from behind as you see very 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.780
 colorful nintendo boxes always 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.400
 let's open it 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.020
 Okay, so here we had the cartridge 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.750
 that he designed the truth is that he is 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.180
 pretty cool have the here as the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.810
 marks of fire and other whites and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.330
 here neurosis iceland is worth and good and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.320
 then we have here so much the points 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.270
 of nintendo to exchange as the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.940
 instructions that do not carry anything else 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.740
 take any pamphlet that tells you 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.899
 how to play or anything that just 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.759
 the typical manual where they put the 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.680
 releases that there have been of 3ds 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.479
 throughout the year to joz and isolate and 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.119
 here it puts then or simply as 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.130
 install the game and it does not even put you 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.280
 nothing else it seems that nintendo has 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.710
 added to the fashion is not to include 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.869
 any kind of manual and good here 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.380
 we would have what is the game and now 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.600
 we go with the accessory this is 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.840
 the egg that they gave us with the reserve 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.000
 the truth very beautiful very nice as 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.210
 you see there 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.810
 good as cloth is worth 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.000
 and let's open we'll see how many 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.230
 games that is worth as you see has there the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.620
 logo of them and island and fit then I 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.170
 I would say that about four games can be 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.460
 because here they can fit two and here another 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.580
 top let's take the cartridge of them and 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:42.000
 see the comparison we take and we put it 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.700
 here it's worth if they can fit maybe 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.640
 about four games worth two in a row 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.280
 here or an accessory you can also 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.470
 push it for ssd cards 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.530
 and well guys, this would be the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.540

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.760
