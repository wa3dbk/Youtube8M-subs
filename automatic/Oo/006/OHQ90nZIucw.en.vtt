00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
that SIM card slot right there of course

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.000 
that SIM card slot right there of course
because<00:04:17.549> it's<00:04:17.699> with<00:04:17.849> ATT<00:04:18.560> but<00:04:19.560> there's<00:04:19.709> no<00:04:19.829> sim

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010

and you actually prop it up like so on
the<00:04:32.320> table<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:34.630> allows<00:04:35.080> you<00:04:35.200> to<00:04:35.290> play

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
the table and it allows you to play

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.620 
the table and it allows you to play
sound<00:04:36.100> through<00:04:36.400> here<00:04:36.640> okay<00:04:37.180> so<00:04:37.240> that's<00:04:37.480> quick
