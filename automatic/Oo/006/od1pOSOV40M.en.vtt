 integral living and compact you go 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.790
 worship the 22 revised and corrected version 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.580
 especially as our test model is the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.529
 sport declination 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.939
 the size change is where he 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.859
 will provide a cast iron bulb that 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.500
 keeps a very small draft 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.010
 cm the upper side marries the profile 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.170
 of the hull 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.130
 the lifting system retained a winch 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.929
 trailers 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.059
 easily one notes that in 2001 the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.800
 who goes back to her hand with a 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.800
 crank it's a trick of performance 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.079
 is in a low position and a device 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.820
 blocking that helps maintain it 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.260
 low water in case of capsizing 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.850
 the construction is classic and robust 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.410
 monolithic for the sandwich shell 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.000
 foam and rex polyester for the deck 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.739
 story of gaining some weight in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 the waters the whole is surrounded by a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.940
 state 10 ton rubber today the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.140
 sea ​​is flat we will appreciate when the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.659
 conditions will be more difficult 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.350
 the central position of the outboard 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.659
 the propeller keeps an excellent 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.210
 motricity the sails in minor are from 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.860
 exit the mainsail harbor unicorn the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.909
 marsh elongated train of 50 cm this 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.340
 work with little onions 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.299
 thanks to the patara and the fittings of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.330
 Marc Descoux all art they 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.320
 facilitate fine adjustments or not 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.150
 as for the bridge plan he wins in 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.820
 fluency thanks to baobabs feel 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.140
 very close to the red to the bow a big 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.520
 haya mooring one of the dies for 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.200
 deport the den she can stay in 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.460
 post 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.350
 we can also there are walls and sails 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.729
 light the important evolution of wine 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.650
 of bones and his cockpit who adopt 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.000
 now two levels near the ruf he 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.500
 is therefore less broad that allows to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.700
 stall more easily to the ji and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.290
 enjoy better protection 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.329
 the three trunk at the back are 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.829
 preserved what are 400 the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.460
 evolutions compared to actresses 21 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.890
 Jean Baptiste 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.140
 the evolutions of the promoter 21 is 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.370
 basically the cockpit 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.530
 so we could still try 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:03.549
 a part 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:05.440
 two floors on the back more open 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.230
 for parra 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.319
 so that's what changes as he 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.610
 the native of 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.190
 one floor 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.810
 we are sitting directly on the bridge as soon as 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.880
 the first edge of closely we measure that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.370
 this sport version there under the hood the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.080
 speed by three beautiful forts and 5.5 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.760
 closer and a little more to sign 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.700
 to the elk more arrived the cape is 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.780
 flattering about 45 degrees from the real wind 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.370
 it is rather during the recovery phases 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.870
 when transfers out of 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.600
 edge that the 22 sports are showing 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.890
 particularly nervous and pleasant 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.780
 two rudders well adjusted and very 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.110
 deep offers a sensation of barras 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.640
 nice especially an excellent control at 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.050
 inside we appreciate the comfortable 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.520
 headroom the quality of the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.530
 finish generous natural light 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.880
 at the lighthouse lost blot the chests the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.330
 many teams and and the table of 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.410
 charisma not forgetting these two flappers 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.700
 the bathroom is also 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.040
 present which is quite rare in 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.480
 units less than 7 meters 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.270
 kitchen side does not support me a little 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.730
 sink and stove fixed in the option 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.560
 two layers adoption of good size the 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.959
 maxus 22 years on the comfort of a unit 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.850
 a good meter more without dreaming his 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.520
 silhouette nor his performances this 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.690
 unit presented at the Grand Pavois 2013 a 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.690
 so everything from the five-legged sheep
