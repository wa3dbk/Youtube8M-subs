00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.480
 would you like to make a basket of basketball 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.990
 how easy is this, you only need 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.379
 tulip containers that have lid are 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.900
 flexible and its shape is perfect for 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.310
 do super crafts you're ready 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.310
 well, we started 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:35.170
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:38.830
 and trim the edge of the beige container 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.410
 it would be like this and we have cut it and the 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.810
 we separated by here now this goes by 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.820
 this side this is going to be the ring of 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.770
 our basket and of course because it does not 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.830
 we can put a network what I 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.920
 invented is this fantastic that I have 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.160
 here that is made with cardboard you see 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.710
 has continued to hit the edge with zeal and 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.780
 so when he placed the ball 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.330
 we will look like a basket 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.640
 attentive now you will have to ask him what 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.880
 safer help even more because we're going 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 to use a sharp object as it is 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.390
 what I have here is a stick with 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.750
 I'm going to catch a ball of 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.450
 I'm going to put plasticine here and I'm going to 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.790
 make a hole right here on the edge 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.440
 notice 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.610
 carefully I will squeeze 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.490
 I'm going to make the hole, you see like that 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.820
 I have around here I will repeat the process 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.820
 in the container just look 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.300
 in the middle 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.170
 well you see I have it here 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.610
 A) Yes 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.960
 and finally I'm going to use the lid and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.900
 I'm also going to make a fair hole 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.770
 here 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.729
 A) Yes 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.319
 now I am going to join the parts with that then 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.629
 with this that I have here that is a 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.370
 bookbinder who serves at school 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.050
 they put all the final drawings of 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.120
 course there well presented with this 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.580
 square because it helps us do this 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.160
 attentive 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.680
 The first thing we are going to do is pass it 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.130
 for this piece of cardboard you see 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.400
 very good effect 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:40.959
 now let's move the container 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.959
 up here 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:52.170
 and finally give it a spin like that 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.170
 and finally we are going to place 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.130
 basket like that and we're going 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.510
 you will 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.849
 perfect very well we already have the part of 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.019
 above our basket and now we're going 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:20.170
 to the bottom part the same thing I will pass 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:24.719
 a binder that I have here what 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.719
 I will go through the cardboard 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.440
 we already have the basket ready now what 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.270
 we need the little ball and see what 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.160
 can fall inside and do 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.460
 competitions you place it for example so 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:46.210
 and you say come 1 2 3 and there's almost 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:48.910
 have a 23 and you want 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.910
 as you see it is very easy I used the 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.940
 cover the top of the container a 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.800
 piece of cardboard and the container so that 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.240
 drop the ball inside 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.520
 very easy what are you going to do at home 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.250
 sure that if we see ourselves in the 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.370
