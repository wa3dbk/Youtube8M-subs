00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
sometimes playing games a little bit

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.080 
sometimes playing games a little bit
easier<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.220> play<00:01:23.369> games<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:23.939> like

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
little bit easier now because this is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
little bit easier now because this is
solid<00:01:28.290> steel<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.640> fall<00:01:29.790> off

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
dollars and the one thing i don't like

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.729 
dollars and the one thing i don't like
about<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.359> it<00:03:02.870> doesn't<00:03:03.349> even<00:03:03.439> move

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
about that is that it doesn't even move

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.000 
about that is that it doesn't even move
they<00:03:04.250> do<00:03:04.310> have<00:03:04.639> a<00:03:04.700> stable<00:03:05.480> Proust<00:03:06.109> and<00:03:06.379> that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
they do have a stable Proust and that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.610 
they do have a stable Proust and that
does<00:03:07.280> pivot<00:03:07.760> up<00:03:07.939> and<00:03:08.209> down<00:03:08.359> side<00:03:08.689> to<00:03:08.750> side<00:03:09.049> but

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
does pivot up and down side to side but

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.020 
does pivot up and down side to side but
that<00:03:09.650> costs<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.099> hundred<00:03:10.250> dollars<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:10.909> that's

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
