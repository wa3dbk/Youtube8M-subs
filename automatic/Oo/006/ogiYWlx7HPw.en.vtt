00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.990
 what're talking to you is lucas 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.730
 gabriel when someone 17 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.619
 Dora request of some subscribers'll 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.689
 teaching how to make a homemade steering wheel 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.240
 to play the trick is good first 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.370
 thing you'll need a knife 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.739
 You'll need a straight wood. 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.340
 thin thing you will need a 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.500
 Ice cream pot with the lid you go 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.510
 need any cover for the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.120
 transparent elton zanata steering wheel even 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.489
 because you will need to clear a mouse 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.130
 for you to drive the sixth step you will 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.989
 need some cloths that you can 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.719
 use I got here my mother does not leave 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.180
 use I think but she left then sheets 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.590
 then this is the sixth and final step 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.170
 mercury you will have to do is 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.600
 pick up the knife and put it on fire 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.970
 When I get really hot in 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.070
 children is the I am a child, I am more 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.950
 always ask for help from an adult if you 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.840
 you are 16 years or younger 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.700
 but I always ask for help from an adult doing 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.220
 Alone because I'm an idiot. 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.009
 so let's go and get some pretty seal there. 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.869
 it will put here on the lid more or 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.380
 less what it will do what a 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:30.130
 hole that a kind of ball like that 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.039
 this way so that it will fit hole ok 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.750
 you will put the focus again and in 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.349
 other side you have to do the same 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.599
 distance to fit the wood 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:43.119
 correctly then you see more or less 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:48.399
 Where do you have to do more here or 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:54.610
 least think here and make the hole or 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:57.759
 is that I will burn me life beauty 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.970
 I think that here I think it's already 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.970
 beauty 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.770
 boot the first step is this so let's 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.500
 take the next step 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.090
 the next step you will do and will have 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.800
 that having a mouse I already told you that I live 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.200
 that will make you turn sideways 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.970
 did not play the trick of the plan I already said 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.099
 It 's good for you, too. 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.440
 I give to him more or less like this and 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.900
 will put Iraq under this form 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.319
 what I 'm doing here so the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.500
 mouse when you put it so much 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.310
 tight and faye that does not escape can see 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.060
 there o 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.920
 very fancy very tight then the only 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.720
 The thing that's gonna make you is just this. 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.849
 This is the step you're going to take. 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.250
 do to drive the truck then 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.000
 let's go to the third step is the next 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.680
 step 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.200
 You'll have to put the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.620
 knife in the fire why are you going to make a 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.239
 hole here so that between the mouse and him 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.430
 be more cute then you will 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.110
 pay the bill and it will calculate where you 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.340
 You have to cut and the only thing you 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.349
 Are you going to have to do the photo you're taking? 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.120
 fire but she is of faith but I do not know 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.769
 because the only thing you're going to have 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.209
 to do with hot knife you will have 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.700
 you decide where you will cut the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.890
 agreement to cut yourself here makes a mouse 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.560
 so more or less so it is good that the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.410
 proton that's just it, let 's go the next step 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.060
 after passing everything looks cool if you pull 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.200
 your entire mouse 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.590
 I passed the mouse over here you pull a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.400
 so it will pass and only 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.380
 pot lid and tank look that's cool 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.790
 do not get a very ugly image then 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.489
 It's very cool. 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.140
 so let's go to the next step by step 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.859
 now it's almost the last of the last 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.049
 steps to put the knife on the stove 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:48.489
 again and I want you to do it 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:51.700
 You'll get the knife and you'll make a 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:56.709
 hole here in the middle more or less 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.700
 beauty beauty is making a hole that the 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:07.540
 dog fucker Latin tata 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:09.549
 and cut 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.819
 we were the next step is to put the 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.829
 cover galera now only split erc 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.169
 explained little feirinha 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.209
 but you make some edits in it 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.109
 leave it cute it will work for 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.600
 you 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.270
 O good here can already see that it will turn 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.310
 all right and looks guys I think 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.289
 I do not have the fuss on my pc anymore 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.850
 but I'll show you that the mouse 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.120
 will turn to one side and the other 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.590
 like it's a game, so let's go 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.660
 to the next step 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.060
 The next step is that I forgot to 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.390
 to talk is that you have to leave the evil 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.310
 not like that 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.370
 can not leave the property that way 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.560
 is there but when you turn up here 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.810
 it will turn the board and when you 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.910
 turn over there he'll turn over 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.800
 then you will leave your mouse 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.260
 head down or on the side of the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.600
 steering wheel will leave your mouse 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.400
 thus here the guys are going to leave 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.350
 the upside-down way that when 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.090
 You come here and you're going to come here. 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.660
 when will you give it go it will turn 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.940
 there 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.200
 so now, yes, we'll see people 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.360
 I'm here in the percentage here in my 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.040
 channel while I'm talking there is not 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.360
 forget to click I liked it too, good 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.340
 I'm going to do this with the mouse. 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.230
 even there with the edge of evil because 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.120
 I'm out of the game took a look here in the 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.570
 my weight and brought a game so look 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.860
 here it is here I'll point it too 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.920
 Good, I'll go there and turn the score. 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.170
 can see that it turned is punctuated 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.720
 You can see that it turned and nobody imagined 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:45.260
 right there he is going to focus on him 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:47.210
 Maybe then, that 's it, guys. 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.980
 was the video I am teaching 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.480
 as doing with the casemiro steering wheel for 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.100
 I throw the tank 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.220
 Good folks, do not forget to click. 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.180

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.180
