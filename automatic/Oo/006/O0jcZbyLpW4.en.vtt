00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 it states the velodrome is in marseille 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.440
 tomorrow stage of the important 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.030
 psv match plays olympique 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.950
 but before the selection of huub 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.049
 Stevens started training tonight 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 the coach just wanted to say something about it 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.640
 a discussion that you yesterday on it 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.400
 training field on the herdgang had with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.550
 edison mendez and that wide ranging 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.099
 away on Dutch television 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 I had time for cameras yesterday 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.399
 to appear 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.550
 after there was an incident at the training 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.550
 luckily we have that incident 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.579
 may see again because he owns this 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.280
 We could have a camera three weeks ago 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 in his not seeing this again 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.370
 it was the last week of faith 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.129
 for example, I have those who know 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.280
 that something like that can happen with one 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.190
 exchange of words arises from people 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.579
 including all that with each other every day 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.579
 have to do 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.129
 we have day after training 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.129
 pronounced and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.320
 for me that means the end of the matter 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 simple and so all noses are back 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.240
 in the same direction and that should be 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.970
 because to play European football after the winter 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.060
 it is business and to win in france 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.740
 also do not lose offers perspective 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.630
 although it is also important what the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.180
 results in the last two rounds 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.460
 of this group 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.329
 it had calculated this one 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.950
 competitions hard guess you always 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.960
 always it starts with the remainder and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.979
 twenty take the go against profit 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.500
 but neither the game needs anything 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.750
 what all said could you maybe am a point 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.729
 here how much can we have to do 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.830
 record that and it must all be done 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.080
 happen with a selection that exists 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.670
 from nine to ten players 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.159
 Stevens therefore has options 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.750
 but because the interests are so great and 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.600
 olympique marseille from another 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.490
 caliber is then ado or phil a two will 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.800
 the trainer no doubt here or there 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.530
 some tinkering 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.959
 fact is that the volatility is off 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.840
 the game appears after the two wins 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.610
 on ado and willem 2 and so matt simons 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.480
 and other in the back 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.480
 stability 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.220
 yes the game can always be better that is 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.660
 that is a fact but then you work 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.360
 constant then 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.580
 and had that with ups and downs 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.570
 some competitions stay up to date 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.940
 moments 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.310
 very good and I would do something about it 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.470
 so we also need a little more 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.459
 I'm constantly trying to spell us out 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.340
 to lie 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.510
 and that on a reasonable gas from how he 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.920
 is or a bad one 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.500
 he says bad but finds that weekend 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.209
 real we spend rain things so it 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.160
 is very powerful and actually very 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.049
 speed the top down very softly we 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.690
 bad well that can follow undoubtedly 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.170
 full grandstands and a fanatic following 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.150
 if psv passes this, there is another one 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.150
 step in the right direction
