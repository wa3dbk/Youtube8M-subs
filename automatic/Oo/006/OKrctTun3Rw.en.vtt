00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
well my primary maton all week has been

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.330 
well my primary maton all week has been
the<00:00:14.670> lack<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.599> blue<00:00:15.780> flake<00:00:16.109> palmento<00:00:16.740> bug

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the lack of the blue flake palmento bug

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.580 
the lack of the blue flake palmento bug
this<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:17.940> I've<00:00:18.060> been<00:00:18.210> flipping<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.199> as

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
this is one I've been flipping and as

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
this is one I've been flipping and as
you<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.800> see<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.189> sinker<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.730> heavyweight

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
you can see the sinker is heavyweight

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.140 
you can see the sinker is heavyweight
it's<00:00:21.990> an<00:00:22.109> ounce<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.619> half<00:00:22.650> range<00:00:23.400> tungsten

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
it's an ounce and a half range tungsten

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.630 
it's an ounce and a half range tungsten
I<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> range<00:00:25.619> Thompson<00:00:26.160> because<00:00:26.400> there

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
I like the range Thompson because there

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.870 
I like the range Thompson because there
is<00:00:26.760> actually<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:28.070> sleeve<00:00:29.070> inside<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.789> that

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
is actually a sleeve inside of that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.999 
is actually a sleeve inside of that
which<00:00:30.150> keeps<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.810> from<00:00:30.869> cutting<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.800> your

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
which keeps that from cutting on your

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.030 
which keeps that from cutting on your
line<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.969> put<00:00:33.510> two<00:00:33.690> bobber<00:00:33.960> Stoppers<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.739> there

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
line I put two bobber Stoppers on there

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.250 
line I put two bobber Stoppers on there
because<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.850> weight<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.390> heavy<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:37.079> of

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
because the weight is so heavy one of

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.920 
because the weight is so heavy one of
them<00:00:37.380> really<00:00:37.649> won't<00:00:37.800> hold<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.250> place<00:00:38.930> Snell

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
them really won't hold in place Snell

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.479 
them really won't hold in place Snell
not<00:00:41.059> straight<00:00:42.059> shape<00:00:42.559> fought<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:44.010> our<00:00:44.190> hook

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
not straight shape fought for our hook

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.100 
not straight shape fought for our hook
and<00:00:45.320> just<00:00:46.320> ring<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.930> me

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
and just ring it this like so and to me

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.830 
and just ring it this like so and to me
the<00:00:49.350> biggest<00:00:49.500> deal<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.510> all-metal<00:00:51.510> boat

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the biggest deal on this all-metal boat

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.990 
the biggest deal on this all-metal boat
is<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.890> made<00:00:53.100> out<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> elastic

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
is because it's made out of the elastic

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.610 
is because it's made out of the elastic
material<00:00:54.649> which<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.210> incredibly<00:00:57.500> strong

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
material which is incredibly strong

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.400 
material which is incredibly strong
it's<00:00:59.039> also<00:00:59.370> unbelievably<00:00:59.940> soft<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it's also unbelievably soft like if you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.270 
it's also unbelievably soft like if you
feel<00:01:01.680> awesome

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.570 
feel awesome
these<00:01:02.550> baits<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:04.049> me<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:05.159> best<00:01:05.309> thing

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
these baits are and to me the best thing

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.810 
these baits are and to me the best thing
about<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.180> being<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.930> soft<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
about that being this soft is is the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
about that being this soft is is the
hook<00:01:09.090> penetrates<00:01:09.780> through<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> body<00:01:10.380> this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
