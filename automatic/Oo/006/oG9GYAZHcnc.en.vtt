to<00:00:04.950> install<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.279> new<00:00:05.339> chain<00:00:05.640> you<00:00:05.790> want<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.970> make

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
to install a new chain you want to make

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.839 
to install a new chain you want to make
sure<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.359> using<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.779> correct<00:00:07.020> size<00:00:07.319> so<00:00:08.220> to

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
sure that using the correct size so to

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.430 
sure that using the correct size so to
find<00:00:09.030> out<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.599> size<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.110> your<00:00:10.200> chain

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
find out this the size of your chain

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.249 
find out this the size of your chain
basically<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.460> speeds<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.179> your<00:00:12.509> of

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
basically it's the speeds of your of

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.200 
basically it's the speeds of your of
your<00:00:13.469> bicycle<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> rear<00:00:14.639> here<00:00:14.849> you'll

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
your bicycle so in the rear here you'll

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.870 
your bicycle so in the rear here you'll
see<00:00:15.450> if<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.080> count<00:00:16.379> each<00:00:16.470> cog<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.609> two

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
see if you count each cog is one two

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.400 
see if you count each cog is one two
three<00:00:17.910> four<00:00:18.270> or<00:00:18.600> five<00:00:18.750> there's<00:00:18.960> nine<00:00:19.109> cogs

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
three four or five there's nine cogs

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.950 
three four or five there's nine cogs
here<00:00:20.000> they'll<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.090> anywhere<00:00:21.330> usually<00:00:21.720> from

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
here they'll be anywhere usually from

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.490 
here they'll be anywhere usually from
five<00:00:22.410> cogs<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.789> now<00:00:24.180> there's<00:00:24.420> eleven<00:00:24.869> cogs<00:00:25.109> I

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
five cogs to now there's eleven cogs I

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.070 
five cogs to now there's eleven cogs I
need<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.189> special<00:00:26.430> chain<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.689> each<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:27.990> of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
need a special chain for each one of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.800 
need a special chain for each one of
those<00:00:28.460> each<00:00:29.460> each<00:00:29.730> size<00:00:30.029> basically<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.599> chain

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
those each each size basically the chain

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.709 
those each each size basically the chain
width<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> different<00:00:31.679> for<00:00:31.800> each<00:00:31.890> size<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.940> you

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
width is different for each size so you

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.959 
width is different for each size so you
find<00:00:34.050> your<00:00:34.140> box<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.950> says<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.460> nine<00:00:35.820> speed

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
find your box that says a nine speed

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.500 
find your box that says a nine speed
chain<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:38.670> take<00:00:38.820> out<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.000> chain<00:00:39.180> we'll

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
chain and you take out the chain we'll

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.180 
chain and you take out the chain we'll
just<00:00:39.780> use<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> old<00:00:40.020> chain<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.890> an

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
just use the old chain just as an

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.000 
just use the old chain just as an
example<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.960> you're<00:00:43.410> gonna<00:00:43.500> shift<00:00:43.829> your

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
example here and you're gonna shift your

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
example here and you're gonna shift your
gears<00:00:44.510> all<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> way<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.750> largest<00:00:48.750> or

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
gears all the way up to the largest or

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.279 
gears all the way up to the largest or
lowest<00:00:49.739> gear<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> back<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
lowest gear in the back and then all the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.279 
lowest gear in the back and then all the
way<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.640> highest<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.480> largest<00:00:54.930> gear

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
way up to your highest and largest gear

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.410 
way up to your highest and largest gear
in<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.440> front<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.120> how<00:00:57.210> you're<00:00:57.329> going

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
in the front so this is how you're going

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.150 
in the front so this is how you're going
to<00:00:57.480> size<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:58.020> chain<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.800> make<00:00:58.949> sure<00:00:59.070> that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to size your chain to make sure that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.439 
to size your chain to make sure that
it's<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> proper<00:00:59.609> length<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.359> not

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it's a proper length and that you're not

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.549 
it's a proper length and that you're not
gonna<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.719> too<00:01:00.840> much<00:01:00.989> slack<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:02.100> enough

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
gonna have too much slack or not enough

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.299 
gonna have too much slack or not enough
so<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> make<00:01:04.890> sure<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.100> weaving

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
so you want to make sure you're weaving

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
so you want to make sure you're weaving
the<00:01:05.790> chain<00:01:06.000> through<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> way<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the chain through just the way that it

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
the chain through just the way that it
came<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.860> making<00:01:08.460> sure<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.790> along

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
came out making sure it's going along

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:31.740 
came out making sure it's going along
these<00:01:09.540> rollers<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.110> through<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.530> proper<00:01:10.799> way

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.240 

so<00:01:32.750> now<00:01:32.840> that<00:01:32.960> you're<00:01:33.140> on<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.470> two<00:01:33.830> largest

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
so now that you're on the two largest

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.760 
so now that you're on the two largest
cogs<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.020> largest<00:01:36.320> in<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.440> back<00:01:36.590> and

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
cogs so the largest in the back and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.410 
cogs so the largest in the back and
large<00:01:36.979> in<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.190> front<00:01:37.400> you're<00:01:37.909> gonna<00:01:38.030> stretch

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
large in the front you're gonna stretch

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.630 
large in the front you're gonna stretch
your<00:01:38.600> chain<00:01:38.840> all<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.560> way<00:01:39.710> till<00:01:40.610> the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
your chain all the way till the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.760 
your chain all the way till the
derailleur<00:01:41.000> can't<00:01:41.180> stretch<00:01:41.420> anymore<00:01:41.770> so

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
derailleur can't stretch anymore so

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.570 
derailleur can't stretch anymore so
that's<00:01:42.950> where<00:01:43.159> you're<00:01:43.250> gonna<00:01:43.340> break<00:01:43.520> your

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
that's where you're gonna break your

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.520 
that's where you're gonna break your
chain<00:01:43.880> you're<00:01:44.000> gonna<00:01:44.119> add<00:01:44.299> one<00:01:44.659> link<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.350> one

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
chain you're gonna add one link so one

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.550 
chain you're gonna add one link so one
full-length<00:01:45.940> link<00:01:46.940> is<00:01:47.119> right<00:01:47.150> here<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.780> size

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
full-length link is right here that size

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.969 
full-length link is right here that size
it<00:01:48.740> there<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:50.210> add<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.470> cut<00:01:51.710> off<00:01:51.830> the

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
it there you add that and cut off the

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.160 
it there you add that and cut off the
rest<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.490> that's<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.540> length<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:53.899> your<00:01:53.990> chain

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
rest and that's the length of your chain

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.800 
rest and that's the length of your chain
so<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:54.649> would<00:01:55.009> look<00:01:55.100> like<00:01:55.159> this<00:01:55.540> what<00:01:56.540> it's<00:01:56.659> put

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
so it would look like this what it's put

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.889 
so it would look like this what it's put
together<00:01:57.790> so<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.880> way<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.030> put<00:01:59.240> together<00:01:59.299> this

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
together so the way to put together this

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.160 
together so the way to put together this
chain<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:01.159> they<00:02:01.340> use<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.520> pin<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.899> comes<00:02:03.049> in

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
chain is they use a pin so it comes in

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.270 
chain is they use a pin so it comes in
these<00:02:03.229> little<00:02:03.320> packets<00:02:03.500> here<00:02:03.950> different

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
these little packets here different

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.830 
these little packets here different
chains<00:02:04.640> require<00:02:05.000> different<00:02:05.390> installation

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
chains require different installation

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.469 
chains require different installation
this<00:02:06.710> chain<00:02:07.009> requires<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.399> pin<00:02:07.700> which<00:02:08.330> you'd

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
this chain requires a pin which you'd

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.400 
this chain requires a pin which you'd
have<00:02:08.570> to<00:02:08.660> get<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.780> bike<00:02:09.019> shop

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
have to get a bike shop

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.530 
have to get a bike shop

they also have quick links which
demonstrated<00:02:16.100> before<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:16.610> these<00:02:16.730> are<00:02:16.850> the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
demonstrated before so these are the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.690 
demonstrated before so these are the
quick<00:02:17.030> links<00:02:17.300> or<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:19.040> chain<00:02:19.250> may<00:02:19.550> already

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
quick links or the chain may already

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.250 
quick links or the chain may already
have<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.030> pin<00:02:20.269> installed<00:02:20.630> on<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:20.959> side<00:02:21.140> is

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
have the pin installed on one side is

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.170 
have the pin installed on one side is
just<00:02:21.350> coming<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.069> of<00:02:22.130> one<00:02:22.430> side<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.940> chain

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
just coming out of one side of the chain

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.920 
just coming out of one side of the chain
and<00:02:23.390> then<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:23.989> can<00:02:24.110> push<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.440> through<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:26.300> to

and then you can push it through to to
connect<00:02:27.200> properly<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:28.340> now<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:28.610> have

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
connect properly so now that you have

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.430 
connect properly so now that you have
the<00:02:28.790> sizing<00:02:29.209> correct<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:30.080> have<00:02:30.170> your<00:02:30.260> pin

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
make sure that you're shifting down to

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.470 
make sure that you're shifting down to
whatever<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.100> smallest<00:02:34.550> cog<00:02:35.269> in<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
whatever is the smallest cog in the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.699 
whatever is the smallest cog in the
front<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.750> whatever<00:02:35.900> this<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.170> smallest<00:02:36.560> cog

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
front and whatever this is smallest cog

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.190 
front and whatever this is smallest cog
in<00:02:36.829> the<00:02:36.890> back<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:38.269> have<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.750> lot<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.900> slack

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
in the back so you have a lot of slack

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.259 
in the back so you have a lot of slack
and<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.310> can<00:02:40.459> actually<00:02:40.670> even<00:02:40.820> take<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.120> off

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
your your chain ring in the front so

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.720 
your your chain ring in the front so
it's<00:02:44.120> nice<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.299> loose<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.950> you're

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
it's nice and loose and then you're
