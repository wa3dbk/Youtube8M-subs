them this is what you need to get for it

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.170 
them this is what you need to get for it
this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.469> great<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.950> got<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> DVI<00:00:35.520> output

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
this is great it's got the DVI output

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
this is great it's got the DVI output
right<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> s-video<00:00:38.309> so

a<00:01:04.260> little<00:01:04.589> bit<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> specs<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.790> this

a little bit about the specs on this
thing<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.360> briefly<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.930> touch<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.350> it
