00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.140
 visibly insult their attitude 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.149
 we could see that they cnx 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.759
 belong to the anarchist movement and 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.939
 extreme left so during 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.040
 the intervention stole the keys from us 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.869
 the mood we suffered insults 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.420
 violence and despite the presence 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.409
 military policemen 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.560
 following the violence and gardens have 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.520
 challenged an individual we have 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.160
 have been forced 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.869
 to the feet with the under the spit and 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.450
 throwing bottles against vehicles 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.510
 and do not forget that foot and also the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.769
 I learned later that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.290
 fifty masked individuals 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.370
 had besieged the barracks today 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.360
 in the village is you but tell me it's 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.900
 current of this kind same interrogation 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.090
 what is the atmosphere in the village 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.269
 have been celebrating for some years now 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.250
 groups of idle youth and since 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.560
 a year or two it does not happen very 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.790
 well the aggressions multiply when 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.680
 the last the thickness of the village 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.930
 had broken his showcase and others 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.450
 assaults committed by that same day of 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.940

 I am this messiah to protect and 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.680
 serve the population and for me it is 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.180
 unacceptable that the individuals 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.049

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.510
