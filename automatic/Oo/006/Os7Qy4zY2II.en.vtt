with<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.980> pyramids<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.640> came<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.390> visit<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
with the pyramids I came to visit the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.509

local<00:00:19.050> museum<00:00:19.440> and<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.460> saw<00:00:21.080> this<00:00:22.080> hill<00:00:22.740> with

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
local museum and I saw this hill with

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.669 
local museum and I saw this hill with
irregular<00:00:24.119> shape<00:00:25.429> four<00:00:26.429> sides<00:00:26.820> triangle

faces very obvious corners and when I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.640 
faces very obvious corners and when I
put<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> composter<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.510> found<00:00:33.990> out<00:00:34.260> that

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
put the composter and I found out that

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.280 
put the composter and I found out that
the<00:00:34.829> sides<00:00:35.250> perfect<00:00:36.090> image<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.690> cabinet

points east west north and south I

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.580 
points east west north and south I
needed<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> know<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.330> have<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:42.480> Piron<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.260> front

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
needed to know I have the Piron in front

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.050 
needed to know I have the Piron in front
of<00:00:43.800> those<00:00:44.760> two<00:00:44.820> facts<00:00:45.570> long<00:00:46.460> geometry<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
of those two facts long geometry and

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.600 
of those two facts long geometry and
perfect<00:00:48.630> orientation<00:00:49.350> were<00:00:49.620> enough<00:00:50.220> for<00:00:50.250> me

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
perfect orientation were enough for me

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.750 
perfect orientation were enough for me
to<00:00:50.820> conclude<00:00:51.290> this<00:00:52.290> was<00:00:52.650> a<00:00:52.980> man-made

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to conclude this was a man-made

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.700 
to conclude this was a man-made
structure<00:00:54.150> which<00:00:54.540> I<00:00:54.720> named<00:00:54.990> the<00:00:55.200> Bosnian

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
structure which I named the Bosnian

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.550 
structure which I named the Bosnian
pyramids<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.310> the<00:00:56.340> sun<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.880> the<00:00:57.420> moon<00:00:57.560> but

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
pyramids of the sun and the moon but

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.340 
pyramids of the sun and the moon but
later<00:00:58.830> on<00:00:59.070> thanks<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> satellite

explaining the images thanks with the
velocity<00:01:03.750> maps<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.890> realised<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
velocity maps we realised that the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.930 
velocity maps we realised that the
complex<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.990> much<00:01:07.200> bigger<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:08.159> added<00:01:08.580> three

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
complex is much bigger we added three

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.980 
complex is much bigger we added three

modest<00:03:52.349> chilly<00:03:53.349> water<00:03:53.609> but<00:03:54.609> it's<00:03:54.790> also

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
modest chilly water but it's also

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.379 
modest chilly water but it's also
finally<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> pyramid<00:03:57.040> structure<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.030> they

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
finally a pyramid structure and they

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.720 
finally a pyramid structure and they
have<00:03:58.569> the<00:03:58.750> alignment<00:03:59.340> north-south<00:04:00.340> and

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
have the alignment north-south and

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.949 
have the alignment north-south and
different<00:04:01.630> tunnel<00:04:02.109> system<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:03.639> it<00:04:04.510> will<00:04:04.780> be

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
different tunnel system so it will be

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.750 
different tunnel system so it will be
very<00:04:05.069> interesting<00:04:06.069> what<00:04:06.419> future<00:04:07.419> brings<00:04:07.840> out

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
very interesting what future brings out

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.199 
very interesting what future brings out
about<00:04:09.760> these<00:04:10.480> places<00:04:11.349> so<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.310> think<00:04:12.459> this<00:04:12.879> story

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
about these places so I think this story

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.430 
about these places so I think this story
will<00:04:13.599> continue<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.799> as<00:04:15.250> your<00:04:16.440> archaeologists

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
will continue and as your archaeologists

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.099 
will continue and as your archaeologists
from<00:04:17.590> Italy<00:04:18.099> told<00:04:18.849> me<00:04:19.090> yesterday<00:04:19.329> that<00:04:19.690> they

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
from Italy told me yesterday that they

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.200 
from Italy told me yesterday that they
wrote<00:04:20.470> already<00:04:21.010> from<00:04:21.280> Italy<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:22.000> she

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
wrote already from Italy that she

they consider themselves as scientists

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.920 
they consider themselves as scientists
so<00:04:38.830> if<00:04:38.949> they<00:04:39.160> recognize<00:04:39.849> your<00:04:40.120> pyramids<00:04:40.720> as

thousand<00:04:46.210> years<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:47.229> missing<00:04:47.620> link<00:04:47.830> was<00:04:48.039> what

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
thousand years the missing link was what

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.240 
thousand years the missing link was what
was<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:49.240> between<00:04:49.599> they<00:04:50.530> should<00:04:50.830> give<00:04:51.099> an

was in between they should give an

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.159 
was in between they should give an
answer<00:04:51.430> but<00:04:51.669> they<00:04:51.970> cannot<00:04:52.270> give<00:04:52.510> an<00:04:52.630> answer<00:04:52.810> so

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
answer but they cannot give an answer so

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.140 
answer but they cannot give an answer so
it's<00:04:53.320> more<00:04:53.560> easy<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.919> say<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:54.760> is<00:04:54.970> all

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
it's more easy to say this is all

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.830 
it's more easy to say this is all
natural<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:56.220> leave<00:04:57.220> us<00:04:57.400> alone<00:04:57.580> and<00:04:58.060> then<00:04:58.510> the

natural and leave us alone and then the

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.159 
natural and leave us alone and then the
media<00:04:59.229> will<00:04:59.289> not<00:04:59.680> report<00:05:00.070> about<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.240> but

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
media will not report about it and but

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.130 
media will not report about it and but
the<00:05:02.320> reality<00:05:02.919> is<00:05:03.159> different<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:04.270> our<00:05:04.570> history
