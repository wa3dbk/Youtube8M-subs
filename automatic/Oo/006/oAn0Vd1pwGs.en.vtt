00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.650
 more 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.080
 Today I will show how to do one 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.539
 double premiere per all stop motion 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.790
 project created and only at the beginning 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.680
 the stop motion stop motion it is when 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.930
 to record individually very many pictures 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.360
 where a figure of always a 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.369
 a little further moved and then on 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.410
 end at the computer can play as the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.239
 film or something so no 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 I have already recorded for this 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.770
 a few pictures taken 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.829
 I just mark them all 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.829
 because two projects 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:01:02.050
 the imported because then I see you 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.560
 already all so imported are completely 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.560
 lots 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.170
 side project with lie and the other 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.180
 times it with chips then when I first 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 in Alsace last with chips and 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.410
 should go all the way up 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.350
 you all like to make a right click on it 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.320
 then click here on re-sequenced 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.240
 then i have the sequence like that here 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.360
 is already adjusted by the size 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.360
 here 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.660
 because the pictures have a higher resolution 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.120
 as in the movie because the film is then have 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.650
 her so taken with a video camera 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.540
 and that has me now with a dslr 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.660
 that means a lot 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.310
 better resolution then, but I have to 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.130
 Nevertheless , all mark again if 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.880
 I now play this is a 550 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.399
 colorful long 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.990
 I have to make sure of that 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.210
 i like to make them all right click 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.899
 it 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.899
 if I'm sharp 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.550
 you do not have to 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.550
 towards the 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.550
 then I click speed here 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.740
 duration and here I have so five 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.290
 seconds in front 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.070
 here are the hours minutes seconds 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.340
 and frames I put this here now 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.680
 that a picture, as it were, a frame 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.320
 is long and very important is that too 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.840
 me on delete and gap close track 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.810
 Move clips created because otherwise 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.730
 is it then yes there are always in between 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.740
 I have big gaps 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.270
 here so click on the spacebar 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.520
 to play 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.520
 but I see it's way too fast 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.580
 do I control now z then come 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.580
 I go back 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.209
 it's only right for two friends 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.500
 then I'll see it again 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.500
 should look better 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.430
 is at the very beginning 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.430
 in front 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.930
 and it looks definitely better 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.150
 then 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.150
 the big problem is with bigger movie 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.409
 that could move me then 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.959
 That's why I do your right click and 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.120
 want and click on group 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.680
 then i can not take a picture individually 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.920
 but move the same 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.020
 all 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.700
 Do you have it even if I want to get out ? 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.700
 I all out then I have this way 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.180
 here 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.709
 twice 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.200
 tutorial but it was also a tutorial 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.689
 and yes, I will open the video too 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.459
 youtube reload with the stop motion 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:42.769
 then to blacken it again 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.769
 Thank you for the viewer user
