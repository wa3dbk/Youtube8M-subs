00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 roller sponsor server maxcraft max 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.569
 mayo on this minecraft server version 1 5 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.150
 2 with lots of mini-games 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.460
 good admins really good 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.740
 the atmosphere in general if I have been looking for a server for a long time 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.150
 where to play with friends max mine 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.699
 reference in the description 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.350
 I do not know something there is not playing well 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.350
 now let's watch a video 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.830
 hello friends my name is bender but 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.960
 this is likely and so know therefore 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.570
 let's do it without any delay today 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.610
 let's go to fashion here i will test in 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.760
 specially super flat world because 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.920
 this mod is very very very connected 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.720
 with buildings in general I would say this 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.360
 mod for the lazy that is and those people 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.699
 which is too lazy to build something creative and 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.250
 who just want themselves a huge house with 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.870
 blackjack well and you understood that is this 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.750
 mod allows using a single block 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.300
 make awesome awesome big house 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.460
 well this is not really original 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.340
 ideas of such mods were already several I 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.070
 personal surveyed but the essence of this mod is 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.690
 that there are really cool buildings here 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.520
 just really huge cool not 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.860
 some small wheat farms 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.869
 Odessa on the steep epic buildings 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.479
 let's take a look at a few again 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.700
 show all I do not have time but let's here 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.220
 Take, for example, this one 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.220
 new house modern house at is called 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.500
 We put it and now you can not see but 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.810
 me over mycroft service window where i'm 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.909
 need to agree with what type you are 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.700
 do you want to put this topic i say i 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.360
 I want to put this topic shake yes again 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.150
 muda 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.520
 and return to the game and voila literally 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.670
 in a few seconds we got here 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.680
 such an awesome healthy home in 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.990
 which you can live and which much 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.700
 It looks creative truth at the expense of 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.680
 that mod is probably not so much 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.840
 updated under the new version you can 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.420
 notice that there are small bugs with 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.729
 but the blocks disappear that is all you can 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.549
 will finish then calmly and everything 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.409
 will work well on pre eat already 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.439
 thing with which you will cook 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.630
 potions it I do not know the sofa that is in 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.780
 really awesome home awesome cool 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.579
 built house and in just one block this 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.220
 cool naturally all these blocks have 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.260
 craft and but as always you can find out by 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.900
 the link in the description and here by the way is very 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.480
 strange these are the expensive things and lie 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.920
 they are like a cushion for the table so 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.290
 but some kind of irrational use 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.380
 let's see a couple more buildings 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.690
 getting out of here and as you can see here everything 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.790
 built in four categories four 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.580
 categories this us technical things up 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.760
 may not even 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.250
 walk here 4 category is with us i am so 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.280
 I understand Asia well, that is, Asian 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.480
 buildings here 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.610
 oriented buildings to be honest 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.500
 We will understand now well and new 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.180
 buildings, that is to say 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.360
 using the whole city can do 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.000
 let's start give technology take 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.430
 here is this technique and now again with me 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.620
 appeared i need to press yes again 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.380
 press yes and something slowly changes 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.360
 hung friends can consell there is nothing 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.330
 It does not work and apparently Mycroft 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.300
 krasnal they are friends of minecraft do not paint 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.370
 just the building turned out to be too 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.410
 motive epic you look it 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.110
 some wild space liner 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.630
 which again for one block I got 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.730
 damn it's just awesome thing 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.350
 look only at her she has 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.630
 some kind of insides ie you can 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.790
 go to this go nuts honestly I donâ€™t know 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.070
 where is this from because i like you know 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.170
 science fiction never me especially 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.730
 deceived yes friends there is something 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.709
 inside you can live there 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.320
 you will take here the players on the server 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.450
 all play with the usual there some 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.000
 houses with mines but such a ship 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.870
 built damn it is drop dead you 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.110
 look here and 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.000
 stove and all sorts of things there are steep and there 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.760
 overall this is just a great place and i would 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.680
 here really lived that is for one 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.700
 block get such a ship according to the mind it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.830
 wild freebie 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.110
 and it's very cool ok let's 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.940
 get out of here damn it turns out 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.920
 just he was loaded for a long time I can't even 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.110
 fly it in a few seconds oh 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.780
 look i don't see it from one edge to 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.260
 another he is just huge you look 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.300
 this airship why no airship 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.370
 this is a whole cruiser of some sort 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.489
 some kind of airship so let's go now 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.030
 let's make another one this one 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.070
 equipment 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.250
 but you saw her at the very beginning it is with us 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.380
 if I'm not mistaken so you maynkravt 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.570
 must now download this technique and 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.300
 Apparently, I again became a cat on top 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.880
 so I live here yes and still red yes 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.160
 and going back to the game and voila air 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.000
 balloon healthy balloon too fucking 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.210
 I generally 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.850
 the place to live is me and it is empty 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.039
 inside this is a cool topic actually 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.689
 sorry it does not fly but nevertheless like this 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.459
 that's airy 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.879
 let's look at the last building 

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:51.289
 with all the buildings you can already 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.229
 see how to download look 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.369
 the link itself as always in the description reading 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.439
 began to get confused slightly 

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:59.689
 so let's look at this topic 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:03.110
 yes again yes yes yes here is so small 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:04.879
 the menu is us an asian house and even before i 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.679
 I do not see that it is Asian honest 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.599
 saying okay let's say it with us 

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:10.669
 asian house too cool honestly 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.799
 saying that it is you very much 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.289
 distinguish on some server or just 

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:16.819
 you will be different from others 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.860
 players who as I said 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:21.050
 standard houses but if you of course 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.939
 be creative, and do so in order to build 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.169
 Of course, well done and it is much better than 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.329
 so here with one block 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.369
 get the whole house okay overall on this 

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:30.409
 I think my friends will finish the review 

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:32.089
 link to it as the third time I say 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.669
 why then I too often lettuce 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:37.009
 speak in the description if you are interested 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.050
 look put well that is here 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.509
 so small enough big 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.039
 actually mod judging by this ship 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.619
 but not really big either 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:48.079
 adds about 30 buildings in total 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:49.610
 well and you had a bender put your 

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:52.039
 likes if you want more movies 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.989
 minecraft and indeed more rollers I 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.659
 I thought maybe if it works out 

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:58.879
 soon we will switch to mode two 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.860
 video per day and it will be cool that is 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.229
 more commercials more fun so 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.969
 put huskies and I understand that you are 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.099
 want and also subscribe to 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:11.439
 channel watch other videos well and on this 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.439
