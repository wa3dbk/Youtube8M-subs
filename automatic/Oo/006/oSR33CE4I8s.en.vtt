00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.049
 hello then rejected products 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.669
 of the last period therefore me 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.639
 do not advise yourself first 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:13.280
 I do not recommend one of the new stirrers 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.589
 of the latest bean collection this 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.060
 specifically, 03 is called ground 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.619
 couture 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.109
 when I saw her before your 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.599
 colors you immediately liked because a 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.670
 all the colors that I use 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.929
 a lot when I decide to make up in 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.840
 colorful teal green on beautiful blue 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.450
 in short, all the colors are darker 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.640
 that I really like this bronze 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.320
 really nice but then when i am 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.050
 I went to do some tricks I had 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.020
 some problems because i 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.410
 light colors write little I do not say that 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.570
 they don't actually write kiko ha 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.820
 really better as eye shadows I have to 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.390
 say that they write little and fade away 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.340
 bad dark ones instead sign up 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.530
 to pigmentation, however, this too 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.600
 once they fade badly we say that 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.360
 precisely the consistency of these objects 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.340
 it's really jamming and jamming 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.350
 because it is not easy to blend them and it is not 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.150
 like to blend them like other eye shadows 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.910
 so he honestly has too many problems 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.130
 to be a small edition 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.110
 limited so that you have to pay more 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.730
 a little more 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.610
 I honestly do not know there are tactical 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.100
 loose eye shadows that make much more 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.420
 compared to these singles you find in 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.570
 this small spoon so if really 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.350
 you have to take them the individual ones is the 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.320
 same thing 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.320
 I honestly do n't know this disappointed me 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.680
 and then rejected another rejected by more 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.110
 points of view and this one is correct 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.930
 of the new vichy correctors is called 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.060
 dyed idea ie the tented line and others 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.800
 which were also made others 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 always products of this line as per 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.190
 example the fluid and compact foundation 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.560
 etc 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.460
 the concealer that I in the coloring 1 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.909
 light the bud almost on all fronts 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.990
 because then here it is seen 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.189
 immediately 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.110
 the reason is first of all the dispenser 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.349
 the applicator just wrong for me 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.390
 for a concealer because a dispenser 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.430
 rolon applicator so there is the ball 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.220
 steel that rotates 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.560
 according to me the raw is not good only for i 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.560
 gel for non-colored things because 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.300
 precisely this corrector sbrodola 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.940
 continually shreds everywhere and 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.190
 therefore also distribute the product in 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.430
 fair amount but it's really difficult 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.650
 own malicious sbrÃ² product more and 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.420
 so this is what I mean 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.690
 applicator with the fact that I said them here 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.700
 mo creates a mess is another thing 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.980
 I don't think it's okay 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.370
 because at 8 o'clock you mark them on the product 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.230
 very light so personally I have 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.660
 really difficult to use it a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.610
 part due to the fact that precisely a 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.819
 doser a consistency that I am a little 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.970
 difficult to manage but because you are many 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.370
 dark circles are completely broken down 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.870
 because it does not go to cover a lot and then there is 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.359
 very liquid and therefore goes almost to 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.220
 to lose sincerely therefore for the 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.870
 girl like me with dark circles that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.780
 they want a nice covering that 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.220
 Product stays there do not recommend it here 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.140
 just maybe for girls who have 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.549
 very few glasses a veil of 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.170
 shading below 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.500
 that they really need something 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.010
 fresh light that passes and you decide home 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.480
 beate v then maybe it could go 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.850
 but honestly in my opinion this 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.920
 product has too many problems of its own 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.690
 logistic and consistency that 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.680
 in my opinion they are not good but they do it to me 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.120
 rejection for which second failed 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.510
 let's talk about this shampoo this game 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.120
 it had to be in my opinion 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.540
 the revelation was not and instead was a 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.819
 flop 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.129
 because in the meantime it's the line 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.840
 magic of the magic perfume brand of 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.310
 nature is found in the great 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.739
 distribution 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.689
 shampoos and conditioners cost very little 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.000
 of this line and I am in Italy of the 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:03.510
 fair success because I believe that it is 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.129
 speaks a bit of curiosity to me he had to 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.930
 be a great success because why 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.260
 I the balm of this line and the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.640
 fabulous balm that is a show 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.280
 I absolutely have to put you 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.340
 products promoted because of what they are 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.880
 coast and for the easy availability is a 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:28.289
 product that will become top for me 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:30.210
 allowed the top shampoo with with 4g 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.310
 so meanwhile I used it because I have 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.590
 my tried and tested routine for i 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.860
 hair will be made recently the video 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.720
 so that's fine though, every tot 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.460
 I change a little bit for some 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.470
 day la routine 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.389
 otherwise you get used to it from the scalp 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.889
 too much to those products so I am 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.150
 said I take this shampoo because 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.800
 the bass is great 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.810
 so this will be the same 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.320
 fantastic 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.780
 then time 2 washes I had one 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.970
 film dandruff 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.490
 you know I don't know in the movie when 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.310
 create the character nerds not 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.880
 glasses type of bottle to the bottom 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.639
 licked hair all blushed with the shot with 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.060
 I was the big piece of force 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.880
 I started to create all this 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.860
 shape at the hairline 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.919
 especially up here 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.840
 I was very full, no short, among other things 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.900
 with where around another fantastic 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.789
 news that once how it is 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.690
 going on it is found with my hair 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:36.630
 dark is seen a mile away 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.820
 horrible and nothing was the fault of this 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.030
 because basically i quit 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.160
 use it e 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.200
 today to have done by the disappearance 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.850
 he immediately really annoyed me 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.040
 very much the scalp between 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.390
 the other one I didn't even notice 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.790
 at the beginning because generally when 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.580
 something bothers me to scalp me 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.560
 itchy so I agree to this right away 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.390
 no it absolutely didn't itch then it is 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.910
 came on the quarry exit 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.840
 we look really fantastic 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.900
 on the hair 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.360
 I finished it on brushes and panels 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.070
 In short it has gone quite well 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.830
 then slightly I sing the little hole 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.520
 so imagine yourself on the hair 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.980
 not recommended for all girls 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.720
 that have the reactive scalp and 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.940
 as sensitive as mine 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.550
 be careful because this makes you do it 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.380
 Trick and especially for girls 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.230
 that already basic with which I understood a lot 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.960
 dry I did not understand dry however it is 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:34.440
 very responsive sensitive so be there 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.440
 He awaits why and evil mum rejected 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.160
 the last rejected and this basis for 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.180
 rimmel eyeshadow 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.730
 it's called exagerate is a base 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.280
 for eyeshadow the applicator similar to 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:53.830
 that of blues very oily as a base 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:56.400
 I don't like it because it's more obvious than 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.900
 world does not hold my eyeshadow a 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.790
 I have tried enough with many a 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.910
 break at the beginning I tried it with these 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.020
 of keycode that I rejected a little while ago is the 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.330
 result was enough 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.300
 disastrous because I always play kiko tv 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.790
 they are a little bit difficult 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.770
 clear they don't write well then this 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.410
 almost stemmed product was fine 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.250
 so kiko eye shadow is already me 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.629
 suspicious 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.430
 then when I realized it was 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:23.620
 just the little stick that I didn't like 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.810
 then I tried it with a lot of eye shadows 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.879
 then tested eye shadows 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.009
 nymark with a naked rights therefore 

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:33.940
 you still with dust that I know already 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:35.409
 no they themselves are very valid and also 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.000
 with those he managed to get me 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:40.720
 folds succeeded in making me the folds 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.599
 with eye shadows that they can sometimes use 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.840
 even without a base under this thing almost 

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:49.960
 of the paranormal however it has happened and therefore 

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.520
 nothing in my opinion is absolutely not one 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.009
 valid eyeshadow base 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.080
 neither more nor less ok michele these were 

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:58.860
 rejected products 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.720
 I don't know how this corrector will end 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:04.930
 I can't know I can't 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.669
 imagine, however, everything is going to end 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:11.229
 in my box of products from 

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:12.550
 but finishing up this girls this is tough 

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:14.469
 time it's hard it's okay 

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.270
 nothing else the back a big kiss 

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:20.340
 I hope to be spoiled useful and there 

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.340
 see you at the next video bye
