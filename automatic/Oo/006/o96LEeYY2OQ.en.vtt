removed my fryer and they're in this
little<00:00:13.830> container<00:00:14.130> now<00:00:14.460> as<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.700> can<00:00:14.790> see

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
little container now as you can see

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.060 
little container now as you can see
they've<00:00:15.000> gone<00:00:15.179> quite<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> bit<00:00:15.870> actually<00:00:16.070> I've

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
they've gone quite a bit actually I've

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.269 
they've gone quite a bit actually I've
gotten<00:00:17.490> quite<00:00:18.890> larger<00:00:19.890> than<00:00:20.010> they<00:00:20.130> were

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
gotten quite larger than they were

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.689 
gotten quite larger than they were
obviously<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.560> them<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.189> two

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
obviously but this is them at about two

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.370 
obviously but this is them at about two
months<00:00:24.600> two<00:00:25.289> months<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.779> no<00:00:27.779> two<00:00:28.050> months<00:00:28.289> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
months two months and no two months I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.790 
months two months and no two months I
think<00:00:28.439> maybe<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.519> bit<00:00:29.699> over<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:30.119> months<00:00:30.269> old<00:00:30.800> so

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
think maybe a bit over two months old so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.139 
think maybe a bit over two months old so
yeah<00:00:32.610> I've<00:00:32.759> done<00:00:32.910> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
yeah I've done that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.060

the stuff at the bottom there so I can

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
the stuff at the bottom there so I can

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
show I'll see if I can show you maybe we

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.920 
show I'll see if I can show you maybe we
have<00:00:51.930> these<00:00:52.170> three<00:00:52.469> good<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.800> hand<00:00:53.570> is<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.780> by

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
have these three good one hand is up by

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.540 
have these three good one hand is up by
burning<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.800> works<00:00:59.010> quite

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
burning you can see that it works quite

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.609 
burning you can see that it works quite
effectively<00:01:01.489> it's<00:01:02.489> gonna<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.789> difficult

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.080 

come<00:01:08.579> on<00:01:09.560> just<00:01:10.560> need<00:01:10.679> to<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:13.490> get<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:14.700> air<00:01:14.939> in

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
come on just need to get get some air in

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.620 
come on just need to get get some air in
there<00:01:15.270> first

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.580 

and<00:01:23.229> see<00:01:24.159> that<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:24.579> sucks<00:01:24.880> up<00:01:25.090> all<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:29.229> quite

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
and see that it sucks up all that quite

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.410 
and see that it sucks up all that quite
nicely

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.690 

this<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.690> very<00:01:38.020> difficult<00:01:38.470> one<00:01:38.680> hand<00:01:38.920> no<00:01:39.550> way

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
this is very difficult one hand no way

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.080 
this is very difficult one hand no way
I'd<00:01:39.820> do<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.060> with<00:01:40.180> two<00:01:41.050> hands<00:01:41.530> but<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:42.910> then

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
I'd do it with two hands but and then

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.950 
I'd do it with two hands but and then
pour<00:01:43.630> it<00:01:43.750> straight<00:01:45.360> into<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.810> can

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
pour it straight into that and you can

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.320 
pour it straight into that and you can
definitely<00:01:47.200> see<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:47.770> it's<00:01:47.890> picked<00:01:48.190> up<00:01:48.400> all

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
definitely see that it's picked up all

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.910 
definitely see that it's picked up all
that<00:01:49.600> stuff<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:50.140> was<00:01:50.350> at<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.530> bottom<00:01:50.650> of<00:01:50.800> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
that stuff that was at the bottom of the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.850 
that stuff that was at the bottom of the
tank<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:52.030> I'm<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:53.350> just<00:01:53.440> gonna<00:01:53.590> keep<00:01:53.800> doing

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
tank so I'm I'm just gonna keep doing

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:06.770 
tank so I'm I'm just gonna keep doing
that<00:01:54.310> I'll<00:01:55.030> show<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.420> again<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:06.280> grip<00:02:06.520> it's

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
that I'll show you again the grip it's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:15.360 
that I'll show you again the grip it's
there<00:02:07.780> we<00:02:07.900> go<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.989> is<00:02:14.050> not<00:02:14.230> as<00:02:14.680> easy<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.160> it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
there we go this is not as easy as it

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.699 
there we go this is not as easy as it
looks<00:02:15.760> with<00:02:16.060> what<00:02:16.300> end<00:02:17.040> okay<00:02:18.040> we<00:02:18.160> get<00:02:18.310> that

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
looks with what end okay we get that

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:34.229 
looks with what end okay we get that
that's<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:21.130> big<00:02:21.310> pacer<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:32.730> I'm<00:02:33.730> so

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
that's a big pacer and I'm so

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.390 
that's a big pacer and I'm so
uncoordinated<00:02:34.660> with<00:02:35.080> one<00:02:35.230> hand<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.800> there<00:02:39.280> we

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
uncoordinated with one hand and there we

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.170 
uncoordinated with one hand and there we
go<00:02:40.650> air<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:41.769> there<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.880> can<00:02:43.000> definitely

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
go air in there and you can definitely

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.660 
go air in there and you can definitely
see<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.660> picks<00:02:43.840> up<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.140> lot<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:45.130> I'm<00:02:45.519> just

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
see that it picks up a lot so I'm just

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.630 
see that it picks up a lot so I'm just
gonna<00:02:45.820> keep<00:02:45.970> doing<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.860> know<00:02:48.459> you're<00:02:48.610> not

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
gonna keep doing that I know you're not

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.210 
gonna keep doing that I know you're not
meant<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.940> really<00:02:49.239> remove<00:02:49.540> more<00:02:49.900> than<00:02:50.140> half<00:02:51.010> of

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
meant to really remove more than half of

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.740 
meant to really remove more than half of
the<00:02:51.400> water<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:51.910> considering<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.540> don't

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
the water but considering that I don't

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.940 
the water but considering that I don't
have<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> filter<00:02:53.230> or<00:02:53.410> anything

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
have a filter or anything

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.979 
have a filter or anything
it's<00:02:54.519> tank<00:02:54.820> tends<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.120> get<00:02:55.239> really<00:02:55.570> dirty<00:02:55.720> like

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
it's tank tends to get really dirty like

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.259 
it's tank tends to get really dirty like
