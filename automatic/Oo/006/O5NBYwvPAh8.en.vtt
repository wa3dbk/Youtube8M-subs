fan of belts i think they really add a
lot<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.680> outfits<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:58.580> i<00:01:58.610> do<00:01:58.700> tend<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.090> wear<00:01:59.240> them

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.480 
lot to outfits so i do tend to wear them
a<00:01:59.479> lot<00:01:59.509> i<00:01:59.900> did<00:02:00.320> put<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.500> belt<00:02:00.710> on<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.189> black

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
a lot i did put a belt on it is black

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.550 
a lot i did put a belt on it is black
but<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.880> little<00:02:02.180> bit<00:02:02.299> of<00:02:02.360> gold<00:02:02.540> detail<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.259> it

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
but a little bit of gold detail so it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.560 
but a little bit of gold detail so it
blends<00:02:04.070> it's<00:02:04.430> not<00:02:04.580> overwhelming<00:02:04.939> it's<00:02:05.479> not

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
blends it's not overwhelming it's not

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.690 
blends it's not overwhelming it's not
this<00:02:05.689> big<00:02:05.960> huge<00:02:06.229> pop<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.680> color<00:02:06.860> but<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.490> adds

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
this big huge pop of color but it adds

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.550 
this big huge pop of color but it adds
more<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.209> outfit<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:09.290> bunch<00:02:09.470> of

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
especially the v necks it kind of

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.530 
especially the v necks it kind of
follows<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.489> line<00:02:13.670> look<00:02:13.940> for<00:02:14.120> pockets

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
follows the line look for pockets

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.850 
follows the line look for pockets
because<00:02:14.660> i<00:02:14.810> think<00:02:14.870> pockets<00:02:15.470> are<00:02:15.620> really

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
because i think pockets are really

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.460 
because i think pockets are really
important<00:02:16.370> on<00:02:16.459> jumpers<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.329> has<00:02:17.870> something

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
important on jumpers so has something

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.020 
important on jumpers so has something
more<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.799> than<00:02:19.010> just<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.310> straight<00:02:19.760> one

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
more to it than just a straight one

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.420 
more to it than just a straight one
piece<00:02:20.690> suit<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.650> is<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.799> little<00:02:22.040> bit<00:02:22.190> looser

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
piece suit and it is a little bit looser

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.670 
piece suit and it is a little bit looser
it's<00:02:23.000> not<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.239> really<00:02:23.600> tight<00:02:23.810> fitted<00:02:24.170> one<00:02:24.350> the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
it's not a really tight fitted one the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.979 
it's not a really tight fitted one the
pants<00:02:25.130> are<00:02:25.280> just<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.760> straight<00:02:26.239> leg<00:02:26.450> pant<00:02:26.750> a

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
pants are just a straight leg pant a

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.259 
pants are just a straight leg pant a
skinny<00:02:27.590> leg<00:02:27.829> or<00:02:28.040> anything<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.370> are<00:02:28.670> too<00:02:28.970> wide

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
skinny leg or anything that are too wide

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.229 
skinny leg or anything that are too wide
and<00:02:29.660> i<00:02:30.350> do<00:02:30.590> like<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.310> pair<00:02:31.700> them<00:02:31.910> i<00:02:32.150> think

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
and i do like to pair them i think

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.110 
and i do like to pair them i think
jumpers<00:02:33.049> work<00:02:33.709> really<00:02:34.010> well<00:02:34.160> with<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.519> platform

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
jumpers work really well with a platform

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.240 
jumpers work really well with a platform
shoe<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.690> have<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.350> dimension<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.160> that

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
shoe so you have that dimension and that

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.610 
shoe so you have that dimension and that
height<00:02:37.579> they're<00:02:38.030> covered<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:39.079> lose<00:02:39.410> the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
height they're covered you lose the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.229 
height they're covered you lose the
whole<00:02:39.799> effect<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.579> little<00:02:40.790> bit<00:02:41.000> too<00:02:41.120> much

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
whole effect of it a little bit too much

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.140 
whole effect of it a little bit too much
unless<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.750> really<00:02:42.079> super<00:02:42.470> wide<00:02:43.070> leg<00:02:43.519> jumper

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
unless the really super wide leg jumper

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.789 
unless the really super wide leg jumper
then<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.450> could<00:02:44.600> do<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.260> that's<00:02:45.470> not<00:02:45.769> a

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
then you could do it that's not a

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.860 
then you could do it that's not a
platform<00:02:46.310> shoes<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.790> flattered<00:02:47.060> shoe<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.780> can

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
platform shoes of flattered shoe you can

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.780 
platform shoes of flattered shoe you can
kind<00:02:48.049> of<00:02:48.110> see<00:02:48.170> how<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:49.040> these<00:02:49.310> are<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.549> shoes

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.350 

and<00:02:53.530> then<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.160> paired<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.490> with<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.670> bunch<00:02:55.210> of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360

fun with drummers you can go crazy

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.970 
fun with drummers you can go crazy
especially<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.990> was<00:03:02.080> all<00:03:02.290> one<00:03:02.500> solid<00:03:02.710> color

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
especially it was all one solid color

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.920 
especially it was all one solid color
the<00:03:03.460> best<00:03:03.670> color<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.030> start<00:03:04.240> with<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.600> black

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
because it's easy to end no patterns I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.570 
because it's easy to end no patterns I
don't<00:03:07.330> like<00:03:07.390> any<00:03:07.690> patterns<00:03:08.230> any<00:03:08.950> prints<00:03:09.400> on
