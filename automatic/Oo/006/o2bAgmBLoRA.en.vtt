00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.180
 hello I'm eduardo de kitchin a punto es y 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:12.250
 we will pass the test and to to to the 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:15.219
 device by efe 2 haitises eduardo 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.170
 frei na 1210 and we are going to pass 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.220
 the before your benchmark today 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.439
 efe hey hey jude 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.740
 We are going to compete with those who said 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:32.680
 the eleven w 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:37.360
 we keep it mine that the professor you 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.010
 and that's a lot five star one point 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.120
 Sun 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:47.949
 let's test 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.949
 both the screen resolution tofful haiti 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.170
 let she works 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.570
 let's see how they work as always 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.670
 the first tests are about the cpu and the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.509
 phone memory and calculations 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.509
 mathematicians 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.380
 as usual of phrases part of the youtube 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:21.030
 is to pray into the view memory and 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.110
 math operations 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.549
 after that starks with the graphics 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.610
 after this it starts already with the part 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.650
 graphic from 50% more or less than 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.550
 test 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.630
 and after the graphics starts with 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.079
 show the results 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.079
 auto the graphics parts it's over 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.079
 resorts 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.970
 its dimension to the round 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.970
 drawings are of the dimensions 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.069
 effects of lights blind effects 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.069
 but 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.770
 3d graphics freddy graphics 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.780
 Similary 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.300
 pretty similar performance in 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.300
 performance 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.430
 and we are approaching the end of the test 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.019
 I'm going to see you next 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.019
 come from test 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.240
 is dictator right and with 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.430
 ay fingers of the smart 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.980
 reading and writing on the card 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.980
 sd I think it's the last part 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:12.400
 we have the result of th 14,487 the 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:16.709
 sun 2 of the puig and fortin house and for 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.709
 android haitÃ­ haiti seven 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.650
 lets 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.650
 white 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.350
 You 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.820
 d 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:43.520
 different remove this round 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.300
 susana five hundred points different 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.780
 many 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.130
 snap show big 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.130
 maybe win 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.840
 the difference between the two is about 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.849
 about 2500 points which is not 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.310
 exceedingly large with the 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:04.400
 difference of processor that has and 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.210
 apart from the turbo processor gpu 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.210
 it's optimized
