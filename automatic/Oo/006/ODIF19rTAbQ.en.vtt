00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.500
 by good firewall as soon as I saw the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.750
 wrist basin scheuer boldi intello 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 ripped the boy actually i 'm a lot 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.670
 kindly he loaned us very willingly 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.039
 this is an invented duffel bag 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.390
 set up at $ 199 but will arrive 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.910
 also in europe 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.720
 two colors black or white strap 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.859
 in 10 colors and see the display and paper 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.510
 exactly like the pebble is malware 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.860
 ball with the most advanced so far 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.780
 sensors because we have in addition to the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.879
 classic accelerometer and sensor e 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.629
 debates also the possibility thanks to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.980
 these four electric sensors of 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.129
 measure the surface temperature 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.700
 of the skin and also the moisture you see 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.030
 we have if the heartbeat 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.739
 the steps clearly but what more 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.260
 interesting painting can be connected 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.579
 obviously via bluetooth to the smartphone 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.030
 to receive notifications 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.610
 unfortunately there are no applications 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.900
 for the web and therefore is not let's say 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.000
 answer from the point of view this is the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.920
 base to recharge it and that's why 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.210
 a small button enter the menu off 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.600
 then and set it is center and so on 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.470
 etc. but look how well done 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.890
 the application interface 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.780
 available for android or ios school 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.140
 the dashboard with the steps calories 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.479
 burn your heartbeat and here 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.920
 are the targets of objectives 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.570
 but goals that have evolved because of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030
 example is the goal of what I have 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.369
 worn as will wear 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.170
 the clock as slept as you slept 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.750
 las vegas is regular or not as good as me 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.720
 I am moved in short a lot of attention is 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.360
 was given to the active partner 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.330
 the application among other things there is also one 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.310
 a web web app then presents you to go 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.440
 on the web and check your results 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.180
 see here skin temperature 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.260
 average moisture calories burned steps 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.820
 obviously made this is a 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.490
 demo watch so it wasn't always 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.950
 however used a device is 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
 really interesting just for the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.830
 park sense richemont has in its interior 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.290
 and above all for a box that has a nose and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.490
 mouth seems to me in metal and above all 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.950
 battery life 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.440
 because it is an air ball with the autonomy of 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.610
 at least a week we'll try it soon 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.610
 will just arrive in Europe
