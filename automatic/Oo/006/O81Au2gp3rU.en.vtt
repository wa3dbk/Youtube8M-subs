00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:03.630
 nobody knows if on Mars 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.030
 existence of human beings 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.030
 but we can talk about something very clear 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.089
 in China 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.089
 more than 400 children are lost 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.679
 they vanish 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.130
 in United States 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.619
 everyday 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.449
 a thousand people are lost 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.560
 that vanishes in the air 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.879
 in all United States 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.730
 in Europe 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.290
 many people know their work a turn 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.680
 and nobody knows absolutely anything normal people 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.340
 they have no enemies 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.460
 that there is no tragic event 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.470
 so that they do not disappear in that way 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.470
 you find the corpse of a lot of bad people 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.720
 but there are many good people 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.720
 papal 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.140
 suddenly what a little bit of the night with lola the next thought 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340
 you are a strong person exist 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060
 a very productive woman and very close 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 he leaves his house for his job 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.210
 suddenly with some chemical 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.960
 it's sleep 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.960
 totally asleep 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.330
 you wake up in a white uniform 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
 with a kind of costume or the baseball world 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.150
 in a plane 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.860
 look around and only people whose faces are covered 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.210
 and they are dressed with those who move 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.680
 in your hands 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.200
 and you can observe several people who are going with 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.420
 on that plane 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.250
 then a center arrives 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.790
 a kind of cosmic song 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.790
 where there is a rocket an expert hand 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.580
 do not go through a site 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.340
 in a whole double room and your doctors rest are the ones that you do not 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.689
 You can see their faces and define them 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.039
 and suddenly 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.039
 he injects him not forcefully mature 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.119
 when he wakes up 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.609
 wake up others 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.609
 on another planet 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.249
 and on that planet there are other humans 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.369
 that they may be enslaved that they may be subjected 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.169
 they have to be working working 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.429
 for another group of people that I review 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.769
 and that is said to be in a concentration camp 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.769
 although it happened an hour before the session 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.669
 remains 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.669
 civilization parliamentary life as it was known no longer exists 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.069
 When there was a 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.519
 of that 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.179
 my friends is from the bank 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.549
 and wake up somewhere else 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.549
 totally different 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.719
 the pocket before 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.779
 living in a glass dome 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.079
 with other human beings 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.619
 barely dyn 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.619
 the Spanish at that time 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.469
 I'm sure my family knows 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.229
 you have no family 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.229
 as a prospect this end a family 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.799
 as a product and that you are 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.189
 this is a dream made on Saturday 8 and 10 days 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.319
 how do you know whose 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.799
 how can you prove that you 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.799
 how can you have a biden memory 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.559
 of a demonstration of something already mobile 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.649
 is observing a hostile panorama unoccupied 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.649
 another universe 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:07.649
 another planet 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:10.139
 do you think that will happen 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.159
 before your mind gets confused 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.470
 my friend we had it in Bogota in Cali and Medellin we know Colombia through 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.459
 of travel photographs of passengers 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.350
 we have a memory of what we are living daily 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.849
 that gives us information 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.909
 that's why he drives to the house and he's robbed of something 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:33.869
 the passive is left and you have no way of remembering what was stolen 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:37.680
 they lived what finally was 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.680
 to your been from the earth 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.240
 psoe can not verify I can tell you for everything that is false 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.310
 man I was walking the seventh race 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.080
 of valencia and the seventh race 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 BogotÃ¡ was destroyed approximately five months ago 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.650
 that district 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.970
 and it can show you images videos of an apparent listening 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.830
 we play with the mind 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.400
 this way of communicating it tended 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.330
 could not even telepathically connect with this one would stop being 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.210
 you 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.680
 it would become 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.870
 to people 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.870
 another planet according to convenience 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:27.979
 the groups that have 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.099
 multi 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.150
 millions of dollars 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.189
 and that can afford 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.199
 to create a similar planet with totally different laws 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.370
 those hypotheticals did not clarify 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.370
 part of the fiction 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.590
 2 the people who come planet is no longer safe mars 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.499
 and a great interest 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:53.499
 pro human beings would create other human beings 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.889
 that they would be educated in another way 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.909
 with another philosophy with another policy 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.879
 that they would not have information from the earth 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.899
 and worship elena its creators thinking they were gods 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.589
 and it would be another world for which eta had karamanlis the rich 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:19.650
 as gods 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.839
 with a slave amount 

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.999
 the world does not stop 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:29.409
 one would go to the police the prosecutor's office I missed a family member they would make a 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.969
 research they will never find 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.669
 my good level 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.039
 at two years 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.059
 they declared him dead really 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:39.789
 and the family are often 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.979
 somehow look towards the sky 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.909
 not assuming the energy the water 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:48.499
 but suddenly without 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:49.839
 that arrive 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.439
 somewhere in the stars 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.659
 these observations 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:58.949
 in the second time I was always macias from behind tells us that we love each other 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:04.839
 I can say that they were the ones looking for that has been kept with a lot of 

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:06.790
 our children and my family supports me 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.740
 from 9 in the morning 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.129
 in the different venues by alonso dreams 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:15.339
 A happy night 

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:16.629
 well I think about what they throw
