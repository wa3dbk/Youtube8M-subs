takes a huge amount of character to play

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.949 
takes a huge amount of character to play
that<00:02:11.940> badly<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:12.480> pop<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:12.930> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959

last-minute<00:02:13.319> winner

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
last-minute winner

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.580 
last-minute winner
but<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.239> performance<00:02:15.659> was<00:02:15.719> atrocious<00:02:15.989> him

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
but the performance was atrocious him

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.740 
but the performance was atrocious him
and<00:02:16.859> matage<00:02:17.219> were<00:02:17.430> both<00:02:17.819> appalling<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.629> it's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
and matage were both appalling and it's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.880 
and matage were both appalling and it's
probably<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.109> worst<00:02:19.349> I've<00:02:19.500> seen<00:02:19.560> them<00:02:19.799> play

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
probably the worst I've seen them play

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.800 
probably the worst I've seen them play
together<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.760> really<00:02:21.269> does<00:02:21.510> need<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.689> be

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
together so that really does need to be

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.420 
together so that really does need to be
addressed<00:02:22.049> in<00:02:22.349> my<00:02:22.709> opinion<00:02:22.980> they<00:02:23.159> should<00:02:23.189> both

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
addressed in my opinion they should both

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.280 
addressed in my opinion they should both
play<00:02:23.670> again<00:02:23.909> I<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.689> they<00:02:24.989> are<00:02:25.019> two

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
play again I think that they are two

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.630 
play again I think that they are two
good<00:02:25.530> there<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.859> there<00:02:26.099> too<00:02:26.250> good<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.549> they're

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
good there to there too good and they're

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.860 
good there to there too good and they're
too<00:02:26.730> important<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.209> they're<00:02:27.299> integral<00:02:27.659> part

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
too important and they're integral part

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.890 
too important and they're integral part
of<00:02:27.900> Chelsea<00:02:28.230> they<00:02:28.950> should<00:02:29.219> play<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.909> it<00:02:30.629> needs

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
of Chelsea they should play but it needs

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.020

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.319 
and sort of change the game so he really
does<00:02:49.590> need<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.950> track<00:02:50.220> back<00:02:50.400> look<00:02:50.700> after<00:02:51.060> look

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
does need to track back look after look

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.809 
does need to track back look after look
after<00:02:51.599> Carrick<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.109> hopefully<00:02:52.859> make<00:02:53.639> sure

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
after Carrick and hopefully make sure

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.460 
after Carrick and hopefully make sure
that<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.389> United<00:02:54.780> do<00:02:54.930> not<00:02:55.079> dominate<00:02:55.260> that

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
that the United do not dominate that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.440 
that the United do not dominate that
midfield<00:02:55.889> because<00:02:56.069> if<00:02:56.159> they<00:02:56.280> do<00:02:56.359> we're<00:02:57.359> in

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
midfield because if they do we're in

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.849 
midfield because if they do we're in
trouble<00:02:57.569> because<00:02:58.169> they've<00:02:58.379> got<00:02:58.500> players<00:02:58.680> off

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
trouble because they've got players off

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.520 
trouble because they've got players off
up<00:02:59.159> top<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.489> can<00:02:59.579> do<00:02:59.730> brilliantly<00:03:00.090> um<00:03:00.530> here's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
up top you can do brilliantly um here's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.259 
up top you can do brilliantly um here's
my<00:03:01.650> team<00:03:01.859> what<00:03:02.189> do<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.310> think<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.609> think<00:03:02.969> that

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
my team what do you think I think that

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.990 
my team what do you think I think that
this<00:03:03.419> team<00:03:03.629> will<00:03:03.780> win<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.930> game<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.290> I've

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
this team will win the game and I've

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
this team will win the game and I've
optimistically<00:03:06.000> put<00:03:06.359> Remy<00:03:06.599> up<00:03:06.750> front<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.109> think

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
optimistically put Remy up front I think

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.220 
optimistically put Remy up front I think
that<00:03:07.709> he<00:03:07.919> has<00:03:08.129> to<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.430> fit<00:03:08.669> dva<00:03:09.359> robert<00:03:09.810> has

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
that he has to be fit dva robert has

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.929 
that he has to be fit dva robert has
finished<00:03:10.709> as<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.099> chill<00:03:11.489> two<00:03:11.609> player<00:03:11.760> I'm

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
finished as a chill two player I'm

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.819 
finished as a chill two player I'm
afraid<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.359> said<00:03:12.599> times<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.439> the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
afraid it's said times but the

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.020 
afraid it's said times but the
performance<00:03:14.069> getting<00:03:14.370> smart<00:03:14.700> range<00:03:14.849> was

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
performance getting smart range was

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.809 
performance getting smart range was
atrocious<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:15.629> think<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.489> when<00:03:17.489> you're<00:03:17.639> being

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
atrocious I think that when you're being

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.229 
atrocious I think that when you're being
outmuscled<00:03:18.599> by<00:03:19.190> players<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.400> that's<00:03:20.879> Steven

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
outmuscled by players like that's Steven

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.300 
outmuscled by players like that's Steven
Caulker<00:03:21.569> it's<00:03:21.810> really<00:03:22.319> it's<00:03:22.680> really<00:03:22.829> not<00:03:23.129> good

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
Caulker it's really it's really not good

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.319 
Caulker it's really it's really not good
we<00:03:23.430> know<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.669> his<00:03:23.760> legs<00:03:23.909> have<00:03:24.030> gone<00:03:24.180> but<00:03:24.299> I

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
we know that his legs have gone but I

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.610 
we know that his legs have gone but I
didn't<00:03:24.510> realize<00:03:24.720> its<00:03:24.870> strength<00:03:25.109> akan<00:03:25.349> as<00:03:25.470> well

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
didn't realize its strength akan as well

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.710 
didn't realize its strength akan as well
so<00:03:26.099> we<00:03:26.579> need<00:03:26.790> Romans<00:03:27.120> planes<00:03:27.329> feature<00:03:27.569> because

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
so we need Romans planes feature because

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.899 
so we need Romans planes feature because
Remy<00:03:28.049> will<00:03:28.319> score<00:03:28.379> goals<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.400> given<00:03:29.729> and

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
Remy will score goals that is given and

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.729 
Remy will score goals that is given and
you'll<00:03:30.329> also<00:03:30.479> notice<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.870> I've<00:03:31.049> played<00:03:31.260> Gary

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
you'll also notice that I've played Gary

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.949 
you'll also notice that I've played Gary
Cahill<00:03:32.069> I<00:03:32.250> think<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.150> football<00:03:33.689> should<00:03:33.810> be<00:03:33.930> a

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
Cahill I think that football should be a

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.539 
Cahill I think that football should be a
meritocracy<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.739> if<00:03:34.889> you<00:03:35.010> play<00:03:35.220> well<00:03:35.430> enough

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
meritocracy and if you play well enough

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.129 
meritocracy and if you play well enough
you<00:03:35.760> deserve<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> place<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.449> team<00:03:36.629> Gary

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
you deserve a place in the team Gary

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.689 
you deserve a place in the team Gary
Cahill<00:03:37.500> has<00:03:37.769> been<00:03:37.949> playing<00:03:38.159> well<00:03:38.280> enough<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
Cahill has been playing well enough and

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.000 
Cahill has been playing well enough and
therefore<00:03:39.120> maintains<00:03:39.870> his<00:03:40.199> place<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.889> this

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
therefore maintains his place in this

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.189 
therefore maintains his place in this
team<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.509> think<00:03:42.509> it's<00:03:42.599> gonna<00:03:42.720> be<00:03:42.810> really<00:03:42.989> tight

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
team I think it's gonna be really tight

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.599 
team I think it's gonna be really tight
i<00:03:43.259> think<00:03:43.530> with<00:03:43.650> world<00:03:43.889> capable<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.340> winning<00:03:44.459> i

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
i think with world capable of winning i

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.219 
i think with world capable of winning i
wouldn't<00:03:44.790> be<00:03:44.849> surprised<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.329> see<00:03:45.449> us<00:03:45.479> win<00:03:45.689> but

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
wouldn't be surprised to see us win but

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.379 
wouldn't be surprised to see us win but
I<00:03:46.530> think<00:03:47.129> United<00:03:47.430> or<00:03:47.519> on<00:03:47.639> such<00:03:47.849> good<00:03:48.000> form<00:03:48.269> I

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
I think United or on such good form I

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.030 
I think United or on such good form I
would<00:03:48.629> take<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> draw<00:03:49.139> a<00:03:49.290> draw<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.829> good

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
would take a draw a draw is a good

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.280 
would take a draw a draw is a good
result<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:50.340> us<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.639> draw<00:03:50.819> does<00:03:51.030> us<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.750> works

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
result for us a draw does us it works

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.929 
result for us a draw does us it works
exactly<00:03:52.500> what<00:03:52.799> we<00:03:53.009> need<00:03:53.250> really<00:03:53.609> there's<00:03:53.790> no

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
exactly what we need really there's no

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.460 
exactly what we need really there's no
there's<00:03:54.209> no<00:03:54.269> major<00:03:54.780> pressure<00:03:55.109> going<00:03:55.349> into

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
there's no major pressure going into

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.990 
there's no major pressure going into
next<00:03:55.680> week's<00:03:55.889> game<00:03:56.009> against<00:03:56.370> Arsenal<00:03:56.639> but<00:03:56.939> a

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
next week's game against Arsenal but a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.789 
next week's game against Arsenal but a
win<00:03:57.180> would<00:03:57.299> be<00:03:57.449> fantastic<00:03:57.629> therefore<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.590> think

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
win would be fantastic therefore I think

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.469 
win would be fantastic therefore I think
it<00:03:58.889> would<00:03:59.009> tight<00:03:59.189> but<00:03:59.699> I<00:03:59.729> think<00:03:59.879> Chelsea<00:04:00.180> just

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
it would tight but I think Chelsea just

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.809 
it would tight but I think Chelsea just
going<00:04:00.629> to<00:04:00.689> shade<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:00.900> 2-1<00:04:01.439> so<00:04:02.129> let<00:04:02.729> me<00:04:02.759> know
