 four minutes passed and now I 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.400
 the microwave 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.020

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.600
 that we are going to take off and whistle 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.370
 while cutting agent we 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.360
 add a tablespoon of 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.440
 Vanilla essence to give a 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.160
 broken in like that again I'm put 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.400
 here and we will mix there for about 30 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.400
 seconds 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.320
 this personal dessert is of origin 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.940
 Portuguese is a hug always my 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.160
 friends of portugal who are always me 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.660
 asking for a Portuguese recipe, that is 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.769
 a simple version is a version of 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.310
 microwave 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.260
 the Brazilian has several versions of it and 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.060
 this is an easier version than you 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.100
 can do in your house 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.420
 without mystery something I finished to move in 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.120
 Brasilia here 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.470
 now I'll take it to the microwave again 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.720
 for another four minutes 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.630
 only when you give two minutes you give 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.150
 pause again and then take a 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.230
 microwave and shot break and left 24 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.959
 minutes 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.450
 So let's go after four minutes. 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.100
 here I have already taken my personal micro 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.930
 waves 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.150
 remembering one thing every microwave has 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.640
 a power in my microwave was 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.099
 exactly this time I told you 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.590
 however if you see in your micro waves that 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.090
 It's too liquid yet you leave more 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.129
 time leaves 5 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.050
 eight minutes until you see that you have a 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.180
 some liquids just not totally 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.599
 dry will look more or less this way 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.280
 here is a little liquid and you 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.000
 I think I've put a little of the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.980
 homes and you're ready and personal now 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.239
 We'll leave it in the refrigerator around. 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.739
 two hours 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.019
 How could you see that I put it? 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.530
 in tacinhas there is a little more 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.870
 here in our football will be 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.650
 now two rooms for January will be 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.239
 ready 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.099
 a curiosity also this dessert 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.630
 which is very popular in the Rio Grande do Sul 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.489
 and Minas Gerais 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.110
 then the embrace of my friends 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.120

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.579

 I put two dessert bowls 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.570
 I put the slice of an orange just 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.840
 to increase and look more cute 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:25.889

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.889

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.580
 of the orange has vanilla essence that 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.650
 Gives a break in the egg gets really cool
