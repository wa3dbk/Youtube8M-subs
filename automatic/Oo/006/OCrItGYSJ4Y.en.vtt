00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the combine is a reason for that um just

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.470 
the combine is a reason for that um just
so<00:01:02.219> teams<00:01:02.399> could<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> better<00:01:02.940> look<00:01:03.180> at<00:01:03.300> me

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
here because the injury a year ago

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.630 
here because the injury a year ago
you're<00:04:17.200> coming<00:04:17.500> off<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.829> no<00:04:18.040> I<00:04:18.070> knew<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.400> would

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
you're coming off that no I knew I would

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.699 
you're coming off that no I knew I would
bounce<00:04:18.790> back<00:04:18.940> my<00:04:19.630> once<00:04:20.019> it<00:04:20.140> happened<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.620> I

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
bounce back my once it happened and I

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.020 
bounce back my once it happened and I
started<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.130> work<00:04:21.310> out<00:04:21.430> again<00:04:21.730> I<00:04:21.760> was

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
started to work out again I was

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.580 
started to work out again I was
determined<00:04:22.300> so<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.720> was<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:23.110> was<00:04:23.140> nothing<00:04:23.350> I

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
determined so it was it was nothing I

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.870 
determined so it was it was nothing I
was<00:04:23.710> going<00:04:23.920> I<00:04:24.100> wasn't<00:04:24.520> going<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:24.670> be<00:04:24.760> the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
was going I wasn't going to be the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.180 
was going I wasn't going to be the
reason<00:04:25.060> that<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.570> came<00:04:25.720> up<00:04:26.110> short<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.530> guess<00:04:26.740> so

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
reason that I came up short I guess so

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.160 
reason that I came up short I guess so
I'm<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:27.850> knew<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.030> would<00:04:28.270> put<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.540> work<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:28.930> and

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
I'm I knew I would put the work in and

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.370 
I'm I knew I would put the work in and
put<00:04:29.440> myself<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.950> position<00:04:30.370> but<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:32.020> go<00:04:32.200> from

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
put myself in position but to go from

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.290 
put myself in position but to go from
sitting<00:04:32.680> around<00:04:32.770> early<00:04:33.700> second<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.120> late

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
sitting around early second to late

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.080 
sitting around early second to late
first<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.750> top<00:04:35.140> ten<00:04:35.410> is<00:04:35.680> that's<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.280> big<00:04:36.490> jump<00:04:36.790> so

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
first to top ten is that's a big jump so

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.980 
first to top ten is that's a big jump so
I<00:04:37.330> wasn't<00:04:38.260> expecting<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.860> big<00:04:39.460> jump<00:04:39.730> I<00:04:40.000> was

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
I wasn't expecting that big jump I was

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.340 
I wasn't expecting that big jump I was
looking<00:04:41.170> at<00:04:41.290> some<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.710> your<00:04:41.830> numbers<00:04:42.220> and

they're free they're good the one thing

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.730
