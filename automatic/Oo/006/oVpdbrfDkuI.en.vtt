you'll see it looks like a standard
varifocal<00:01:13.680> lens<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.400> actually<00:01:14.760> does<00:01:14.970> have

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
varifocal lens but it actually does have

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.590

the first thing I really liked about

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.930 
the first thing I really liked about
this<00:02:21.240> camera<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.320> anti<00:02:22.800> blue<00:02:23.130> technology

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
this camera is the anti blue technology

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.240 
this camera is the anti blue technology
now<00:02:24.570> it's<00:02:24.780> all<00:02:24.930> part<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.560> sure<00:02:25.830> vision

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
get me wrong this camera performed

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.770 
get me wrong this camera performed
extremely<00:02:34.950> well<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:35.790> low-light<00:02:36.240> tests

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
extremely well in all low-light tests

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.870 
extremely well in all low-light tests
but<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.350> was<00:02:37.470> really<00:02:37.890> impressed<00:02:38.160> at<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.520> way<00:02:38.730> it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
but I was really impressed at the way it

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.820 
but I was really impressed at the way it
cut<00:02:39.120> through<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.480> headlights<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.140> my<00:02:40.350> car<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
cut through the headlights of my car and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.000 
cut through the headlights of my car and
I<00:02:41.250> could<00:02:41.459> still<00:02:41.760> read<00:02:42.120> my<00:02:42.330> license<00:02:42.780> plate<00:02:43.020> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
thing I didn't like about this camera is

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.250 
thing I didn't like about this camera is
the<00:03:07.440> back<00:03:07.770> box<00:03:08.100> though<00:03:09.030> technically<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.080> can

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
the back box though technically you can

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.440 
the back box though technically you can
fit<00:03:10.440> all<00:03:10.650> your<00:03:10.709> wires<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.580> connectors<00:03:12.060> inside

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.650 
fit all your wires and connectors inside
of<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.720> it's<00:03:13.260> an<00:03:13.470> extremely<00:03:14.220> tight<00:03:14.580> fit<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
of it it's an extremely tight fit and I

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.539 
of it it's an extremely tight fit and I
wish<00:03:15.930> palca<00:03:16.350> would<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:16.650> add<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:17.070> little<00:03:17.400> bit

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
wish palca would just add a little bit

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.390 
wish palca would just add a little bit
more<00:03:17.880> room<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.390> make<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.080> lot<00:03:19.470> easier<00:03:20.010> on<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
more room to make it a lot easier on the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.030 
more room to make it a lot easier on the
Installer<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:22.080> other<00:03:22.350> thing<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.709> didn't<00:03:23.010> like

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040

Installer the other thing I didn't like
about<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.549> camera<00:03:23.820> is<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.870> during<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
about this camera is that during the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.440 
about this camera is that during the
low-light<00:03:25.920> testing<00:03:26.459> there<00:03:26.790> was<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> lot<00:03:27.269> of

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
low-light testing there was a lot of

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.570 
low-light testing there was a lot of
noise<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.170> images<00:03:28.590> especially<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.370> lower

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
noise on the images especially the lower

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.990 
noise on the images especially the lower
the<00:03:29.790> light<00:03:30.000> levels<00:03:30.390> got<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:31.370> when<00:03:32.370> using<00:03:32.670> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
the light levels got and when using the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.420 
the light levels got and when using the
anti<00:03:33.390> bloom<00:03:33.720> technology<00:03:34.470> there<00:03:35.040> was<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.160> lot<00:03:35.400> of

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
anti bloom technology there was a lot of

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.690 
anti bloom technology there was a lot of
artifacting<00:03:36.360> around<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.900> lights<00:03:37.170> themselves

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
artifacting around the lights themselves

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.160 
artifacting around the lights themselves
it<00:03:38.700> didn't<00:03:39.120> stop<00:03:39.330> me<00:03:39.360> from<00:03:39.510> getting<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.930> data

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
it didn't stop me from getting the data

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.960 
it didn't stop me from getting the data
I<00:03:40.260> needed<00:03:40.709> which<00:03:40.920> were<00:03:41.100> license<00:03:41.549> plates<00:03:41.820> and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
I needed which were license plates and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.330 
I needed which were license plates and
faces<00:03:42.480> but<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:43.110> could<00:03:43.500> see<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.890> being<00:03:44.190> a

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
faces but I could see it being a

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.479 
faces but I could see it being a
potential<00:03:44.730> problem<00:03:45.269> for<00:03:45.299> some<00:03:45.690> users<00:03:46.489> that's

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
potential problem for some users that's

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.830 
potential problem for some users that's
it<00:03:47.640> for<00:03:47.790> what<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:47.940> didn't<00:03:48.299> like<00:03:48.329> about<00:03:48.420> this

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
it for what I didn't like about this

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.140 
it for what I didn't like about this
camera<00:03:49.110> I'll<00:03:49.739> say<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.160> during<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.670> day<00:03:50.910> time

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
camera I'll say that during the day time

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.940 
camera I'll say that during the day time
testing<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:51.870> performed<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.829> would

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
testing it performed like you would

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.490 
testing it performed like you would
expect<00:03:53.070> from<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.730> 1.2<00:03:54.390> megapixel<00:03:54.690> camera<00:03:55.350> in

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
expect from a 1.2 megapixel camera in

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.979 
expect from a 1.2 megapixel camera in
this<00:03:55.650> price<00:03:55.950> range<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.910> was<00:03:57.120> really<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.720> sure

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
this price range it was really the sure
