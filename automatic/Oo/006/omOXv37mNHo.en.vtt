00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so not only do you scavenge some

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.450 
so not only do you scavenge some
otherwise<00:00:04.319> play<00:00:04.560> some<00:00:04.770> tape<00:00:04.980> but<00:00:05.190> you're<00:00:05.339> not

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
otherwise play some tape but you're not

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.290 
otherwise play some tape but you're not
thoroughly<00:00:05.790> shocked<00:00:06.210> in<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.680> cold<00:00:07.680> water

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
thoroughly shocked in the cold water

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.850 
thoroughly shocked in the cold water
then<00:00:09.300> once<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.960> steam<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.349> given<00:00:10.620> up<00:00:10.710> so

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
then once the steam is given up so

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.100 
then once the steam is given up so
mesquite<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.460> goes<00:00:11.639> through<00:00:11.910> here<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.480> don't

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
mesquite that goes through here I don't

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.289 
mesquite that goes through here I don't
know<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.410> saw<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.309> smoke<00:00:14.549> pot<00:00:14.790> yeah

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
know if you saw in the smoke pot yeah

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.599 
know if you saw in the smoke pot yeah
there's<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.109> venturi<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.190> what<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.400> does

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
there's a venturi and so what that does

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.120 
there's a venturi and so what that does
is<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.390> your<00:00:18.900> way<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> smoke<00:00:19.350> box<00:00:19.560> doors<00:00:19.800> close

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
is it your way the smoke box doors close

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.630 
is it your way the smoke box doors close
and<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.420> shoots<00:00:22.010> steam<00:00:23.010> up<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> stack

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and so it shoots steam up the stack

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.599 
and so it shoots steam up the stack
which<00:00:23.970> sucks<00:00:24.960> air<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:25.890> also<00:00:26.310> draws

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
which sucks air with it with also draws

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.970 
which sucks air with it with also draws
air<00:00:26.939> through<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.300> fire<00:00:27.599> right<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.590> actually

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
air through the fire right it's actually

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.070 
air through the fire right it's actually
Fanning<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> fire<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.090> run<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
Fanning the fire as you run it and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.530 
Fanning the fire as you run it and
there's<00:00:31.949> another<00:00:32.309> little<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
there's another little this is this is

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.670 
there's another little this is this is
it<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:33.930> that's<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> pipe<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> goes

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
it right here that's the pipe that goes

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.020 
it right here that's the pipe that goes
in<00:00:34.890> there<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> stack<00:00:35.700> blower

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
in there that's what the stack blower

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
in there that's what the stack blower
and<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.809> does<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.050> exact<00:00:37.440> same<00:00:37.530> thing

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and that does the exact same thing

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.830 
and that does the exact same thing
except<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.730> power<00:00:39.120> off<00:00:39.390> steam<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
except it just power off steam from the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.910 
except it just power off steam from the
boiler<00:00:39.930> got<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
boiler got it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.619 
boiler got it
so<00:00:41.070> once<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> first<00:00:41.670> get<00:00:41.820> steam<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.149> if<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so once you first get steam up if you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
so once you first get steam up if you
want<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.230> faster<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.520> open

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
want to get it going faster you can open

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.690 
want to get it going faster you can open
the<00:00:44.910> stock<00:00:45.149> door<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> main<00:00:47.280> venture

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the stock door so then the main venture

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
the stock door so then the main venture
it<00:00:47.850> only<00:00:48.059> works<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.660> animagic<00:00:49.289> they're

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it only works with animagic they're

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.500 
it only works with animagic they're
running<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.210 

so<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.989> there<00:00:57.140> any<00:00:57.260> purpose<00:00:57.559> at<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.829> time<00:00:57.980> to

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
so is there any purpose at this time to

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.040 
so is there any purpose at this time to
suck<00:00:58.640> air<00:00:58.820> over<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.149> boiler<00:00:59.450> Troy

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
suck air over the boiler Troy

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.020 
suck air over the boiler Troy

going through them transfer their need
for<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.290> water<00:01:09.409> but<00:01:10.340> here<00:01:10.520> anybody<00:01:10.880> could<00:01:11.060> you

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
for the water but here anybody could you

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.850 
for the water but here anybody could you
conserve<00:01:11.510> all<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.810> water<00:01:11.990> in<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:12.260> system

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
conserve all the water in this system

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.090 
conserve all the water in this system
theoretically<00:01:13.610> there<00:01:13.910> are<00:01:14.770> yes<00:01:15.770> there<00:01:16.070> are

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
theoretically there are yes there are

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.969 
theoretically there are yes there are
scheme<00:01:16.640> set<00:01:17.180> up<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.450> do<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:17.630> when<00:01:18.380> folks<00:01:18.650> do

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
scheme set up to do that when folks do

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.650 
scheme set up to do that when folks do
that<00:01:19.160> they<00:01:19.910> call<00:01:20.119> it<00:01:20.150> writing<00:01:20.390> conventions

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
that they call it writing conventions

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.600 
that they call it writing conventions
you<00:01:21.200> take<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.619> exhaust<00:01:21.920> steam<00:01:22.160> and<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:22.460> run

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
you take the exhaust steam and you run

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.609 
you take the exhaust steam and you run
it<00:01:22.700> through<00:01:22.729> an<00:01:22.940> adventurer<00:01:23.450> back<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:24.530> the

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
it through an adventurer back in the

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.290 
it through an adventurer back in the
water<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:25.009> problem<00:01:25.400> with<00:01:25.550> that<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:25.940> that<00:01:25.970> you

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
water the problem with that is that you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.060 
water the problem with that is that you
have<00:01:26.479> your<00:01:26.630> lubricating<00:01:27.170> oil<00:01:27.409> mix<00:01:27.619> in<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.890> -

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
have your lubricating oil mix in to -

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.520 
have your lubricating oil mix in to -
okay<00:01:28.880> up<00:01:29.210> here<00:01:29.539> we<00:01:29.750> can<00:01:29.960> see<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:30.350> on<00:01:30.470> the

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
okay up here we can see it's on the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.100 
okay up here we can see it's on the
inner<00:01:30.619> side<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:31.009> here<00:01:31.160> there's<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.399> little

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
inner side of here there's a little

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.570 
inner side of here there's a little
medical<00:01:33.110> lubricator<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:33.979> pumps<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.340> little

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
medical lubricator that pumps a little

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.690 
medical lubricator that pumps a little
shot<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:34.850> oil<00:01:35.240> ever<00:01:35.570> saw<00:01:35.840> in<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.070> steam<00:01:37.369> that's

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
shot of oil ever saw in the steam that's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.790 
shot of oil ever saw in the steam that's
it<00:01:37.910> will<00:01:38.119> easy<00:01:38.420> lubrication<00:01:38.660> today<00:01:39.440> there's

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
it will easy lubrication today there's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.350 
it will easy lubrication today there's
no<00:01:39.920> oil<00:01:40.210> or<00:01:41.210> anything<00:01:41.630> like<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.039> nitrogen

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
no oil or anything like that nitrogen

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.389 
no oil or anything like that nitrogen
yeah<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.140> in<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.350> specially<00:01:45.770> designed<00:01:45.920> oil

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
yeah so so in a specially designed oil

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.780 
yeah so so in a specially designed oil
that<00:01:46.610> will<00:01:46.759> multiply<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.360> mix<00:01:47.660> with<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.929> steam

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
that will multiply a mix with the steam

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.090 
that will multiply a mix with the steam
and<00:01:49.000> lubricates<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.750> piston<00:01:50.230> cylinder<00:01:50.530> so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
and lubricates the piston cylinder so

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:07.639 
and lubricates the piston cylinder so
that<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.640> present<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.180> your<00:01:52.300> songs<00:01:52.660> okay<00:01:53.020> so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
yeah yeah but steam pose do that because

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.060 
yeah yeah but steam pose do that because
water<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:10.930> at<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.140> premium<00:02:11.320> they<00:02:11.650> might<00:02:11.860> be<00:02:11.980> on

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
water is at a premium they might be on

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.470 
water is at a premium they might be on
salt<00:02:12.400> water<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.820> they<00:02:12.910> don't<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.120> any<00:02:13.270> cream

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
salt water and they don't have any cream

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600 
salt water and they don't have any cream
plant<00:02:13.690> cooling<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.410> free<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:15.130> cooling<00:02:15.490> is

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
plant cooling is free and cooling is

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.790 
plant cooling is free and cooling is
free<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:15.970> abundant<00:02:16.060> right<00:02:16.600> yeah<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.500> they<00:02:17.620> run

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
free and abundant right yeah so they run

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.440 
free and abundant right yeah so they run
a<00:02:17.830> keel<00:02:18.100> condenser<00:02:18.610> underneath<00:02:18.970> like<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.240> big

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
a keel condenser underneath like a big

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.570 
a keel condenser underneath like a big
tube<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.350> run<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.710> exhaust<00:02:20.920> into<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.400> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
tube and run the exhaust into that the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.910 
tube and run the exhaust into that the
other<00:02:21.760> advantage<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.680> you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
other advantage of that is that you you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.190 
other advantage of that is that you you
create<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.250> vacuum<00:02:24.490> right<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:25.570> so<00:02:25.810> now<00:02:25.990> you're

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
create a vacuum right and so now you're

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.560 
create a vacuum right and so now you're
reducing<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.220> back<00:02:27.790> pressure<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.330> would

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
reducing the back pressure that would

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.450 
reducing the back pressure that would
otherwise<00:02:28.690> like<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:32.650> get<00:02:32.770> more<00:02:32.920> power<00:02:33.160> up

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
otherwise like you get more power up

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.150 
otherwise like you get more power up
right<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:35.110> here<00:02:35.350> with<00:02:35.500> these<00:02:35.620> things<00:02:35.950> they

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
right but here with these things they

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.690 
right but here with these things they
didn't<00:02:36.400> care<00:02:36.550> they<00:02:36.580> would<00:02:36.850> fill<00:02:37.060> water<00:02:37.300> truck

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700
