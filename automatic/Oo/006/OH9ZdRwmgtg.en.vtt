come<00:01:09.550> on<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:11.770> can't<00:01:11.920> pair<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.700> anymore

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
come on and you can't pair it anymore

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.670 
come on and you can't pair it anymore
and<00:01:16.060> then<00:01:16.210> if<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.570> can<00:01:16.780> listen<00:01:17.050> if<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:17.530> can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
and then if you can listen if you can

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.850 
and then if you can listen if you can
hear<00:01:17.979> it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.700 

how<00:01:24.860> bad<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.090 

the<00:01:30.159> audio<00:01:30.520> is<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.150> can<00:01:31.180> hear<00:01:31.450> my<00:01:31.600> motor

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
the audio is and you can hear my motor

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.800 
the audio is and you can hear my motor
the<00:01:33.490> engine<00:01:33.880> Rev

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.889 

so<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.409> pretty<00:01:37.619> poor<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:39.180> again<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.659> can't

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
so it's pretty poor and again you can't

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.070 
so it's pretty poor and again you can't
see<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:41.759> being<00:01:42.060> paired<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.810> all

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
see it being paired at all

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.860 

so<00:01:45.620> I'll<00:01:46.040> turn<00:01:46.220> up<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.370> radio<00:01:46.460> louder

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
so I'll turn up the radio louder

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:57.660 
so I'll turn up the radio louder
and<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.260> can<00:01:49.380> hear<00:01:49.530> it

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.310 

so<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:59.619> wouldn't<00:02:00.619> buy<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.799> device<00:02:01.280> it's<00:02:02.320> it

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
so I wouldn't buy this device it's it

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.840 
so I wouldn't buy this device it's it
shorted<00:02:03.770> out<00:02:04.100> after<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> day<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:07.490> came<00:02:07.640> with

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
shorted out after a day and it came with

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.969 
shorted out after a day and it came with
that<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.330> came<00:02:08.599> from<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.929> from<00:02:09.410> crutchfield

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
that it came from the from crutchfield

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.290 
that it came from the from crutchfield
with<00:02:11.590> damaged<00:02:12.590> RCA<00:02:13.310> plugs<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.970> had<00:02:14.150> to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
with damaged RCA plugs that I had to

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.380 
with damaged RCA plugs that I had to
start<00:02:14.569> Reese<00:02:14.989> odder<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.380> replace<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:17.209> that's

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
start Reese odder and replace so that's

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.630 
start Reese odder and replace so that's
my<00:02:17.569> review
