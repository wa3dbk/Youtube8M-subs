00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.220
 the only youtube people from vittek today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.529
 I'll bring more life to you someday. 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.570
 today will talk about the cable charger 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.559
 usb that is all together here in the case of g2 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.619
 different light from the core 2 and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.199
 lg 2 light meanwhile let's leave the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.630
 set there resting for him to give a 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.050
 Sleeping ale as home unlocks it 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.460
 let's leave it there play here now 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.529
 Let's just stay here with a charger 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.539
 headset that is the focus of this video 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
 maybe for you and if this video is not 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.880
 so last for other people it's good 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.000
 It's extremely cool, we see the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.850
 charger is a standard charger 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.059
 Such an apparatus bears in a short time is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.280
 well, it does not mess up but what I wanted 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.910
 highlight about this charger is that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.710
 It is usb cable and charger together 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.210
 different from a device such as core 2 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.250
 I'll leave the same video I did 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.960
 about the description core 2 is to leave a 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.699
 The observation is that if you have a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.109
 computer you click will be 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.879
 directed to this video if you 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.790
 be on youtube on a tablet phone 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.220
 for the description and you can compare 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.670
 seeing the two videos he has one 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.830
 Charger is USB Charger Cable already 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.320
 another is not a fully charged charger. 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.950
 separate USB cable is then 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.600
 money is spent on pennies but on 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.560
 bulk sales can make a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.890
 difference 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.479
 ok then the usb cable is normal standard 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.509
 It's okay, you can connect the computer. 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.360
 only so to carry we do 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 The basic is connect here and place in the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.409
 bra and boot to carry 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.509
 already your headphones are black 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.150
 different from core 2 of the video are 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.369
 because I admire you when you see 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.799
 because white headphones despite 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.890
 be more beautiful as I really am 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.829
 they tend to turn yellow and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.890
 with mari colors gets dirty he cellar 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.509
 dirt more easily than not then 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.130
 the suit will not logically foul black 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.210
 dirty if poorly used 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.490
 but the black will disguise the maximum until 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.590
 be totally bad I think with 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.569
 a basic care he does not get to stay 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.970
 Bad plus a white you put in there 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.350
 putting it there it seems to cling to the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.690
 leaf 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.900
 it looks like he was born ready to oscar 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.090
 with it then it's complicated okay then he 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.940
 has basic extension is an extension 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.460
 nice here we have this little button 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.040
 which is used to stop the songs 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.500
 when you are listening and accordion 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.990
 duvidÃ¡veis qualities 10am headset 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.210
 simple quality only to bring 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.510
 a basic quality of audios not only 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.880
 between the only home is neither 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.600
 come close to those of the iphones tops 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.600
 apple 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.190
 then it's intraocular handsets 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.860
 as four notebooks do not come close 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.440
 so they are very basic qualities of 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.710
 Audio, we heard good, so nothing. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.210
 only too same to is because they are 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.100
 low cost part 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.690
 then just for the cheap what they do not 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.970
 resources and resources. 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.710
 resources despite g2 light me 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.270
 surprise then more than 30 videos of 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.320
 two leds only you click on the device 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.820

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.350
 observation are you going to be 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.670
 targeted to these lists 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.680
