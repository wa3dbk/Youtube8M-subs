00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Everyone loves me, yes, I had asked you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.589
 in the last video if you are interested 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.710
 So a sports video or maybe 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.570
 but only on a video what you take 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.660
 can do sport to lose weight 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.090
 and here is the video that is called today 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.590
 lose weight without starving and I wish 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.119
 you definitely have fun with it 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.939
 video and I would suggest we 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.140
 start immediately with the first tip 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.150
 really sleep it very very much 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 important and that's why I'm a person 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.050
 that sleeps for at least seven hours 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.120
 I actually always try in 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.260
 to sleep eight hours a week and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.230
 when sleeping, you also take 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.180
 at the same time so always nice into 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.399
 go to bed and sleep well early 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.550
 go and at least seven hours 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.280
 sleep actually curves tropical 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.710
 fruits such as pineapple papaya or these 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.899
 Whole tropical fruits stop that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.910
 metabolism and thereby burns 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.129
 Of course you calories much faster 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.960
 and it just more tropical fruits 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.260
 instead of maybe strawberries or something 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.609
 In any case, you will lose more 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.559
 it is actually proved that if 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.159
 a cushion is automatically one too 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.810
 decreases 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.240
 that means if you are theoretically back 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.650
 plays a German football such as 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.210
 last year at the wm I always have 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.680
 and I cheered and if you can 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.570
 in fact, then an increased pulse 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 when watching television you take theoretical 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.770
 at least a little bit off 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.630
 Maybe some of you knew that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 that at some point, for example, in fever 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.369
 or helps diseases and helps fever 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 actually even with fever sometime 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.939
 actually helps to lose weight 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.030
 because if you somehow do that 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.110
 or somebody makes food then 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.430
 brings sometime namely at the same time 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.710
 in circulation 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.360
 but digestion, too, is what you mean 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.119
 Of course you can do it well later and later 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.649
 it also takes a bit off when we do 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.720
 already with the topic digestion are then 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.030
 you probably know that coffee and 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.280
 especially espresso digestion guttut 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 That's why you actually take when you 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.329
 always a cup of espresso a day 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040
 also decreases at the same time by that 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.840
 the digestion is just cranked 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 the researchers actually have 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.100
 found out that one with the left 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.689
 hand less is that if you have one 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.979
 protection hut then you also can not be upheld 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.970
 with the right hand purely but with 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.650
 the left hand 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.009
 proven to be one actually 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.390
 thereby 30 percent less 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.920
 so if you have stress then skin but 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.050
 Just a chewing gum at work 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.090
 a gum really reduces that 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.730
 stress and makes him feel stopped 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.740
 less and at the same time if you stop 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.570
 sugar-free chewing gum chews then 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.340
 signals that the stomach is actually 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.260
 that here is something that is not so 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.970
 with sugar chewing gum but only with 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.440
 sugar-free chewing gum and then think 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.970
 expensive cars at the same time you have something 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.430
 Eat and feel by it 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.780
 in fact sata- and your head thinks 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.420
 Of course this is not so much in here 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.709
 you really should have hunger 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.300
 actually no one is silent 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.120
 but I read that play 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.580
 actually increased energy sales and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.290
 at the same time also the metabolism 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.630
 boosts and also fed faster 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.220
 Burning brings experiments 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.350
 actually that if we are now 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.750
 Illuminated like I am not so fast 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.360
 are like when we are in the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.390
 panel in food setting automatically 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.070
 stronger and now I ask myself 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.360
 but in fact then they knew that too 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.920
 restaurants are not yet modest 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.380
 whenever I go to eat somewhere 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.120
 except at subway or so it's always like this 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.310
 a bit dark romantic 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.810
 lit but we sell 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.700
 theoretically not that much 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.530
 I think you've already heard one 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.570
 always says if you slow down then 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.570
 one is also sata and it is actually 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.360
 so after the first bite needs the 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.040
 body 20 minutes until he is full 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.080
 that's what this is after this time 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.370
 means if you are properly reinhaut 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.200
 you probably only after 20 minutes 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.370
 the manufacturing feeling that occurs 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.430
 a little later 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.230
 that's why it really is my biggest 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.630
 recommendation and me as it really is from 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.160
 nature of automatically slow first 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.080
 slowly pauses 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.880
 because you are automatically after 20 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.340
 minutes faster than if the theoretical one 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.530
 have eaten quickly after ten minutes 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.890
 So you know what I mean 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.450
 just a slow grapefruit I think 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.590
 personally not so the berner but that 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.190
 I actually drink completely in 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.750
 order 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.090
 but it is really like that 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.370
 grapefruit by being so sour 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.720
 The Fed brings peace to peace faster 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.269
 ding it is actually recommended 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.260
 after eating a raid to eat with it 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.269
 the horse also faster again 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.829
 to be burned 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.820
 Apples actually swell the stomach 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.079
 I 've always thought when I did 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.269
 I'm the apple first too 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.250
 full and it is true that have 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.870
 I researched the internet now that 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.270
 If you are an apple, the man is really 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.610
 on springs and thereby much less 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.199
 Have appetite after that when I have chocolate 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.729
 then she must not eat before 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.710
 because I like that 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.550
 really cold things do not like so much 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.259
 but the researchers really noticed 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.539
 that if you like sweets for example 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.880
 which were located in the fridge 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.520
 if, for example, chocolate is the 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.889
 then chilled is the operate 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.150
 automatically the taste buds and 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.210
 you really lose that 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.550
 hunger feeling and the last tip if 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.190
 you have hunger then just take it 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.470
 a wish cummins bonbon what I 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.620
 because they are not so appetizing 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.810
 Anyway, our mind will find that way or that 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.320
 our taste buds and thereby 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.090
 he automatically passes on her appetite 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.710
 live that was s video i hope it has 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.660
 helped you and most of all hope 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.919
 Me too that I liked you 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.210
 link now mine again 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.740
 last resort was about the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.470
 Nutrition I have such a quarter 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.960
 shown and how I like sport 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.889
 and so on and hope otherwise 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.630
 Of course I like that video 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.289
 has fallen and until the next video 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.289
 bye
