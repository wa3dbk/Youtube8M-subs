00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.190
 professor utkin assistant today we 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.019
 we will shoot experiments by the way you 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.320
 you can't see me but now you will see 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.410
 as the camera gets closer to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.020
 us with an assistant about what the series will be 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.939
 and why the assistant decided to open his 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.939
 find business right after the screensaver 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.429
 dear friends as you see a colleague 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.719
 opened his business 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:44.199
 sell pigs part of them air well 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.940
 wish colleagues good luck for now 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.149
 tell you the essence of the experiment we have 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.030
 there are many stoves and many different stoves 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.549
 type of fuel what is the essence of what we study 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.629
 fuel is the most efficient which fuel 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.129
 per unit of time gives the most 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.429
 here we have the most effect 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.720
 each stove as you see a stack of iron 

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:11.090
 exactly with so iron and we are in each of 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.920
 distributors placed a certain type 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.830
 raw materials here for example charcoal 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.619
 here is an ordinary stick here Ifrit 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.500
 different tree types we want to understand 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:25.039
 is it true that different types of trees and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.380
 it is the trees they boards burn burn 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.490
 differently here with us 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.259
 wooden tools who can 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.750
 burn but in general you see everything yourself 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.319
 workbench music block and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.920
 bucket bucket words and it will all be 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:43.340
 moved by the funnels of the stove we 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.789
 find out what is the most efficient type 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.160
 here we just turned on the fuels 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.399
 night night as known friend of youth and 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.820
 now my colleague and I will click asynchronously 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.400
 here 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.080
 here I am on this button and a colleague 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.880
 respectively 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.280
 and from the distributors the raw materials will enter the stoves and 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:11.150
 the process will begin and so to colleagues about 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:15.910
 three times two three went fine here you are 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.910
 see all the stoves lit up only here 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.910
 oh well ok we will add now 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.610
 manually yes here's a colleague thanks added 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.000
 bucket of lava and the process went as you saw 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.340
 almost all hit at the same time 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.280
 except for a bucket of lava but that's actually 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.160
 excusable and unbelievable but fact 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.830
 for the most part for the most part everything is already 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.110
 only lava bucket burned and 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.260
 water these three three types of resources 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.250
 ebony stick charcoal and charcoal 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.100
 Now we find out what the result and what 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.590
 fuel is the most effective dear friends 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.110
 unfortunately some colleagues 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.959
 difficulty he had to shut down 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.330
 so finish the issue and one colleagues already 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.090
 we will see in the next issue itself smeg 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.459
 he went to prepare knowledge so let's 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.450
 short 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.450
 summarize the results of our experiment 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.510
 they are these results interesting enough 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.510
 so first first place first place 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.780
 we will come to the very end and now the third 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.880
 place third place efficiency plan 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.880
 gets charcoal and regular coal 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.150
 8 angel you will see it turns out 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.660
 due to use here 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.610
 here is this kind of means three place is 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.160
 Effrit stick 12 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.130
 from iron the second result is not enough 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.640
 bad but objectively speaking regiments 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:57.200
 iron on time get oh sorry 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:01.250
 ifrita get longer and harder than 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.110
 coal so a little bit further he 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.570
 is burning but I really don't know how much 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.030
 it is effective and first place first 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.690
 place unconditional first place 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.300
 gets 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:17.419
 bucket of lava see what happened before 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.720
 a whole stack of iron was shipped and from 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.850
 i will say that a lava bucket might 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.090
 probably still melt another if not 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.410
 a few more then 1 stack of iron for sure 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.620
 so of course the first place it at 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.380
 buckets 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.230
 words especially since it is renewable 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.870
 resources that is you take a bucket then 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.440
 then go to the source of the lava 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.210
 again fill it run and so 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.210
 further besides it is possible delov 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.699
 motivate and then generally cool you 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.290
 can you can just 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.970
 commercially do what 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.520
 want if sense melt down and 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.199
 there are plenty of resources in general 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.960
 short experiment yes by the way 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.699
 after the recording I remembered that the fence 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.210
 tell you about others where melted 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.070
 example about wood or wood 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.169
 tools so here are the results 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.210
 practically none because the maximum 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.550
 one ingot and now let's say a sapling and 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.070
 no demigod at all 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.880
 results on this in principle burn them 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.860
 it is possible but the output is the output by the efficiency still 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.100
 not a bit 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.470
 thank you for being with us today I know 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.630
 that many may resent say that 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.240
 this is wikipedia honestly say 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.889
 first came up with a release then found out that 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.650
 Indeed on wikipedia there is such 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.110
 information but we didn't just show that 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.470
 what is on wikipedia on search showed and 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.960
 proved it still matters 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.910
 so thanks to everyone who watched our 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.190
 today's release next series 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.570
 I will repeat it will be connected by snakes 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.570
 good luck to all and bye
