colossal<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.119> love<00:01:45.810> colossal<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.649> guys<00:01:46.829> know

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
colossal I love colossal you guys know

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.859 
colossal I love colossal you guys know
I've<00:01:47.490> made<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.939> multiple<00:01:48.420> reviews<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I've made like multiple reviews on it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.280 
I've made like multiple reviews on it
but<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.759> admit<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.030> colossal<00:01:51.329> isn't<00:01:52.110> for

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
but I do admit that colossal isn't for

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.969 
but I do admit that colossal isn't for
everyone

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
everyone

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
everyone
so<00:01:53.159> falsies<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:54.000> probably<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> number

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
so falsies would probably be the number

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.530 
so falsies would probably be the number
one<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> suggest<00:01:55.950> because<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.939> think<00:01:57.360> it's

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
one that I suggest because I think it's

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.929 
one that I suggest because I think it's
more<00:01:57.990> easy<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.530> use<00:01:58.710> colossal<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> little

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
more easy to use colossal is a little

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.030 
more easy to use colossal is a little
more<00:02:00.119> wet<00:02:00.420> whereas<00:02:01.200> falsies<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
more wet whereas falsies is like the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.490 
more wet whereas falsies is like the
perfect<00:02:02.399> formula<00:02:02.700> anyone<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.810> use<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
perfect formula anyone can use it you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.840 
perfect formula anyone can use it you
really<00:02:04.770> can't<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.100> wrong<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.640> other

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
really can't go wrong there are other

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
really can't go wrong there are other
variations<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.750> falsies<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.259> well<00:02:07.409> like

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
variations of falsies as well like

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.160 
variations of falsies as well like
falsies<00:02:08.099> flared<00:02:08.429> or<00:02:08.729> falsies<00:02:09.179> black<00:02:09.479> drama<00:02:09.869> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
falsies flared or falsies black drama I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.330 
falsies flared or falsies black drama I
believe<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.770> name<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
believe is the name and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.280 
believe is the name and
like<00:02:11.519> all<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.819> them<00:02:12.120> except<00:02:12.870> waterproof

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
like all of them except waterproof

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.869 
like all of them except waterproof
because<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.890> will<00:02:14.069> never<00:02:14.220> use<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.459> waterproof

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
because I will never use a waterproof

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.910 
because I will never use a waterproof
mascara<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.480> overall<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:16.410> suggest<00:02:16.560> it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
mascara but overall I would suggest it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.920 
mascara but overall I would suggest it

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
first the reason for this is so that I

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.580 
first the reason for this is so that I
don't<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:11.819> mascara<00:03:12.299> on<00:03:12.510> my<00:03:12.690> eyelid<00:03:13.170> when<00:03:13.470> I'm

bottom eyelashes you have to look up and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.220 
bottom eyelashes you have to look up and
that's<00:03:20.670> how<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.150> get<00:03:21.359> your<00:03:21.510> mascara<00:03:22.019> on<00:03:22.200> your

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.520 
that's how you get your mascara on your
eyelid<00:03:23.329> because<00:03:24.329> usually<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.870> top<00:03:25.049> mascara

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
eyelid because usually the top mascara

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.770 
eyelid because usually the top mascara
is<00:03:25.680> still<00:03:25.920> wet<00:03:26.069> now<00:03:26.639> another<00:03:27.150> thing<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.599> might

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
before do the tips of the eyelashes then

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.520 
before do the tips of the eyelashes then
the<00:03:55.489> middle<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.120> then<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.540> roots<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.260> very

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
the middle and then the roots the very

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.160 
the middle and then the roots the very
last<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.280> this<00:03:58.879> will<00:03:59.090> really<00:03:59.510> help<00:03:59.720> you<00:04:00.049> to

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
last and this will really help you to

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.259 
last and this will really help you to
keep<00:04:00.349> a<00:04:00.530> curl<00:04:00.890> just<00:04:01.370> in<00:04:01.549> case<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:01.849> guys<00:04:01.970> don't

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
keep a curl just in case you guys don't

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.539 
keep a curl just in case you guys don't
know<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:03.349> reason<00:04:03.799> for<00:04:03.950> doing<00:04:04.010> your<00:04:04.340> roots

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
know the reason for doing your roots

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.449 
know the reason for doing your roots
last<00:04:04.849> is<00:04:05.209> because<00:04:05.360> if<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.440> put<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:07.069> mascara

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
last is because if you put the mascara

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.920 
last is because if you put the mascara
on<00:04:07.610> your<00:04:07.760> roots<00:04:08.120> first<00:04:08.420> but<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.810> have

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
on your roots first but you have

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.410 
on your roots first but you have
naturally<00:04:09.440> very<00:04:09.650> straight<00:04:10.129> eyelashes<00:04:10.819> it

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
naturally very straight eyelashes it

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.600 
naturally very straight eyelashes it
will<00:04:11.900> become<00:04:12.170> heavy<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.799> then<00:04:13.040> they'll<00:04:13.250> fall

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
will become heavy and then they'll fall

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.539 
will become heavy and then they'll fall
so<00:04:14.560> usually<00:04:15.560> that's<00:04:15.709> why<00:04:15.920> people<00:04:16.100> like<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.519> use

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
so usually that's why people like to use

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.810 
so usually that's why people like to use
waterproof<00:04:17.410> but<00:04:18.410> for<00:04:18.709> me<00:04:18.859> I<00:04:18.889> hate<00:04:19.310> waterproof

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
waterproof but for me I hate waterproof

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.909 
waterproof but for me I hate waterproof
because<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.239> have<00:04:20.449> this<00:04:20.630> technique<00:04:21.079> I'm<00:04:21.410> able

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
because I have this technique I'm able

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.730 
because I have this technique I'm able
to<00:04:21.949> keep<00:04:22.190> my<00:04:22.370> curl<00:04:22.639> so<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.780> brush<00:04:24.320> is<00:04:24.530> shaped

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
to keep my curl so the brush is shaped

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.279 
to keep my curl so the brush is shaped
like<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:24.889> little<00:04:25.039> spoon<00:04:25.750> so<00:04:26.750> I'm<00:04:26.990> gonna<00:04:27.110> use

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
like a little spoon so I'm gonna use

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.070 
like a little spoon so I'm gonna use
like<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.680> inner<00:04:28.160> part<00:04:28.910> of<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.570> spoon<00:04:29.870> and

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
like the inner part of the spoon and

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.100 
like the inner part of the spoon and
that's<00:04:30.470> how<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.800> would<00:04:31.220> describe<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.789> and<00:04:32.110> put

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
that's how you would describe it and put

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.760 
that's how you would describe it and put
this<00:04:33.229> like<00:04:33.410> right<00:04:33.710> up<00:04:33.889> against<00:04:34.220> my<00:04:34.340> roots<00:04:34.610> and

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
this like right up against my roots and

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.010 
this like right up against my roots and
just<00:04:36.770> kind<00:04:36.949> of<00:04:37.010> wiggle<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:38.870> will

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
just kind of wiggle it and this will

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:48.370 
just kind of wiggle it and this will
really<00:04:39.350> get<00:04:39.590> them<00:04:39.770> thick

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:55.750

the thing that I love about this curved

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.840 
the thing that I love about this curved
brush<00:04:59.490> is<00:04:59.790> that<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.600> really<00:05:01.200> like<00:05:01.610> sweeps<00:05:02.610> the

brush is that I really like sweeps the

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.640 
brush is that I really like sweeps the
eyelashes<00:05:03.450> up<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.900> gives<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.470> that<00:05:04.500> extra

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
eyelashes up and gives it that extra

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.800 
eyelashes up and gives it that extra
curl<00:05:05.220> because<00:05:05.610> if<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.880> notice<00:05:06.120> my<00:05:06.420> eyelashes
