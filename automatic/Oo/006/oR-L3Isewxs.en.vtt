uses a shotgun the shotgun requires a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.110 
uses a shotgun the shotgun requires a
relatively<00:01:47.070> close<00:01:47.370> range<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.880> make<00:01:47.910> it

efficient and so the blood from each

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:58.040 
efficient and so the blood from each

only two specific examples with the
