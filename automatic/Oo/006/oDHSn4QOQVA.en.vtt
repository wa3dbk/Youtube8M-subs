00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
once you've got those ranges you can add

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.960 
once you've got those ranges you can add
that<00:01:22.780> into<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.049> circle<00:01:23.500> moving<00:01:24.010> as<00:01:24.220> if<00:01:24.820> you're

way down to the floor same exercise
we're<00:01:36.400> gonna<00:01:36.460> be<00:01:36.640> coming<00:01:36.939> down<00:01:37.119> in<00:01:37.950> closing

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
we're gonna be coming down in closing

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.710 
we're gonna be coming down in closing
the<00:01:39.040> Kinect<00:01:39.310> kinetic<00:01:39.909> chain<00:01:39.939> so<00:01:40.330> here<00:01:40.540> we're

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
the Kinect kinetic chain so here we're

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.330 
the Kinect kinetic chain so here we're
pawing<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.200> ground<00:01:41.290> with<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.830> hands<00:01:42.040> turned

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
pawing the ground with the hands turned

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.450 
pawing the ground with the hands turned
out<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:42.909> call<00:01:43.150> this<00:01:43.299> one<00:01:43.540> seal<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.500> the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
out we call this one seal and the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.160 
out we call this one seal and the
farther<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.790> move<00:01:46.119> your<00:01:46.299> body<00:01:46.330> back<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.990> more

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
farther you move your body back the more

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.670 
farther you move your body back the more
intense<00:01:47.500> stretch<00:01:47.860> you'll<00:01:48.189> feel<00:01:48.369> in<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.670> wrist

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
intense stretch you'll feel in the wrist

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.280 
intense stretch you'll feel in the wrist
and<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:50.950> can<00:01:51.159> see<00:01:51.400> that<00:01:51.880> Nick's<00:01:52.240> doing<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
and so you can see that Nick's doing the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.630 
and so you can see that Nick's doing the
modified<00:01:53.680> version<00:01:53.890> because<00:01:54.250> he's<00:01:54.400> straight

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
modified version because he's straight

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.830 
modified version because he's straight
up<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:54.939> down<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.270> I'm<00:01:55.360> doing<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.720> more

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
up and down and I'm doing the more

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.090 
up and down and I'm doing the more
advanced<00:01:56.110> version<00:01:56.470> because<00:01:56.590> I'm<00:01:56.710> farther

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
advanced version because I'm farther

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.999 
advanced version because I'm farther
back<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.780> depending<00:01:59.140> on<00:01:59.229> your<00:01:59.320> flexibility

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
back so depending on your flexibility

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.310 
back so depending on your flexibility
that<00:02:00.310> will<00:02:00.490> dictate<00:02:01.210> how<00:02:01.540> far<00:02:01.750> you<00:02:01.869> can<00:02:01.990> go<00:02:02.079> and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
that will dictate how far you can go and

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.609 
that will dictate how far you can go and
then<00:02:02.619> turn<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:02.950> hands<00:02:03.250> in<00:02:03.579> for<00:02:04.570> Bulldog<00:02:04.960> and

then turn the hands in for Bulldog and

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.350 
then turn the hands in for Bulldog and
again<00:02:06.070> you're<00:02:06.220> just<00:02:06.369> palling<00:02:06.820> up<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.240> down

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
again you're just palling up and down

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.419 
again you're just palling up and down
and<00:02:07.570> you're<00:02:07.659> trying<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:07.990> get<00:02:08.140> as<00:02:08.229> many<00:02:08.409> reps<00:02:09.220> as

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
and you're trying to get as many reps as

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.619 
and you're trying to get as many reps as
you<00:02:09.489> can<00:02:09.819> because<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.090> want<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.299> expose

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
you can because you want to expose

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.589 
you can because you want to expose
yourself<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.349> stretch<00:02:11.680> multiple<00:02:12.220> times

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
yourself to that stretch multiple times

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.309 
yourself to that stretch multiple times
so<00:02:13.599> in<00:02:14.129> my<00:02:15.209> 10<00:02:16.209> seconds<00:02:16.629> or<00:02:16.719> so<00:02:16.749> warming<00:02:17.169> up

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
so in my 10 seconds or so warming up

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.989 
so in my 10 seconds or so warming up
I've<00:02:17.469> gotten<00:02:17.739> ten<00:02:18.010> little<00:02:18.249> stretches<00:02:18.730> because

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:18.999 
I've gotten ten little stretches because

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:19.530 
I've gotten ten little stretches because
I've<00:02:19.120> done

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
I've done

and pawing actions all right and then go

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.880 
and pawing actions all right and then go
ahead<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.540> come<00:02:25.719> to<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.930> knees<00:02:26.079> move<00:02:26.709> into

ahead and come to the knees move into
the<00:02:27.040> elbows<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.849> basic<00:02:28.299> elbow<00:02:28.540> circles<00:02:28.989> you

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
the elbows so basic elbow circles you

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.649 
the elbows so basic elbow circles you
can<00:02:29.140> start<00:02:29.469> with<00:02:29.560> your<00:02:29.590> thumbs<00:02:29.920> facing

then fully extend moving in a circular
pattern<00:02:36.790> what<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.689> does<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.109> it<00:02:38.230> Prime's<00:02:38.530> the

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
pattern what this does is it Prime's the

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.699 
pattern what this does is it Prime's the
elbow<00:02:39.129> joint<00:02:39.310> get<00:02:39.609> synovial<00:02:40.090> fluid<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.480> there

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
elbow joint get synovial fluid in there

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.349 
elbow joint get synovial fluid in there
keeping<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.829> joint<00:02:42.069> supple<00:02:42.519> avoiding
