00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
well and he's an amazing player but I

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.020 
well and he's an amazing player but I
know<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.510> could<00:03:15.690> have<00:03:15.870> done<00:03:16.020> better<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:17.030> going

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
it felt to the viewers like I wasn't

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.250 
it felt to the viewers like I wasn't
even<00:03:26.670> trying<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.060> know<00:03:27.270> like<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:28.050> lost

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
even trying you know like I just lost

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.810 
even trying you know like I just lost
right<00:03:28.710> I<00:03:28.740> wasn't<00:03:29.040> doing<00:03:29.310> anything<00:03:29.400> pretty

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
I want to flame again and hopefully I

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.290 
I want to flame again and hopefully I
will<00:03:33.570> get<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.810> play<00:03:33.900> him<00:03:34.020> again<00:03:34.230> today<00:03:35.300> because

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
will get to play him again today because

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.640 
will get to play him again today because
I<00:03:36.510> know<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.660> could<00:03:36.900> do<00:03:37.020> better<00:03:37.140> last<00:03:37.410> time<00:03:37.560> I

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
I know I could do better last time I

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.050 
I know I could do better last time I
played<00:03:37.740> Emma<00:03:37.980> Kim<00:03:38.160> down<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.550> wire<00:03:38.700> he<00:03:38.910> beat

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
played Emma Kim down to the wire he beat

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.390 
played Emma Kim down to the wire he beat
me<00:03:39.180> three<00:03:39.300> two<00:03:39.510> last<00:03:39.780> game<00:03:39.930> last<00:03:40.140> round<00:03:40.400> but

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
me three two last game last round but

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.400 
me three two last game last round but
this<00:03:41.520> time<00:03:41.730> it's<00:03:41.850> like<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.300> don't<00:03:42.480> know<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:43.260> was

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
this time it's like I don't know it was

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.070 
this time it's like I don't know it was
just<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.670> know<00:03:44.820> what<00:03:45.060> kind<00:03:45.210> of<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.450> critique

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
just so I know what kind of a critique

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.480 
just so I know what kind of a critique
about<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.590> us<00:03:46.920> scenes<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.340> there's

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
about like the us scenes that there's

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.490 
about like the us scenes that there's
really<00:03:47.640> not<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.940> lot<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.360> high<00:03:48.750> level<00:03:48.780> Akuma's

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
really not a lot of high level Akuma's

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.080 
really not a lot of high level Akuma's
verses<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:49.890> maybe<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:50.220> Japan<00:03:50.580> was<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.880> lot

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
verses that maybe like Japan was a lot

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.240 
verses that maybe like Japan was a lot
of<00:03:51.210> Akuma<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:51.660> how<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.840> was<00:03:51.960> like<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.440> Korean

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
of Akuma so how I was like a Korean

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.280 
of Akuma so how I was like a Korean
Akuma<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.880> his<00:03:54.270> infiltrations<00:03:54.720> now<00:03:54.990> can<00:03:55.230> we

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
Akuma and his infiltrations now can we

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.450 
Akuma and his infiltrations now can we
compare<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.890> you've<00:03:56.460> seen<00:03:56.730> in<00:03:58.460> definitely

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
compare to the you've seen in definitely

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.370 
compare to the you've seen in definitely
filtration<00:04:00.180> Akuma<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.720> amazing<00:04:01.110> like<00:04:01.260> I

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
filtration Akuma is amazing like I

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.330 
filtration Akuma is amazing like I
played<00:04:01.620> against<00:04:02.030> -6<00:04:03.170> from<00:04:04.170> Japan<00:04:04.470> he's<00:04:04.740> he's<00:04:05.100> I

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
played against -6 from Japan he's he's I

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.010 
played against -6 from Japan he's he's I
think<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.820> my<00:04:05.910> opinion<00:04:06.210> he's<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.390> best<00:04:06.630> Akuma

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
think in my opinion he's the best Akuma

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.100 
think in my opinion he's the best Akuma
in<00:04:07.260> Japan<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.240> guy<00:04:09.240> is<00:04:09.300> basically<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.930> heavy

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
in Japan that guy is basically a heavy

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.020 
in Japan that guy is basically a heavy
vortex<00:04:10.620> guy<00:04:10.800> but<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.310> would<00:04:11.430> say<00:04:11.580> infiltration

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
vortex guy but I would say infiltration

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.180 
vortex guy but I would say infiltration
like<00:04:12.660> maybe<00:04:12.870> his<00:04:13.050> vortex<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.710> mix<00:04:13.890> ups<00:04:14.040> are

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
like maybe his vortex and mix ups are

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.390 
like maybe his vortex and mix ups are
not<00:04:14.370> as<00:04:14.490> good<00:04:14.700> as<00:04:14.850> -6<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:16.350> he<00:04:16.680> got<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.070> overall

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
not as good as -6 but he got the overall

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.550 
not as good as -6 but he got the overall
like<00:04:18.330> everything<00:04:18.870> from<00:04:18.989> something<00:04:19.260> like<00:04:19.470> you

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
like everything from something like you

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.960 
like everything from something like you
know<00:04:19.650> like<00:04:19.859> he<00:04:19.950> got<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.130> footsies<00:04:20.549> he<00:04:20.700> got<00:04:20.850> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
know like he got the footsies he got the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.850 
know like he got the footsies he got the
vortex<00:04:21.420> like<00:04:21.630> maybe<00:04:21.900> not<00:04:22.080> as<00:04:22.200> good<00:04:22.380> but<00:04:22.500> he<00:04:22.650> got

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
vortex like maybe not as good but he got

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.920 
vortex like maybe not as good but he got
a<00:04:22.890> really<00:04:23.310> good<00:04:23.460> vertex<00:04:23.940> he<00:04:24.540> got<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.780> reaction

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
a really good vertex he got the reaction

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.350 
a really good vertex he got the reaction
he<00:04:25.350> got<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.620> reads<00:04:25.830> he<00:04:26.070> got<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.340> setups<00:04:26.730> the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
he got the reads he got the setups the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.659 
he got the reads he got the setups the
look<00:04:28.169> he<00:04:28.319> studies<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.740> game<00:04:29.009> you<00:04:29.159> know<00:04:29.280> unlike

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
look he studies the game you know unlike

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.279 
look he studies the game you know unlike
the<00:04:29.849> other<00:04:30.120> players<00:04:30.449> that's<00:04:30.780> what<00:04:30.960> makes<00:04:31.139> him

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
the other players that's what makes him

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.100 
the other players that's what makes him
so<00:04:31.470> good<00:04:31.729> he's<00:04:32.729> just<00:04:33.419> like<00:04:33.509> the<00:04:33.599> best<00:04:33.780> player

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
so good he's just like the best player

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.480 
so good he's just like the best player
in<00:04:34.229> the<00:04:34.259> world<00:04:34.319> right<00:04:34.560> now<00:04:34.710> kind<00:04:34.919> of<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:35.039> for<00:04:35.220> Evo

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490
