00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.830
 making art back in detail and the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.559
 loops this doll here the hint of our 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.120
 Today's invited assurance to him hisses 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.730
 sumaré city 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.840
 How long did it take to make them? 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.730
 in this little dolls to count on 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.769
 Her appearance deceives looking to talk is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.779
 Easy né girls that the whole afternoon 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.029
 four hours make your cap four 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.580
 hours but also because I could because it was 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.740
 The first is we think that this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.780
 which was a bit faster then 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.010
 Okay, so personal but also the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.620
 staff that will do all the time have to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.059
 have patience have to be calm there requires 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.489
 much and even when we go 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.710
 create something is this even was 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.960
 The first one I did is got the project. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.059
 did the first so then you take the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 paper to put on the fabric in the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 easy is going to be fast because it is created 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.899
 a role but you go to the lady 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.190
 a little more because you did the mold is 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.530
 the people are watching us 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 accompanied with claret tv will already have 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.899
 available a template since the work of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.820
 break her head she dance slow 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.409
 Good people stopped well the moment you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 had finished making the strip 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.650
 I explained it to her 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.430
 Then I explained only the part of the head 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.110
 now I will explain the rest of the body 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.970
 the rest of the body is easy for people not to 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.430
 has secret will be the fabric is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.270
 working if it is the mesh this is the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.790
 linen is 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.280
 that was tricoline this is the linen 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.479
 I liked him because he is thicker. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.979
 well structured is already different and I woke up 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 it does not have to be hit because the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.140
 cotton usually we had a 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.869
 shawl such that ideal rock already provides 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.400
 Is it really different? 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.870
 here it is of the doll 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.700
 he is thicker is captured exactly 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.370
 finally you will choose what you 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.470
 Prefer to adapt your work 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.320
 you will pick up and normally pass as 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.360
 the other dolls here that I spoke to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.560
 margin and not forget for the body as well 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.110
 is worth 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.180
 There you will pass the seam in that 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.310
 feeling trimmed half a centimeter 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.770
 but for me we always have those 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.869
 the little work of the city at the time 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.840
 You come to not stay that doll. 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:18.570
 wrinkled here in the mold on the head 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.970
 it already looks like it's a glitch but 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.090
 no it's not people it's purpose it's for 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.510
 signaling the fit because the little head 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.210
 It's going to fit in the body. 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.000
 end up assuming does not show up do not stay 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.890
 this beak here why why he enters 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.630
 here in my head to study 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.780
 because it's a little absurd in us 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.070
 So not to get that crooked head. 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.380
 here in the neck and I could not hold it 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.150
 its structure this part will try 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.880
 help hold 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:54.330
 So this is it you turned it on full 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.670
 already approached the head all the little legs 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.730
 and the little arms have no secret sewed 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.920
 turned out filled 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.260
 started to ride her will do it 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.430
 which I explained filled his head in the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.349
 the moment you went to fit the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.650
 You'll put your hat on your neck. 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.959
 indicator there and tunneling I demand that 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.230
 fits acrylic bench to fill 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.209
 This one I used the silicone is why 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.940
 because the intention of this doll that is 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.400
 just for the child to play, right? 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.200
 so it gets a lot smoother child 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.750
 likes to sleep with a doll and he too 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.760
 antiallergic the marchinhas we go 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.489
 do the same process that we did 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.720
 here in the fringe that bastard around 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.540
 It's just that instead of us doing it 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.840
 we do it, I do the lion. 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.849
 Make a jump, it's no secret, little mouth. 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.739
 same thing is a water line 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.629
 only before you do it 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.849
 check mark with pencil to exit 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.629
 Okay, okay, and then it's just getting fatter. 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.420
 on 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.569
 the little eyes you put sinned election 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.970
 glue hot opa the hot glue I did not 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.920
 I really like her because she's usually 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.180
 black fair depending on the machine that 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.209
 you have working was not a 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.590
 good machine she falls a lot at once 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.989
 and I do not have to make you recover the 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.940
 This work is not smoother and 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.130
 you get a better look 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.560
 now if you have closed your head already 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.700
 Couture stitched in Buenos Aires only takes 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.739
 careful not to mix the filler 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.989
 along're just takes even the fabric're the 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.410
 companies you will only fit into this 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.080
 part here below for filled in here 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.410
 When I have untapped you will see and 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:35.180
 to fit a dog in the machine 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:38.389
 're the socks I've sent marking already 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.099
 This template I did everything in May 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.960
 the shoe like mine 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.570
 if you have done in the beauty filter already 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.419
 can cut direct from up to 15 years to 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.550
 I advise you always to analyze 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.289
 tricoline because it is 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.599
 she does not give elasticity when climbing 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:57.980
 because your leg is already full you do not 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:00.680
 will not be able to raise it or even rescue it 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.350
 there is no bad faith miracle is this so do 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.730
 in the mesh people this mesh I used is 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.010
 the one we use to make the 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.080
 sweatshirt fist taer my cinnamon 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.180
 then there is a legal effect of 6 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:18.770
 even in both the stocking and the shoe 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:22.040
 is the outfit part of itself that at 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.960
 instead of making that neck here I 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.300
 I only take this mold so far 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.070
 I can make half a centimeter more and 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.750
 I do not even need to get people here because 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.060
 it will fit inside the head're 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.400
 here I did it also in the mesh that I 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.900
 I think it's better to wear if you want. 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.810
 do in another text will 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.740
 know by filó can also be this 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:47.060
 measure of which is 20 centimeters 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.550
 length by 50 wide 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.550
 I'm going to make a belly underneath, but in 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.400
 instead of 150 it has 60 reasons why it has 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.530
 that you put the trim on top of the 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.210
 How will he be armed? 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.510
 if I make exactly the same width 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.820
 I will not be able to, but if you expand 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.860
 the motto is going to make the biggest doll you want 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.910
 get out more round goes like this always like this 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.640
 10 to 10 10 more than the bottom 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.700
 here people look it 's 20 cm up here 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.570
 We're just going to do an alignment. 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.870
 exercise the vu 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.670
 I'll put it on the doll 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.890
 so for a little while they're alone 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.500
 is starting to invest her and let's go 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.120
 take a break, we're going to a 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.780
 quick break the people back in 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.990
 sequence to pretend final will be like this 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.880
 The fight is to forget the dollar looks I go 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.640
 watch drawing for you is really good 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.710
 so the children are liking black and 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.390
 People come back because for their clear TV 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.390
 along with me soli silva tezza 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.069
 i
