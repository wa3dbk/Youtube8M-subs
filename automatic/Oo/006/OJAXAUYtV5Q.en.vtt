00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:09.060
 ok and at 311 terms and as you can see already 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.060
 I'm in 17 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.840
 let's put a little more brightness 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.840
 here 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.990
 we are going to generate information 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.260
 Y 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.260
 there is the 7 of the 3rd 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.840
 and so we can confirm in the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.800
 accountant 7 now if they want to go for 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.910
 back but if you do not like what the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.230
 sale although it has a bit of problems 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.640
 but it's normal if you want to see 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.640
 how are they like 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.320
 many things have changed but if 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.440
 they want to go back in you must 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.920
 update let's restore and like 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.059
 let's put set and we will click 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.240
 in restore 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.240
 and then we're going to have to 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.050
 search for 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.530
 613 nothing else we can go back in 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.759
 this time to 613 we can not go for 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.470
 back to no other version but the 613 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.220
 Now we can still restore for 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.250
 behind 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.290
 because the key has not yet left 7 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.900
 official when it leaves the jove 7 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.150
 officer in August and it seems that no 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.770
 we can go back and there is his 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.260
 team only that I think about it because 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.310
 so if you have any questions or 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.530
 if they have 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.470
 to a comment please do not go 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.659
 to put all the links for the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.539
 downloads 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.009

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.009
