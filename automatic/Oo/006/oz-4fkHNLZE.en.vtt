00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
should play your distance one you have a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.830 
should play your distance one you have a
2<00:02:06.149> which<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.810> should<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.350> player<00:02:07.530> distance<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
2 which is should a player distance to

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.930 
2 which is should a player distance to
you<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> beer<00:02:10.379> which<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.920> regain<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.760> of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
you have a beer which is regain one of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
you have a beer which is regain one of
your<00:02:12.060> lost<00:02:12.420> life<00:02:12.629> won't<00:02:12.810> actually<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.379> can

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
your lost life won't actually you can

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.550 
your lost life won't actually you can
make<00:02:13.709> anybody<00:02:14.069> regain<00:02:14.879> my<00:02:15.030> last<00:02:15.270> one<00:02:15.900> life

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
make anybody regain my last one life

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.050 
make anybody regain my last one life
point<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.280> allows<00:02:17.520> for<00:02:17.700> more

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
point so this allows for more

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.770 
point so this allows for more
interaction<00:02:18.720> with<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.080> other<00:02:19.230> players<00:02:20.780> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
interaction with the other players and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.869 
interaction with the other players and
then<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.410> roll<00:02:22.620> if<00:02:22.890> you're<00:02:23.550> all<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
then if you roll if you're all the

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.260 
then if you roll if you're all the
Indian<00:02:24.690> arrows<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:26.459> have<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.700> take<00:02:26.849> one<00:02:27.090> of

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
Indian arrows you have to take one of

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.320 
Indian arrows you have to take one of
the<00:02:27.390> Indian<00:02:27.750> token<00:02:28.670> from<00:02:29.670> from<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> center<00:02:30.300> of

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
the Indian token from from the center of

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.360 
the Indian token from from the center of
the<00:02:30.540> border<00:02:30.780> at<00:02:30.930> nine<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.290> these<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:32.250> can

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the border at nine of these you can

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.550 
the border at nine of these you can
still<00:02:32.610> reroll<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.410> take

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
still reroll this but you have to take

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.559 
still reroll this but you have to take
it's<00:02:34.769> it's<00:02:35.010> mandatory<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.670> take<00:02:35.970> one<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
it's it's mandatory to take one of the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.150 
it's it's mandatory to take one of the
tokens<00:02:38.750> whenever<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.260> say<00:02:40.620> for<00:02:40.650> example<00:02:40.830> you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
tokens whenever so say for example you

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.009 
tokens whenever so say for example you
got<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.670> know<00:02:41.790> three<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.269> these<00:02:42.420> he's<00:02:42.780> got

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
got you know three of these he's got

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.259 
got you know three of these he's got
three<00:02:43.500> whatever<00:02:43.860> if<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.489> wrote<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:44.730> example

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
three whatever if I wrote for example

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.229 
three whatever if I wrote for example
two<00:02:45.420> more<00:02:45.690> here<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.379> take<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.340> last<00:02:47.580> token

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
two more here I take the last token

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.720 
two more here I take the last token
which<00:02:48.930> triggers<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.830> Indian<00:02:50.069> attacks<00:02:50.400> and

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
which triggers the Indian attacks and

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.390 
which triggers the Indian attacks and
that's<00:02:51.690> mean<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.290> means<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.680> lose<00:02:53.069> as

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that's mean that means that I lose as

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.640 
that's mean that means that I lose as
many<00:02:53.910> Life<00:02:54.180> Points<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.080> number<00:02:55.349> of<00:02:55.470> tokens

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
many Life Points as the number of tokens

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.119 
many Life Points as the number of tokens
that<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:55.980> ass<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.459> 3<00:02:56.730> here<00:02:57.120> 3<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.569> entry<00:02:57.870> here

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
that I ass is 3 here 3 here entry here

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.149 
that I ass is 3 here 3 here entry here
the<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.159> characters<00:02:59.940> have<00:03:00.530> higher<00:03:01.530> life

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
the the characters have higher life

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.089 
the the characters have higher life
points<00:03:02.640> than<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.510> regular<00:03:03.870> game<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.470> it's

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
points than in the regular game so it's

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.710 
points than in the regular game so it's
not<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> big<00:03:05.459> deal<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:05.760> still<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.209> big<00:03:06.510> hit

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
not a big deal but still is a big hit

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.130 
not a big deal but still is a big hit
and<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:08.340> adds<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.819> risk<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.150> course<00:03:09.360> how

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
and that adds to the risk of course how

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.509 
and that adds to the risk of course how
often<00:03:10.319> do<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.530> want<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.739> roll<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:11.190> rolling

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
often do you want to roll a rolling

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.460 
often do you want to roll a rolling
exactly<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.569> then<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.080> Gatling

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
exactly and then you have the Gatling

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.280 
exactly and then you have the Gatling
which<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.980> last<00:03:14.220> icon<00:03:15.090> here<00:03:15.390> if<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.080> roll

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
which is the last icon here if you roll

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.979 
which is the last icon here if you roll
it<00:03:16.580> three<00:03:17.580> times<00:03:17.790> if<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.510> roll<00:03:18.629> a<00:03:18.659> set<00:03:18.870> of

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
it three times if you roll a set of

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.380 
it three times if you roll a set of
three<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.980> first<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.700> all<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.819> heat<00:03:21.090> all<00:03:21.330> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
three you first of all you heat all the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.930 
three you first of all you heat all the
other<00:03:21.690> players<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:23.010> know<00:03:23.099> you<00:03:23.159> shoot<00:03:23.670> all

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
other players for you know you shoot all

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.759 
other players for you know you shoot all
the<00:03:24.120> other<00:03:24.239> players<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.659> you<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.080> get<00:03:25.290> rid<00:03:25.530> of

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
the other players and you can get rid of

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.090 
the other players and you can get rid of
the<00:03:26.129> Indian<00:03:26.430> tokens

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
the Indian tokens

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.220 
the Indian tokens
so<00:03:27.700> there<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.030> counter<00:03:28.300> mechanics<00:03:29.140> that

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
so there is a counter mechanics that

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.310 
so there is a counter mechanics that
allows<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.740> to<00:03:29.800> discard<00:03:30.310> them<00:03:31.020> characters<00:03:32.020> Oh

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
allows you to discard them characters Oh

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.430 
allows you to discard them characters Oh
as<00:03:32.740> I<00:03:33.310> said<00:03:33.640> before<00:03:33.720> mess<00:03:34.720> up<00:03:34.870> with<00:03:35.140> all<00:03:35.290> this

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
as I said before mess up with all this

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.480 
as I said before mess up with all this
rules<00:03:35.740> so<00:03:36.360> for<00:03:37.360> example<00:03:37.710> slap<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:38.860> killer<00:03:39.160> has

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
rules so for example slap the killer has

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.950 
rules so for example slap the killer has
the<00:03:39.640> possibility<00:03:39.820> of<00:03:40.210> triggering<00:03:40.720> the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
the possibility of triggering the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960 
the possibility of triggering the
Gatling<00:03:41.350> with<00:03:41.530> only<00:03:41.680> two<00:03:42.100> dice<00:03:42.310> instead<00:03:42.880> of

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
Gatling with only two dice instead of

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.280 
Gatling with only two dice instead of
three<00:03:43.270> you<00:03:43.900> know<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.980> usual<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.610> know<00:03:46.290> bits

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
three you know the usual you know bits

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.290 
three you know the usual you know bits
and<00:03:47.500> pieces<00:03:47.800> that<00:03:47.830> goes<00:03:48.490> with<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.820> widow<00:03:49.030> dice

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
and pieces that goes with the widow dice

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.870 
and pieces that goes with the widow dice
rolling<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.990> it's<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:50.830> real<00:03:51.070> player<00:03:51.550> count

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
rolling and it's it's real player count

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.570 
rolling and it's it's real player count
is<00:03:52.240> three<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.720> seven<00:03:53.050> yeah<00:03:53.590> as<00:03:53.860> in<00:03:54.580> base<00:03:54.730> 327

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
is three to seven yeah as in base 327

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.280 
is three to seven yeah as in base 327
actually<00:03:57.580> norm<00:03:57.760> is<00:03:57.970> for<00:03:58.240> maybe<00:03:58.480> four<00:03:58.810> that

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
actually norm is for maybe four that
