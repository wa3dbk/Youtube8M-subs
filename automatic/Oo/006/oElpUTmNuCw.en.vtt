00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
areas where we are or AT&amp;T might be

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.590 
areas where we are or AT&amp;T might be
better<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.680> use<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.610> iPad<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.479> we

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
better so then we use the iPad and we

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.770 
better so then we use the iPad and we
make<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.020> into<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> Wi-Fi<00:01:20.130> hotspot<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.600> do

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
make it into a Wi-Fi hotspot and you do

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.469 
make it into a Wi-Fi hotspot and you do
that<00:01:21.930> by<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> settings<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:26.479> somewhere
