00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
a joke sometimes this game you know you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.750 
a joke sometimes this game you know you
can<00:02:48.720> play<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.140> well<00:02:49.410> as<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.680> possibly<00:02:49.890> can<00:02:50.310> but

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
can play as well as you possibly can but

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.430 
can play as well as you possibly can but
you<00:02:50.850> can<00:02:50.970> still<00:02:51.180> come<00:02:51.330> out<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.480> loser<00:02:51.840> which<00:02:52.260> is

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
you can still come out a loser which is

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.620 
you can still come out a loser which is
just<00:02:52.680> very<00:02:52.830> very<00:02:52.950> frustrating<00:02:53.850> anyway<00:02:54.420> that

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
just very very frustrating anyway that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.000 
just very very frustrating anyway that
is<00:02:54.750> only<00:02:54.930> our<00:02:55.110> fourth<00:02:55.350> loss<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.770> account

realize<00:04:06.510> because<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:06.900> only<00:04:07.020> ever<00:04:07.200> look<00:04:07.500> at<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
realize because I only ever look at the

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.110 
realize because I only ever look at the
player<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.340> I'm<00:04:08.430> adding<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.880> team

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
player that I'm adding to the team

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.820 
player that I'm adding to the team
because<00:04:09.630> everyone<00:04:09.959> else's<00:04:10.290> kit<00:04:10.500> numbers

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
because everyone else's kit numbers

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.930 
because everyone else's kit numbers
should<00:04:11.010> be<00:04:11.040> right<00:04:11.340> because<00:04:11.580> they<00:04:11.700> shouldn't

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
should be right because they shouldn't

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.910 
should be right because they shouldn't
change<00:04:12.150> but<00:04:12.570> somehow<00:04:12.810> bail<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.650> right<00:04:13.830> now

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
change but somehow bail and right now

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.650 
change but somehow bail and right now
those<00:04:14.130> numbers<00:04:14.520> are<00:04:14.640> wrong<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:15.030> think<00:04:15.270> Ronaldo

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
those numbers are wrong I think Ronaldo

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.820 
those numbers are wrong I think Ronaldo

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.369 
ester in there he's not on full chem
because<00:06:50.339> he's<00:06:50.459> at<00:06:50.610> CDM<00:06:50.999> and<00:06:51.300> well<00:06:51.659> it's<00:06:52.139> not<00:06:52.319> on

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
because he's at CDM and well it's not on

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.109 
because he's at CDM and well it's not on
the<00:06:52.439> fact<00:06:52.619> that<00:06:52.649> scene<00:06:53.039> um<00:06:53.189> but<00:06:53.339> he's<00:06:53.429> got<00:06:53.610> four

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:54.119 
the fact that scene um but he's got four

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:55.489 
the fact that scene um but he's got four
three<00:06:54.449> dead<00:06:54.629> links<00:06:54.839> going<00:06:55.080> into<00:06:55.319> them<00:06:55.439> and

00:06:55.489 --> 00:06:55.499 
three dead links going into them and

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:57.320 
three dead links going into them and
only<00:06:55.619> a<00:06:56.009> strong<00:06:56.489> link<00:06:56.639> coming<00:06:56.909> in<00:06:56.999> to<00:06:57.089> him<00:06:57.209> from

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
only a strong link coming in to him from

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.879 
only a strong link coming in to him from
Sergio<00:06:57.689> Ramos<00:06:57.899> so<00:06:58.169> definitely<00:06:58.499> not<00:06:58.559> on<00:06:58.709> full

00:06:58.879 --> 00:06:58.889 
Sergio Ramos so definitely not on full

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:00.649 
Sergio Ramos so definitely not on full
chem<00:06:59.129> but<00:06:59.489> unfortunately<00:07:00.059> we<00:07:00.149> go<00:07:00.300> behind

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:00.659 
chem but unfortunately we go behind

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:02.719 
chem but unfortunately we go behind
again<00:07:01.199> I<00:07:01.529> think<00:07:01.830> this<00:07:02.009> is<00:07:02.159> the<00:07:02.219> third<00:07:02.459> game<00:07:02.489> in

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
again I think this is the third game in

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:04.219 
again I think this is the third game in
the<00:07:02.879> row<00:07:03.059> that<00:07:03.209> we<00:07:03.300> end<00:07:03.479> up<00:07:03.629> going<00:07:03.809> behind

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
the row that we end up going behind

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:06.439 
the row that we end up going behind
first<00:07:04.499> maybe<00:07:04.860> not<00:07:05.099> maybe<00:07:05.339> not<00:07:05.459> but<00:07:05.759> anyway<00:07:06.209> and

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
first maybe not maybe not but anyway and

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.659 
first maybe not maybe not but anyway and
we<00:07:06.869> are<00:07:07.050> you<00:07:07.439> know<00:07:07.559> struggling<00:07:08.009> to<00:07:08.249> get<00:07:08.639> a

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:08.669 
we are you know struggling to get a

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:10.249 
we are you know struggling to get a
result<00:07:08.879> in<00:07:09.179> this<00:07:09.330> game<00:07:09.539> but<00:07:09.929> fortunately

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 
result in this game but fortunately

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:12.919 
result in this game but fortunately
Benza<00:07:10.649> managed<00:07:10.919> to<00:07:11.159> scoop<00:07:12.149> stir<00:07:12.449> through<00:07:12.719> two

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:12.929 
Benza managed to scoop stir through two

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:14.089 
Benza managed to scoop stir through two
of<00:07:13.050> his<00:07:13.139> players<00:07:13.439> ridding<00:07:13.709> nice<00:07:13.830> goal

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:14.099 
of his players ridding nice goal

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.679 
of his players ridding nice goal
actually<00:07:14.339> and<00:07:14.699> then<00:07:14.999> we<00:07:15.059> managed<00:07:15.330> to<00:07:15.360> score<00:07:15.539> a

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:15.689 
actually and then we managed to score a

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:17.239 
actually and then we managed to score a
second<00:07:16.050> goal<00:07:16.199> this<00:07:16.349> time<00:07:16.409> I<00:07:16.559> think<00:07:16.769> was<00:07:16.860> either

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:17.249 
second goal this time I think was either

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:19.070 
second goal this time I think was either
Benjamin<00:07:17.759> or<00:07:17.849> Pepe<00:07:18.209> that<00:07:18.419> managed<00:07:18.629> to<00:07:18.689> score

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
Benjamin or Pepe that managed to score

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.139 
Benjamin or Pepe that managed to score
that<00:07:19.289> one<00:07:19.499> to<00:07:19.889> make<00:07:20.009> it<00:07:20.069> to<00:07:20.189> 1<00:07:20.519> and<00:07:20.639> then<00:07:21.119> we

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:21.149 
that one to make it to 1 and then we

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.689 
that one to make it to 1 and then we
managed<00:07:21.569> to<00:07:21.629> Tramp<00:07:21.959> him<00:07:22.139> in<00:07:22.319> the<00:07:22.649> 56<00:07:23.429> minutes

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 
managed to Tramp him in the 56 minutes

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:25.309 
managed to Tramp him in the 56 minutes
to<00:07:23.759> make<00:07:23.879> it<00:07:24.029> 3-1<00:07:24.209> and<00:07:24.629> that<00:07:24.749> is<00:07:24.899> how<00:07:25.050> the<00:07:25.110> game

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 
to make it 3-1 and that is how the game

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:26.899 
to make it 3-1 and that is how the game
ends<00:07:25.800> so<00:07:25.979> well<00:07:26.159> done<00:07:26.309> to<00:07:26.369> the<00:07:26.490> team

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:26.909 
ends so well done to the team

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:28.489 
ends so well done to the team
