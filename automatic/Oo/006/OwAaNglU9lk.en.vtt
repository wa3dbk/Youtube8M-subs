00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello everyone I'm 337 and today I bring you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.250
 a video that many people have asked me and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.369
 is how to optimize the PC for games without 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.219
 good programs let's start the first 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:16.529
 What we are going to do is activate the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.960
 multicore processor cores that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.740
 By default, they are deactivated 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.929
 well first we went down to the start menu 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.559
 we give right click initial administer 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:33.420
 of tasks we go to file and execute 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:36.510
 new task here we copy ms config 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.030
 we are going to accept you here we go to the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.550
 start tab and we select the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.370
 operating system that we use in which 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.890
 we want to apply the true change and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.619
 we give advanced options here activate 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.269
 the number tab of processors and 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.460
 we select the ones we have 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.579
 I in my case have 2 only active 2 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.199
 because if not I would only give 1 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.030
 regardless if they have 8 or 16 only 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.000
 would use 1 then here we activate the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.170
 number of presidents that we have ready 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.730
 here we go to the services tab 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.370
 we click on hide all services 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.320
 from microsoft and here we deactivate all 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.460
 the services that we do not use or that is what 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.250
 is not indispensable 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.020
 with that we released a little more ram 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.580
 so that it is available for 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.560
 Applications 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.100
 right here at windows start we do 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.530
 the same as what we did now and apply 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.330
 in applying and going to request restart what 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.150
 restart if you want to notice the change or 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.480
 I hope you do everything 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.340
 ready the second step would be to go to panel 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.759
 control system 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.469
 advanced configuration and performance 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.750
 here what we are going to do is deactivate 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.270
 all the effects of the desktop and the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.450
 start menu so there's more more 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.069
 video memory and ram we explain in 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.270
 adjust to have better performance 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.789
 ready 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.829
 well this other step is recommended 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.240
 for people who have laptops 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.250
 those who have desktop sets 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.860
 they will not notice much change with this 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.800
 step but on laptops and it shows a lot 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.310
 the difference 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.430
 let's put control on let's go to energy 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.040
 energy options and we click on high 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.810
 performance 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.359
 with this we are going to make the computer 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.920
 works to the maximum without taking into account the 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.689
 light or energy are more than all 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.219
 portable but still in the 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.609
 desktop computers it shows the 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:32.280
 change ready the next step is going to be 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:35.790
 change the desktop resolution to 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.799
 16 bits this is why this step is 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.390
 recommended for those who have a card 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.400
 integrated those who have a card 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.349
 video is not necessary clear that what 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.840
 they can do if they want to increase a bit 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.280
 the performance when I had the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.650
 integrated 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.709
 and change the resolution of the writing 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.740
 6-bit note that the card the card 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.930
 without any program on top I used 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.819
 30% yield and when 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.920
 place to 16 bits I got 9 on 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.459
 hundred what does that mean that is 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.530
 more than everything in integrated plates ready 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.319
 here we select the resolution that 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.090
 we had before it is this but the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.970
 we search in 16 bits with the same 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.770
 exercises we accept and apply that I 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.120
 I can not do it here because it hurts me 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.879
 video 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.930
 did another step is to erase all 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.220
 temporary windows and in programs 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.819
 we do the same and start the 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.480
 manage tasks file execute and 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.760
 we copy pre sets 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.040
 prefect how they see it 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.910
 we give in accepting tells us not to 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.250
 have permits but let's continue 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.630
 he says he will load this 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.010
 are generally the programs that 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.840
 they charge in memory then we go to 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.510
 select everything and we will eliminate it 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.720
 and ready 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.579
 another place where there are many storms and 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.069
 slowing down the computer would be in the 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.530
 users click on the root hard drive 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.799
 in my case we're going to users 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.290
 in my case to catherine we search in app 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.660
 data 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.250
 local 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.400
 and we eliminate only that inside 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.780
 ready there is always a file that is not 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.230
 eliminate what is the record of 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.000
 windows but that's not important 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.940
 ready for now these are all 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.520
 steps if you liked the video subscribe 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.800
 I like favorites and I'm going to make a 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.650
 second part that is with programs for 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.810
 that is much faster and I am 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.810
 I speak to 337 and until next time
