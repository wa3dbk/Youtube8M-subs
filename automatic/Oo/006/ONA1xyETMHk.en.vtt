00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
think of that a man I think that's the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.890 
think of that a man I think that's the
only<00:03:13.670> way<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.030> he<00:03:14.180> can<00:03:14.360> win<00:03:14.420> his<00:03:14.720> fight<00:03:14.840> I

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
only way that he can win his fight I

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.510 
only way that he can win his fight I
think<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:15.350> was<00:03:15.440> good<00:03:15.620> construction<00:03:16.040> he's

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
think it was good construction he's

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.800 
think it was good construction he's
going<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.790> take<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:16.970> risk<00:03:17.240> of<00:03:17.390> getting<00:03:17.570> hit

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
going to take the risk of getting hit

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.840 
going to take the risk of getting hit
but<00:03:17.960> he's<00:03:18.110> going<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.380> get<00:03:18.470> hit<00:03:18.620> anyway<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.640> the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
but he's going to get hit anyway so the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.340 
but he's going to get hit anyway so the
best<00:03:20.060> thing<00:03:20.270> he<00:03:20.300> can<00:03:20.510> do<00:03:20.690> is<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.930> pick<00:03:21.110> up<00:03:21.260> the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
best thing he can do is to pick up the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.250 
best thing he can do is to pick up the
tempo<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.120> hopefully<00:03:23.120> get<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.870> round<00:03:24.050> up<00:03:24.140> the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
tempo and hopefully get to round up the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.680 
tempo and hopefully get to round up the
fight<00:03:24.500> at<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:24.920> faster<00:03:25.550> pace<00:03:25.580> than<00:03:25.880> he's<00:03:26.360> used<00:03:26.600> to
