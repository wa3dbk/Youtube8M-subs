hey guys I got an unboxing for you today
this<00:00:09.820> these<00:00:10.179> are<00:00:10.450> the<00:00:10.900> 8<00:00:11.260> inch<00:00:11.590> subwoofers

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629 
this these are the 8 inch subwoofers

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.209 
this these are the 8 inch subwoofers
that<00:00:13.629> I<00:00:13.750> just<00:00:13.930> got<00:00:14.139> my<00:00:14.529> Rockford<00:00:15.039> Fosgate

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
that I just got my Rockford Fosgate

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.080 
that I just got my Rockford Fosgate
these<00:00:16.029> are<00:00:16.330> the<00:00:16.539> punch<00:00:16.869> stage<00:00:17.380> 2<00:00:17.830> and<00:00:18.220> I<00:00:18.850> got

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
these are the punch stage 2 and I got

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.650 
these are the punch stage 2 and I got
the<00:00:19.470> 2<00:00:20.470> own<00:00:20.710> version<00:00:21.460> so<00:00:22.060> these<00:00:22.240> are<00:00:22.419> dual

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
the 2 own version so these are dual

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.569 
the 2 own version so these are dual
voice<00:00:22.839> coil<00:00:23.230> which<00:00:23.560> means<00:00:23.859> you<00:00:24.160> know<00:00:24.279> check

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579 
voice coil which means you know check

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.380 
voice coil which means you know check
your<00:00:24.759> wiring<00:00:25.659> patterns<00:00:26.529> that<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:27.009> would<00:00:27.390> that

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
your wiring patterns that you would that

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.029 
your wiring patterns that you would that
would<00:00:28.570> work<00:00:28.749> well<00:00:28.929> with<00:00:29.079> your<00:00:29.109> hamp<00:00:29.409> before

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
would work well with your hamp before

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.589 
would work well with your hamp before
you<00:00:30.159> buy<00:00:30.310> them<00:00:30.579> to<00:00:30.820> know<00:00:30.970> if<00:00:31.089> you<00:00:31.210> need<00:00:31.359> to<00:00:31.449> buy

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
you buy them to know if you need to buy

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.130 
you buy them to know if you need to buy
you<00:00:32.410> know<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.770> 2<00:00:33.400> ohm<00:00:33.579> or<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.790> forum<00:00:34.150> setup<00:00:34.540> but

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
you know a 2 ohm or a forum setup but

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.990 
you know a 2 ohm or a forum setup but
I'm<00:00:35.320> running<00:00:36.000> two<00:00:37.000> subs<00:00:37.450> in<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:39.370> box<00:00:39.670> over

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
I'm running two subs in this box over

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.740 
I'm running two subs in this box over
here<00:00:40.270> and<00:00:41.520> running<00:00:42.520> my<00:00:42.640> hamp<00:00:42.850> at<00:00:43.030> 2<00:00:43.210> ohms<00:00:43.390> so<00:00:43.690> I

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
here and running my hamp at 2 ohms so I

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.640 
here and running my hamp at 2 ohms so I
went<00:00:43.930> ahead<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:44.440> got<00:00:44.590> my<00:00:45.250> 2<00:00:45.310> ohm<00:00:45.850> subs<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:47.560> I'm

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
went ahead and got my 2 ohm subs and I'm

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.460 
went ahead and got my 2 ohm subs and I'm
going<00:00:47.830> to<00:00:47.860> run<00:00:48.040> it<00:00:48.190> in<00:00:48.310> a<00:00:48.430> parallel<00:00:49.060> and<00:00:49.470> series

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
going to run it in a parallel and series

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.290 
going to run it in a parallel and series
combination<00:00:51.060> wiring<00:00:52.060> style<00:00:52.450> now<00:00:54.300> you'll

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
combination wiring style now you'll

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.360 
combination wiring style now you'll
notice<00:00:55.570> that<00:00:55.720> in<00:00:56.260> most<00:00:56.560> of<00:00:56.650> my<00:00:56.710> videos<00:00:56.800> I<00:00:57.310> don't

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
notice that in most of my videos I don't

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.430 
notice that in most of my videos I don't
actually<00:00:57.910> leave<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.450> things<00:00:58.660> in<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:58.990> boxes

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
actually leave the things in the boxes

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.380 
actually leave the things in the boxes
because<00:00:59.620> it<00:00:59.740> just<00:00:59.830> takes<00:01:00.040> too<00:01:00.310> long<00:01:00.340> but<00:01:00.820> this

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
because it just takes too long but this

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.030 
because it just takes too long but this
is<00:01:01.600> what<00:01:01.810> you'll<00:01:01.990> see<00:01:02.050> when<00:01:02.380> you<00:01:02.470> first<00:01:02.650> open

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
is what you'll see when you first open

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.580 
is what you'll see when you first open
it<00:01:03.160> up<00:01:03.310> and<00:01:03.520> then<00:01:04.150> I<00:01:04.509> just<00:01:04.809> pull<00:01:05.079> the<00:01:05.199> sub<00:01:05.409> out

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
it up and then I just pull the sub out

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.330 
it up and then I just pull the sub out
it<00:01:05.740> comes<00:01:05.979> in<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.820> nice<00:01:07.390> plastic<00:01:08.350> wrap<00:01:08.799> just<00:01:09.009> to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
it comes in a nice plastic wrap just to

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.760 
it comes in a nice plastic wrap just to
protect<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.090> then<00:01:10.750> make<00:01:11.320> sure<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.530> you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
protect it and then make sure that you

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.140 
protect it and then make sure that you
pull<00:01:12.040> this<00:01:12.190> out<00:01:12.340> you'll<00:01:12.580> see<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:12.909> they've

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
pull this out you'll see that they've

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.540 
pull this out you'll see that they've
put<00:01:13.840> markings<00:01:14.170> there<00:01:14.440> pull<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.040> styrofoam

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
put markings there pull the styrofoam

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.090 
put markings there pull the styrofoam
out<00:01:15.730> because<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:17.320> trim<00:01:17.620> piece<00:01:17.800> is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
out because this trim piece is

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.800 
out because this trim piece is
underneath<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:18.970> would<00:01:19.120> be<00:01:19.240> ashamed<00:01:19.600> to

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
underneath and it would be ashamed to

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
underneath and it would be ashamed to
throw<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.110> away

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
throw that away

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.950 
throw that away
also<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.900> screws<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.600> specialty<00:01:25.600> tool

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
also the screws and the specialty tool

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.920 
also the screws and the specialty tool
it's<00:01:26.229> just<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.650> X<00:01:27.280> type<00:01:27.760> deal<00:01:28.030> because<00:01:28.720> these

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
it's just a X type deal because these

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.340 
it's just a X type deal because these
screws<00:01:29.290> aren't<00:01:29.940> standard<00:01:30.940> they're<00:01:31.120> just<00:01:31.390> they

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
screws aren't standard they're just they

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.990 
screws aren't standard they're just they
have<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.650> tool<00:01:32.860> for<00:01:33.100> them<00:01:33.310> which<00:01:33.970> is

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
have the tool for them which is

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.780 
have the tool for them which is
different<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:34.720> unique<00:01:35.170> but<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.430> guess<00:01:36.670> it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
different and unique but I guess it

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.870 
different and unique but I guess it
prevents<00:01:37.180> stripping<00:01:37.630> hopefully<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.320> idea

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
prevents stripping hopefully is the idea

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.170 
prevents stripping hopefully is the idea
now<00:01:40.470> these<00:01:41.470> are<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.710> 8<00:01:42.100> inch<00:01:42.310> version<00:01:42.880> like<00:01:43.060> I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
now these are the 8 inch version like I

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.890 
now these are the 8 inch version like I
said<00:01:43.360> earlier<00:01:43.750> they<00:01:43.930> come<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.320> 8<00:01:44.530> 10<00:01:45.130> 12<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.909> 15

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
said earlier they come in 8 10 12 and 15

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.890 
said earlier they come in 8 10 12 and 15
inches<00:01:48.570> let's<00:01:49.570> see<00:01:49.869> here<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.760> manual<00:01:52.690> that

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
inches let's see here is the manual that

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.109 
inches let's see here is the manual that
it<00:01:53.140> comes<00:01:53.380> with<00:01:53.500> which<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.250> pretty<00:01:54.490> nice<00:01:54.729> they

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
it comes with which is pretty nice they

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.510 
it comes with which is pretty nice they
go<00:01:55.810> over<00:01:56.020> all<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.290> specifications<00:01:56.680> for<00:01:57.460> the

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
go over all the specifications for the

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.719 
go over all the specifications for the
box<00:01:57.909> sizes<00:01:58.210> sealed<00:01:58.720> ported<00:01:59.580> whatever<00:02:00.580> you

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
might want to build it gives you all of

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.170 
might want to build it gives you all of
the<00:02:04.080> handling<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.439> all<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.159> got<00:02:07.060> these

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
the handling and all that I got these

them and then I'm wiring them to a 500

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.610 
them and then I'm wiring them to a 500
watt<00:02:14.370> RMS<00:02:15.370> amp<00:02:16.090> at<00:02:16.330> 2<00:02:16.510> ohms<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.350> works

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
watt RMS amp at 2 ohms so this works

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.060 
watt RMS amp at 2 ohms so this works
perfectly<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.550> then<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.900> can<00:02:20.500> see<00:02:20.710> they<00:02:20.860> give

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
perfectly and then you can see they give

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.620 
perfectly and then you can see they give
you<00:02:21.220> all<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.520> different<00:02:21.790> wiring<00:02:22.000> options

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
you all the different wiring options

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.970 
you all the different wiring options
just<00:02:22.810> make<00:02:23.080> sure<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.590> pick<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.800> right

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
just make sure that you pick the right

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.680 
just make sure that you pick the right
one<00:02:24.130> for<00:02:24.550> your<00:02:25.000> setup<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.970> course<00:02:28.270> my

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
one for your setup so the of course my

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.480 
one for your setup so the of course my
more<00:02:28.990> in-depth<00:02:29.380> review<00:02:29.530> will<00:02:29.830> come<00:02:30.070> after

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
more in-depth review will come after

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.860 
more in-depth review will come after
I've<00:02:30.610> messed<00:02:30.910> with<00:02:31.000> these<00:02:31.270> for<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> little<00:02:31.630> bit

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
I've messed with these for a little bit

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.600 
I've messed with these for a little bit
and<00:02:31.930> actually<00:02:32.260> plugged<00:02:32.530> them<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.800> but<00:02:33.460> when

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
and actually plugged them in but when

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.590 
and actually plugged them in but when
you<00:02:33.700> first<00:02:33.880> pull<00:02:34.120> them<00:02:34.270> out<00:02:34.390> they're

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
you first pull them out they're

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.190 
you first pull them out they're
significantly<00:02:35.290> heavy<00:02:36.240> I've<00:02:37.240> owned<00:02:37.630> some<00:02:37.960> 12

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
significantly heavy I've owned some 12

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.950 
significantly heavy I've owned some 12
inch<00:02:38.380> subs<00:02:38.710> before<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:40.060> weren't<00:02:40.360> quite<00:02:40.690> I

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
inch subs before that weren't quite I

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.230 
inch subs before that weren't quite I
mean<00:02:41.430> they're<00:02:42.430> about<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.760> same<00:02:43.000> weight

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
mean they're about the same weight

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.670 
mean they're about the same weight
you'll<00:02:43.510> notice<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.050> these<00:02:44.170> are<00:02:44.230> actually

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
you'll notice that these are actually

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.450 
you'll notice that these are actually
decently<00:02:45.190> deep<00:02:45.490> for<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.910> diameter<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.830> depth

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
decently deep for the diameter the depth

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.080 
decently deep for the diameter the depth
mounting<00:02:48.970> depth<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.530> 4.75<00:02:50.530> or<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.790> know<00:02:51.910> give

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
mounting depth is 4.75 or you know give

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.780 
mounting depth is 4.75 or you know give
or<00:02:52.120> take<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.420> little<00:02:52.540> bit<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.830> they're<00:02:53.950> decently

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
or take a little bit so they're decently

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.010 
or take a little bit so they're decently
shallow<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:55.330> they're<00:02:55.510> definitely<00:02:55.690> not

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
shallow but they're definitely not

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.530 
shallow but they're definitely not
qualified<00:02:57.010> as<00:02:57.160> shallow<00:02:57.400> mount<00:02:57.700> subs<00:02:58.090> they're

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
qualified as shallow mount subs they're

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.880 
qualified as shallow mount subs they're
just<00:02:58.980> small<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:01.300> cutout<00:03:01.810> diameter<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:03.510> 7.21

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
just small the cutout diameter is 7.21

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.700 
just small the cutout diameter is 7.21
inches<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:07.270> really<00:03:07.900> they<00:03:08.050> don't<00:03:08.170> take<00:03:08.410> up<00:03:08.560> too

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
inches so really they don't take up too

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.310 
inches so really they don't take up too
much<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:08.950> each<00:03:09.370> sub<00:03:09.820> woofer<00:03:10.120> only<00:03:10.450> needs<00:03:10.660> 0.6

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
much and each sub woofer only needs 0.6

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.449 
much and each sub woofer only needs 0.6
cubic<00:03:11.740> feet<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.220> box<00:03:13.150> open<00:03:13.660> air<00:03:13.810> space<00:03:13.930> volume

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
cubic feet of box open air space volume

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.110 
cubic feet of box open air space volume
so<00:03:15.459> for<00:03:15.760> two<00:03:16.000> subs<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:18.010> know<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.160> really<00:03:18.730> wasn't

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
so for two subs you know I really wasn't

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.940 
so for two subs you know I really wasn't
taking<00:03:19.630> up<00:03:19.750> too<00:03:19.900> much<00:03:19.930> trunk<00:03:20.290> space<00:03:20.410> which<00:03:20.770> is

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
taking up too much trunk space which is

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.710 
taking up too much trunk space which is
good<00:03:21.130> because<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.989> hatchback<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.709> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
good because I have a hatchback so the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.960 
good because I have a hatchback so the
material<00:03:25.720> up<00:03:25.840> here<00:03:25.870> this<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.290> soft<00:03:27.040> rubber<00:03:27.670> and

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
material up here this is soft rubber and

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.620 
material up here this is soft rubber and
the<00:03:28.690> cone<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.290> harder<00:03:30.040> plastic<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
the cone is a harder plastic and the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.390 
the cone is a harder plastic and the
center<00:03:32.020> is<00:03:32.050> some<00:03:32.739> force<00:03:33.160> form<00:03:33.730> of<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:34.060> molded

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
center is some force form of a molded

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.210 
center is some force form of a molded
plastic<00:03:36.420> rubberized<00:03:37.420> plastic<00:03:37.510> type<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:38.860> they

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
plastic rubberized plastic type so they

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.340 
plastic rubberized plastic type so they
look<00:03:39.430> like<00:03:39.610> they<00:03:39.850> should<00:03:39.880> flex<00:03:40.330> pretty<00:03:40.810> well<00:03:41.080> I

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
look like they should flex pretty well I

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.680 
look like they should flex pretty well I
do<00:03:42.160> like<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.820> look<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.150> them<00:03:43.360> they're<00:03:43.660> very

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
do like the look of them they're very

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.800 
do like the look of them they're very
sharp<00:03:44.110> looking<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.769> they're<00:03:45.489> clean<00:03:45.850> nothing

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
sharp looking and they're clean nothing

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.660 
sharp looking and they're clean nothing
too<00:03:47.080> fancy<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.620> they<00:03:47.709> don't<00:03:47.860> have<00:03:48.040> giant

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
too fancy and they don't have giant

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.240 
too fancy and they don't have giant
logos<00:03:49.180> on<00:03:49.420> them<00:03:49.660> so<00:03:49.870> they<00:03:50.019> can<00:03:50.200> be<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:51.130> know

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
logos on them so they can be you know

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.370 
logos on them so they can be you know
they<00:03:51.610> they<00:03:52.000> don't<00:03:52.150> have<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.690> draw<00:03:52.900> too<00:03:53.260> much

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
they they don't have to draw too much

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.530 
they they don't have to draw too much
attention<00:03:53.440> if<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.010> don't<00:03:54.160> like<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.540> they

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
attention if you don't like that they

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.259 
attention if you don't like that they
were<00:03:55.600> I<00:03:56.070> can't<00:03:57.070> speak<00:03:57.340> too<00:03:57.550> much<00:03:57.700> about<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
were I can't speak too much about the

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.030 
were I can't speak too much about the
Flex<00:03:58.540> because<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:58.989> don't<00:03:59.260> really<00:03:59.470> want<00:03:59.680> to<00:03:59.739> poke

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
Flex because I don't really want to poke

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.940 
Flex because I don't really want to poke
them<00:04:00.310> right<00:04:00.489> now<00:04:01.019> because<00:04:02.019> it<00:04:02.440> probably<00:04:02.830> won't

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
them right now because it probably won't

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.430 
them right now because it probably won't
be<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.130> best<00:04:03.250> thing<00:04:03.640> for<00:04:03.670> them<00:04:04.060> but<00:04:04.630> this<00:04:05.260> is

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
be the best thing for them but this is

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.140 
be the best thing for them but this is
just<00:04:05.620> one<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.100> voice<00:04:06.280> coils<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.940> same

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
just one of the voice coils the same

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.000 
just one of the voice coils the same
thing<00:04:07.330> on<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.570> other<00:04:07.600> side<00:04:07.810> as<00:04:08.350> kind<00:04:08.950> of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
thing on the other side as kind of

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.509 
thing on the other side as kind of
interesting<00:04:09.519> I<00:04:09.610> guess<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.940> save<00:04:10.120> space<00:04:10.450> and

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
interesting I guess to save space and

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.960 
interesting I guess to save space and
not<00:04:12.519> have<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:13.209> strand<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.959> four<00:04:14.550> of<00:04:15.550> the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
not have a strand of four of the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.539

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
nice I don't know how big a gauge wire

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.940 
nice I don't know how big a gauge wire
they<00:04:47.640> hold<00:04:47.880> but<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.240> feels<00:04:48.630> like<00:04:48.950> should

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
they hold but it feels like should

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.550 
they hold but it feels like should
probably<00:04:50.160> take<00:04:50.490> up<00:04:50.670> to<00:04:50.790> about<00:04:51.030> 14<00:04:51.810> or<00:04:51.990> maybe<00:04:52.110> 12

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
probably take up to about 14 or maybe 12

probably take up to about 14 or maybe 12
gauge<00:04:52.830> speaker<00:04:53.730> wiring<00:04:54.120> so<00:04:54.450> we'll<00:04:55.290> see<00:04:55.470> about

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
gauge speaker wiring so we'll see about

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.820 
gauge speaker wiring so we'll see about
that<00:04:55.770> I'll<00:04:56.370> keep<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.700> guys<00:04:56.760> updated<00:04:57.210> as<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:58.560> get

further along you can kind of see the

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.160 
further along you can kind of see the
actual<00:05:05.000> I'm<00:05:06.000> not<00:05:06.210> quite<00:05:06.390> sure<00:05:06.420> I<00:05:06.630> forget<00:05:07.050> what

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
actual I'm not quite sure I forget what

actual I'm not quite sure I forget what
that's<00:05:07.350> called<00:05:07.560> but<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.830> looks<00:05:07.980> like<00:05:08.160> mesh<00:05:08.460> is

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
that's called but it looks like mesh is

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.850 
that's called but it looks like mesh is
red<00:05:09.600> on<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.870> inside<00:05:10.140> but<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.440> won't<00:05:10.650> be

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
red on the inside but you won't be

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.290 
red on the inside but you won't be
saying<00:05:11.100> that<00:05:11.250> unless<00:05:11.400> you<00:05:11.610> do<00:05:11.730> an<00:05:11.880> inverted

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
saying that unless you do an inverted

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
that these are pretty great they're

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.090 
that these are pretty great they're
about<00:05:18.030> 70<00:05:18.510> dollars<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.870> piece<00:05:19.170> I've<00:05:19.920> heard

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
about 70 dollars a piece I've heard

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.800 
about 70 dollars a piece I've heard
great<00:05:20.250> things<00:05:20.310> about<00:05:20.640> them<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.120> I'll<00:05:21.660> keep

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
great things about them and I'll keep

great things about them and I'll keep
you<00:05:21.990> updated<00:05:22.170> as<00:05:22.650> soon<00:05:22.800> as<00:05:22.920> I<00:05:23.010> get<00:05:23.070> them<00:05:23.280> wired

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
you updated as soon as I get them wired

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.700 
you updated as soon as I get them wired
in<00:05:23.760> so<00:05:24.180> thanks<00:05:24.840> for<00:05:24.930> watching<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.440> let<00:05:25.650> me

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
in so thanks for watching and let me

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.010 
in so thanks for watching and let me
know<00:05:25.800> if<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.040> have<00:05:26.160> any<00:05:26.310> more<00:05:26.400> questions<00:05:27.020> okay

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
know if you have any more questions okay

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.600 
know if you have any more questions okay
so<00:05:28.110> those<00:05:28.350> last<00:05:28.620> five<00:05:28.830> minutes<00:05:28.950> may<00:05:29.310> have<00:05:29.430> not

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
so those last five minutes may have not

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.180 
so those last five minutes may have not
been<00:05:29.910> exactly<00:05:30.240> what<00:05:30.570> you're<00:05:30.690> looking<00:05:31.020> for<00:05:31.350> I

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
been exactly what you're looking for I

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.140 
been exactly what you're looking for I
promise<00:05:33.090> that<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:33.330> will<00:05:33.450> be<00:05:34.310> reviewing<00:05:35.310> them<00:05:35.820> in

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
promise that I will be reviewing them in

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.820 
promise that I will be reviewing them in
their<00:05:36.330> entirety<00:05:36.690> this<00:05:37.140> is<00:05:37.260> more<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.530> like<00:05:37.560> an

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
their entirety this is more of like an

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.700 
their entirety this is more of like an
overview<00:05:38.220> type<00:05:38.580> video<00:05:39.000> so<00:05:39.840> anyway<00:05:40.380> I'm<00:05:40.650> going

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
overview type video so anyway I'm going

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.130 
overview type video so anyway I'm going
to<00:05:41.160> be<00:05:41.430> wiring<00:05:41.790> them<00:05:42.000> with<00:05:42.750> this<00:05:42.930> one<00:05:43.110> right

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
to be wiring them with this one right

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.340 
to be wiring them with this one right
here<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.530> have<00:05:43.890> a<00:05:43.920> 2<00:05:44.220> ohm<00:05:44.600> so<00:05:45.600> I'm<00:05:45.750> running<00:05:46.320> a

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
here I have a 2 ohm so I'm running a

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.170 
here I have a 2 ohm so I'm running a
series<00:05:47.070> and<00:05:47.370> then<00:05:47.490> I'm<00:05:47.610> going<00:05:47.700> to<00:05:47.790> put<00:05:47.940> them<00:05:48.000> in

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
series and then I'm going to put them in

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.220 
series and then I'm going to put them in
parallel<00:05:48.480> and<00:05:48.870> if<00:05:49.380> you<00:05:49.530> look<00:05:49.770> back<00:05:50.670> here<00:05:51.060> I<00:05:51.300> did

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
parallel and if you look back here I did

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.500 
parallel and if you look back here I did
mention<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:53.430> gauge<00:05:53.640> of<00:05:53.850> wiring<00:05:54.090> that<00:05:54.300> you

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
mention the gauge of wiring that you

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.070 
mention the gauge of wiring that you
could<00:05:54.690> use<00:05:55.760> they<00:05:56.760> fitted<00:05:57.120> really<00:05:57.390> nicely<00:05:57.600> and

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
could use they fitted really nicely and

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.630 
could use they fitted really nicely and
they're<00:05:58.260> actually<00:05:58.410> snug<00:05:58.860> so<00:05:59.100> they<00:05:59.250> have<00:05:59.430> no

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
they're actually snug so they have no

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.940 
they're actually snug so they have no
chance<00:05:59.850> of<00:06:00.090> pulling<00:06:00.270> not<00:06:00.540> really<00:06:00.950> I'm

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
chance of pulling not really I'm

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.860 
chance of pulling not really I'm
actually<00:06:02.310> using

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.930 

14-gauge<00:06:06.800> right<00:06:07.010> now<00:06:07.160> and<00:06:07.370> it<00:06:07.460> fit<00:06:07.669> in<00:06:07.790> no

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
14-gauge right now and it fit in no

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.790 
14-gauge right now and it fit in no
problem<00:06:08.150> so<00:06:08.540> I<00:06:08.570> think<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:08.900> could<00:06:09.050> do<00:06:09.200> 12<00:06:09.470> maybe

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
problem so I think you could do 12 maybe

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.879 
problem so I think you could do 12 maybe
even<00:06:10.190> 10<00:06:10.400> gauge<00:06:11.470> then<00:06:12.470> again<00:06:12.740> you're<00:06:12.860> only

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
even 10 gauge then again you're only

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.090 
even 10 gauge then again you're only
using<00:06:13.130> 250<00:06:13.970> watts<00:06:14.210> to<00:06:14.990> each<00:06:15.139> of<00:06:15.320> these<00:06:15.440> subs<00:06:15.770> so

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
using 250 watts to each of these subs so

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.129 
using 250 watts to each of these subs so
I<00:06:16.130> don't<00:06:16.430> I<00:06:16.580> think<00:06:16.790> this<00:06:16.970> ought<00:06:17.300> to<00:06:17.330> be<00:06:17.720> good

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
I don't I think this ought to be good

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.920 
I don't I think this ought to be good
enough<00:06:18.770> of<00:06:18.980> what<00:06:19.100> I'm<00:06:19.250> wanting<00:06:19.430> to<00:06:19.669> do<00:06:19.930> the

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
enough of what I'm wanting to do the

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.990 
enough of what I'm wanting to do the
magnet<00:06:21.410> on<00:06:21.560> the<00:06:21.650> back<00:06:22.460> is<00:06:22.700> actually

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
magnet on the back is actually

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.560 
magnet on the back is actually
significantly<00:06:24.790> has<00:06:25.790> some<00:06:26.000> significant

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
significantly has some significant

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.530 
significantly has some significant
weight<00:06:26.750> to<00:06:26.930> it<00:06:27.080> and<00:06:27.230> which<00:06:28.220> you<00:06:28.730> know<00:06:28.880> normally

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
weight to it and which you know normally

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.310 
weight to it and which you know normally
means<00:06:29.780> the<00:06:30.050> heavier<00:06:30.380> the<00:06:31.300> magnet<00:06:32.300> the<00:06:32.660> better

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
means the heavier the magnet the better

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.430 
means the heavier the magnet the better
able<00:06:34.280> sub<00:06:34.790> sounds<00:06:35.150> than<00:06:35.690> just<00:06:35.990> a<00:06:36.080> general

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
able sub sounds than just a general

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.950 
able sub sounds than just a general
statement<00:06:36.560> but<00:06:37.210> I'll<00:06:38.210> do<00:06:38.389> a<00:06:38.450> little<00:06:38.600> bit

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
statement but I'll do a little bit

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.110 
statement but I'll do a little bit
another<00:06:39.500> clip<00:06:39.770> here<00:06:39.979> real<00:06:40.160> quick<00:06:40.370> once<00:06:40.639> I<00:06:40.790> drop

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
another clip here real quick once I drop

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.110 
another clip here real quick once I drop
them<00:06:41.389> in<00:06:41.540> here<00:06:41.570> and<00:06:41.840> finish<00:06:42.169> wiring<00:06:42.440> them<00:06:42.830> and

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
them in here and finish wiring them and

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.180 
them in here and finish wiring them and
see<00:06:44.120> how<00:06:44.210> they<00:06:44.419> look<00:06:44.630> on<00:06:44.900> my<00:06:45.320> unpainted<00:06:45.740> box

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
see how they look on my unpainted box

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.629 
see how they look on my unpainted box
that<00:06:46.850> will<00:06:47.060> hopefully<00:06:47.270> be<00:06:47.660> painted<00:06:48.050> soon

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.790 

okay<00:06:52.210> so<00:06:52.330> I<00:06:52.449> got<00:06:52.659> these<00:06:52.810> in<00:06:52.960> my<00:06:53.080> box<00:06:53.379> so<00:06:53.680> the

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
okay so I got these in my box so the

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.550 
okay so I got these in my box so the
next<00:06:54.039> thing<00:06:54.220> we<00:06:54.340> do<00:06:54.490> is<00:06:54.639> go<00:06:54.879> wire<00:06:55.750> up<00:06:55.990> my<00:06:56.199> amp

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
next thing we do is go wire up my amp

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.920 
next thing we do is go wire up my amp
and<00:06:56.919> then<00:06:57.189> take<00:06:58.090> care<00:06:58.330> of<00:06:58.419> the<00:06:58.509> rest<00:06:58.659> of<00:06:58.840> that

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
and then take care of the rest of that

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.020 
and then take care of the rest of that
type<00:06:59.169> of<00:06:59.349> wiring<00:06:59.560> then<00:07:00.370> I'll<00:07:00.490> be<00:07:00.639> able<00:07:00.729> to<00:07:00.849> tell

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
type of wiring then I'll be able to tell

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.830 
type of wiring then I'll be able to tell
you<00:07:01.180> guys<00:07:01.300> how<00:07:01.360> they<00:07:01.719> actually<00:07:01.870> sound<00:07:03.599> you<00:07:04.599> can

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
you guys how they actually sound you can

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.279 
you guys how they actually sound you can
see<00:07:05.020> they<00:07:05.169> sit<00:07:05.409> pretty<00:07:05.590> nicely<00:07:05.889> and<00:07:06.430> then<00:07:07.289> get

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:08.289 
see they sit pretty nicely and then get

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:13.379 
see they sit pretty nicely and then get
the<00:07:09.900> trim<00:07:10.900> here<00:07:11.229> and<00:07:11.789> that's<00:07:12.789> what<00:07:13.030> they<00:07:13.180> look

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:13.389 
the trim here and that's what they look

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:16.469 
the trim here and that's what they look
like<00:07:13.419> so<00:07:14.169> pretty<00:07:14.979> nice<00:07:15.219> pretty<00:07:15.550> clean<00:07:15.909> simple

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
like so pretty nice pretty clean simple

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.010 
like so pretty nice pretty clean simple
and<00:07:16.979> the<00:07:17.979> hardest<00:07:18.819> part<00:07:19.090> of<00:07:19.300> installing<00:07:19.870> these

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.020 
and the hardest part of installing these

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.790 
and the hardest part of installing these
things<00:07:20.379> was<00:07:20.800> getting<00:07:21.039> two<00:07:22.030> strands<00:07:22.659> of<00:07:22.800> 14

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
things was getting two strands of 14

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.649 
things was getting two strands of 14
gauge<00:07:24.039> wire<00:07:24.069> to<00:07:25.030> go<00:07:25.150> into<00:07:25.449> the<00:07:25.599> same<00:07:27.659> same

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:28.659 
gauge wire to go into the same same

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:32.339 
gauge wire to go into the same same
receiver<00:07:29.050> for<00:07:30.449> one<00:07:31.449> of<00:07:31.569> the<00:07:31.659> voice<00:07:31.840> coils

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:32.349 
receiver for one of the voice coils

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:34.050 
receiver for one of the voice coils
because<00:07:32.830> of<00:07:32.919> the<00:07:33.009> way<00:07:33.129> I<00:07:33.159> wired<00:07:33.460> it<00:07:33.669> I<00:07:33.819> had<00:07:33.940> to

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:34.060 
because of the way I wired it I had to

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.719 
because of the way I wired it I had to
put<00:07:34.270> two<00:07:34.419> wires<00:07:34.629> into<00:07:35.020> one<00:07:35.199> slot<00:07:35.500> so<00:07:35.889> as<00:07:36.550> the

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:36.729 
put two wires into one slot so as the

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:38.249 
put two wires into one slot so as the
hardest<00:07:37.030> part<00:07:37.240> other<00:07:37.389> than<00:07:37.479> that<00:07:37.780> everything

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:38.259 
hardest part other than that everything

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:40.709 
hardest part other than that everything
is<00:07:38.409> very<00:07:38.620> easy<00:07:38.770> and<00:07:39.219> very<00:07:39.250> fast<00:07:39.699> so<00:07:40.090> these

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:40.719 
is very easy and very fast so these

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:42.689 
is very easy and very fast so these
we're<00:07:40.990> pretty<00:07:41.440> nice<00:07:41.770> so<00:07:42.159> far

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:42.699 
we're pretty nice so far

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:46.050 
we're pretty nice so far
most<00:07:43.539> of<00:07:43.750> the<00:07:43.840> molding<00:07:44.379> looks<00:07:44.650> pretty<00:07:45.129> decent

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.060 
most of the molding looks pretty decent

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.409 
most of the molding looks pretty decent
there's<00:07:46.659> a<00:07:46.779> few<00:07:47.400> parts<00:07:48.400> you<00:07:48.969> can<00:07:49.150> see<00:07:49.330> around

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:49.419 
there's a few parts you can see around

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:53.159 
there's a few parts you can see around
here<00:07:49.719> how<00:07:49.900> its<00:07:50.050> kind<00:07:50.169> of<00:07:50.289> shiny<00:07:50.909> and<00:07:52.169> Dave

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:53.169 
here how its kind of shiny and Dave

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:55.200 
here how its kind of shiny and Dave
that's<00:07:53.409> just<00:07:53.680> a<00:07:53.830> glue<00:07:54.099> which<00:07:54.430> is<00:07:54.610> okay<00:07:55.000> as<00:07:55.180> long

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.210 
that's just a glue which is okay as long

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.779 
that's just a glue which is okay as long
as<00:07:55.419> it's<00:07:55.750> not<00:07:55.990> on<00:07:56.199> the<00:07:56.469> actual<00:07:56.979> speaker<00:07:57.430> itself

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:57.789 
as it's not on the actual speaker itself

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:00.390 
as it's not on the actual speaker itself
and<00:07:58.180> that<00:07:58.960> that<00:07:59.110> stuff<00:07:59.440> doesn't<00:07:59.650> melt<00:07:59.919> so<00:08:00.219> I'll

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 
and that that stuff doesn't melt so I'll

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.070 
and that that stuff doesn't melt so I'll
take<00:08:00.669> it<00:08:00.819> through<00:08:01.000> the<00:08:01.090> full<00:08:01.270> break-in<00:08:01.659> cycle

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 
take it through the full break-in cycle

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.480 
take it through the full break-in cycle
and<00:08:02.199> then<00:08:02.319> let<00:08:02.469> you<00:08:02.650> guys<00:08:02.800> know<00:08:03.039> how<00:08:03.250> it<00:08:03.340> went

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:03.490 
and then let you guys know how it went

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.199 
and then let you guys know how it went
and<00:08:03.840> how<00:08:04.840> they<00:08:04.990> sell
