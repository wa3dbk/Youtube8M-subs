00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.050
 a much greater sportsmanship to her for 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.820
 fix her pedals 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.469

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.890
 It's power to send a hug to my friend. 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.860
