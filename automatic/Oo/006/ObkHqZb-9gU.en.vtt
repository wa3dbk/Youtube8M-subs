00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
sites all then offer the program so

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.620 
sites all then offer the program so
anyway<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:47.989> our<00:02:48.290> power<00:02:48.680> company<00:02:49.250> in

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
anyway then our power company in

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.540 
anyway then our power company in
Washington<00:02:50.830> Mindy<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:51.920> don't<00:02:52.070> know<00:02:52.160> this<00:02:52.310> we

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
Washington Mindy you don't know this we

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.600 
Washington Mindy you don't know this we
just<00:02:52.760> did<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.290> Pepco<00:02:54.290> which<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.709> our<00:02:54.890> what<00:02:55.519> is

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
just did this Pepco which is our what is

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.400 
just did this Pepco which is our what is
it<00:02:55.760> here<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.120> like

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.010 

yeah<00:02:59.100> exactly<00:02:59.880> well<00:03:00.510> they've<00:03:00.690> had<00:03:00.840> some

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
yeah exactly well they've had some

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.640 
yeah exactly well they've had some
troubles<00:03:01.320> lately

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
troubles lately

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.010 
troubles lately
but<00:03:02.160> anyway<00:03:02.640> Pepco<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.180> adopted<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.720> as<00:03:03.840> well

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
but anyway Pepco just adopted it as well

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.000 
but anyway Pepco just adopted it as well
and<00:03:04.140> it's<00:03:04.230> making<00:03:04.410> their<00:03:04.590> lines<00:03:04.770> wouldn't

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
and it's making their lines wouldn't

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.230 
and it's making their lines wouldn't
work<00:03:05.100> faster

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
work faster

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.900 
work faster
so<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:09.060> old<00:03:09.330> way<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.660> doing<00:03:10.080> research<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:11.010> that

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
so the old way of doing research is that

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.510 
so the old way of doing research is that
and<00:03:12.360> we<00:03:13.080> need<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.560> prove<00:03:13.800> what<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> plant-based

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
and we need to prove what a plant-based

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.430 
and we need to prove what a plant-based
diet<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:15.180> do<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.420> old<00:03:15.600> way<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:15.810> doing<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.320> is

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
diet can do the old way of doing it is

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.980 
diet can do the old way of doing it is
we<00:03:16.770> do<00:03:16.920> two<00:03:17.190> or<00:03:17.310> three<00:03:17.340> years<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.420> diabetes

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
we do two or three years of a diabetes

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.990 
we do two or three years of a diabetes
study<00:03:19.230> followed<00:03:19.680> by<00:03:19.800> several<00:03:20.370> more<00:03:20.610> years<00:03:20.760> of

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
study followed by several more years of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.790 
study followed by several more years of
a<00:03:21.060> cancer<00:03:21.270> study<00:03:21.660> we've<00:03:22.080> got<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> new<00:03:22.470> method

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
a cancer study we've got a new method

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.960 
a cancer study we've got a new method
where<00:03:23.490> we<00:03:24.060> recruit<00:03:24.630> large<00:03:25.170> numbers<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.650> people

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
where we recruit large numbers of people

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.970 
where we recruit large numbers of people
we<00:03:26.970> bring<00:03:27.330> them<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.780> at<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.110> same<00:03:28.440> time<00:03:28.500> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
we bring them in at the same time and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.860 
we bring them in at the same time and
run<00:03:29.160> studies<00:03:29.580> concurrently<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.540> have<00:03:30.690> got<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
run studies concurrently we have got a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.020 
run studies concurrently we have got a
good<00:03:31.140> staff<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.620> do<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.430> reason<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.910> I

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
good staff to do it and the reason is I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.880 
good staff to do it and the reason is I
calculated<00:03:33.690> all<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.080> our<00:03:34.200> collective<00:03:34.530> life

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
calculated all of our collective life

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.160 
calculated all of our collective life
expectancy<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.240> decided<00:03:36.600> we<00:03:36.750> got<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.960> speed

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
expectancy and I decided we got to speed

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.060 
expectancy and I decided we got to speed
it<00:03:37.200> up<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:38.690> anyway<00:03:39.690> what<00:03:40.320> we<00:03:40.440> can't<00:03:40.710> do<00:03:40.890> without

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
it up so anyway what we can't do without

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.630 
it up so anyway what we can't do without
you

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.180

so<00:03:42.450> many<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.140> people<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.830> people<00:03:44.070> I

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
so many of the people here the people I

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.160 
so many of the people here the people I
mentioned<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:44.670> many<00:03:44.880> others<00:03:45.180> as<00:03:45.390> well<00:03:45.420> have

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
mentioned but many others as well have

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.550 
mentioned but many others as well have
helped<00:03:46.530> us<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.860> do<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.640> whether<00:03:48.030> it's

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
helped us to do that so whether it's

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.960 
helped us to do that so whether it's

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
us in many ways that the federal

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.710 
us in many ways that the federal
government<00:05:07.950> still<00:05:08.220> subsidizes<00:05:09.210> meat<00:05:09.480> and

we<00:05:56.190> got<00:05:56.340> two<00:05:56.580> full<00:05:56.880> pages<00:05:57.120> on<00:05:57.540> vegetarian<00:05:58.169> and

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
we got two full pages on vegetarian and

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.120 
we got two full pages on vegetarian and
vegan<00:05:58.320> diets<00:05:58.950> that<00:05:59.250> and<00:06:00.000> so<00:06:00.840> what<00:06:00.990> we<00:06:01.169> do<00:06:01.380> and

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
vegan diets that and so what we do and

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.220 
vegan diets that and so what we do and
so<00:06:02.250> they're<00:06:02.520> continuing<00:06:03.060> this<00:06:03.180> what<00:06:03.600> we<00:06:03.750> do<00:06:03.960> is

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
so they're continuing this what we do is

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.640 
so they're continuing this what we do is
we<00:06:04.860> do<00:06:05.040> research<00:06:05.430> where<00:06:05.700> we<00:06:05.820> bring<00:06:06.030> in<00:06:06.090> people

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
we do research where we bring in people

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.920 
we do research where we bring in people
we<00:06:07.650> publish<00:06:08.190> our<00:06:08.340> findings<00:06:08.820> and<00:06:09.030> once<00:06:09.780> they're

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
we publish our findings and once they're

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.740 
we publish our findings and once they're
published<00:06:10.320> we<00:06:10.590> then<00:06:10.830> work<00:06:11.070> on<00:06:11.250> Capitol<00:06:11.700> Hill

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
published we then work on Capitol Hill

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.690 
published we then work on Capitol Hill
because<00:06:12.750> NIH<00:06:13.320> cares<00:06:13.650> dramatically<00:06:14.550> what

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
because NIH cares dramatically what

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.909 
because NIH cares dramatically what
Capitol<00:06:15.210> Hill<00:06:15.360> thinks<00:06:15.720> because<00:06:16.080> that's<00:06:16.560> who

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
Capitol Hill thinks because that's who

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.760 
Capitol Hill thinks because that's who
writes<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:17.430> checks<00:06:17.729> and<00:06:18.030> so<00:06:18.660> our<00:06:18.930> strategy<00:06:19.260> is

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
writes the checks and so our strategy is

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.580 
writes the checks and so our strategy is
you<00:06:20.370> lay<00:06:20.610> out<00:06:20.760> the<00:06:20.910> science<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:21.540> you<00:06:22.290> push<00:06:22.560> it

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
you lay out the science and you push it

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.130 
you lay out the science and you push it
like<00:06:22.830> crazy<00:06:23.100> and<00:06:23.490> you<00:06:24.030> change<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.630> policy

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
like crazy and you change the policy

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.110 
like crazy and you change the policy
from<00:06:25.290> the<00:06:25.380> top<00:06:25.560> down<00:06:25.830> so<00:06:26.250> we<00:06:26.550> got<00:06:26.700> to<00:06:26.820> prove<00:06:27.000> it

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
from the top down so we got to prove it

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.969 
from the top down so we got to prove it
we've<00:06:27.600> got<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.840> push<00:06:28.020> it<00:06:28.050> we've<00:06:28.590> got<00:06:28.740> to<00:06:28.770> be

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
we've got to push it we've got to be

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.330 
we've got to push it we've got to be
right<00:06:30.050> but<00:06:31.050> we've<00:06:31.229> got<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.740> be<00:06:31.919> impatient

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
right but we've got to be impatient

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.850 
right but we've got to be impatient
that's<00:06:32.910> the<00:06:33.090> most<00:06:33.240> important<00:06:33.810> thing<00:06:33.840> I<00:06:34.169> do<00:06:34.470> not

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
that's the most important thing I do not

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.920 
that's the most important thing I do not
want<00:06:35.130> to<00:06:35.250> see<00:06:35.370> one<00:06:35.610> more<00:06:35.640> candlelight<00:06:36.479> vigil

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.630 
want to see one more candlelight vigil
hoping<00:06:37.260> things<00:06:37.440> get<00:06:37.650> better<00:06:37.830> what<00:06:38.310> we've<00:06:38.460> got

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
hoping things get better what we've got

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.570 
hoping things get better what we've got
