00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
it doesn't have to you know match the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.220 
it doesn't have to you know match the
comic<00:05:14.070> panel<00:05:14.490> completely<00:05:15.420> because<00:05:15.900> this<00:05:16.080> is

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
comic panel completely because this is

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
happen is if the characters attitude or

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.240 
happen is if the characters attitude or
the<00:05:21.960> characters<00:05:22.320> origins<00:05:22.740> are<00:05:22.920> paying<00:05:23.160> homage

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.790 
the characters origins are paying homage
to<00:05:23.430> so<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.630> attitude<00:05:25.050> of<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.230> character<00:05:25.650> is

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
to so the attitude of the character is

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.360 
to so the attitude of the character is
very<00:05:26.280> similar<00:05:26.610> or<00:05:26.910> adapted<00:05:27.810> but<00:05:28.110> but<00:05:29.100> still

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
very similar or adapted but but still

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.220 
very similar or adapted but but still
showing<00:05:29.610> signs<00:05:29.970> of<00:05:30.240> paying<00:05:30.540> respect<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.050> where

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
showing signs of paying respect to where

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.020 
showing signs of paying respect to where
it<00:05:31.350> came<00:05:31.500> from<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.890> the<00:05:32.160> variations<00:05:32.640> before

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
it came from and the variations before

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.090 
it came from and the variations before
it<00:05:33.180> by<00:05:33.390> what<00:05:33.600> it<00:05:33.690> does<00:05:33.900> so<00:05:34.650> in<00:05:34.770> that<00:05:34.860> respect

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
it by what it does so in that respect

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.890 
it by what it does so in that respect
I'm<00:05:35.460> sure<00:05:35.670> Anne<00:05:35.970> Hathaway's<00:05:36.390> attitude<00:05:36.810> is
