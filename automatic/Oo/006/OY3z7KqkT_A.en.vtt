00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.969
 as you are all in this channel no 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.830
 we talk only about books even if it's 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.010
 let's talk more, they talk to us a little 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.560
 of everything we like about this book 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.290
 music movies and now we have thought 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.420

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.939

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.140
 first thing we have taught are things 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.090

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.890

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.710
 we leave 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.510
 the links of all the pieces of clothing 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.030
 in case you want to buy them the first thing 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.040
 we caught was this ramones dress is 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.559
 a dress like that with the logo of the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.579
 ramones and here is transparent and it's like that 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.340
 quite long plan has a quality 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.629
 super good that 'just so much or so has 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.309
 surprised a lot by the quality that 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.140
 has and if it's cotton we'll do the 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.460
 super cool I already wear it I want it 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.289
 which is the piece that I've taken the most 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.330
 all because I love being young and 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.490
 in addition super comfortable super cool and the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.860
 perfect for summer and the second and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.110
 last VERON very is this dress that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.060
 has a cloth as well as a swimsuit 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.190
 It molds very well to the body I love that 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.590
 have so many 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.210
 because I love the colors and 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.010
 they hope that once I'm always 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.500
 black and I want to change that a bit 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.390
 that also saw steyn looked like 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.880
 plan very 90s and I really like 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.800
 the style of the 90's and I love using the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.690
 detail of this that has on the sides 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.640
 the only thing you have to take it with a 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.030
 bra that even looks from behind 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.680
 because it has a super back the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.920
 super discovered and has a quality 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.930
 super good and super the article the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.150
 clients that we got this this dress 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.670
 from the store more doctrines that we will draw 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.830
 also the point with facebook because 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.810
 we upload the photo 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.140
 we started translated was what you see without 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.600
 more but he wore in the neck known 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.090
 Like a scooter diamond necklace 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.300
 exactly entertaining expression is 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.940
 super comfortable that it was his opposite who 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.390
 He wears the transparent collar that looks at him 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.090
 also in areas above areas that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.790
 it seems like it's wearing a skirt month 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.830
 sausage and also the fabric is super soft 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.000
 and as they are in some clients of 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.670
 solid 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.990
 this skirt that is like velvet I 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.270
 at the beginning when the mine photos 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.570
 it entered that it was dry without more and when 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.390
 it took me was in price plan but not 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.790
 nothing happens but we are more complicated 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.610
 ahead is shorter and behind 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.060
 It is longer and also takes this detail 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.450
 in plan that are like weird straps do not 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.850
 is thinking if you want is behind and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.670
 also this in the legs you have is 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.070
 also a little bit the bad thing is that you 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.620
 you fall for a while on the leg I like 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.090
 a lot does not hit me much with I'm going 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.010
 dressed because I'm a bit weird 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.590
 wearing and you will see it I think it is very 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.380
 original and it's very very soon also 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 I am is I asked myself this monkey that 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:10.159
 well well in the photo I said no 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.349
 I like your letters a lot because it's 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.500
 as well as with lace and it is very cool and 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.379
 well it's not that I do not like it but it's 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.750
 a little weird put and good but I 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.549
 like the east side that's like it's wearing 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.519
 It's just around your waist and for summer it's 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.769
 as very cool although the peel is a 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.690
 little vulgar and also pretty hot 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.690
 but good to put it on 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:44.480
 She wears long dresses and a dress 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.640
 rather over night or for some 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.340
 summer summer event 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.709
 it's like a slightly transparent cloth 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.049
 but it's a little below, so it's not 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.590
 is going to see nothing we like a lot but the 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.950
 problem is that we have so many 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.049
 centimeters of fabric or I'm 170 and 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.560
 I have a lot of spare but good 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.329
 can arrange pick up a little under 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.000
 and on the hand of handles we will get these 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.870
 shoes that are some flu like 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.849
 a blue that many years ago 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.560
 but does not control any cheap sites 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.510
 these do not have much quality in 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.979
 reality are our handles the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.020
 works as well as cork in plan 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.210
 flip flops and this is how I need 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.550
 hair but it's also marine but they're very 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.350
 very comfortable and I do not know how much I like how 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.300
 are very beautiful and I thought that 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.130
 they were going to be more lower but when I 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.780
 they arrived they had a piece platform 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.520
 huge but for me better because to me 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.440
 love the other way keep in mind 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.520
 if you want to buy them, they come more 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.600
 small than normal 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.520
 jobs 1 3839 I took a 38 and luckily 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.800
 I'm doing well, so if you go to about 39 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.870
 they would advise you to take a 40 for 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.630
 let us go small and finally 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.760
 It is not a collaboration is this necklace 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.770
 that also in his 90s he had it when 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.930
 It was small and it's the typical necklace this 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.520
 that is like mouth suit and I bought it in 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.960
 ebay we also carry all the time 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.150
 looking for those that are not found by 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.440
 no side anyway if you like 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.030
 and you do not want to buy it online 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.740
 they also sell it in what happens 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.510
 which is more expensive than it was 56 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.330
 euros also cost me a euro and peak 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.070
 with the shipping I love how they are left 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.350
 from my favorite colleagues when I was 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.950
 small along with this and that's it 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.050
 wait 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.510
