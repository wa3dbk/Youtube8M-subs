recommend getting any one that has fruit
in<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.490> fruit<00:01:14.760> gets<00:01:14.939> lodged<00:01:15.240> in

the<00:01:15.720> straw<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> nerves<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.369> then

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the straw with the nerves and then

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
the straw with the nerves and then
you're<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:18.119> you'll<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.570> never<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.229> spend

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470

the straw
I<00:01:22.290> also<00:01:22.799> recommend<00:01:23.189> only<00:01:23.490> getting<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> medium

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
I also recommend only getting the medium

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.350 
I also recommend only getting the medium
size<00:01:25.220> for<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> same<00:01:26.490> reason<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
size for the same reason as you want to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.850 
size for the same reason as you want to
drink<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.630> fast<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
drink it fast because if you get the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.539 
drink it fast because if you get the
large<00:01:29.070> size<00:01:30.829> you're<00:01:31.829> gonna<00:01:31.920> try<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.250> drink<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
fast but you need a brain freeze and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.620 
fast but you need a brain freeze and
it's<00:01:34.619> gonna<00:01:34.770> suck<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> medium

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
