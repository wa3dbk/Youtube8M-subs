you up 43 blocks which is all i needed

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.929 
you up 43 blocks which is all i needed
but<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.599> easily<00:00:15.929> scalable<00:00:19.820> alright<00:00:20.820> let's

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
but it's easily scalable alright let's

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.150 
but it's easily scalable alright let's
take<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> look<00:00:21.210> at<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> bottom<00:00:21.600> here<00:00:21.980> yes<00:00:22.980> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
take a look at the bottom here yes it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.560 
take a look at the bottom here yes it
looks<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.519> underneath<00:00:23.820> trying<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> make<00:00:24.449> it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
looks like underneath trying to make it

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.490 
looks like underneath trying to make it
look<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> game<00:00:25.109> close<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.189> get<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.870 

boom<00:00:31.500> works<00:00:32.099> one<00:00:32.340> hundred<00:00:32.550> percent<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
boom works one hundred percent of the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.389 
boom works one hundred percent of the
time<00:00:33.140> although<00:00:34.140> sometimes<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:35.040> gets<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.280> little

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
time although sometimes it gets a little

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.330 
time although sometimes it gets a little
glitchy<00:00:35.670> depending<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.210> how<00:00:36.300> many<00:00:36.360> resources

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340

you can face you directly at the wall
there<00:00:42.230> that's<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.410> glitch<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.610> new

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
there that's a glitch and the new

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.720 
there that's a glitch and the new
direction<00:00:45.840> commands<00:00:47.210> for<00:00:48.210> teleport<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.730> if

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
direction commands for teleport and if

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.130 
direction commands for teleport and if
you<00:00:50.879> fall<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.329> tell<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> poor<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.840> back<00:00:51.989> up

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
you fall and tell the poor you back up

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.569

here so you don't get stuck yeah most of
the<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.699> works<00:00:57.149> perfectly<00:00:58.160> sometimes<00:00:59.160> it'll

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the time works perfectly sometimes it'll

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.889 
the time works perfectly sometimes it'll
glitch<00:00:59.609> when<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> teleport<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> make<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
glitch when a teleport you and make you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.770 
glitch when a teleport you and make you
face<00:01:01.079> random<00:01:01.500> directions<00:01:02.210> its<00:01:03.210> bugs<00:01:03.480> they'll

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
face random directions its bugs they'll

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.000 
face random directions its bugs they'll
get<00:01:03.930> worked<00:01:04.110> out<00:01:04.260> hopefully<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.799> newer

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
get worked out hopefully in the newer

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.340 
get worked out hopefully in the newer
versions<00:01:08.540> all<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:09.810> let's<00:01:09.930> take<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> look<00:01:10.260> at

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
versions all right let's take a look at

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.219 
versions all right let's take a look at
the<00:01:10.439> internals<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.010> real<00:01:11.189> quick<00:01:11.750> as<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.049> see

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the internals here real quick as you see

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.640 
the internals here real quick as you see
it's<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:13.950> contained<00:01:14.869> can't<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.020> any<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it's all contained can't see any of the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.730 
it's all contained can't see any of the
Redstone<00:01:17.130> involved<00:01:18.229> although<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.439> much

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
Redstone involved although it's not much

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
Redstone involved although it's not much
this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> Redstone<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> fault<00:01:21.390> in

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
this is all of the Redstone a fault in

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.200 
this is all of the Redstone a fault in
it<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.869> side<00:01:22.049> moves<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.909> that<00:01:23.909> side

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it this side moves you up and that side

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.830 
it this side moves you up and that side
moves<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.689> down<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.740> very<00:01:25.950> simple<00:01:26.840> right

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
moves you down it's very simple right

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.330 
moves you down it's very simple right
now<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.170> only<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.409> single<00:01:28.680> player<00:01:28.950> friendlies

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
now it's only a single player friendlies

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.609 
now it's only a single player friendlies
you<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.350> nearest<00:01:31.350> player

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you see you have the nearest player

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.300 
you see you have the nearest player
command<00:01:32.009> i'll<00:01:32.240> update<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:34.009> but<00:01:35.009> these<00:01:35.100> are

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
command i'll update that but these are

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.649 
command i'll update that but these are
just<00:01:35.340> clone<00:01:35.700> commands<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> new<00:01:36.420> clone

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
just clone commands the new clone

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.429 
just clone commands the new clone
commands<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.140> 14<00:01:37.500> w<00:01:37.770> 0<00:01:37.979> 3<00:01:38.220> 28<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.479> 29<00:01:39.780> basically

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
commands in 14 w 0 3 28 to 29 basically

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.440 
commands in 14 w 0 3 28 to 29 basically
clones<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.130> elevator<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.880> shaft<00:01:42.180> here

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
clones this elevator and the shaft here

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.649 
clones this elevator and the shaft here
and<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:43.649> paste<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.030> other<00:01:45.180> shaft

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and it will paste it in the other shaft

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.200 
and it will paste it in the other shaft
each<00:01:46.350> paste<00:01:46.770> will<00:01:47.070> move<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.610> successfully

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
each paste will move it successfully

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.520 
each paste will move it successfully
upward<00:01:48.750> successively<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.710> word<00:01:49.979> rather<00:01:51.530> yeah

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
upward successively a word rather yeah

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.980 
upward successively a word rather yeah
i'm<00:01:52.619> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> update<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.570> target<00:01:54.570> selector

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
i'm going to update the target selector

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.319 
i'm going to update the target selector
to<00:01:55.290> find<00:01:56.040> people<00:01:56.430> who<00:01:56.460> are<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.060> elevator

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
to find people who are on the elevator

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.830 
to find people who are on the elevator
and<00:01:57.540> move<00:01:57.810> them<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.110> rather<00:01:58.829> than<00:01:59.630> moving<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
and move them up rather than moving the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.300 
and move them up rather than moving the
nearest<00:02:01.110> player<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:01.890> multiplayer
