 did her football when you were in my 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.970
 childhood until my 16th 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.220
 when finally I would just 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.440
 no more so I had stopped 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.970
 my trainer comes to me to do 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.580

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.860
 best defenders that we had there 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.990
 I think you would really do that 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.080
 just to be my bee 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:30.370

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.370

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.420
 I already know my attention is drawn to this 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.140
 I still remember that when I was sixteen 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.720
 that exists mels from vliet to want 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.870
 you watch the most and that game 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.250

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.250
 fun game I watch out the most 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.080
 actually none though I say that 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.560
 wrong 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.209
 I'm really looking forward to the Dayz 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.010
 stand-alone 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.200
 that's just going crazy fucking 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.180
 to be there I actually look it one 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.930
 the only thing I look forward to 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.300
 the rest I hope the spirit of times death 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.300
 really come true and out of the better 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.420
 yes and which game look the most out of the dayz 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:24.730
 standalone that seems very bold to me 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.730
 what game finned best bottles funniest 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.739
 I think the two different things 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.569
 to be 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.610
 why to be say games that are 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.349
 pack well now and they are actually 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.280
 not so nice at all 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.280
 how is that I think then 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.730
 lately I play very few 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.440
 kill the two and also very little sea 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.720
 I think that will be real again 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.180
 fucking good ones are just too 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.830
 so at a moment I have a lot of fun 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:59.160
 with pokémon online so poké mmo.nu 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.049
 if you want to start playing there, spend it 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.049
 I spend my time in minecraft hungergames 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.560
 I do reasonable calculations these days 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.560
 cruises 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.360
 I did not answer that at all 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.660
 a question wrong 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.170
 but you just have to deal with it 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.420
 herein I least want favorite pornstar 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.420

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.540
 Now you can get good grasp parts 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.550
 just dialogue 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.400

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.590
 emigrate to which country would I want to go 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.510
 I live in Noord-Holland in a reasonable way 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.160
 close to Amsterdam and that's all 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.160
 information you receive from the law 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.870
 as well as emigrate i would like to 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.270
 want to go to italy or to sweden because 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.530
 the day before but mainly Italy 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.530
 just because of the history it has 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.530
 just 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.440
 I'm so impressed by SSS 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.640
 creates that I have a lot more of 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:13.400
 italy wants to know about renaissance and what 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:16.850
 the forum what after all all schools 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.950
 colosseum the kompany italy is common 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.660
 insanely okay 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.480
 united states in which I also 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.480
 do not say the right beans 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.090
 a little too extreme italy seems very bad to me 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.610
 fat then a nice boy was little 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.290
 have questions 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.300
 i would i said there are only three 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:43.870
 they simply answered questions because of it 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.870
 just here a lot of questions that you ask 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.640
 until next time until next 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.300

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.770
 it just really works like i am 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:16.820
 just think this is the one he sees 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.820
 kind of weird but there is a wait 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.120
 place a little bit 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.250
 this drops in waiting
