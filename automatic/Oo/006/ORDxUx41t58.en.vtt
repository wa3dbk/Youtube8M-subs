coming<00:01:02.890> out<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.070> me<00:01:03.400> this<00:01:03.520> is<00:01:03.579> my<00:01:03.880> my<00:01:04.809> opinion

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
coming out to me this is my my opinion

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
but I'm coming out trying to calm

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.780 
but I'm coming out trying to calm
everybody<00:01:07.840> down<00:01:08.080> about<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.100> resolution

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
everybody down about the resolution

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.580 
everybody down about the resolution
really<00:01:10.390> under<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.780> resolution<00:01:11.320> shouldn't

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
really under the resolution shouldn't

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.010 
really under the resolution shouldn't
really<00:01:11.680> matter<00:01:11.920> um<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:13.120> take<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.300> look<00:01:13.480> at<00:01:13.630> 60

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
really matter um and take a look at 60

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.649 
really matter um and take a look at 60
frames<00:01:14.050> I<00:01:14.650> think<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:15.729> would<00:01:15.790> be<00:01:15.850> better<00:01:16.330> for

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
frames I think that would be better for

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.290 
frames I think that would be better for
gaming<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.950> um<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.520> know<00:01:18.610> I'm<00:01:18.790> go<00:01:19.000> ahead<00:01:19.180> and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
gaming but um you know I'm go ahead and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.390 
gaming but um you know I'm go ahead and
get<00:01:19.360> my<00:01:19.510> thoughts<00:01:19.720> about<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.979> just<00:01:21.010> it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
get my thoughts about it and it just it

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.370 
get my thoughts about it and it just it
just<00:01:21.430> goes<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:21.790> show<00:01:21.970> you<00:01:22.150> that<00:01:22.240> Marisol<00:01:22.780> xbox

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
just goes to show you that Marisol xbox

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.100 
just goes to show you that Marisol xbox
one<00:01:23.680> it's<00:01:24.580> not<00:01:24.790> it<00:01:25.210> does<00:01:25.420> not<00:01:25.630> have<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.080> power

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
one it's not it does not have the power

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.560 
one it's not it does not have the power
so<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.740> think<00:01:26.830> that<00:01:27.100> it<00:01:27.280> shouldn't<00:01:27.580> focus<00:01:28.090> on

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
so I think that it shouldn't focus on

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.690 
so I think that it shouldn't focus on
that<00:01:28.810> anymore<00:01:29.170> they've<00:01:29.860> been<00:01:29.979> focusing<00:01:30.460> on<00:01:30.549> it

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
that anymore they've been focusing on it

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.510 
that anymore they've been focusing on it
for<00:01:30.850> two<00:01:31.120> years<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:32.200> why<00:01:32.380> not<00:01:32.770> focus<00:01:33.040> on<00:01:33.310> just

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
for two years so why not focus on just

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.330 
for two years so why not focus on just
producing<00:01:34.090> games<00:01:34.409> ok<00:01:35.409> this<00:01:35.620> is<00:01:35.799> can't<00:01:36.070> do<00:01:36.220> it

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
producing games ok this is can't do it

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.070 
producing games ok this is can't do it
move<00:01:36.549> on<00:01:36.760> let's<00:01:37.030> let's<00:01:37.270> let's<00:01:37.420> get<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.900> games

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
move on let's let's let's get the games

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.810 
move on let's let's let's get the games
out<00:01:38.350> because<00:01:39.159> it<00:01:39.280> seemed<00:01:39.430> like<00:01:39.549> the<00:01:39.640> meter

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
out because it seemed like the meter

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.940 
out because it seemed like the meter
putting<00:01:40.120> too<00:01:40.240> much<00:01:40.360> time<00:01:40.659> inside<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.380> let's

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
putting too much time inside of let's

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.980 
putting too much time inside of let's
try<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.159> get<00:01:42.340> these<00:01:42.460> games<00:01:42.670> at<00:01:42.880> 720p<00:01:43.360> instead
