we use previous and next cut it's

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.510 
we use previous and next cut it's
actually<00:02:13.510> going<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.750> jump<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:15.100> these<00:02:15.250> cue

actually going to jump to these cue

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:24.300 
actually going to jump to these cue
points<00:02:17.850> using<00:02:18.850> s<00:02:19.150> go<00:02:19.959> forward<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.170> once<00:02:24.070> more

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
points using s go forward and once more

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.790 
points using s go forward and once more
will<00:02:24.640> take<00:02:24.670> us<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.120> end<00:02:25.270> or<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.680> way

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
will take us to the end or all the way

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.120 
will take us to the end or all the way
back<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.970> start<00:02:30.120> if<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.300> add<00:02:31.480> an<00:02:31.750> endpoint

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.620 

the<00:02:36.130> end<00:02:36.310> point<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.730> actually<00:02:37.030> considered<00:02:37.180> as

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
the end point is actually considered as

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.580 
the end point is actually considered as
part<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.380> previous<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.190> next<00:02:39.220> point<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.290> I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
part of the previous and next point so I

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.570 
part of the previous and next point so I
can<00:02:42.580> use<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.239> help<00:02:43.600> snap<00:02:44.070> exact<00:02:45.070> in<00:02:45.340> and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
can use that to help snap exact in and

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.490 
can use that to help snap exact in and
out<00:02:45.670> points<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.660> where<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.840> want<00:02:46.930> them<00:02:47.260> now

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.620 

I'm<00:02:50.500> back<00:02:50.650> at<00:02:50.830> this<00:02:50.920> point<00:02:51.220> here<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.700> can<00:02:52.390> step

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
I'm back at this point here I can step

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.570 
I'm back at this point here I can step
one<00:02:52.810> further<00:02:53.049> step<00:02:53.170> backwards<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.340> cue

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
one further step backwards to that cue

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.090 
one further step backwards to that cue
point<00:02:54.880> or<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.510> top<00:02:55.810> just<00:02:56.590> going<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.860> clear

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
point or to the top just going to clear

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.830 
point or to the top just going to clear
those<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:58.060> same<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.330> happening<00:02:58.420> on<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
those the same is happening on the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.240 
those the same is happening on the
timeline<00:02:59.080> using<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.980> S<00:03:00.130> key<00:03:00.160> forward<00:03:01.150> cut<00:03:01.360> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
timeline using the S key forward cut a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.750 
timeline using the S key forward cut a
key<00:03:03.269> last<00:03:04.269> cut<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.440> Q<00:03:05.650> point<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.519> cut

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.020 
point to the Q point to the cut point
and<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:11.320> forth<00:03:11.620> if<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.370> did<00:03:12.549> have<00:03:12.670> an<00:03:12.820> endpoint

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and so forth if I did have an endpoint

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.410 
and so forth if I did have an endpoint
added<00:03:13.720> here

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.550 

I<00:03:16.480> could<00:03:17.140> use<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.500> key<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.610> jump<00:03:18.849> from<00:03:19.090> here

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
I could use the a key to jump from here

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.040 
I could use the a key to jump from here
back<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.800> endpoint<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.900> just<00:03:22.900> need<00:03:23.020> to

back to the endpoint I just need to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.010 
back to the endpoint I just need to
press<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.470> couple<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.800> times<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.870> we're

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
press that a couple of times and we're

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.410 
press that a couple of times and we're
back<00:03:26.140> in<00:03:26.200> there<00:03:26.700> there<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.790> another<00:03:28.030> couple<00:03:28.330> of

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
back in there there is another couple of

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.390 
back in there there is another couple of
keys<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.660> will<00:03:28.930> be<00:03:29.020> useful<00:03:29.230> for<00:03:29.650> jumping

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
keys that will be useful for jumping

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.000 
keys that will be useful for jumping
