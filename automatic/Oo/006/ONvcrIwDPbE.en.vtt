 from your server for you 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.909
 Subscribe 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.250
 if you spend the kids and then 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.530
 by ogrines it can do very well 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.079
 do it instead of paying a subscription 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.950
 2 to 3 euros even if you have the habit 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.240
 two steps to pay him so here is 59 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.579
 participants it's pretty good 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.710
 I tried not to over you 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.979
 wait for that I found that one 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.350
 was already rather number were ceded 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.749
 we were already quite numerous 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.249
 participate in the contest and so bah I 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:42.850
 I'm told we're not going to make them wait 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:45.400
 more and we will make sure 2 2 2 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.549
 not to make a person win a very 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.729
 quickly so then not this time 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.680
 it's the result of the first contest 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.200
 so the first contest but there is 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.270
 will have a second only to participate in 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.100
 second is on this video that everything 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.700
 is happening so you just have just 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.229
 just to comment this video to the league 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.920
 and subscribe to my channel for no 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.000
 miss the result because I'm not going 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.680
 go see the person who will have who will have 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.600
 who won but that becomes black 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.220
 so she does not come to see me in a 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.260
 eight weeks to make sure 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.170
 to resume the list already the list 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.430
 keep all the players who have 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.060
 attended a great to go see 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.709
 your name or pseudo rather here and if 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.959
 never the person does not claim his 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.560
 lot in comment I gave it to 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.819
 someone else 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.670
 that's why it's important to 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.850
 subscribe to be able to check down 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.780
 that it is you the winner offers that 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.489
 to see if you are not the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.880
 winner and after you claim your lot 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.130
 just so that's it I'm going to 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.570
 to launch we will not wait more 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.310
 do not have me I will not do you 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.959
 to wait more than that because there I 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.130
 change a little the chocottes 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.900
 in any case I do not know what is it 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.269
 the winning eclm because it's 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.930
 really a draw there is no ya 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.489
 no cheat 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.500
 So that's really a draw at 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.549
 fate after good we'll do a first 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.200
 draw I take the game takes one after 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.640
 we will draw the first shot 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.660
 purchase is the first to win the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.769
 second draw I'll put it from 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.570
 side because if ever the first 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.540
 no one is claiming fuller and 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.530
 second person bassorah who will win 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.120
 so on but hey I think 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.920
 besides from there sees from there 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.420
 second still someone who is going to me 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.609
 to say good I will come on Thursday to 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.200
 get my lot anyway and that's it 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.430
 studies to show you that ben that 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.260
 not always fall on the same person 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.030
 shows like that if he did not want too much 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.510
 confident because it's very easy to 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.930
 2 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.010
 to make a false draw but 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.420
 do not worry about me it's not me 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.920
 who developed this pretty this software that 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.959
 is called Picard and who was lamented 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.700
 by liberty does a lot of software 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.610
 which is called shea very 2b but 310 p 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.010
 here we go we go for the draw 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.420
 the lot of the 1 million cases surprised me 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.579
 but be careful it will start 1 3 2 1 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.489
 then there you will see your nickname 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:07.040
 parade we know how to stay a little 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.790
 number of time and that's it and in the end we 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.180
 will know who is going to be the happy ones 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.909
 winners 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.190
 So here are some family who won this 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:21.680
 lot I write his nickname on the side 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.960
 so as not to forget it and then to 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.060
 to show you that it is not a fact 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.160
 will redo this draw for you 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.490
 tell who's going to be the second person 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.990
 etc. 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.780
 even if the person is not going to win 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.889
 from the moment there nobody 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.020
 claims under dawn a dozen cases 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.820
 will not be his lot here is finally 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.610
 it's not finally that's what you've got me 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.139
 understood that's just we never know if the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.180
 first pass even face no like that 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.509
 at least low 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.789
 ah that's how it is at least like that at 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.039
 the less I will always have a second 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:56.660
 nobody for whom gave the lot so the 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:05:01.100
 second person is maxence dominates 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.729
 I have for the podium to make one 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.919
 third 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.470
 here to show you that 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.479
 not always fall on the same person 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.740
 that's but at the same time coughs those 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.840
 who see their first name in second or 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.930

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.330
 participate 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.740
 that's how even at the last moment 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.660
 interesting to participate but hey you 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.490

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.880
