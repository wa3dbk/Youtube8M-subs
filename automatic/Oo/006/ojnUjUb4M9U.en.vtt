stand-up and tall and we found that

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.990 
stand-up and tall and we found that
stand-up<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> really<00:00:19.350> good<00:00:19.760> vehicle<00:00:20.760> for

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
stand-up is a really good vehicle for

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.970 
stand-up is a really good vehicle for
for<00:00:21.750> really<00:00:21.960> taking<00:00:22.289> advantage<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.769> long

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980

waves<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.600> kind<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.660> came<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.019> this

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
waves and kind of came up with this

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.349 
waves and kind of came up with this
project<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:25.890> redbull<00:00:26.310> together<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.939> try<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
project with redbull together to try and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.870 
project with redbull together to try and
find<00:00:27.680> like<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> longest<00:00:29.279> waves<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> world

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
