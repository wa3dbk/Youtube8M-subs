00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 death to a challenge that followed in the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.059
 last flood is not good here 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.070
 nobody wants an idiot a lot of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.290
 Indigenous movies are feeling now 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.830
 It will start in a week from the fire. 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.250
 arrived here on duty ready to play 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.810
 is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.720
 It's very good and it's their presence that 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 It was there because the team had no 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 arrived 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.269
 I hope we can now 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.500
 fit as soon as possible as 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.000
 yourself said 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.350
 The game is next and we need it. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.020
 fit as fast as possible to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:47.090
 to win in matches 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.090
 I think it's better not to say that Miguel LittÃ­n 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.800
 very glad that every day more 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.930
 continue thus evolution in the trainings 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:16.670
 and consequently in games he already 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:20.220
 vines had long queue at all boys 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.420
 like girls aloud and this is great to see in 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.390
 death package will only be a little because it is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.850
 Physiotherapy staff asked but 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:36.229
 that tomorrow I think they will leave 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.229
 a little bit already for me power in colombia 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.180
 as it is evident that the dream is very bad 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.990
 throughout the day 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.310
 and when I get the uol the two-time effect 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.070
 How long do you think he's going to? 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.070
 You where the fire playing well together 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.220
 I do not know, I think the first game is already 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.540
 ting is well matched because the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.420
 toronto does not wait 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.300
 when you have a game nearby and we 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.060
 It has to work and serve the team. 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.030
 You gotta move, we did not take a goal. 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.300
 noting and only the chances of winning 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.250
 soccer country 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.600
 on the other hand because I do not want and I do not want 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.959
 I risk the ax 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.020
 she went with a type of circumstance 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:37.489
 I think it 's about having people with 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:41.120
 toronto accept 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.120
 Look, I hope he has 65 fast and 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.060
 I can give him joy for this. 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.360
 I was hired and I hope every day more 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.209
 is helping the team and the fans 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.080
 from toronto to be happy 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:02.170
 be the first in 2008 the smallest number 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.170
