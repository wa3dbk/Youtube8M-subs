00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
out on the the root of the note so in

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.740 
out on the the root of the note so in
this<00:00:58.500> case<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> B<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.640> would<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
this case on the B it would be the the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.910 
this case on the B it would be the the
5th<00:01:01.020> string<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:04.019> train<00:01:04.350> third

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
5th string and then go this train third

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.000 
5th string and then go this train third
string<00:01:05.369> second<00:01:06.210> string<00:01:06.240> 1st<00:01:06.930> string<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
string second string 1st string then you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460 
string second string 1st string then you
come<00:01:08.220> back<00:01:08.250> down<00:01:08.960> second<00:01:09.960> string<00:01:10.260> third

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
come back down second string third

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.530 
come back down second string third
string<00:01:10.740> four<00:01:11.430> straight

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
string four straight

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.720 
string four straight
and<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.680> would<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:14.400> next

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
and then you would go on to the next

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.770 
and then you would go on to the next
chord<00:01:15.120> course<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.830> a-flat<00:01:17.430> minor<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.660> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
chord course on the a-flat minor it's a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.240 
chord course on the a-flat minor it's a
little<00:01:19.080> different<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.490> go<00:01:21.950> this<00:01:22.950> time

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
little different so if we go this time

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.670 
little different so if we go this time
since<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> root<00:01:23.910> is<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.590> sixth<00:01:25.590> string

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
since the root is on the sixth string

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.730 
since the root is on the sixth string
it's<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.910> be<00:01:27.090> sixth<00:01:27.870> string<00:01:28.170> third

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it's going to be sixth string third

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.530 
it's going to be sixth string third
string<00:01:29.690> second<00:01:30.690> string<00:01:30.720> first<00:01:31.170> string<00:01:32.540> then

second<00:01:34.170> string<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.620> would<00:01:34.770> stop<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.580> and

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
second string you would stop there and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.090 
second string you would stop there and
go<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.520> fourth<00:01:38.760> string<00:01:38.880> fifth<00:01:39.300> fret<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
go on the fourth string fifth fret I

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.679 
a just a downward strum or just up and
down<00:05:30.449> I<00:05:30.750> think<00:05:31.650> in<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.860> video<00:05:32.129> I<00:05:32.520> play<00:05:33.210> up<00:05:33.509> and

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
down I think in the video I play up and

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:41.650 
down I think in the video I play up and
down<00:05:34.580> so<00:05:35.930> again<00:05:36.930> it's

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.680 

Part<00:05:42.660> C<00:05:42.720> is<00:05:43.380> where<00:05:44.160> he<00:05:44.460> sings<00:05:44.790> nowhere<00:05:45.540> is

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
Part C is where he sings nowhere is

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.670 
Part C is where he sings nowhere is
anyone's<00:05:46.140> reason<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:47.570> out<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.810> place<00:05:49.050> in<00:05:49.410> my

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
anyone's reason and out of place in my

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.090 
anyone's reason and out of place in my
own<00:05:49.830> time<00:05:50.240> so<00:05:51.240> on<00:05:51.570> this<00:05:52.140> part<00:05:52.440> is<00:05:52.530> really<00:05:52.590> easy

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
own time so on this part is really easy

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.720 
own time so on this part is really easy
you<00:05:53.970> just<00:05:54.000> play<00:05:54.390> it<00:05:54.510> twice<00:05:54.980> it's<00:05:55.980> um

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
you just play it twice it's um

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:04.030 
you just play it twice it's um
a-flat<00:05:57.600> minor<00:05:59.210> F<00:06:00.210> sharp<00:06:01.020> and<00:06:01.610> C<00:06:02.610> sharp<00:06:02.640> and

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
a-flat minor F sharp and C sharp and

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.920 
a-flat minor F sharp and C sharp and
those<00:06:05.040> last<00:06:05.400> two<00:06:05.670> chords<00:06:06.000> go<00:06:06.390> by<00:06:06.570> really<00:06:06.810> fast

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
those last two chords go by really fast

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:16.430
