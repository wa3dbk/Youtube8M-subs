okay<00:00:00.480> now<00:00:00.690> we're<00:00:00.840> going<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.020> look<00:00:01.110> at<00:00:01.230> one-way

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
okay now we're going to look at one-way

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.340 
okay now we're going to look at one-way
streets<00:00:02.129> again<00:00:02.820> you<00:00:03.300> looked<00:00:03.629> hopefully<00:00:04.049> look

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
streets again you looked hopefully look

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.690 
streets again you looked hopefully look
to<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.560> emerging<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.040> turning<00:00:05.370> so<00:00:05.490> I'm<00:00:05.580> not

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
to the emerging and turning so I'm not

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.519 
to the emerging and turning so I'm not
going<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.879> go<00:00:05.970> through<00:00:06.210> all<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.750> MSP<00:00:07.259> SL

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
going to go through all that MSP SL

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.110 
going to go through all that MSP SL
routing<00:00:07.919> too<00:00:08.099> much<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> will<00:00:08.519> mention<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.970> bit

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
routing too much I will mention a bit

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.169 
routing too much I will mention a bit
but<00:00:09.360> obviously<00:00:09.719> got<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.200> carry<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.559> out<00:00:11.179> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
but obviously got to carry that out the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.640 
but obviously got to carry that out the
difference<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.599> one-way<00:00:12.990> streets<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.530> you

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
difference of one-way streets is you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.930 
difference of one-way streets is you
shouldn't<00:00:13.920> only<00:00:14.040> want<00:00:14.250> coming<00:00:14.490> toward<00:00:14.759> you

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
shouldn't only want coming toward you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.910 
shouldn't only want coming toward you
notice<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.960> word<00:00:16.080> shouldn't<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.650> we're

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
notice the word shouldn't that we're

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.250 
notice the word shouldn't that we're
still<00:00:17.100> looking<00:00:17.220> ahead<00:00:17.460> we're<00:00:17.730> still<00:00:17.940> planning

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
still looking ahead we're still planning

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.500 
still looking ahead we're still planning
particularly<00:00:19.260> cyclists<00:00:20.160> cycle<00:00:20.970> has<00:00:21.090> come<00:00:21.390> up

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
particularly cyclists cycle has come up

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.029 
particularly cyclists cycle has come up
one-way<00:00:21.779> streets<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> wrong<00:00:22.289> way<00:00:22.410> definitely

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
one-way streets the wrong way definitely

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.620 
one-way streets the wrong way definitely
we're<00:00:23.160> looking<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.490> them<00:00:23.609> particularly<00:00:24.390> when

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
we're looking for them particularly when

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.689 
we're looking for them particularly when
turning<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.350> one-way<00:00:25.650> streets<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.519> main

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
turning out or one-way streets the main

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.070 
turning out or one-way streets the main
difference<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.060> when<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.330> turn<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.900> can

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
difference is when we turn out we can

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.660 
difference is when we turn out we can
position<00:00:28.199> differently<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.369> if<00:00:29.429> we're<00:00:29.519> going

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
position differently so if we're going

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.160 
position differently so if we're going
left<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.150> normal<00:00:30.510> left<00:00:30.720> if<00:00:30.869> we're<00:00:31.019> going

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
left it's normal left if we're going

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
left it's normal left if we're going
straight<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.650> we'd<00:00:32.189> keep<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> left<00:00:32.759> unless

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
straight on we'd keep to the left unless

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.910 
straight on we'd keep to the left unless
it<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.270> much<00:00:33.420> otherwise<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.739> in

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it was much otherwise and really in

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.260 
it was much otherwise and really in
one-way<00:00:35.190> street<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.520> can't<00:00:35.790> tend<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.149> go

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
one-way street you can't tend to go

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.670 
one-way street you can't tend to go
straight<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:36.899> crossroads<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.410> tend<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
straight on at crossroads they tend to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.080 
straight on at crossroads they tend to
be<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.340> left<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.640> you'll<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
be right and left as you'll see in a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.639 
be right and left as you'll see in a
minute<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.809> might<00:00:39.960> better<00:00:40.110> go<00:00:40.260> straight<00:00:40.530> on

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
minute you might better go straight on

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.080 
minute you might better go straight on
and<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.219> turning<00:00:41.340> right<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.969> position

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
and for turning right we can position

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299 
and for turning right we can position
ourselves<00:00:42.329> well<00:00:42.930> over<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.620> unlike

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
ourselves well over to the right unlike

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.119 
ourselves well over to the right unlike
normally<00:00:44.760> because<00:00:45.510> if<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.750> don't<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.860> our

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
normally because if we don't one our

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.619 
normally because if we don't one our
vision<00:00:47.460> probably<00:00:47.730> won't<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.000> good<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.420> two

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
vision probably won't be as good and two

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
vision probably won't be as good and two
if<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> car<00:00:49.710> behind<00:00:49.950> might<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
if we don't the car behind might and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.770 
if we don't the car behind might and
then<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> find<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.180> boat<00:00:51.360> trying<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.660> turn

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
then you find a boat trying to turn

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.660 
then you find a boat trying to turn
right<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.289> we'll<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.070> happens<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.430> mate

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
right so we'll see what happens we mate

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.910 
right so we'll see what happens we mate
the<00:00:53.820> video<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.510> quite<00:00:54.690> interesting

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
the video it can be quite interesting

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.979 
the video it can be quite interesting
when<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> turn<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.430> one-way<00:00:56.969> street<00:00:57.360> again

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
when you turn into one-way street again

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.450 
when you turn into one-way street again
when<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> turn<00:00:58.440> right<00:00:58.680> into<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.160> one-way

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
when you turn right into a one-way

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.189 
when you turn right into a one-way
street<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.910> cut<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> corner<00:01:00.480> because

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
street you can cut the corner because

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.840 
street you can cut the corner because
there<00:01:01.350> isn't<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> corner<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> cut<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.640> still

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
there isn't the corner to cut it's still

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.039 
there isn't the corner to cut it's still
going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> live<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> still<00:01:03.840> could<00:01:03.960> be

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
going to live because it still could be

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.810 
going to live because it still could be
something<00:01:04.320> coming<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.799> again<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.760> too

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
something coming out again if you go too

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.670 
something coming out again if you go too
far<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.390> they'll<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.689> safe<00:01:06.990> may<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.290> further<00:01:07.500> up

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
far up they'll be safe may go further up

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
far up they'll be safe may go further up
you'll<00:01:08.220> give<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.490> behind<00:01:08.880> cut<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> corners

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you'll give your behind cut the corners

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.730 
you'll give your behind cut the corners
both<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> trying<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.320> down<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.530> road

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
both of you trying to go down the road

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
both of you trying to go down the road
that's<00:01:10.920> too<00:01:11.070> narrow<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.540> turn

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that's too narrow then so you do turn

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.030 
that's too narrow then so you do turn
right<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.200> soon<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:13.860> you've<00:01:13.950> got

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
right as soon as you can but you've got

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
right as soon as you can but you've got
to<00:01:14.130> make<00:01:14.280> sure<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.580> clear<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.330> clear<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
to make sure it's clear and clear and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.450 
to make sure it's clear and clear and
say<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> quick<00:01:16.979> examples

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
say it's going to be a quick examples

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.640 
say it's going to be a quick examples
here<00:01:17.700> okay<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:18.990> normal<00:01:19.290> things<00:01:19.439> are

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
here okay so there are normal things are

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.520 
here okay so there are normal things are
put<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.979> way<00:01:21.170> well<00:01:22.170> now<00:01:22.200> we're<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
put in a way well now we're going to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.749 
put in a way well now we're going to
take<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> next<00:01:22.979> left<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.520> one-way

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
take the next left this is a one-way

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.480 
take the next left this is a one-way
street<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.350> would<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.890> turn<00:01:26.040> left<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.430> an

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
street so I would just turn left as an

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
street so I would just turn left as an
almost<00:01:26.700> no<00:01:26.850> different<00:01:27.299> from<00:01:27.450> turning<00:01:27.869> left

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
almost no different from turning left

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
almost no different from turning left
from<00:01:28.110> into<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> two-way<00:01:29.340> street<00:01:29.400> left<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.030> no

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
from into a two-way street left is no

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.690 
from into a two-way street left is no
different<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.689> I'm<00:01:31.320> still<00:01:31.590> looking<00:01:31.979> for

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
different at all I'm still looking for

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.640 
different at all I'm still looking for
people<00:01:33.000> coming<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> other<00:01:33.329> way<00:01:33.479> down<00:01:34.470> these

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
people coming the other way down these

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.080 
people coming the other way down these
particular<00:01:35.009> ones<00:01:35.220> we've<00:01:35.400> got<00:01:35.430> speed<00:01:35.759> humps

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
particular ones we've got speed humps

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.370 
particular ones we've got speed humps
because<00:01:36.360> people<00:01:36.630> tend<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> speed<00:01:37.140> down

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
because people tend to speed down

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.910 
because people tend to speed down
one-way<00:01:38.070> streets<00:01:38.610> because

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
one-way streets because

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.679 
one-way streets because
they<00:01:40.490> presume<00:01:41.000> nothing's<00:01:41.270> going<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.450> come<00:01:41.600> the

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
they presume nothing's going to come the

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.090 
they presume nothing's going to come the
other<00:01:41.840> way<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.020> they<00:01:42.229> tend<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.439> go<00:01:42.560> faster<00:01:42.979> but

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
other way so they tend to go faster but

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.530 
other way so they tend to go faster but
Keeley's<00:01:43.400> could<00:01:43.610> still<00:01:43.820> run<00:01:43.939> out<00:01:44.119> on<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.330> side

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
Keeley's could still run out on the side

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.420 
Keeley's could still run out on the side
of<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.720> road<00:01:44.869> etc<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.590> probably<00:01:45.890> still<00:01:46.159> will

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
of the road etc and probably still will

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.130 
of the road etc and probably still will
more<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.060> because<00:01:47.360> again<00:01:47.390> they<00:01:47.750> think<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.080> was

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
more so because again they think I was

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.230 
more so because again they think I was
one<00:01:48.350> way<00:01:48.500> story<00:01:48.740> then<00:01:48.890> look<00:01:49.100> one<00:01:49.310> way<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:50.090> so

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
one way story then look one way and so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.510 
one way story then look one way and so
on<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.600> we're<00:01:51.560> going<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.740> go<00:01:51.799> right<00:01:52.070> at<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.399> end

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
on so we're going to go right at the end

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.389 
on so we're going to go right at the end
here<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.330> one<00:01:53.509> there<00:01:53.630> actually<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:55.100> can

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
here and this one there actually you can

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.740 
here and this one there actually you can
get<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.729> right<00:01:55.909> now<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.270> can't<00:01:56.509> get<00:01:56.630> the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
get in the right now you can't get the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.330 
get in the right now you can't get the
right-hand<00:01:57.140> side<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.380> we're<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.220> go

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
right-hand side so we're going to go

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.440 
right-hand side so we're going to go
right<00:01:58.549> I'm<00:01:58.670> gonna<00:01:58.850> have<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.000> use<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.240> left

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
right I'm gonna have to use the left

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.789 
right I'm gonna have to use the left
lane<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.840> would<00:01:59.930> normally<00:02:00.170> go<00:02:00.259> right<00:02:00.560> over<00:02:00.590> to

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
lane you would normally go right over to

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.429 
lane you would normally go right over to
the<00:02:00.920> right<00:02:00.950> but<00:02:01.310> they'd<00:02:01.460> put<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.439> protective

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
the right but they'd put and protective

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.990 
the right but they'd put and protective
barrier<00:02:03.799> in<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.979> way<00:02:04.009> for<00:02:04.310> some<00:02:04.430> reason<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:04.880> we

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
barrier in the way for some reason so we

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.760 
barrier in the way for some reason so we
just<00:02:05.119> need<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.330> be<00:02:05.450> aware<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.689> that<00:02:05.869> quite

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
just need to be aware of that quite

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.749 
just need to be aware of that quite
often<00:02:06.920> you'd<00:02:07.130> be<00:02:07.220> able<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.430> actually<00:02:07.520> get

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
often you'd be able to actually get

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.460 
often you'd be able to actually get
right<00:02:07.939> out<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.450> lane<00:02:08.660> hopefully<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.170> can<00:02:09.289> show

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
right out that lane hopefully I can show

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.290 
right out that lane hopefully I can show
you<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.709> in<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.860> minute<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.910> look<00:02:11.120> right

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
you that in a minute so you look right

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.000 
you that in a minute so you look right
around<00:02:11.599> as<00:02:11.780> normal<00:02:12.140> no<00:02:12.260> different<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.890> that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
around as normal no different to that

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.890 
around as normal no different to that
and<00:02:13.489> you've<00:02:13.610> got<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.819> see<00:02:14.269> what<00:02:14.420> type<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.660> road

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and you've got to see what type of road

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.600 
and you've got to see what type of road
you're<00:02:15.050> moving<00:02:15.319> into<00:02:15.470> as<00:02:15.709> well<00:02:15.890> because<00:02:16.100> that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
you're moving into as well because that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.220 
you're moving into as well because that
may<00:02:16.850> well<00:02:17.060> be<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.300> one-way<00:02:17.690> streets<00:02:18.019> are<00:02:18.140> going

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
may well be a one-way streets are going

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.330 
may well be a one-way streets are going
to<00:02:18.319> make<00:02:18.440> sure<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.620> turn<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:18.980> right<00:02:19.160> way

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
to make sure you turn in the right way

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.720 
to make sure you turn in the right way
into<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:21.230> we're<00:02:21.650> going<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.799> go<00:02:22.010> left<00:02:22.459> here

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
into it so we're going to go left here

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.400 
into it so we're going to go left here
so<00:02:22.940> again<00:02:23.330> two<00:02:23.510> one-way<00:02:23.720> strength<00:02:24.230> now

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
so again two one-way strength now

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.680 
so again two one-way strength now
different<00:02:24.799> when<00:02:24.920> turning<00:02:25.160> left<00:02:25.430> as<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.569> can

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
different when turning left as you can

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.880 
different when turning left as you can
see<00:02:26.780> it's<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> one-way<00:02:27.290> street

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
see it's a one-way street

see it's a one-way street
this<00:02:28.580> cars<00:02:28.819> placed<00:02:29.060> in<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.239> wrong<00:02:29.360> way<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:30.380> I

that<00:02:38.360> people<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:38.840> not<00:02:39.049> always<00:02:39.350> do<00:02:40.130> what<00:02:40.280> they

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
that people do not always do what they

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.220 
that people do not always do what they
should<00:02:40.519> in<00:02:40.640> one-way<00:02:40.970> streets<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.989> you've<00:02:42.110> got

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
should in one-way streets so you've got

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.080 
should in one-way streets so you've got
to<00:02:42.319> be<00:02:42.440> very<00:02:42.709> very<00:02:43.190> careful<00:02:45.820> because<00:02:46.820> they

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
to be very very careful because they

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.190 
to be very very careful because they
shouldn't<00:02:47.390> come<00:02:47.480> up<00:02:47.600> here<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.810> doesn't<00:02:47.959> mean

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
shouldn't come up here it doesn't mean

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.360 
shouldn't come up here it doesn't mean
that<00:02:48.230> specifically<00:02:48.769> they've<00:02:48.950> just<00:02:49.130> changed

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
that specifically they've just changed

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.160 
that specifically they've just changed
them<00:02:49.700> when<00:02:50.239> they<00:02:50.359> made<00:02:50.570> all<00:02:50.720> these<00:02:50.840> streets

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
them when they made all these streets

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.539 
them when they made all these streets
one-way<00:02:51.500> streets<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.980> first<00:02:52.220> couple<00:02:52.489> of

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
one-way streets the first couple of

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.009 
one-way streets the first couple of
weeks<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.850> was<00:02:52.940> very<00:02:53.209> interesting<00:02:53.630> because

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
weeks it was very interesting because

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.870 
weeks it was very interesting because
you<00:02:54.650> had<00:02:54.769> people<00:02:54.980> coming<00:02:55.310> out<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.579> wrong<00:02:55.609> way

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
you had people coming out the wrong way

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.479 
you had people coming out the wrong way
all<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.450> time<00:02:56.680> they<00:02:57.680> were<00:02:57.739> just<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.430> know

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
all the time they were just you know

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.890 
all the time they were just you know
just<00:02:58.760> not<00:02:58.910> looking<00:02:59.209> at<00:02:59.359> the<00:02:59.480> signs<00:02:59.720> because

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
just not looking at the signs because

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.750 
just not looking at the signs because
the<00:03:00.079> roads<00:03:00.320> had<00:03:00.470> changed

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.550 

so<00:03:05.360> we're<00:03:05.540> going<00:03:05.629> to<00:03:05.690> go<00:03:05.810> right<00:03:06.050> here<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:06.470> we

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
so we're going to go right here so we

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.649 
so we're going to go right here so we
check<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.310> middle<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.790> right<00:03:08.090> mirror<00:03:08.360> and

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
check the middle and right mirror and

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.210 
check the middle and right mirror and
see<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:09.319> time<00:03:09.530> we're<00:03:09.650> gonna<00:03:09.739> go<00:03:09.799> over<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.129> the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
see this time we're gonna go over to the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.949 
see this time we're gonna go over to the
right<00:03:10.400> because<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.120> one-way<00:03:11.450> street<00:03:11.750> then

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
right because the one-way street then

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:12.910 
right because the one-way street then
nothing<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.290> going<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.470> come<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:12.769> hopefully

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
nothing is going to come in hopefully

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.039 
nothing is going to come in hopefully
but<00:03:13.879> even<00:03:14.090> if<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.269> does<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.540> still<00:03:14.780> can<00:03:14.900> go<00:03:14.989> to

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
but even if it does we still can go to

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.660 
but even if it does we still can go to
the<00:03:15.200> right<00:03:15.409> as<00:03:15.830> long<00:03:15.950> as<00:03:16.040> we're<00:03:16.159> looking<00:03:16.459> for

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.850 

so<00:04:27.570> going<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.750> go<00:04:27.810> left<00:04:28.110> here<00:04:28.290> can<00:04:28.560> we<00:04:28.650> go<00:04:28.740> into

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
so going to go left here can we go into

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.570 
so going to go left here can we go into
a<00:04:28.980> one-way<00:04:29.340> street<00:04:30.950> so<00:04:31.950> it's<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.310> normal

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
a one-way street so it's just a normal

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.090 
a one-way street so it's just a normal
left<00:04:32.730> turn<00:04:32.970> no<00:04:33.210> no<00:04:33.780> difference<00:04:34.200> there<00:04:34.440> again

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
left turn no no difference there again

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.830 
left turn no no difference there again
we<00:04:35.250> are<00:04:35.400> still<00:04:35.640> looking<00:04:35.820> for<00:04:36.000> cars<00:04:36.360> coming<00:04:36.720> out

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
we are still looking for cars coming out

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.120 
we are still looking for cars coming out
people<00:04:37.110> tend<00:04:37.290> about<00:04:37.410> rubbed<00:04:37.650> corners

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
people tend about rubbed corners

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.740 
people tend about rubbed corners
thinking<00:04:38.580> oh<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:38.730> doesn't<00:04:39.480> matter<00:04:39.630> because

you can go around them because we've

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.400

wrong way up and don't you say you've
got<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.360> look<00:04:45.510> for<00:04:45.720> that<00:04:47.270> at<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.360> end<00:04:48.510> we're

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
got to look for that at the end we're

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.780 
got to look for that at the end we're
going<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.900> go<00:04:49.020> right<00:04:49.340> it's<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.430> one-way<00:04:50.760> street

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
going to go right it's a one-way street

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.700 
going to go right it's a one-way street
so<00:04:51.450> we're<00:04:51.600> going<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.810> go<00:04:51.930> over<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.500> right

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.290 

coughing<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.430> get<00:04:56.520> people<00:04:56.759> parking<00:04:57.090> right

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
coughing to get people parking right

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.760 
coughing to get people parking right
after<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.660> corners<00:04:58.020> of<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.229> set<00:04:58.440> which<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.740> a

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
after the corners of the set which is a

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.230 
after the corners of the set which is a
bit<00:04:58.949> of<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.100> pain<00:04:59.340> because<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.790> doesn't<00:05:00.060> allow

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
bit of a pain because it doesn't allow

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.600 
bit of a pain because it doesn't allow
the<00:05:00.270> flow<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:00.600> traffic

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
the flow of traffic

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.379 
the flow of traffic
but<00:05:02.610> we're<00:05:02.699> going<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:02.850> get<00:05:02.970> us<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.120> right<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
but we're going to get us the right the

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.279 
but we're going to get us the right the
best<00:05:03.630> we<00:05:03.780> can<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:05.509> it<00:05:06.509> just<00:05:06.660> feels<00:05:06.870> weird<00:05:06.930> the

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
best we can and it just feels weird the

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.170 
best we can and it just feels weird the
first<00:05:07.470> few<00:05:07.650> times<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:07.919> do<00:05:08.100> it<00:05:08.250> but<00:05:08.759> just<00:05:08.820> make

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
first few times you do it but just make

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.580 
first few times you do it but just make
sure<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.389> is<00:05:09.509> a<00:05:09.539> one-way<00:05:09.930> street<00:05:09.960> don't<00:05:10.380> are<00:05:10.500> we

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
sure it is a one-way street don't are we

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.900 
sure it is a one-way street don't are we
doing<00:05:10.800> if<00:05:10.919> it's<00:05:11.070> a<00:05:11.130> two-way<00:05:11.460> street

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
doing if it's a two-way street

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:20.239 
doing if it's a two-way street
because<00:05:12.419> that<00:05:12.570> could<00:05:12.720> be<00:05:12.870> interesting

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:20.249 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.479 

oh<00:05:20.929> just<00:05:21.929> looking<00:05:22.169> as<00:05:22.439> per<00:05:22.679> normal<00:05:22.829> again<00:05:23.279> just

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:23.489 
oh just looking as per normal again just

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.129 
oh just looking as per normal again just
making<00:05:23.669> sure<00:05:23.879> we<00:05:23.999> turn<00:05:24.179> the<00:05:24.389> correct<00:05:24.659> way<00:05:24.839> into

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
making sure we turn the correct way into

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.019 
making sure we turn the correct way into
the<00:05:25.259> street<00:05:25.529> because<00:05:26.249> the<00:05:26.339> one<00:05:26.489> along<00:05:26.699> the<00:05:26.819> top

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
the street because the one along the top

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.849 
the street because the one along the top
might<00:05:27.209> be<00:05:27.329> in<00:05:27.419> one<00:05:27.539> way<00:05:27.719> as<00:05:27.779> well<00:05:28.079> going<00:05:28.679> to<00:05:28.739> go

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:28.859 
might be in one way as well going to go

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:32.659 
might be in one way as well going to go
right<00:05:29.129> here<00:05:29.549> and<00:05:30.299> this<00:05:31.049> is<00:05:31.109> a<00:05:31.639> one-way<00:05:32.639> street

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
right here and this is a one-way street

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.219 
right here and this is a one-way street
so<00:05:33.539> when<00:05:33.749> we<00:05:33.869> turn<00:05:34.109> I<00:05:34.469> can<00:05:35.189> turn<00:05:35.569> now<00:05:36.569> I<00:05:36.839> don't

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
so when we turn I can turn now I don't

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.809 
so when we turn I can turn now I don't
need<00:05:37.409> to<00:05:37.529> wait<00:05:37.709> as<00:05:37.979> long<00:05:38.009> as<00:05:38.129> I<00:05:38.309> check<00:05:38.579> I've

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
need to wait as long as I check I've

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.789 
need to wait as long as I check I've
always<00:05:39.119> got<00:05:39.269> to<00:05:39.359> check<00:05:39.569> I<00:05:39.839> couldn't<00:05:40.529> really<00:05:40.649> go

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:40.799 
always got to check I couldn't really go

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:41.869 
always got to check I couldn't really go
further<00:05:41.009> up<00:05:41.129> there<00:05:41.339> anyway<00:05:41.489> because<00:05:41.639> some

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:41.879 
further up there anyway because some

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.029 
further up there anyway because some
numpties<00:05:42.269> part<00:05:42.479> in<00:05:42.629> the<00:05:42.719> gone<00:05:42.929> and<00:05:43.109> so<00:05:43.229> but

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
numpties part in the gone and so but

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.889 
numpties part in the gone and so but
when<00:05:44.159> you<00:05:44.249> turn<00:05:44.399> right<00:05:44.729> you<00:05:45.209> can<00:05:45.359> turn<00:05:45.539> earlier

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:45.899 
when you turn right you can turn earlier

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:48.019 
when you turn right you can turn earlier
basically<00:05:46.409> can<00:05:46.529> turn<00:05:46.799> straightaway<00:05:47.639> and<00:05:47.879> when

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
basically can turn straightaway and when

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.059 
basically can turn straightaway and when
you<00:05:48.119> emerge<00:05:48.449> you<00:05:49.229> can<00:05:49.379> keep<00:05:49.559> over<00:05:49.859> to<00:05:49.949> the

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
you emerge you can keep over to the

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:51.499 
you emerge you can keep over to the
right<00:05:50.249> as<00:05:50.459> the<00:05:50.609> main<00:05:50.759> difference<00:05:51.089> is<00:05:51.239> I'm<00:05:51.359> just

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
right as the main difference is I'm just

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.929 
right as the main difference is I'm just
going<00:05:51.629> to<00:05:51.659> do<00:05:51.749> one<00:05:51.929> more<00:05:51.959> right<00:05:52.289> turn<00:05:52.909> from<00:05:53.909> a

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:53.939 
going to do one more right turn from a

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:55.969 
going to do one more right turn from a
major<00:05:54.209> to<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.509> minor<00:05:54.749> and<00:05:55.169> say<00:05:55.349> look<00:05:55.619> this<00:05:55.739> one's

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
major to a minor and say look this one's

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.949 
major to a minor and say look this one's
that<00:05:56.339> put<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.939> baradar<00:05:57.449> the<00:05:57.599> end<00:05:57.749> I<00:05:57.839> think

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:57.959 
that put the baradar the end I think

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:59.899 
that put the baradar the end I think
that's<00:05:58.169> to<00:05:58.259> stop<00:05:58.469> you<00:05:58.649> to<00:05:59.339> make<00:05:59.489> you<00:05:59.610> realise

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
that's to stop you to make you realise

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.850 
that's to stop you to make you realise
you<00:05:59.999> can't<00:06:00.029> go<00:06:00.269> straight<00:06:00.599> on<00:06:00.809> for<00:06:01.349> him<00:06:01.529> to<00:06:01.709> make

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
you can't go straight on for him to make

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.469 
you can't go straight on for him to make
sure<00:06:01.889> we<00:06:02.129> make<00:06:02.429> him<00:06:02.639> realize<00:06:02.939> he<00:06:03.089> can't<00:06:03.299> come

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
sure we make him realize he can't come

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.329 
sure we make him realize he can't come
straight<00:06:03.719> on<00:06:03.749> but<00:06:04.559> it's<00:06:04.679> not<00:06:04.709> signaling<00:06:05.189> so

attention<00:06:14.269> unfortunately<00:06:15.269> doesn't<00:06:15.419> mean

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
attention unfortunately doesn't mean

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.719 
attention unfortunately doesn't mean
everyone<00:06:15.839> else<00:06:15.959> is<00:06:16.309> so<00:06:17.309> we're<00:06:17.429> going<00:06:17.519> to<00:06:17.579> go

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
everyone else is so we're going to go

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.489 
everyone else is so we're going to go
right<00:06:17.999> here<00:06:18.389> we're<00:06:18.629> in<00:06:18.719> a<00:06:18.779> two-way<00:06:19.139> street<00:06:19.199> at

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:19.499 
right here we're in a two-way street at

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:20.929 
right here we're in a two-way street at
the<00:06:19.559> moment<00:06:19.889> so<00:06:19.949> we<00:06:19.979> must<00:06:20.189> keep<00:06:20.369> over<00:06:20.699> to<00:06:20.819> the

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:20.939 
the moment so we must keep over to the

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:24.229 
the moment so we must keep over to the
left-hand<00:06:21.329> side<00:06:21.529> and<00:06:22.529> when<00:06:22.679> I<00:06:22.709> turn<00:06:23.239> will

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:24.239 
left-hand side and when I turn will

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:26.269 
left-hand side and when I turn will
check<00:06:24.479> that<00:06:24.509> he's<00:06:25.079> stopping<00:06:25.619> on<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:26.009> turn

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
check that he's stopping on the turn

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.919 
check that he's stopping on the turn
straightaway<00:06:26.729> because<00:06:27.029> it<00:06:27.299> is<00:06:27.419> a<00:06:27.449> one-way<00:06:27.869> to

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:27.929 
straightaway because it is a one-way to

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.549 
straightaway because it is a one-way to
drink<00:06:29.059> so<00:06:30.059> I<00:06:30.119> was<00:06:30.209> going<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:30.419> pull<00:06:30.539> up<00:06:30.629> here<00:06:30.809> so

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:31.559 
drink so I was going to pull up here so

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:32.859 
drink so I was going to pull up here so
that's<00:06:31.709> it<00:06:31.860> really<00:06:32.159> quite<00:06:32.459> straightforward

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:32.869 
that's it really quite straightforward

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:36.799 
that's it really quite straightforward
but<00:06:33.869> you<00:06:34.110> must<00:06:35.149> really<00:06:36.149> most<00:06:36.449> important

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:36.809 
but you must really most important

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:37.909 
but you must really most important
things<00:06:36.959> realized<00:06:37.319> if<00:06:37.439> you<00:06:37.529> know<00:06:37.619> one-way

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
things realized if you know one-way

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.859 
things realized if you know one-way
street<00:06:38.189> or<00:06:38.309> not<00:06:38.459> because<00:06:38.789> some<00:06:39.239> are<00:06:39.269> someone

00:06:39.859 --> 00:06:39.869 
street or not because some are someone

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:42.019 
street or not because some are someone
and<00:06:40.110> it<00:06:40.169> can<00:06:40.529> be<00:06:40.619> quite<00:06:40.829> confusing<00:06:41.099> so<00:06:41.489> we're

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:42.029 
and it can be quite confusing so we're

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:43.489 
and it can be quite confusing so we're
going<00:06:42.269> out<00:06:42.360> practice<00:06:42.839> and<00:06:42.929> I'm<00:06:43.019> looking<00:06:43.289> them

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:43.499 
going out practice and I'm looking them

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:45.739 
going out practice and I'm looking them
but<00:06:43.649> make<00:06:44.459> sure<00:06:44.489> you<00:06:45.089> know<00:06:45.119> if<00:06:45.329> you're<00:06:45.479> in<00:06:45.569> one

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:45.749 
but make sure you know if you're in one

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:49.069 
but make sure you know if you're in one
or<00:06:45.869> not<00:06:46.079> okay<00:06:46.769> thank<00:06:47.009> you
