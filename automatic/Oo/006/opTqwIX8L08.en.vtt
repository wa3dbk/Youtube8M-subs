00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.190
 and very good to all kids I am a boy and 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.889
 Today I 'm going to teach you a trick with 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.600
 that you are going to be able to break this stone of 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.430
 here 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.840
 and good before you start with the trick os 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.210
 I want to say that this week I do not think that 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.940
 I can upload videos since I have exams 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.210
 and you have to study now better if there was 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.510
 some tutorial of these rapids but in 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.870
 long videos and throughout the week 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.050
 no I do not think it can go up right now 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.140
 we go with the trick that is to break 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.010
 this stone once rock and it's just 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.559
 with a door 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.770
 I'm in the snapshot is a trick that 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.780
 will be able to do 1.8 if they do not arrange 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.720
 this bug and that is when you put a 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.110
 door the door occupies two blocks the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.239
 first nothing will happen and the block 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.620
 from above but we now put 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.080
 a door here the door of the put 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.460
 here the block above the door what 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.000
 that is over the door is going to 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.910
 disappear 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.700
 then let's see it and look at what 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.729
 You see, it has just disappeared 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.250
 and this we could do with all the 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.270
 blocks I do not know then with the rock time to 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.750
 that you see that this works 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.020
 this would be this would be when we want 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.530
 break something that is below us 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.990
 so to speak and there is another trick that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.990
 I'm going to do it in him 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.110
 the cne of at the top is worth 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.210
 so now I cut the video here and in 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.830
 a moment and I return well we are already 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.560
 back in sneijder I'm sorry it goes with 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.000
 a little on the side because when recording I'm going 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.190
 a little bit worse 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.440
 with the trick of now let's be able to 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.710
 break the truth that is below 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.890
 We are going to put four 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.480
 earth blocks 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.310
 we need a dark oak bud 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.500
 let's put this here and now we have 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.840
 make it grow when it has grown 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.790
 we have to break the wood of 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.800
 that leaves nothing else from the earth these 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.239
 four blocks here and we have to 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.220
 put back the buds 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.319
 we have to make it grow again and 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.319
 so all the time until something happens 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.110
 here as you just saw is what they 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.879
 He said rather than continue growing for 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.640
 up has grown to the side and towards 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:48.319
 down this time I go down 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.660
 the sound now I'm going to remove all the 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.560
 leaves 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:57.030
 and look where the trunk is here is the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.030
 trunk not who is 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.730
 to see here 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:09.310
 here here is the trunk is worth then 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.459
 what has done this and here also what 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.160
 what's going to happen with this is that it has 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:20.069
 got into the rock time now we 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:23.159
 we will be able to break what they see here 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:27.150
 to see around here, we would not go back 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:30.329
 to do the trick until it comes out 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.910
 here the image has come back here again 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.560
 was 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.580
 of breaking 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.050
 and we could go down 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.680
 this 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.080
 This trick also serves in the world 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.950
 normal to break the time what there is 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.140
 below us 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.879
 but I do not think I want to do it there 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.099
 nobody and something simply this because in 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.959
 survival I do not know maybe I 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.450
 same cilic I'm doing 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.430
 I make a house on top and that trick 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.660
 Well, it can come well this has been all 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.470
 for today and I hope you liked it and 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.470
 until the next video
