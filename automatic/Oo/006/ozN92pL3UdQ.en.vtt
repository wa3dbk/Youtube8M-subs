through it right now
so<00:00:49.860> add<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:52.010> cylinder<00:00:54.980> now<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> get

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
so add a cylinder now I'm going to get

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.580 
so add a cylinder now I'm going to get
the<00:00:57.180> cylinder<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> side<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> could<00:00:58.500> get

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the cylinder on the side so I could get

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.470 
the cylinder on the side so I could get
a<00:00:58.649> straight<00:00:59.070> hole<00:00:59.340> through<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.270> can

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
a straight hole through it but you can

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.210 
a straight hole through it but you can
just<00:01:00.660> keep<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.020> sideways<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.559> whatever<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
just keep it sideways or whatever so to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.800 
just keep it sideways or whatever so to
get<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> side<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:06.659> know<00:01:06.720> how

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
get it on the side is you don't know how

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.810 
get it on the side is you don't know how
to<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.200> maybe<00:01:07.560> should<00:01:08.689> minimize<00:01:09.689> this

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
to do that maybe should minimize this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.060 
to do that maybe should minimize this
alright<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.439> outside

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
alright so to get it on outside

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.850 
alright so to get it on outside
you<00:01:14.760> press<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:16.080> thing<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.770> will

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you press this this thing that will

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
you press this this thing that will
click<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> square<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.200> as<00:01:19.200> you've<00:01:19.409> said

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
click a square and as you've said

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.310 
click a square and as you've said
location<00:01:20.189> rotation<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.790> scale<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.229> on

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
location rotation and scale so on

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.410 
location rotation and scale so on
rotation<00:01:23.180> this<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.340> x<00:01:26.340> axis<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.390> y

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
rotation this is the x axis and the y

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.140 
rotation this is the x axis and the y
axis<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> z<00:01:28.290> axis

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
axis and the z axis

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.090 
axis and the z axis
so<00:01:31.280> if<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:32.909> here

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
so if you can see right here

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.380 
so if you can see right here
Imus<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.430> screen<00:01:35.670> should<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> little

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
Imus on your screen should have a little

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.740 
Imus on your screen should have a little
chart<00:01:36.740> say<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> side<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:39.689> screen

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
chart say up on the side your screen

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.380 
chart say up on the side your screen
should<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.470> chart<00:01:40.650> saying<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
should have a little chart saying if the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.830 
should have a little chart saying if the
z<00:01:42.659> axis<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.290> blue<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.520> y<00:01:44.700> axis<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.329> green<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
z axis is blue the y axis is green and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.499 
z axis is blue the y axis is green and
the<00:01:46.200> x<00:01:46.320> axis<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.939> red<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:50.060> we're<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> tilt

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the x axis is red so we're going to tilt

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.230 
the x axis is red so we're going to tilt
it<00:01:51.750> sideways<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.130> flat<00:01:53.430> straight<00:01:53.820> so

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it sideways so it's flat straight so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.819 
it sideways so it's flat straight so
we'll<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> bond<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:55.100> around<00:01:56.100> 9<00:01:56.369> degrees

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
we'll get the bond one around 9 degrees

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:06.370 
we'll get the bond one around 9 degrees
this<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.100> degrees<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.890> top<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.219> then

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.840 

now<00:02:07.380> pull<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:09.530> cylinder<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.740> just<00:02:11.490> put<00:02:11.730> it

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
now pull the cylinder and just put it

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.880 
now pull the cylinder and just put it
right<00:02:11.880> inside<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.650> square<00:02:14.100> right<00:02:14.370> there

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
right inside the the square right there

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.110 
right inside the the square right there
now<00:02:16.890> I'm<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.190> make<00:02:17.280> my<00:02:17.460> cylinder<00:02:17.790> bigger

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
now I'm going to make my cylinder bigger

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.220 
now I'm going to make my cylinder bigger
so<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.900> get<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> complete<00:02:19.620> through<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:21.230> can

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
so I can get a complete through I can

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.010 
so I can get a complete through I can
get<00:02:22.440> completely<00:02:22.950> through<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.580> block<00:02:23.960> so<00:02:24.960> I'm

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
get completely through the block so I'm
