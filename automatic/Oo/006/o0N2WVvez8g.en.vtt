engine might float and it might not
start<00:01:20.970> straight<00:01:21.210> away<00:01:21.680> that's<00:01:22.680> okay<00:01:23.070> leave<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
start straight away that's okay leave it

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.880 
start straight away that's okay leave it
for<00:01:23.520> ten<00:01:23.700> minutes<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:25.380> should<00:01:25.590> start

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
for ten minutes and and should start

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.880 
for ten minutes and and should start
just<00:01:26.549> by<00:01:27.110> unless<00:01:28.110> something<00:01:28.500> else<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> wrong

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
just by unless something else is wrong

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.840 
just by unless something else is wrong
with<00:01:29.040> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.280 

now<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.910> wider<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.390> handlebars<00:01:34.930> you've<00:01:35.110> got

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
now the wider the handlebars you've got

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.600 
now the wider the handlebars you've got
the<00:01:35.470> better<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.830> leverage<00:01:36.160> you'll<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.460> to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
the better the leverage you'll have to

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.100 
the better the leverage you'll have to
lift<00:01:36.760> it<00:01:36.910> up<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.300> works<00:01:37.480> even<00:01:37.690> better<00:01:37.960> on

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
lift it up so it works even better on

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.690 
lift it up so it works even better on
naked<00:01:38.470> bikes<00:01:38.680> and<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:38.980> does<00:01:39.100> on<00:01:39.220> race<00:01:39.430> style

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
naked bikes and it does on race style

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.720 
naked bikes and it does on race style
bikes<00:01:40.030> but<00:01:40.900> in<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.770> little<00:01:42.010> workshop<00:01:42.370> we<00:01:42.580> ran

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
bikes but in a little workshop we ran

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.660 
bikes but in a little workshop we ran
recently<00:01:43.470> every<00:01:44.470> single<00:01:44.830> person<00:01:45.190> was<00:01:45.370> able<00:01:45.520> to

v-strom 650 this is a 200 kilo bike it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.250 
v-strom 650 this is a 200 kilo bike it
works<00:01:54.460> just<00:01:55.120> as<00:01:55.300> well<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:55.480> all<00:01:55.720> sorts<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.050> bikes

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
works just as well on all sorts of bikes

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.710 
works just as well on all sorts of bikes
we<00:01:56.440> found<00:01:56.650> out<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.460> much<00:01:57.790> much<00:01:58.060> better<00:01:58.270> than

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
we found out and much much better than

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.560 
we found out and much much better than
they<00:01:58.960> turn<00:01:59.560> around<00:01:59.680> backwards<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:00.450> lift<00:02:01.450> it

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
they turn around backwards and lift it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.300 
they turn around backwards and lift it
up<00:02:01.690> that<00:02:01.840> way<00:02:01.990> kind<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.380> kind<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.010> technique

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
up that way kind of kind of technique

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.430 
up that way kind of kind of technique
the<00:02:04.180> best<00:02:04.360> way<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.540> learn<00:02:04.810> if<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.050> can<00:02:05.200> do<00:02:05.320> it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
the best way to learn if you can do it

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.680 
the best way to learn if you can do it
is<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:06.100> give<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.340> try<00:02:06.580> get<00:02:07.270> somebody's
