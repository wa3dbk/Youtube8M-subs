 Hello everyone, welcome this 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.120
 a tip of minecraft mode palermo 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.440
 branched out 1.87 day a lot 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.480
 interesting and very simple as 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.519
 you know the 18 and 7 are vanilla fashions 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.860
 guys then let's go see that one 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.100
 of today made by red engineer automatic 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.199
 of fan one command kids is then 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.699
 let's see how koman works 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.820
 block come to me 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.460
 let's try to place ctrl v here with the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 command that you will find in description red 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.410
 I'm a blog to give our input 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.120
 director and let's read ours 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.430
 shack let's see it then says 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.820
 of origin reforms arguments in minecraft 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.180
 youtube all the rest and tells us command 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.340
 auto farm ingegni art craft the rai demos 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.030
 click for information then 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.140
 we have to find 25 pieces on the ground 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.219
 then in york then we have to throw 3 o 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.250
 then we said 2 dispensers and the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.100
 our beautiful of amon dax and reforms 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 who we are against the boys farmers 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.479
 look now I walk away for safety 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.080
 because I care about the beautiful 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.299
 We like the commands of things on the ground 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.430
 well it is generated in our farm of 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.950
 saplings then how do you do it 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.659
 functional we need the kind of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.110
 solar panel and that are ours 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.509
 beautiful light sensors ok how it is 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.119
 put if they put me from 1 to 5 here 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.619
 behind to give energy these take 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.150
 electricity in this way 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.939
 this machinery 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.380
 here we have the lauper from which I threw 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.960
 saplings that recovers and here those who 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.689
 therefore leaves it very particular see it 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.390
 they know the pieces of wood and John 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:50.970
 fantastic sapling true then let's go 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.149
 to approve sapling ok hoc which is put 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.930
 only one planted one that 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.740
 I'm stupid probable then others know 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.740
 bling we put 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.170
 ok daje here they are that list should 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.910
 start planting them let's see some 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.700
 here he is, he was enough to wait 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.800
 that our sun sensors could hear 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.860
 the sun then more or less at set time 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.450
 5,000 when he looks up and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.250
 this is perhaps a small defect that i 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.170
 sensors only sense electricity 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.300
 when the sun stalls is planting ai 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.840
 our beautiful saplings so what? 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.450
 let's go and do something nice bon miur 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.920
 who it is then I make it grow 1 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.730
 look guys started at 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.380
 cut it look at the whole part 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.850
 superior remained only and basic praise 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.310
 here he did not cut you were planted 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.230
 the tree look that cool or am 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.630
 left the leaves from the leaves he who 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.880
 cascano takes back the saplings and them 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.240
 it throws back on the farma so it re plant 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.030
 immediately gigi is great guys 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:04.200
 the vain functioning plant we see 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.200
 a little will cut 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.080
 we try to do so admits the do 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.790
 will pass the so-called from here it is 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.370
 when the water course passes over it 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.160
 cut the wood 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.519
 look at the town and finish the logs 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.200
 here and isab language also collects 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.989
 apples guys don't worry I live a 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.519
 put in praise to destroy 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.069
 all this gimmick is enough to break 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.620
 the part below and we will fall back on the 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.290
 our three pharma we can 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.750
 reuse and move boys comfortable 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.880
 true very convenient i would say okay guys 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.650
 this was today's vanilla mode made by 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.150
 the red ingenieur I hope you enjoyed 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.140
 see you in the next installment of the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.140
 fashions hi guys
