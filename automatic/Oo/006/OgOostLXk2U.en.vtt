00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 here is a video about the cure and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.009
 bodybuilding sessions 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.740
 can we have a good session of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.120
 bodybuilding within an hour is it 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.190
 true that one must never go beyond 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.420
 error because the increase of courtisols 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.809
 is not good for the design 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.809
 muscular 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.050
 a few days ago I asked the 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.580
 youth on my facebook page communicating 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.500
 he spent in the room and most 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.119
 answered me 1h30 to 2h put 1h30 to 2h that 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.829
 feel that for the most part the goal is 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.019
 weight loss or construction 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.559
 muscle honestly two years it's 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.750
 too much 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.489
 this you pass 30 anyway read to the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.710
 end of science to do cardio and 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.629
 again or you do a program 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.920
 oriented towards strength and that you have 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.239
 need to take 3 4 minutes and 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.050
 recovery between each series and 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.210
 each exercise 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.580
 there you can do a session of two 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.049
 hours otherwise you never need to 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.760
 to make a science that goes beyond the inner 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.559
 15 there are 30 maximum 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.420
 if you think more than an hour and a half to 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.010
 the room it's probably because you 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.140
 recover too much between the exercises and 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.390
 the series or that you spend your time at 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.369
 discuss and therefore patience is not 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.600
 quite intense it's been two months since I 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.830
 do science that looks like that 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.840
 and I never go beyond 1:15 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.670
 it's an idea heater man 4 exercises 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.920
 three sets of three repetitions with 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.200
 two minutes of recovery alone 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.289
 exercise with the warm up charge and 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.079
 unload the bar takes 10 minutes so 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.630
 the four exercises 40 minutes a 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:33.259
 three exercises 3,4 series of six reviews 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.369
 repetition only takes 15 to 20 minutes so 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.679
 total 1h10 a program with this 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.119
 exercise it barely exceeds theirs a 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.289
 program a little more classic and the 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.289
 majority of people follow 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.569
 would look like that so with 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.060
 warming up 8 exercise t4 series 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.219
 of stretching the nap does not exceed 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.600
 linear and a half so I do not understand 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.729
 not what people do for two 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.749
 hours at the hall then there are people 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.420
 who say that we must not go beyond 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.759
 45 minutes or maximum one hour to 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.679
 the cardboard room and and social begin 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.539
 to decrease and a rate of cortisol 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.670
 increases and then in the day sometimes 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.050
 cortisone is never stable 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.430
 and when for example you are stressed for 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.470
 an examination or for an interview 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.569
 hired or if in the life of all 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.850
 days it's not going too much guess what 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.030
 other cortisol is going to be elevated 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.530
 so it's not just at the end of the session 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.819
 does it all for a few minutes or 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.400
 a few hours of a rate of 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.319
 testosterone hgh growth hormone 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.689
 roanne or cortisone 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.430
 - rate decreases has no consequence 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.139
 either loss or growth 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.760
 muscular 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.329
 if you do not believe me that your skin 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.430
 research 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.889
 but I never say anything so 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.989
 I'm not sure at least 99 for that 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.969
 there is a huge difference between a 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.489
 increase and decrease that lasts 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.349
 a few hours and an increase or 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.510
 decrease that lasts a few days and 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.639
 a few weeks after your science of 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.900
 men move but it does not last 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.760
 long time and so has no 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.219
 consequences when you have a 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.689
 increase or decrease your body 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.609
 do everything for it to come back to a 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.799
 stable level the fastest 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.329
 possible yes this is currently a 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.769
 the one that has the most effect on the 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.959
 muscle building is not the 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.639
 testosterone when being a 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.459
 testosterone level increases or decreases 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.079
 during or after the session has no 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.939
 importance 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.129
 on the other hand cortisol which is not a 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.299
 anabolic hormone is much more 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.609
 important for construction 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.989
 muscular if I take two individuals 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.540
 both are more or less the same 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.949
 science fiction in arms one by one 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.370
 increase of short teaser at the end of 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.680
 the session 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.470
 when it got a little more intense 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.540
 report to the other in your opinion who had the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.549
 best session and who is going to have a 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.919
 best hormonal response and who is going 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.030
 build more muscles yes that's 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.199
 whoever has an increase of 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.780
 courtiers at the end of the session 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.699
 to summarize who does not need it at all 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.909
 to make a science that exceeds 1h 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:54.379
 1h 15 maximum is the case is that you 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.359
 trolling too much and that you have there this is 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.650
 not intense enough and when you are told 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.970
 that it's not good becomes a sitting 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.900
 which lasts more than an hour for 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.479
 any reason 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.859
 no it's not true the changes 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.989
 hormones that will only last a few 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.310
 hours really have no influence 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.199
 on the results obtained 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.159
 so you do not need to be afraid 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.859
 just because you made a 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.879
 science that lasted more culinary thank you 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.879
 and the next video 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.579
