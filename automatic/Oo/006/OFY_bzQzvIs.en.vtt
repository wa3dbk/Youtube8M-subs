I'm<00:00:11.559> going<00:00:11.650> to<00:00:11.770> be<00:00:11.830> talking<00:00:12.040> about<00:00:12.340> drum

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
I'm going to be talking about drum

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.320 
I'm going to be talking about drum
rudiments<00:00:13.750> and<00:00:13.990> how<00:00:14.949> to<00:00:15.010> apply<00:00:15.250> them<00:00:15.789> to<00:00:16.119> the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
rudiments and how to apply them to the

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.279 
rudiments and how to apply them to the
drumset<00:00:18.119> basically<00:00:19.140> rudiments<00:00:20.140> were

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
drumset basically rudiments were

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.430 
drumset basically rudiments were
originally<00:00:21.160> created<00:00:21.190> and<00:00:22.030> written<00:00:22.510> for<00:00:22.930> snare

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440 
originally created and written for snare

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.720 
originally created and written for snare
drum<00:00:23.770> and<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:25.330> are<00:00:25.620> rhythms<00:00:26.620> that<00:00:26.890> have

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
drum and they are rhythms that have

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.560 
drum and they are rhythms that have
specific<00:00:28.770> sticking<00:00:29.770> patterns<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:31.060> rudiment

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
specific sticking patterns the rudiment

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.389 
specific sticking patterns the rudiment
that<00:00:31.720> I've<00:00:31.869> chosen<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:32.529> demonstrate<00:00:33.070> today<00:00:33.250> is

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
that I've chosen to demonstrate today is

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.000 
that I've chosen to demonstrate today is
called<00:00:33.789> a<00:00:33.910> paradiddle<00:00:34.539> and<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:35.649> sticking

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
called a paradiddle and the sticking

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.970 
called a paradiddle and the sticking
pattern<00:00:36.399> for<00:00:36.730> it<00:00:36.909> is<00:00:37.089> right<00:00:37.929> left<00:00:38.289> right<00:00:38.649> right

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
pattern for it is right left right right

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.450 
pattern for it is right left right right
left<00:00:39.280> right<00:00:39.909> left<00:00:40.269> left<00:00:40.659> and<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:42.190> goes

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
left right left left and it goes

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.919 
left right left left and it goes
something<00:00:42.909> like<00:00:43.059> this<00:00:43.210> i'm<00:00:43.629> just<00:00:43.749> going<00:00:43.870> to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
an accent on the first of every four

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.259 
an accent on the first of every four
beats<00:00:56.100> once<00:00:57.100> i<00:00:57.219> start<00:00:57.460> playing<00:00:57.760> you're<00:00:58.120> going

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
beats once i start playing you're going

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.639 
beats once i start playing you're going
to<00:00:58.329> see<00:00:58.449> that<00:00:58.659> i'm<00:00:58.870> going<00:00:59.079> to<00:00:59.199> use<00:00:59.499> the

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
to see that i'm going to use the

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.789 
to see that i'm going to use the
paradiddle<00:01:00.100> as<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:01.120> fill<00:01:01.600> around<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.530> drums

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
paradiddle as a fill around the drums

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.240 
paradiddle as a fill around the drums
and<00:01:03.069> i'm<00:01:03.909> going<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.360> try<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.680> incorporate<00:01:05.680> it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
and i'm going to try to incorporate it

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.029 
and i'm going to try to incorporate it
in<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.850> beat<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.240> i'm<00:01:07.360> playing<00:01:07.570> so<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.409> will

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
in the beat that i'm playing so you will

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.149 
in the beat that i'm playing so you will
hear<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:09.880> see<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.380> played<00:01:11.380> between<00:01:11.619> the

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
hear and see it played between the

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.810 
hear and see it played between the
symbol<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:12.850> snare<00:01:13.119> drum<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.820> probably

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
symbol and the snare drum and probably

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.440 
symbol and the snare drum and probably
between<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.539> hi-hat<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:19.960> snare<00:01:20.200> drum<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
between the hi-hat and snare drum and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.590 
between the hi-hat and snare drum and
I'm<00:01:25.450> also<00:01:25.689> going<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.350> try<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.070> increase<00:01:28.030> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
I'm also going to try to increase the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.929 
I'm also going to try to increase the
speed<00:01:28.899> of<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.890> rudiment<00:01:30.340> while<00:01:30.490> maintaining

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
speed of the rudiment while maintaining

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.539 
speed of the rudiment while maintaining
a<00:01:31.299> basic<00:01:31.750> pulse<00:01:32.079> in<00:01:32.409> something<00:01:33.070> that's<00:01:33.189> called

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
a basic pulse in something that's called

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.149 
a basic pulse in something that's called
double<00:01:34.359> time<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.929> that<00:01:35.649> should<00:01:35.979> sound

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
double time and that should sound

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.359 
double time and that should sound
something<00:01:36.310> like<00:01:36.579> this<00:01:40.679> here<00:01:41.679> goes<00:01:41.859> have<00:01:42.340> a

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
something like this here goes have a

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.919 
something like this here goes have a
listen<00:01:42.579> and<00:01:42.820> see<00:01:43.030> if<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.210> can<00:01:43.359> pick<00:01:43.539> out<00:01:43.659> some

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
listen and see if you can pick out some

00:01:43.929 --> 00:02:37.780 
listen and see if you can pick out some
of<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.079> things<00:01:44.259> that<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.469> just<00:01:44.710> talked<00:01:44.950> about

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.010 

anyway<00:02:38.790> hopefully<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.450> were<00:02:39.540> able<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.840> pick

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
anyway hopefully you were able to pick

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.720 
anyway hopefully you were able to pick
out<00:02:40.140> some<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.530> stuff<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.890> talked<00:02:41.190> about<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
out some of the stuff I talked about and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.780 
out some of the stuff I talked about and
just<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.780> closing<00:02:43.080> if<00:02:43.470> you're<00:02:44.190> ever<00:02:44.310> listening

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
just in closing if you're ever listening

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.060 
just in closing if you're ever listening
to<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.390> watching<00:02:45.500> some<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.590> your<00:02:46.710> favorite

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
to and watching some of your favorite

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.270 
to and watching some of your favorite
drummers<00:02:47.540> listen<00:02:48.560> carefully<00:02:49.560> watch<00:02:49.920> closely

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
drummers listen carefully watch closely

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.060 
drummers listen carefully watch closely
and<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.360> will<00:02:51.480> probably<00:02:51.840> notice<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.800> they

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
and you will probably notice that they

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.400 
and you will probably notice that they
are<00:02:53.120> incorporating<00:02:54.120> drum<00:02:54.720> rudiments<00:02:55.230> and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
are incorporating drum rudiments and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.209 
are incorporating drum rudiments and
their<00:02:55.590> day-to-day<00:02:55.830> play<00:02:56.310> thanks
