00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.899 

okay<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.860> going<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.040> be<00:00:02.190> part<00:00:02.460> one<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:02.790> the

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
okay this is going to be part one of the

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay this is going to be part one of the
amino<00:00:03.179> acid<00:00:03.540> structures<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:04.470> video

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
amino acid structures and in this video

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.530 
amino acid structures and in this video
I'm<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.430> talk<00:00:05.580> about<00:00:05.730> nonpolar<00:00:06.359> amino

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
I'm going to talk about nonpolar amino

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.549 
I'm going to talk about nonpolar amino
acids<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.730> polar<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:09.120> charged<00:00:09.570> amino<00:00:10.050> acids

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
acids and polar on charged amino acids

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.490 
acids and polar on charged amino acids
so<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:13.790> drew<00:00:14.790> out<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.269> amino<00:00:15.660> acid<00:00:16.049> structures

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
so I drew out the amino acid structures

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.519 
so I drew out the amino acid structures
here<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> nonpolar<00:00:17.699> amino<00:00:17.880> acids<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.080> I

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
here for the nonpolar amino acids and I

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.870 
here for the nonpolar amino acids and I
drew<00:00:19.710> most<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.039> them<00:00:20.160> out<00:00:20.250> because<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.699> thought

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
drew most of them out because I thought

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.910 
drew most of them out because I thought
it<00:00:21.000> would<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.210> kind<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.510> silly<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.900> sit<00:00:22.740> here

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it would be kind of silly to sit here

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.939 
it would be kind of silly to sit here
and<00:00:23.240> have<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.269> guys<00:00:24.480> watch<00:00:24.779> me<00:00:25.019> draw<00:00:25.710> these

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and have you guys watch me draw these

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.029 
and have you guys watch me draw these
out<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:26.490> by<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.930> what<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.619> want<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.980> do

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
out one by one so what I just want to do

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.950 
out one by one so what I just want to do
is<00:00:29.160> point<00:00:29.340> out<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.580> few<00:00:29.609> things<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.390> give<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
is point out a few things and give you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.020 
is point out a few things and give you
some<00:00:31.109> tips<00:00:31.260> about<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.219> maybe<00:00:32.520> think<00:00:32.910> about

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
some tips about how to maybe think about

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.930 
some tips about how to maybe think about
drawing<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> first<00:00:35.399> thing<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.700> want

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
drawing these so the first thing I want

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.530 
drawing these so the first thing I want
everybody<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.570> notice<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.489> this

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
everybody to notice is that this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.020 
everybody to notice is that this
backbone<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> same<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
backbone here is the same in all of the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.590 
backbone here is the same in all of the
amino<00:00:42.239> acids<00:00:43.820> with<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.059> exception<00:00:45.510> of

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
amino acids with the exception of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
amino acids with the exception of
prolene<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.460> really

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
prolene and you know it's it's really

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.670 
prolene and you know it's it's really
basic<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.930> carbon<00:00:52.460> a/c<00:00:53.460> alpha<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
basic it's just a carbon a/c alpha and a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.540 
basic it's just a carbon a/c alpha and a
nitrogen<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.739> way<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> think<00:00:59.039> about<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
nitrogen so the way I think about as I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
nitrogen so the way I think about as I
say<00:00:59.699> okay<00:01:00.059> say<00:01:00.390> e<00:01:00.420> C<00:01:00.750> alpha<00:01:00.899> N<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:03.260> for<00:01:04.260> each

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
say okay say e C alpha N and for each

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.170 
say okay say e C alpha N and for each
amino<00:01:04.860> acid<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> only<00:01:05.729> thing<00:01:05.909> that's<00:01:06.060> going

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
amino acid the only thing that's going

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.179 
amino acid the only thing that's going
to<00:01:06.240> change<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> side<00:01:06.990> chain<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.619> that's

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to change is the side chain so that's

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.830 
to change is the side chain so that's
this<00:01:08.460> part<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.510> basically

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
this part right here it's basically

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.490 
this part right here it's basically
what's<00:01:10.320> attached<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.979> alpha<00:01:11.820> carbon

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
what's attached to that alpha carbon

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.539 
what's attached to that alpha carbon
that's<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.680> only<00:01:13.979> thing<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.310> you're<00:01:14.430> going

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that's the only thing that you're going

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.160 
that's the only thing that you're going
to<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.729> change<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.750> these<00:01:15.900> amino

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to see change in all of these amino

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.690 
to see change in all of these amino
acids<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.890> always<00:01:17.009> remember<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
acids so you can always remember the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.850 
acids so you can always remember the
backbone<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.390> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.930> exactly<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.830> same

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
backbone is going to be exactly the same

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.570 
backbone is going to be exactly the same
in<00:01:20.700> each<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.830> far<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> nonpolar<00:01:23.400> amino

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
in each as far as the nonpolar amino

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.420 
in each as far as the nonpolar amino
acids<00:01:24.210> go<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.409> first<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.040> drawn

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
acids go here the first one I have drawn

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.609 
acids go here the first one I have drawn
is<00:01:26.670> alanine<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.020> abbreviation<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.740> ala<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
is alanine and the abbreviation is ala a

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.969 
is alanine and the abbreviation is ala a
it's<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.920> letter<00:01:32.130> abbreviation<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
it's the one letter abbreviation and

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's the one letter abbreviation and
that<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.369> side<00:01:35.579> chain<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.600> ch3<00:01:36.930> or

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
that the side chain is just a ch3 or

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.760 
that the side chain is just a ch3 or
methyl<00:01:37.740> group<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:39.329> second<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.140> valine

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
methyl group the second one is valine

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.270 
methyl group the second one is valine
and<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.610> v<00:01:41.790> al<00:01:42.150> v<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.590> abbreviations

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and that's v al v as the abbreviations

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.389 
and that's v al v as the abbreviations
and<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> side<00:01:46.049> chain<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.530> valine<00:01:46.920> has<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.850> CH<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
and the side chain for valine has a CH a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.590 
and the side chain for valine has a CH a
methyl<00:01:50.399> group<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.270> another<00:01:51.990> methyl<00:01:52.500> group<00:01:53.600> so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
methyl group and another methyl group so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.240 
methyl group and another methyl group so
that's<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.320> an<00:01:55.439> isopropyl<00:01:55.829> group

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that's like an isopropyl group

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.010 
that's like an isopropyl group
essentially<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.829> third<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> leucine<00:02:00.020> Leu

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
essentially the third one is leucine Leu

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.819 
essentially the third one is leucine Leu
and<00:02:01.290> L<00:02:02.009> are<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.340> abbreviations<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:04.649> side

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
and L are the abbreviations and the side

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:13.260 
and L are the abbreviations and the side
chain<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.430> ch2<00:02:06.210> CH<00:02:07.819> ch3<00:02:09.110> ch3

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.970 

the<00:02:14.270> next<00:02:14.570> one<00:02:14.690> over<00:02:14.870> here<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.410> have<00:02:15.680> is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the next one over here that I have is

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.510 
the next one over here that I have is
isoleucine<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.810> that's<00:02:18.770> slightly<00:02:19.040> different

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
isoleucine and that's slightly different

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.970 
isoleucine and that's slightly different
than<00:02:19.700> their<00:02:19.910> scene<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.720> we<00:02:21.530> have<00:02:21.650> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
than their scene and that is we have a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.020 
than their scene and that is we have a
CH<00:02:22.690> ch2<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:24.610> ch3<00:02:25.610> up<00:02:26.120> here<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.570> another<00:02:27.500> ch3

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
CH ch2 a ch3 up here and another ch3

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.630 
CH ch2 a ch3 up here and another ch3
attached<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.330> original<00:02:29.450> CH<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:33.490> that's

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
attached to the original CH so that's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.949 
attached to the original CH so that's
isoleucine<00:02:35.770> pearline<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:36.980> one<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.370> unique

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
isoleucine pearline is one of the unique

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.570 
isoleucine pearline is one of the unique
amino<00:02:38.959> acid<00:02:39.290> structures<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.950> cyclic<00:02:40.400> ring

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
amino acid structures it's a cyclic ring

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.000 
amino acid structures it's a cyclic ring
it's<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:43.040> not<00:02:43.340> aromatic<00:02:44.150> though<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:45.440> it's

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
it's it's not aromatic though so it's

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.760 
it's it's not aromatic though so it's
out<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:47.300> has<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:48.050> nitrogen<00:02:48.590> actually

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
out it has the nitrogen actually

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.100 
out it has the nitrogen actually
incorporated<00:02:49.520> into<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.000> cyclic<00:02:50.660> ring<00:02:50.810> here

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
incorporated into the cyclic ring here

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.860 
incorporated into the cyclic ring here
as<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.560> can<00:02:51.590> see<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.480> these<00:02:53.480> can<00:02:53.690> cause

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
as you can see and these can cause

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.540 
as you can see and these can cause
problems<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.470> alpha<00:02:54.830> helix<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.340> things

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
problems in the alpha helix and things

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.970 
problems in the alpha helix and things
like<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.989> because<00:02:56.989> they're<00:02:57.320> pretty<00:02:57.709> rigid

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
like that because they're pretty rigid

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.530 
like that because they're pretty rigid
the<00:02:58.459> ring<00:02:58.640> structures<00:02:59.030> are<00:02:59.150> rigid<00:02:59.450> you

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
the ring structures are rigid you

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.699 
the ring structures are rigid you
probably<00:02:59.840> learned<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.320> organic

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
probably learned that in organic

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.180 
probably learned that in organic
chemistry<00:03:01.130> so<00:03:02.560> basically<00:03:03.560> attached<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:04.010> C

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190

now<00:03:10.820> I<00:03:11.180> didn't<00:03:11.630> draw<00:03:11.750> these<00:03:11.989> in<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.320> zoo<00:03:12.470> Doron

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
now I didn't draw these in the zoo Doron

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.820 
now I didn't draw these in the zoo Doron
form<00:03:13.690> that's<00:03:14.690> basically<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.410> form<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:15.769> would

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
form that's basically the form you would

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
draw at physiological pH we're gonna do

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.410 
draw at physiological pH we're gonna do
that<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.190> go<00:03:19.340> over<00:03:19.459> things<00:03:19.730> like<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.209> the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
that and go over things like that in the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.060 
that and go over things like that in the
next<00:03:20.630> couple<00:03:21.049> of<00:03:21.170> videos<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.680> just<00:03:21.860> kind<00:03:22.040> of

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
next couple of videos so I just kind of

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.740 
next couple of videos so I just kind of
do<00:03:22.190> these<00:03:22.370> in<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.640> basic<00:03:23.000> format<00:03:23.360> here<00:03:25.750> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
do these in the basic format here the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.199 
do these in the basic format here the
next<00:03:27.019> one<00:03:27.140> is<00:03:27.290> phenylalanine<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.209> the

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
next one is phenylalanine and the

next one is phenylalanine and the
abbreviation<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:30.170> Phe<00:03:30.890> F<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:33.040> does<00:03:34.040> have

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
abbreviation is Phe F and that does have

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.870 
abbreviation is Phe F and that does have
an<00:03:34.340> aromatic<00:03:34.670> benzene<00:03:34.910> ring<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:36.200> ch2<00:03:36.880> benzene

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
an aromatic benzene ring so ch2 benzene

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.690 
an aromatic benzene ring so ch2 benzene
ring

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700

acids is tryptophan and that's TRP W and
we<00:03:49.160> can<00:03:49.310> see<00:03:49.489> again<00:03:49.730> with<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.540> benzene<00:03:50.870> ring

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
we can see again with the benzene ring

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.020 
we can see again with the benzene ring

guys<00:04:12.590> how<00:04:12.769> I<00:04:12.799> draw<00:04:13.400> these<00:04:13.610> out

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
guys how I draw these out

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.599 
guys how I draw these out
I<00:04:14.570> left<00:04:15.079> glycine<00:04:15.590> out<00:04:15.829> and<00:04:16.130> I'm<00:04:16.370> going<00:04:16.519> to

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
I left glycine out and I'm going to

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.370 
I left glycine out and I'm going to
include<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.090> in<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.239> nonpolar<00:04:17.600> amino<00:04:17.780> acids

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
include it in the nonpolar amino acids

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.570 
include it in the nonpolar amino acids
so<00:04:19.130> let<00:04:19.310> me<00:04:19.400> just<00:04:19.549> draw<00:04:19.700> that<00:04:19.970> real<00:04:20.150> quick

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:31.410 

so<00:04:24.580> again<00:04:25.150> see<00:04:25.750> see<00:04:26.380> see<00:04:26.620> alpha<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:30.420> almost

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
so again see see see alpha and almost

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.490 
so again see see see alpha and almost
made<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.600> mistake<00:04:31.990> there<00:04:33.330> because<00:04:34.330> this<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:35.200> not

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
made a mistake there because this is not

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.360 
made a mistake there because this is not
a<00:04:35.530> stereocenter

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
a stereocenter

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.150 
a stereocenter
so<00:04:37.330> there's<00:04:37.720> two<00:04:37.900> hydrogen's<00:04:38.440> here<00:04:38.770> there's

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
so there's two hydrogen's here there's

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.680 
so there's two hydrogen's here there's
not<00:04:39.340> four<00:04:39.610> different<00:04:39.970> groups<00:04:40.030> attached<00:04:40.450> to

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
not four different groups attached to

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.840 
not four different groups attached to
this<00:04:40.810> carbon<00:04:41.080> so<00:04:41.860> that's<00:04:42.220> one<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.520> unique

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
this carbon so that's one of the unique

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.010 
this carbon so that's one of the unique
things<00:04:42.880> about<00:04:43.300> glycine<00:04:43.990> which<00:04:44.230> is<00:04:44.380> GL<00:04:45.010> y<00:04:46.020> gene

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
things about glycine which is GL y gene

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.600 
things about glycine which is GL y gene
has<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.800> abbreviations<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:50.430> it's<00:04:51.430> the

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
has the abbreviations and it's the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.940 
has the abbreviations and it's the
simplest<00:04:51.940> amino<00:04:52.090> acid<00:04:52.570> very<00:04:52.810> small<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.500> can

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
simplest amino acid very small and can

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.970 
simplest amino acid very small and can
also<00:04:54.130> disrupt<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.910> construction<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.800> don't

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
also disrupt the construction so I don't

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.530 
also disrupt the construction so I don't
know<00:04:57.040> if<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.160> can<00:04:57.220> get<00:04:57.460> all<00:04:57.610> these<00:04:57.790> on<00:04:58.000> camera<00:04:58.420> at

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
know if I can get all these on camera at

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.500 
know if I can get all these on camera at
the<00:04:58.630> same<00:04:58.810> time<00:04:59.080> doesn't<00:04:59.500> look<00:04:59.800> like<00:05:00.040> it<00:05:00.510> but

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
the same time doesn't look like it but

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.710 
the same time doesn't look like it but
those<00:05:01.750> are<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.020> nonpolar<00:05:02.440> amino<00:05:02.620> acids<00:05:03.720> the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
those are the nonpolar amino acids the

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.180 
those are the nonpolar amino acids the
best<00:05:04.900> tip<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.170> can<00:05:05.200> give<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.560> for<00:05:05.860> drawing

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
best tip I can give you for drawing

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.330 
best tip I can give you for drawing
these<00:05:06.520> is<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:07.030> just<00:05:07.240> simply<00:05:07.860> sit<00:05:08.860> down<00:05:09.100> with

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
these is to just simply sit down with

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.730 
these is to just simply sit down with
them<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:09.750> continue<00:05:10.750> drawing<00:05:10.990> them<00:05:11.260> over<00:05:11.560> and

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
them and continue drawing them over and

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.850 
them and continue drawing them over and
over<00:05:11.950> again<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:13.180> few<00:05:14.170> times<00:05:14.380> I'd<00:05:14.620> say<00:05:14.740> about

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
over again a few times I'd say about

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.710 
over again a few times I'd say about
five<00:05:15.280> times<00:05:15.670> and<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.120> should<00:05:16.330> start<00:05:16.570> to

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
five times and you should start to

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.330 
five times and you should start to
really<00:05:16.930> get<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.320> hang<00:05:17.470> of<00:05:17.650> what's<00:05:17.890> going<00:05:18.190> on

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
really get the hang of what's going on

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.450 
really get the hang of what's going on
here<00:05:19.530> so<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:21.040> second<00:05:21.460> set<00:05:22.030> that<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.330> have<00:05:23.460> that

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
here so the second set that I have that

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.860 
here so the second set that I have that
I<00:05:24.490> want<00:05:24.730> to<00:05:24.820> show<00:05:24.910> for<00:05:24.940> this<00:05:25.240> video<00:05:25.540> are<00:05:25.840> the

become<00:06:11.200> important<00:06:11.590> later<00:06:11.620> on<00:06:11.950> because<00:06:12.190> that

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
become important later on because that

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.200 
become important later on because that
actually<00:06:12.610> forms<00:06:12.880> disulfide<00:06:13.480> bonds<00:06:13.870> and<00:06:15.210> it

actually forms disulfide bonds and it

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.990 
actually forms disulfide bonds and it
has<00:06:16.419> a<00:06:16.450> ch2<00:06:16.750> SH<00:06:18.360> and<00:06:19.800> I<00:06:20.800> have<00:06:21.040> also<00:06:21.669> over<00:06:21.970> here

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
has a ch2 SH and I have also over here

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.850 
has a ch2 SH and I have also over here
as<00:06:22.390> far<00:06:22.660> a<00:06:22.720> gene<00:06:23.020> a<00:06:23.320> SN<00:06:23.950> n<00:06:24.310> and<00:06:25.410> that<00:06:26.410> has<00:06:26.560> a<00:06:26.590> side

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
as far a gene a SN n and that has a side

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.060 
as far a gene a SN n and that has a side
chain<00:06:27.100> that's<00:06:27.340> ch2<00:06:28.200> C<00:06:29.200> double<00:06:29.560> bond<00:06:29.740> o<00:06:29.950> NH<00:06:30.729> two

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
chain that's ch2 C double bond o NH two

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:38.070 
chain that's ch2 C double bond o NH two
so<00:06:33.070> I<00:06:33.750> left<00:06:34.750> off<00:06:35.400> glutamine<00:06:36.400> and<00:06:36.820> I'll<00:06:37.780> draw

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
so I left off glutamine and I'll draw

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.900 
so I left off glutamine and I'll draw
that<00:06:38.260> out<00:06:38.320> for<00:06:38.740> you<00:06:38.830> real<00:06:39.040> quick<00:06:39.070> just<00:06:39.640> again

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
that out for you real quick just again

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.900 
that out for you real quick just again
to<00:06:40.060> kind<00:06:40.240> of<00:06:40.360> give<00:06:40.480> you<00:06:40.570> guys<00:06:40.600> an<00:06:40.870> idea<00:06:40.960> of<00:06:41.290> what

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
to kind of give you guys an idea of what

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.690 
to kind of give you guys an idea of what
how<00:06:42.910> I'm<00:06:43.090> doing<00:06:43.510> it<00:06:43.950> nothing<00:06:44.950> special<00:06:45.070> nothing

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
how I'm doing it nothing special nothing

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.810 
how I'm doing it nothing special nothing
spectacular<00:06:46.060> here<00:06:49.620> so<00:06:50.620> I<00:06:51.220> draw<00:06:51.640> out<00:06:51.670> my

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820 
spectacular here so I draw out my

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.040 
spectacular here so I draw out my
backbone<00:06:52.480> and<00:06:53.550> then<00:06:55.350> glutamine<00:06:56.350> has<00:06:56.680> a<00:06:56.710> ch2

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
backbone and then glutamine has a ch2

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:04.740 
backbone and then glutamine has a ch2
ch2<00:06:59.050> and<00:07:00.780> then<00:07:01.780> this<00:07:01.990> is<00:07:02.170> a<00:07:02.200> C<00:07:03.210> double<00:07:04.210> bond<00:07:04.450> o

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
ch2 and then this is a C double bond o

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.680 
ch2 and then this is a C double bond o
and<00:07:05.610> h2<00:07:08.310> sorry<00:07:09.310> it's<00:07:09.520> a<00:07:09.550> bit<00:07:09.580> sloppy<00:07:10.030> there<00:07:10.420> but

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
and h2 sorry it's a bit sloppy there but

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:23.130 
and h2 sorry it's a bit sloppy there but
ch2<00:07:11.500> ch2<00:07:14.190> ch2<00:07:15.190> and<00:07:15.840> that's<00:07:17.130> GL<00:07:18.540> N<00:07:20.490> and<00:07:21.490> Q<00:07:22.000> as<00:07:22.630> the

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
ch2 ch2 ch2 and that's GL N and Q as the

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:30.240 
ch2 ch2 ch2 and that's GL N and Q as the
abbreviation<00:07:25.230> so<00:07:26.230> those<00:07:27.010> are<00:07:27.250> the<00:07:27.400> six<00:07:29.250> polar

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.250 
abbreviation so those are the six polar

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:37.140 
abbreviation so those are the six polar
neutral<00:07:30.880> amino<00:07:31.120> acids<00:07:35.130> and<00:07:36.130> again<00:07:36.640> it's<00:07:36.910> just

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150 
neutral amino acids and again it's just

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.050 
neutral amino acids and again it's just
really<00:07:37.890> practice<00:07:38.890> and<00:07:39.190> repetition<00:07:39.520> that's

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.060 
really practice and repetition that's

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.520 
really practice and repetition that's
going<00:07:40.270> to<00:07:40.330> get<00:07:40.450> you<00:07:40.540> good<00:07:40.630> at<00:07:40.780> using<00:07:40.960> these<00:07:41.230> but

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.530 
going to get you good at using these but

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.840 
going to get you good at using these but
you're<00:07:41.770> you're<00:07:41.980> also<00:07:42.130> going<00:07:42.340> to<00:07:42.400> get<00:07:42.520> used<00:07:42.730> to

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:42.850 
you're you're also going to get used to

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.550 
you're you're also going to get used to
using<00:07:43.030> them<00:07:43.330> when<00:07:43.570> you<00:07:43.660> start<00:07:43.900> doing<00:07:44.140> protein

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
using them when you start doing protein

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.770 
using them when you start doing protein
structure<00:07:45.010> and<00:07:45.040> I<00:07:45.430> asked<00:07:45.940> you<00:07:46.090> to<00:07:46.210> draw<00:07:46.390> a

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:46.780 
structure and I asked you to draw a

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.690 
structure and I asked you to draw a
tripeptide<00:07:47.320> or<00:07:47.800> something<00:07:48.130> like<00:07:48.220> that<00:07:48.280> and

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:48.700 
tripeptide or something like that and

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.060 
tripeptide or something like that and
you're<00:07:49.180> using<00:07:49.420> a<00:07:49.870> bunch<00:07:50.530> of<00:07:50.620> these<00:07:50.680> amino

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.070 
you're using a bunch of these amino

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.210 
you're using a bunch of these amino
acids<00:07:51.580> and<00:07:51.790> things<00:07:51.970> like<00:07:52.150> that<00:07:52.330> so<00:07:53.230> that's<00:07:54.040> all

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.220 
acids and things like that so that's all

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.250 
acids and things like that so that's all
I<00:07:54.280> want<00:07:54.430> to<00:07:54.520> cover<00:07:54.640> for<00:07:54.940> this<00:07:55.090> video<00:07:55.390> and<00:07:55.450> I'll

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:56.260 
I want to cover for this video and I'll

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.720 
I want to cover for this video and I'll
finish<00:07:56.620> up<00:07:56.860> with<00:07:57.010> the<00:07:57.130> rest<00:07:57.280> of<00:07:57.370> the<00:07:57.460> amino

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:57.730 
finish up with the rest of the amino

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.920 
finish up with the rest of the amino
acids<00:07:58.060> in<00:07:58.180> the<00:07:58.300> next<00:07:58.510> video

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:58.930 
acids in the next video

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.470 
acids in the next video
Thanks
