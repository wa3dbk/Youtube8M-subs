 not urgent loaded all but without 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.369

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:46.369
 if you have a village 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.360

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:55.030
 order to start it you can of course 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:00.100
 wring the trailer but as i stand on 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:05.210
 It is impossible to do a day off 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:09.410
 I can not go this is the twitch 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.310
 so as not to bring down his vacation time 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.599
 on a detailed tachograph that we 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.910
 first we need to do 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:24.980
 disengage because we need to open 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.600
 this one this one here 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.540
 our cabin wo n't let you 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 disengage to be here instead 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.769
 now let's start clinging well to 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:42.470
 disengage before all 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:44.750
 open the lock so opened my lock 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.030
 this is called semi-automatic then 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.609
 there is here just pulled the handle aside 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.660
 and she locked herself in the open 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:56.799
 position there are locks as if so tame 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.320
 what do you call a doggy there 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:04.359
 make tied so strong to 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.940
 there do not climb do not get dirty or rope 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.709
 dog it opens and the same 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.120
 manipulation make the handle opens 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.660
 Castle 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.650
 opened the lock and why are we first 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.690
 open the lock 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:25.130
 the fact is that if you first raise the corpse 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.319
 recipe to raise our rear axle then when 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.510
 will happen and evil and 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.350
 lock jam and most of you 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.930
 the case will just be difficult 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.459
 make it difficult to discover but 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.980
 so we are now 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:47.750
 open lock we will start the car so that 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:52.510
 we had air in the system 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.280
 helicopters are allowed to live there 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:03.260
 Now the head of the car was to the system 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:04.459
 air and since we have a remote on for 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.250
 rear axle lift 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:13.130
 that is, we only work on 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.540
 ignition that I started the air above the market 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.160
 pumped up 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.980
 we get 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.330
 our remote 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.330
 and click on this button 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.260
 take off 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.639
 raised enough 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.439
 now let's go pushing you two skipping 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:45.110
 Now we will take this pen 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:49.349
 Kamchatka will dress and lower their paws 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.700
 that costs you so well paws now 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:57.300
 lowered lowered 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:05:02.100
 and a little bit on the remote down the rear axle 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.030
 to give free the lock as if 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.030
 weakness that was 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:12.659
 so he sat on his paws 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.580
 fine 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:19.840
 so my drove away now you can freely 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:23.319
 open defense now open 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.659
 Batteries will light against cancer 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:31.449
 battery I have prepared the cable already 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:36.630
 Now I will connect and we will try 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:39.390
 start a trailer refrigerator 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.889
 the cocktail that I made to the starter 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.129
 connected plus 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.550

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.889
 connect 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:03.309
 Battery not forget that 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.589
 so we have a voltage of 24 volts 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:09.400
 Refrigerator 12 means lit from 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.400
 single battery 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.390
 so all 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.390
 but now we try to start 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.100
 similarity for the police works wires I 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.330
 disconnected 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:31.490
 the bullet is closing my sight and 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.490
 After all, they try to disturb the batteries 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.700
 all doing the reverse order why are you 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:43.580

 just will not have time 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.590
 so it's best to do it dunking 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.190
