00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
stop now actually hit the side and the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.760 
stop now actually hit the side and the
great<00:01:21.570> thing<00:01:21.720> about<00:01:21.780> tunnels<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.350> discovered

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
great thing about tunnels I discovered

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
great thing about tunnels I discovered
in<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:22.920> game<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.939> parts<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.900> are

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
in this game is like parts of it are

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
in this game is like parts of it are
circular<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.040> drive<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
circular so you can like drive on the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.730 
circular so you can like drive on the
side<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:29.130> I'd<00:01:29.369> show<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.759> later<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.740> so

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
side so I think I'd show it later on so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.660 
side so I think I'd show it later on so
you<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.189> go<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
why why would they come down in the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.249 
why why would they come down in the
tunnels<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.619> might<00:01:58.799> get<00:01:58.950> hit<00:01:59.070> by<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> train<00:02:00.259> or

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
tunnels we might get hit by a train or

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.990 
tunnels we might get hit by a train or
get<00:02:01.469> gone<00:02:01.680> down<00:02:01.890> either<00:02:02.130> way

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
get gone down either way

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
so I have to avoid other trains careful

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.880 
so I have to avoid other trains careful

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
reason

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.460 
reason
why<00:02:19.880> would<00:02:20.120> they<00:02:20.240> be<00:02:20.300> scared<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.840> me<00:02:21.110> all<00:02:21.410> right

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
why would they be scared of me all right

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.370 
why would they be scared of me all right
and<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:23.030> think<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.570> think<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.840> would<00:02:23.960> go<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.110> use<00:02:24.290> a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
and I think I think I would go to use a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.830 
and I think I think I would go to use a
shotgun<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:27.530> think<00:02:27.860> later<00:02:28.070> see<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.940> see

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
shotgun and I think later see it I see

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.030 
shotgun and I think later see it I see
these<00:02:30.020> guys<00:02:30.170> don't<00:02:30.320> even<00:02:30.440> care<00:02:30.740> they're<00:02:30.890> just
