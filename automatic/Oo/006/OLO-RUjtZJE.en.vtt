00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.500
 stressed only for lovers in 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.870
 we do not like professionals 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.630
 caretakers 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:39.270
 I will show 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:44.340
 giving one its different 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:51.650
 means to start on what equipment 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.650
 faces we have a training ball and 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.900
 so here so they can be seen yes here it is one 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:07.070
 brand is a training ball and second 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.070
 the ball is as far as I understand it 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:19.800
 Announced as a tournament for those 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:23.090
 who understands the usual racket 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.090
 Chinese basis 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:34.550
 Southerners may not matter with imitation 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.550
 carbon fiber and as far as i can 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.880
 As in English, you are not 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:52.580
 synergy, that is, two overlays 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.580
 table at our French company 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.310
 Now I show closer 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.900
 french firm as far as i can 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.679
 read Korneliuk 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.210
 now what about base 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.140
 forwards 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.140
 away is done 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.239
 with reverse rotation that is initially 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.690
 rocket is laid in this way 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.010
 under the ball so that the ball has the opposite 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.540
 rotation and exercise for this 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:37.709
 initial offers for performance 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.940
 next when we pinch the brush and no 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.970
 It does not wife 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:49.440
 just move in such a clear way 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.770
 that the ball touch lightly 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:58.620
 in front for the ball for me not like 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.800
 usually back or bottom and side and front 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.010
 we all know very well those who 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.420
 do not use the cheapest 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.440
 rocket is a dream is, well, any athlete 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.990
 checks the quality of rubber one of 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.660
 methods as follows sets 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.670
 rotation of the ball and substitutes the rocket 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:29.890
 at such an angle the fry is not 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:33.970
 should fly up and he flies off or 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.840
 flies up like that angle to which well 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.960
 like illnesses those who know about such 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.180
 sense 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.400
 I will go like this 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.530
 of course 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:51.970
 add brush rotation 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:56.320
 sending the ball forward towards the opponent 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.150
 it is clear that we are completely trying to remove 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.870
 progressively 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.159
 even here such a ball will be 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.590
 rotate my 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:09.610
 will have to overcome near the wall 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:14.040
 progressive rotation and he is obliged 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:17.049
 just have a look almost go out 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.400
 barely fly and on the contrary 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.940
 spin forcibly go back immediately 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.560
 here for lovers well since i am 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.690
 table tennis lover 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.120
 just believe lovers when 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.230
 which feed is just not faced 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.770
 I know that Milan 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.020
 on the grass cool bead hands even 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.310
 don't think about him 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.330
 that is, people have 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.020
 big shock and we 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.020
 young sik 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.760
 what is the flow even 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.760
 on such 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.070
 von haikek snatch on the whole and com 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.030
 necessarily and even when he is like this 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:11.980
 height seems to be coming up so do that 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:15.880
 do you want it a little is not convenient because 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.970
 But with this composition it is no longer 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.840
 repulse normally he is very under the net 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.500
 close and according to the rules 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.010
 table tennis 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.840
 besides touching the racket on the table or 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.700
 against which racket 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.570
 there was nothing else to touch 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.510
 I touch my foot clearly I jumped a 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.390
 bye wenge 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:48.000
 the ball is already returning to the side 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:48.000
 rival almost 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:08.909
 and the handout is much easier to serve when 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:15.520
 show you go far down and below 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:18.520
 throw up really need 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.789
 save all the same state of affairs for 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.219
 games and do not show that they will serve 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.229
 its position must remain 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:30.629
 such a 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:36.569
 if i were allowed in this position 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:37.770
 feed or some left spin 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:44.129
 bear 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:44.129
 stay in that position where i will 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:51.520
 keep your opponent in suspense 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:58.449
 account of the fact that he first does not know where 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:01.210
 I can fall well in general use on 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:05.100
 health write if something is wrong 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.100
 but with pleasure everyone is different
