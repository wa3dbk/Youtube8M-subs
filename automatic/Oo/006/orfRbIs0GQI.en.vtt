00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:33.810 

sort<00:00:14.260> of<00:00:14.380> shot<00:00:14.970> for<00:00:15.970> during<00:00:16.420> the<00:00:16.540> week

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.330 

but<00:00:34.820> Darrell<00:00:35.720> has<00:00:36.290> a<00:00:36.320> chance<00:00:36.650> to<00:00:36.739> lock<00:00:37.010> him<00:00:37.220> up

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
but Darrell has a chance to lock him up

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.049 
but Darrell has a chance to lock him up
here<00:00:37.580> this<00:00:39.400> would<00:00:40.400> you<00:00:40.430> see<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.820> cue<00:00:41.030> ball

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
here this would you see the cue ball

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.619 
here this would you see the cue ball
curve<00:00:41.540> there<00:00:41.870> yeah<00:00:42.140> with<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.280> spin<00:00:43.629> towards

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
curve there yeah with the spin towards

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.450 
curve there yeah with the spin towards
the<00:00:44.809> one<00:00:44.960> that's<00:00:45.440> how<00:00:45.620> much<00:00:45.830> spin<00:00:46.070> he<00:00:46.160> had<00:00:46.280> on

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
the one that's how much spin he had on

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:56.600 
the one that's how much spin he had on
it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.400 

I<00:00:56.670> would<00:00:57.270> look<00:00:57.450> for<00:00:57.630> the<00:00:57.720> cue<00:00:57.930> ball<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.290> be

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
I would look for the cue ball to be

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.560 
I would look for the cue ball to be
nestled<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.040> up<00:00:59.370> against<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.880> too<00:01:00.180> at<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
nestled right up against that too at the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.200 
nestled right up against that too at the
bitch

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.560 

it's<00:01:04.780> one<00:01:05.019> of<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.170> most<00:01:05.320> basic<00:01:05.680> safeties<00:01:06.400> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it's one of the most basic safeties and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:16.640 
it's one of the most basic safeties and
pocket<00:01:07.570> billiards<00:01:08.020> but<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:08.470> is<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:09.330> effective

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.280 

what<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.280> he<00:01:17.370> looking

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
what is he looking

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.870 
what is he looking
Oh

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Oh

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.580 
Oh
he<00:01:21.390> doesn't<00:01:21.780> look<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:21.930> he's<00:01:22.229> playing<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
he doesn't look like he's playing the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.440 
he doesn't look like he's playing the
safety<00:01:24.259> not<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.289> safety<00:01:25.860> we're<00:01:26.009> suggesting

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
safety not the safety we're suggesting

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.350 
safety not the safety we're suggesting
does<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> ball<00:01:27.899> pass<00:01:28.320> no<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> doesn't<00:01:29.610> pass

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.270 

I'm<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.170> distance<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.130> for

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I'm going for distance it's going for

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.069 
I'm going for distance it's going for
the<00:01:35.340> safety<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:35.969> clever<00:01:36.270> shock<00:01:36.630> yes

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the safety here that's clever shock yes

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.300 
the safety here that's clever shock yes
it<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:39.319> I<00:01:42.259> guess<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:43.409> he<00:01:43.530> played<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.799> shot<00:01:44.159> we

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it is I guess if he played the shot we

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.340 
it is I guess if he played the shot we
were<00:01:44.429> thinking<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> Jerry<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.390> might<00:01:45.689> offer

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
were thinking of Jerry it might offer

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
were thinking of Jerry it might offer
the<00:01:46.799> one<00:01:46.979> rail<00:01:47.159> kick<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.450> would<00:01:48.600> be

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the one rail kick in the one would be

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.740 
the one rail kick in the one would be
near<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> rail<00:01:49.579> so<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:52.490> hindsight

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
near the rail so this is a hindsight

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:09.850 
near the rail so this is a hindsight
much<00:01:54.750> better<00:01:55.020> choice

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.650 

don't<00:02:10.460> ask<00:02:10.690> going<00:02:11.690> for<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.930> jump<00:02:13.540> looking<00:02:14.540> to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
don't ask going for the jump looking to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.450 
don't ask going for the jump looking to
send<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.960> ball<00:02:15.200> back<00:02:15.500> down<00:02:15.740> here<00:02:15.950> behind<00:02:16.100> these

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
send a ball back down here behind these

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:44.010 
send a ball back down here behind these
