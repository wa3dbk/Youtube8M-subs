00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
these electrical boxes and I'm

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.149 
these electrical boxes and I'm
completely<00:02:04.479> finished<00:02:05.049> like<00:02:05.320> my<00:02:05.469> box<00:02:05.740> is<00:02:05.920> done

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
completely finished like my box is done

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
piece of ground copper you guys know

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.250 
piece of ground copper you guys know
what<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.180> when<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.079> work<00:02:26.230> with

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
what that is when you work with

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.920 
what that is when you work with
electrical<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.730> have<00:02:27.909> to<00:02:28.150> have<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.810> know

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
electrical you have to have you know

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.399 
electrical you have to have you know
your<00:02:29.290> your<00:02:29.769> SJ<00:02:30.129> wire<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:31.599> all<00:02:31.750> your<00:02:32.230> wires

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
your your SJ wire and all your wires

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.110 
your your SJ wire and all your wires
intact<00:02:32.829> and<00:02:33.040> head<00:02:33.159> to<00:02:33.280> be<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.579> certain<00:02:33.760> form

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
intact and head to be in a certain form

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.559 
intact and head to be in a certain form
you<00:02:34.959> also<00:02:35.109> have<00:02:35.409> to<00:02:35.620> ground<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:37.299> it's<00:02:37.420> just

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
you also have to ground it and it's just

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.170 
you also have to ground it and it's just
like<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.720> little<00:02:37.959> thin<00:02:38.409> piece<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:39.370> copper

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
like a little thin piece of of copper

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.539 
like a little thin piece of of copper
and<00:02:40.329> he<00:02:41.319> took<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.859> thought<00:02:42.310> it'd<00:02:42.430> be<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
and he took it and thought it'd be a

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.020 
and he took it and thought it'd be a
good<00:02:42.700> idea<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:43.269> it's<00:02:44.139> powered<00:02:44.530> on<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:45.190> stick

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
good idea as it's powered on to stick

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.559 
good idea as it's powered on to stick
the<00:02:46.450> piece<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.930> copper<00:02:47.379> inside<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.940> inside

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
the piece of copper inside the inside

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.770 
the piece of copper inside the inside
the<00:02:49.629> load<00:02:49.930> box<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:51.370> if<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.970> guys<00:02:52.120> don't<00:02:52.389> know

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
the load box and if you guys don't know

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.599 
the load box and if you guys don't know
what<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:52.989> does<00:02:53.139> basically<00:02:53.709> as<00:02:54.129> soon<00:02:54.159> as<00:02:54.430> he

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
what that does basically as soon as he

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.670 
what that does basically as soon as he
touched<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.209> as<00:02:55.359> soon<00:02:55.510> as<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.750> made<00:02:55.930> contact<00:02:56.470> it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
touched it as soon as it made contact it

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.599 
touched it as soon as it made contact it
goes<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:58.659> sparked<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.409> it<00:02:59.859> burned<00:03:00.159> up<00:03:00.400> a

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
goes and it sparked and it burned up a

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.179 
goes and it sparked and it burned up a
piece<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.209> wire<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:02.049> little<00:03:02.680> bit<00:03:02.769> of<00:03:02.859> smoke

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
piece of the wire a little bit of smoke

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.979 
piece of the wire a little bit of smoke
just<00:03:03.459> not<00:03:03.909> too<00:03:04.150> much<00:03:04.299> for<00:03:04.540> just<00:03:04.629> a<00:03:04.750> little<00:03:04.900> bit

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
just not too much for just a little bit

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.190 
just not too much for just a little bit
but<00:03:05.950> just<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.670> act<00:03:06.879> of<00:03:07.150> him<00:03:07.359> actually<00:03:07.569> doing

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
but just the act of him actually doing

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.530 
but just the act of him actually doing
that<00:03:08.349> in<00:03:08.500> thinking<00:03:08.889> hey<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.150> really

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.030 
that in thinking hey this is a really
good<00:03:10.659> idea<00:03:10.720> for<00:03:11.260> me<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.409> just<00:03:11.680> stick<00:03:11.859> this

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
good idea for me to just stick this

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.890 
good idea for me to just stick this
piece<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.430> copper<00:03:12.849> in<00:03:12.879> here<00:03:13.180> while<00:03:13.420> its<00:03:13.629> power

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
piece of copper in here while its power

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.379 
piece of copper in here while its power
while<00:03:14.470> it's<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.889> while<00:03:15.879> everything<00:03:16.299> is

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
and you know maybe maybe it's fun maybe

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.830 
and you know maybe maybe it's fun maybe
it's<00:03:24.760> fun<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.329> nearly<00:03:26.199> kill<00:03:26.349> myself<00:03:26.799> so<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.840> just

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
it's fun to nearly kill myself so I just

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.599 
it's fun to nearly kill myself so I just
thought<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.049> was<00:03:29.319> great<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.340> then<00:03:30.489> we

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
thought that was great and then we

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.159 
thought that was great and then we
actually<00:03:30.849> had<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> sub<00:03:31.359> so<00:03:31.599> then<00:03:31.750> he<00:03:31.959> had<00:03:32.049> to

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
actually had a sub so then he had to

new channel called twitch plays Pokemon
and<00:04:53.960> it's<00:04:54.050> been<00:04:54.200> having<00:04:54.350> a<00:04:54.530> lot<00:04:54.680> of<00:04:54.740> trouble<00:04:55.220> on

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
and it's been having a lot of trouble on

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.120 
and it's been having a lot of trouble on
like<00:04:56.360> Twitter<00:04:56.630> servers<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.230> everything<00:04:57.590> so<00:04:57.920> I

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
like Twitter servers and everything so I

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.190 
like Twitter servers and everything so I
assume<00:04:58.880> that's<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.300> reason<00:04:59.570> because<00:04:59.780> I<00:04:59.930> tried

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
assume that's the reason because I tried

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.320 
assume that's the reason because I tried
everything<00:05:00.380> that<00:05:00.650> I<00:05:00.770> could<00:05:00.890> in<00:05:01.250> my<00:05:01.730> power<00:05:01.970> so

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
everything that I could in my power so

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.270 
everything that I could in my power so
that's<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.290> should<00:05:03.800> be<00:05:03.890> streaming<00:05:04.100> tonight

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
that's that should be streaming tonight

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.430 
that's that should be streaming tonight
if<00:05:04.580> not<00:05:05.060> you<00:05:05.300> guys<00:05:05.450> know<00:05:05.690> what's<00:05:05.870> going<00:05:06.110> on<00:05:06.230> I
