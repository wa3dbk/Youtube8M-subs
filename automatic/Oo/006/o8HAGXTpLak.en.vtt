00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.670 
we're doing all those last-minute things
to<00:03:19.090> our<00:03:19.239> body<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:19.870> could<00:03:20.019> perform<00:03:20.470> at

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
to our body so that we could perform at

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.670 
to our body so that we could perform at
the<00:03:20.769> highest<00:03:21.040> level<00:03:21.579> now<00:03:22.450> there<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.530> guess

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
the highest level now there is I guess

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.970 
the highest level now there is I guess
you<00:03:24.070> could<00:03:24.220> say<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.400> routine<00:03:24.940> or<00:03:25.170> se<00:03:26.170> when<00:03:26.739> guys

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
you could say a routine or se when guys

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.949 
you could say a routine or se when guys
go<00:03:27.190> out<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.579> field<00:03:27.880> if<00:03:28.329> you've<00:03:28.540> been<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.870> an

I<00:04:09.800> mean<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.070> was<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.880> that<00:04:11.030> was<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.150> real

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
I mean that was and that was a real

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.840 
I mean that was and that was a real
crucial<00:04:11.540> part<00:04:11.960> for<00:04:12.110> us<00:04:12.200> because<00:04:12.490> that<00:04:13.490> pregame

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
crucial part for us because that pregame

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.710 
crucial part for us because that pregame
warmup

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
warmup

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.449 
warmup
sometimes<00:04:15.140> could<00:04:15.350> almost<00:04:15.470> dictate<00:04:16.310> your

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
sometimes could almost dictate your

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.509 
sometimes could almost dictate your
confidence<00:04:17.209> going<00:04:17.540> into<00:04:17.810> game<00:04:18.560> time<00:04:18.859> that's

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
confidence going into game time that's

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.009 
confidence going into game time that's
why<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:19.730> was<00:04:19.880> trying<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.180> catch<00:04:20.329> every<00:04:20.660> single

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
why I was trying to catch every single

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.930 
why I was trying to catch every single
ball<00:04:21.200> during<00:04:21.440> pregame<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:22.160> sometimes<00:04:22.820> you

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
ball during pregame and sometimes you

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.700 
ball during pregame and sometimes you
might<00:04:23.090> drop<00:04:23.300> one<00:04:23.630> or<00:04:23.750> two<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.560> could

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
might drop one or two and it could

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.740 
might drop one or two and it could
rattle<00:04:24.980> you<00:04:25.220> for<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.490> second<00:04:25.970> but<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.510> made

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
rattle you for a second but you made

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.590 
rattle you for a second but you made
