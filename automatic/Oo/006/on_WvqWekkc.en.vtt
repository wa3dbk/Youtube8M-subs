I want to start off talking about is

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.060

a new character and they show it on an
old<00:02:38.500> stage<00:02:38.830> but<00:02:39.280> I'm<00:02:39.370> really<00:02:39.550> curious<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:40.090> see

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
old stage but I'm really curious to see

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.440

what<00:02:40.630> her<00:02:40.810> stage<00:02:41.140> looks<00:02:41.470> like<00:02:41.740> in<00:02:41.920> particular

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
what her stage looks like in particular

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.180 
what her stage looks like in particular
because<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.500> said<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:45.010> are

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
because like I said there are

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.790 
because like I said there are
similarities<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:46.360> her<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.930> Samara<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.680> of

course home and had a lot of

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.810 
course home and had a lot of

similarities to Pazuzu from The Exorcist

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.680 
similarities to Pazuzu from The Exorcist
but<00:02:52.150> omen<00:02:52.960> shares<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.980> same<00:02:54.880> background<00:02:55.480> as

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
but omen shares the same background as

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.440 
but omen shares the same background as
Jago<00:02:56.440> does<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:57.070> we<00:02:57.670> really<00:02:58.000> don't<00:02:58.120> have<00:02:58.420> that

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
Jago does so we really don't have that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.080 
Jago does so we really don't have that
character<00:02:59.140> totally<00:02:59.680> fleshed<00:03:00.430> out<00:03:00.640> no<00:03:00.940> pun

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
character totally fleshed out no pun

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.750 
character totally fleshed out no pun
intended<00:03:01.270> but<00:03:01.950> that's<00:03:02.950> pretty<00:03:03.280> much<00:03:03.400> how<00:03:03.730> I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
intended but that's pretty much how I

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.780 
intended but that's pretty much how I
see<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.180> now<00:03:04.420> obviously<00:03:05.140> there's<00:03:05.380> an<00:03:05.790> japanese

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
see it now obviously there's an japanese

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.080 
see it now obviously there's an japanese
element<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.630> character<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:09.090> obviously

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
element to this character and obviously

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.000 
element to this character and obviously
there's<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.540> martial<00:03:10.990> arts<00:03:11.230> aspect<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:11.890> this

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
there's a martial arts aspect to this

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.400 
there's a martial arts aspect to this
character<00:03:12.640> which<00:03:13.390> really<00:03:13.690> comes<00:03:14.020> at<00:03:14.260> no

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
character which really comes at no

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.440 
character which really comes at no
surprise<00:03:14.890> considering<00:03:15.490> that<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.970> rain<00:03:16.150> was

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
surprise considering that the rain was

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.650 
surprise considering that the rain was
originally<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.410> japanese<00:03:17.950> film<00:03:18.280> anyway<00:03:18.660> so

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
originally a japanese film anyway so

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.950 
originally a japanese film anyway so
those<00:03:20.560> similarities<00:03:21.100> are<00:03:21.600> kind<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.930> don't

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
those similarities are kind of I don't

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.260 
those similarities are kind of I don't
know<00:03:23.170> again<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.310> just<00:03:24.430> speculation<00:03:24.550> I

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
know again this is just speculation I

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.830 
know again this is just speculation I
don't<00:03:25.450> know<00:03:25.600> if<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.610> ring<00:03:27.850> or<00:03:28.120> Samara<00:03:28.570> had

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
don't know if the the ring or Samara had

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.590 
don't know if the the ring or Samara had
any<00:03:28.990> kind<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.380> influence<00:03:29.980> on<00:03:30.330> iron<00:03:31.330> galaxy

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
any kind of influence on iron galaxy

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.900 
any kind of influence on iron galaxy
when<00:03:32.080> they<00:03:32.200> were<00:03:32.260> making<00:03:32.530> this<00:03:32.800> but<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.700> can

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
when they were making this but you can

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.370 
when they were making this but you can
pretty<00:03:34.120> much<00:03:34.240> tell<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.660> lot<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.140> killer

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
pretty much tell a lot of the killer

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.860 
pretty much tell a lot of the killer
instinct<00:03:35.920> characters<00:03:36.520> do<00:03:36.880> kind<00:03:37.270> of<00:03:37.390> represent

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
instinct characters do kind of represent

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.310 
instinct characters do kind of represent
a<00:03:37.960> lot<00:03:38.080> of<00:03:38.200> pop<00:03:38.590> culture<00:03:39.070> references<00:03:40.320> whether

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
a lot of pop culture references whether

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.500 
a lot of pop culture references whether
it's<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.890> saberwolf<00:03:42.580> for<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.150> whole<00:03:43.270> werewolf

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
it's a saberwolf for the whole werewolf

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.190 
it's a saberwolf for the whole werewolf
kind<00:03:44.110> of<00:03:44.230> thing<00:03:44.440> whether<00:03:44.890> it's<00:03:45.900> possibly<00:03:46.900> even

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
kind of thing whether it's possibly even

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.680 
kind of thing whether it's possibly even
spinal<00:03:48.070> from<00:03:48.550> maybe<00:03:48.850> like<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.030> clash<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.570> the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
spinal from maybe like a clash of the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.620 
spinal from maybe like a clash of the
titans<00:03:50.140> or<00:03:50.590> even<00:03:51.490> con<00:03:51.790> rod<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:52.480> do<00:03:52.600> a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
titans or even con rod and then do a

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.410 
titans or even con rod and then do a
video<00:03:52.870> on<00:03:53.110> that<00:03:53.140> but<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.530> thought<00:03:53.770> con<00:03:54.130> raw<00:03:54.420> kind

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
video on that but I thought con raw kind

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.660 
video on that but I thought con raw kind
of<00:03:55.600> represented<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.260> lot<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.680> what<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.160> see<00:03:57.430> with

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
of represented a lot of what we see with

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.730 
of represented a lot of what we see with
mum<00:03:58.000> raw<00:03:58.240> from<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.780> Thundercats<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.560> don't

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
mum raw from the Thundercats I don't

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.770 
mum raw from the Thundercats I don't
know<00:03:59.830> if<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.070> lot<00:04:00.100> of<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.640> are<00:04:00.910> familiar<00:04:01.450> with

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
know if a lot of you are familiar with

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.380 
know if a lot of you are familiar with
Thundercat<00:04:02.740> but<00:04:03.190> anyway<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:03.970> think<00:04:04.120> it's

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
Thundercat but anyway I think it's

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.270 
Thundercat but anyway I think it's
really<00:04:04.630> cool<00:04:04.840> but<00:04:05.050> killer<00:04:05.260> instinct<00:04:05.710> does<00:04:05.950> a

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
really cool but killer instinct does a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.370 
really cool but killer instinct does a
lot<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.970> these<00:04:07.240> kind<00:04:07.600> of<00:04:07.690> pop<00:04:07.900> culture

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
lot of these kind of pop culture

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.000 
lot of these kind of pop culture
references<00:04:09.100> little<00:04:10.000> nods<00:04:10.270> little<00:04:11.010> things

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
references little nods little things

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.010 
references little nods little things
that<00:04:12.310> would<00:04:12.910> suggest<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.480> they're<00:04:13.750> paying

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
that would suggest that they're paying

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.560 
that would suggest that they're paying
homage<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:15.160> lot<00:04:15.820> of<00:04:15.970> these<00:04:16.060> kind<00:04:16.420> of<00:04:16.510> things

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
homage to a lot of these kind of things

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.229 
homage to a lot of these kind of things
now<00:04:17.440> let's<00:04:17.680> uh<00:04:17.890> analyze<00:04:18.520> her<00:04:18.790> a<00:04:18.820> little<00:04:19.030> bit

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
now let's uh analyze her a little bit

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.960 
now let's uh analyze her a little bit
here<00:04:19.660> just<00:04:20.500> look<00:04:20.650> at<00:04:20.770> that<00:04:20.799> she<00:04:21.190> looks<00:04:21.430> crazy

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
here just look at that she looks crazy

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.150 
here just look at that she looks crazy
very<00:04:22.930> scary<00:04:23.410> too

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
very scary too

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.400 
very scary too
she's<00:04:24.400> probably<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:25.330> only<00:04:25.360> real<00:04:25.840> scary

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
she's probably the only real scary

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.550 
she's probably the only real scary
looking<00:04:26.860> character<00:04:27.490> in<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:28.510> game<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:29.080> mean<00:04:29.470> you

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
looking character in the game I mean you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.030 
looking character in the game I mean you
can<00:04:29.770> say<00:04:30.030> omen<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.180> slightly<00:04:31.660> but<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.500> just

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
can say omen is slightly but I just

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.770 
can say omen is slightly but I just
think<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.370> whole<00:04:33.400> body<00:04:33.820> type<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.420> everything

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
think the whole body type and everything

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.630 
think the whole body type and everything
the<00:04:34.870> way<00:04:34.990> omen<00:04:35.500> looks<00:04:35.740> kind<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.190> takes<00:04:36.520> that

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
the way omen looks kind of takes that

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.150 
the way omen looks kind of takes that
away<00:04:36.790> but<00:04:37.240> this<00:04:37.450> character<00:04:37.990> looks<00:04:38.290> creepy

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
away but this character looks creepy

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.370 
away but this character looks creepy
really<00:04:39.700> does<00:04:40.090> look<00:04:40.300> creep<00:04:40.540> in<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.170> really

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
really does look creep in and I really

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.330 
really does look creep in and I really
like<00:04:41.560> that<00:04:42.720> yeah<00:04:43.720> that<00:04:43.990> looks<00:04:44.290> pretty<00:04:45.070> awesome

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
like that yeah that looks pretty awesome

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.820 
like that yeah that looks pretty awesome
and<00:04:45.880> in<00:04:46.390> many<00:04:46.630> ways<00:04:46.900> there's<00:04:47.320> also<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.650> lot<00:04:47.770> of

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
and in many ways there's also a lot of

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.710 
and in many ways there's also a lot of
resemblance<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.910> character<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.510> a

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
resemblance to the character and a

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.830 
resemblance to the character and a
grudge<00:04:50.020> as<00:04:50.230> well<00:04:50.940> especially<00:04:51.940> in<00:04:52.390> that<00:04:52.510> photo

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
grudge as well especially in that photo

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.440 
grudge as well especially in that photo
and<00:04:53.170> I<00:04:53.770> guess<00:04:54.040> it<00:04:54.310> all<00:04:54.460> kind<00:04:54.730> of<00:04:54.850> ties<00:04:55.090> in<00:04:55.300> and
