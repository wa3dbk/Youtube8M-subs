00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.519
 how to make a good reservation 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.949
 if you are a student and want to make a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.720
 Ball was already going to school or if you are 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.060
 literary blogger wants to improve his 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.029
 levels that this is the focus of our video 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.630
 accessible until the end because it is well 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.449
 interesting, it's good, let's go then one 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.160
 The topic of making a good review is 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 very important thing for the whole 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.060
 literary script first by attracting 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.350
 public 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.770
 It's obvious that you have to have a good 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.620
 Portuguese a good review when everything 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.260
 well attract the public and secondly 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.010
 because the industry analyzed this a lot 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.350
 Sun 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.780
 I'm from the old woman is the editor's focus 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.300
 good reviews in and detail and everything 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.980
 but how to do a review like 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.010
 attract such publishers as attracting 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.450
 how to make a person read the review 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:10.170
 and that our review is really 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:12.840
 good to go back in the hair because there 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.780
 first thing in translation that review 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.140
 she has to have an introduction in the truth 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.660
 all type of text is a 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.700
 dissertation will receive any kind of 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.840
 text 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.800
 poetic some genes that are 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.159
 more with his father 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.680
 they have to have a formula 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.290
 line the introduction of development and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 There are networks that you already know 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.880
 in the introduction it is imperative that you 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.490
 put the object information 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.280
 you have to keep in mind that your reader 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 he does not know anything about what you 're going to say 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.830
 for example also doing a reform 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.630
 a review on the book you have to 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.330
 speak in the first paragraph 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.600
 What is this book is not to write to 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.509
 synopsis of ours 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.700
 Who is talking when it was published? 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.869
 information that you think you are 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.039
 you reader 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:13.030
 he will he will want to know 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.000
 Of course every book every every movie 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.980
 each product is different information 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.140
 maybe this book is interesting to put 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.480
 the date of publication because it is old 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.100
 and I think the voter will be more 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.640
 controversial most relevant event put 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.910
 that 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.310
 or maybe try to put it in the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.239
 introduction that is a movie made by a 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.220
 dog actor top of the moment without this 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.090
 information if you think the reader 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.709
 know will usually put all 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.890
 literary tastes is a form or 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.500
 puts editor at top of garlic 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.250
 publication and a literary genius and then 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.830
 makes a quick and quick sense of 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.970
 hydration node a description of what 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.100
 the story 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.230
 You might as well ask yourself what you 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.810
 I would like to know from this book if you 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.700
 I did not know anything about my blog 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.610
 I usually put the name of the book 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.280
 obvious 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.870
 lacked a bit about the history and 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.970
 production can not be too large but 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.480
 it can also be very small to put there 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:21.040
 what is the type has to be one of the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.579
 five lines to eight lines and beauty 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.769
 good development what I see in the 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.109
 tonight is that she does not have 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.030
 no planning you have to have 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.489
 planning new questions 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.290
 if you do it's not even someday if you did 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.540
 some kind of proof that asks for writing 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.030
 you know that has the small element 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.780
 you can not write start talking 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.180
 about something back to talk about 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.579
 another poetry take the first tale 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.160
 You can not do this without talking about the tail. 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.060
 talk about it I'm going to talk about the 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.950
 River 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.140
 You have to have a plan for 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.540
 example in my veins I do the 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.670
 next is the analyzes five points 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.270
 generally that the action 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.170
 the author writer writes 10 wrongly wrong 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.040
 What 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.900
 the plot the characters the physical book and 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.610
 general assessment that the thing that 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.920
 You make one more conclusion if you 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.410
 liked or not in the book really are 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.049
 these accounts but you can have others 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.320
 points for example is and illustrations and 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.930
 thinks that the strength of the book makes 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.090
 for about it comments and beauty everything is 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.150
 I know if these topics are going to you 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.860
 do in the race the character does not need 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.200
 to be 5 any example because I do not 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.389
 I put 5 but for example chose three 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.860
 narration characters off 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.729
 the first will talk about the 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.729
 characters just will not mix where lie 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.150
 a baby to be nervous to tell 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.310
 everything you found feeling if you did not 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.740
 let's go easy 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.880
 certain second can not be redundant 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.080
 for example he said something we will think 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.210
 in our reader 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.950
 he is lazy our readers are 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.380
 very dangerous despite being 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.150
 of books they are lazy they 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.729
 take the world rate 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.220
 the value was looking for another beauty not 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.340
 may redundant re- subscribed 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.039
 a fragile civilian who is coherent not 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.520
 paste or otherwise inscribe 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:27.490
 I do not trust your cue write 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.430
 write the sentence does not put either or 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.080
 write the same thing 3 4 times and you read 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.340
 here or there the same information is 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.550
 speaking the same new thing 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:42.150
 No redundancy is what I wrote down 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.860
 always have a good time getting people 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.860
 unfortunately 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:53.159
 Blog Hill will have a lot of leads with 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:57.569
 many mistakes that the verbs errors know 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:06:00.060
 I slept and sleep with her 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.909
 in the infinitive you do not have to be 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:08.360
 Portuguese smart but you have to have it 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:14.400
 so basic then forward because it's good 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:17.490
 okay last ration topic has to be 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.270
 on the hand excuses the reserve in its 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.740
 conclusion 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:27.509
 There is no comment on the 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.219
 topics and not a mess you have to 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:32.639
 have a call from that 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:33.900
 if you want to be redundant to talk be 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.909
 confused 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.250
 if you want to pick up some topics that you 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:41.300
 already said lets play to the conclusion 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.430
 understood that there will be a 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.710
 all memory of what you said in 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.539
 tv speak if you liked if you think 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.750
 it 's worth it if you think it's worth it 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.789
 get rid of shit beauty 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.339
 remember that in your development you have 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:58.680
 have arguments that confirm your 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.900
 conclusion can not have a conclusion there 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.759
 at the beginning then start increasing or 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:07.020
 It can even if you're very good at 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:09.659
 write but how difficult is the tip 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.300
 are you the mess there at the end and the 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:14.819
 arguments will increase because 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.680
 Did you find that bad book right? 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.830
 usually already has the conclusion of the mind 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.199
 I finished my book, we suck 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.839
 to pass because it was a shit to start 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:27.419
 write and then just put your 

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:29.699
 opinion in the confusion, it's good, people went 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:32.009
 Do you want to give any tips 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.259
 for the bloggers you are a reader and I think 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:35.250
 Blogger hill who writes a lot 

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:36.790
 wrongly 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.070
 today you want a tip 

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.200
 gives a hint to improve and I think I've 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.000
 It is good but want to improve one leaves here 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.470
 Review I think super valid to people 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.870
 improve our reserves even 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.630
 because you're strangers to and 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.160
 of your experiences follow the blogs 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:55.470
