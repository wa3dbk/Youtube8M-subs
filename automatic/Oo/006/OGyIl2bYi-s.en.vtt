00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
an awesome exercise I'm reading terrain

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.349 
an awesome exercise I'm reading terrain
we<00:04:15.370> have<00:04:15.489> somebody<00:04:15.790> parts<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.150> course

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
we have somebody parts of the course

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.529

compromised

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.049 

approach<00:04:31.659> particular<00:04:32.199> turns<00:04:32.699> you<00:04:33.699> actually

00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:34.059 
approach particular turns you actually

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:35.820 
approach particular turns you actually
need<00:04:34.209> to<00:04:34.240> engage<00:04:34.419> in<00:04:34.869> left<00:04:35.110> briefly<00:04:35.379> to<00:04:35.679> get

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
need to engage in left briefly to get

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.290 
need to engage in left briefly to get
the<00:04:35.919> vehicle<00:04:36.069> to<00:04:36.309> do

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
the vehicle to do

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.570 
the vehicle to do
it's<00:04:37.990> be<00:04:38.140> more<00:04:38.320> responsive<00:04:38.890> essentially<00:04:39.340> and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
it's be more responsive essentially and

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.610 
it's be more responsive essentially and
this<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> perfect<00:04:40.720> place<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:40.900> practice<00:04:41.200> that

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
this is a perfect place to practice that

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.830 
this is a perfect place to practice that
skill<00:04:41.800> set<00:04:44.700> when<00:04:45.700> we<00:04:45.790> began<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.360> portion<00:04:46.750> of

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
skill set when we began this portion of

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.240 
skill set when we began this portion of
the<00:04:46.930> jumping<00:04:47.290> course<00:04:47.530> we<00:04:47.710> were<00:04:47.830> told<00:04:48.040> that<00:04:48.190> we

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
the jumping course we were told that we

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.220 
the jumping course we were told that we
could<00:04:48.370> go<00:04:48.490> 40<00:04:48.910> miles<00:04:49.090> per<00:04:49.210> hour<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.750> then<00:04:50.110> we

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
could go 40 miles per hour and then we

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.670 
could go 40 miles per hour and then we
built<00:04:50.500> up<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.950> 50<00:04:51.280> miles<00:04:51.430> per<00:04:51.580> hour<00:04:52.680> we're

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
built up to 50 miles per hour we're

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:04.839 
built up to 50 miles per hour we're
gonna<00:04:53.770> jump<00:04:54.070> this<00:04:54.160> out

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.329 

so<00:05:05.849> having<00:05:06.330> had<00:05:06.629> so<00:05:07.259> much<00:05:07.409> awesome<00:05:07.769> time<00:05:07.919> out

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:08.339 
so having had so much awesome time out

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.339 
so having had so much awesome time out
here<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.759> to<00:05:09.330> practice<00:05:09.749> on<00:05:09.839> these<00:05:09.959> really

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
here that to practice on these really

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.779 
here that to practice on these really
big<00:05:10.559> jumps<00:05:13.099> really<00:05:14.099> they're<00:05:14.249> just<00:05:14.639> three

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
big jumps really they're just three

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.639 
big jumps really they're just three
basic<00:05:14.909> things<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.569> you've<00:05:15.719> got<00:05:15.989> to<00:05:16.139> do<00:05:16.289> and

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:16.649 
basic things that you've got to do and

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.979 
basic things that you've got to do and
no<00:05:16.830> one<00:05:17.129> is<00:05:17.849> you<00:05:18.179> have<00:05:18.389> to<00:05:18.539> have<00:05:18.689> your<00:05:18.869> wheel

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:18.989 
no one is you have to have your wheel

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:22.609 
no one is you have to have your wheel
Street<00:05:19.669> fundamental<00:05:20.669> first<00:05:21.360> point<00:05:21.629> second

00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:22.619 
Street fundamental first point second

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:24.139 
Street fundamental first point second
you<00:05:22.800> need<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.039> let<00:05:23.249> off<00:05:23.369> the<00:05:23.489> acceleration

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:24.149 
you need to let off the acceleration

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:26.119 
you need to let off the acceleration
rate<00:05:24.300> as<00:05:24.479> you<00:05:24.509> reach<00:05:24.719> the<00:05:24.869> peak<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.319> that<00:05:25.830> jump

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:26.129 
rate as you reach the peak of that jump

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:47.299 
rate as you reach the peak of that jump
and<00:05:27.029> third

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:47.309 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:49.699 

just<00:05:48.209> win-win<00:05:48.569> man<00:05:48.839> it's<00:05:49.079> just<00:05:49.109> win-win<00:05:49.529> in

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:49.709 
just win-win man it's just win-win in

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:51.949 
just win-win man it's just win-win in
there<00:05:49.829> after<00:05:49.979> when<00:05:50.849> it<00:05:50.999> goes<00:05:51.089> exactly<00:05:51.299> the<00:05:51.869> way

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:51.959 
there after when it goes exactly the way

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.899 
there after when it goes exactly the way
you<00:05:52.019> wanted<00:05:52.379> to<00:05:52.559> it's<00:05:53.069> phenomenal
