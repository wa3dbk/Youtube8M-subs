when<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> kid<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.820> said<00:01:26.850> this

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
when you have a kid but like I said this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.840 
when you have a kid but like I said this
is<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.590> hypothetical

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
is just all like this is hypothetical

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.690 
is just all like this is hypothetical
you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.530> i<00:01:31.860> guess<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.430> baby

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you know so i guess with this baby

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.819 
you know so i guess with this baby
thinking<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.659> ups<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.320> ideal

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
thinking about that ups like the ideal

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.260 
thinking about that ups like the ideal
time<00:01:35.159> would<00:01:35.970> probably<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:37.100> october<00:01:38.270> october

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
time would probably be october october

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.810 
time would probably be october october
maybe<00:01:39.689> november<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.799> why<00:01:41.040> ok<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
maybe november and this is why ok so

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.069 
maybe november and this is why ok so
just<00:01:41.939> hearing<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.450> i<00:01:42.479> said<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.960> all

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
just hearing out like i said this is all

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.690 
just hearing out like i said this is all
ridiculousness<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.100> i<00:01:44.189> would<00:01:44.340> never<00:01:44.369> really

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
ridiculousness and i would never really

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.840 
ridiculousness and i would never really
try<00:01:45.079> specifically<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.729> like<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
try specifically for this because like I

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.190 
try specifically for this because like I
learned<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.210> Grayson<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.869> doesn't<00:01:49.110> work

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
learned with Grayson that doesn't work

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.630 
learned with Grayson that doesn't work
like<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.890> don't<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.220> what<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.610> always

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
like that you don't get what you always

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.289 
like that you don't get what you always
want<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.140> um<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.890> but

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
want you know so um but but

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.940 
want you know so um but but
hypothetically<00:01:54.299> speaking<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
hypothetically speaking you know the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.649 
hypothetically speaking you know the
reason<00:01:56.250> why<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.820> i<00:01:57.270> would<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.630> my

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
reason why is because I i would have my

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.870 
reason why is because I i would have my
maternity<00:01:58.259> wardrobe<00:01:58.649> would<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:59.009> set<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
maternity wardrobe would be set the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
maternity wardrobe would be set the
weather<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> girl<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> boy<00:02:01.229> they

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
weather it was a girl or a boy they

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.200 
weather it was a girl or a boy they
should<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.890> able<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.189> use<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.759> clothes<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
should be able to use the clothes that

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.750 
should be able to use the clothes that
we<00:02:03.240> are

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
we are

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.640 
we are
for<00:02:04.000> either<00:02:04.120> about<00:02:04.840> then<00:02:05.080> I'm<00:02:05.230> going<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.530> be<00:02:05.620> a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
for either about then I'm going to be a

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
little off like we probably need a few

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.730

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
younger age but it would work mostly and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.720 
younger age but it would work mostly and
