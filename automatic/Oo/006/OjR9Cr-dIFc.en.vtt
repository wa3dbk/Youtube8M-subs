00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:22.710
 here presented projects robot 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.860
 it's mainly about the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.750
 students by working alone 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.950
 the robots already a high motivation 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.960
 to give 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.369
 interesting is in this project 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.560
 all things that one here 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.079
 Basic knowledge can apply here 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.730
 it's about speed and acceleration 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.000
 that is, it is not just one 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.200
 it is pure programming but it is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.820
 just a problem the physical 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.040
 correctly apply laws 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.110
 my task in this project is the 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.620
 A human's movement is through kinect 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.980
 camera and we data in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.860
 Robot position allowing the robot 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.530
 also recognizes and implements the coordinates 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.590
 my job is the basic one 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.329
 Movements on the robot by means of cables 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.350
 transfer and interface and down 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:20.179
 simply test movements with it 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.219
 when we transfer to the robot and 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.499
 the engines do not break and the 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.659
 Programming language is very different 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:31.380
 I never made that I must therefore 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.219
 First you can really learn properly 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.219
 no longer fits the clock 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.340
 What is so special about this 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.189
 prix finder is that one to the project 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.869
 I also learn something new myself 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.259
 That's a lot of fun because I'm easy 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.810
 look like now the acquired knowledge 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.319
 the previous semester actually 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.030
 flows into a realization of one 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.030
 concrete project
