00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:05.839
Bachelor in International Hospitality Management
at Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL).
Meet EHL students from Asia talking about...

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.839
how EHL Bachelor in Hospitality Programme bring management and analytic skills to success into hospitality industry.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.269
Hi, my name is Stephanie Grawehr. I'm half Swiss, half filipino but

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.199
I lived in Singapour

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:28.199
and i'm currently in the second year at EHL.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.870
You startup in AP which is the preparatory year

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.999
and it's really a mix of theory and
practicals.

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.719
One week you're in class and you learning
about cuts of meat and then the next

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.689
week you're doing housekeeping or you're
in pastry making your own ice creams

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:49.039
developing your own menus and so there's
such a great mix between practicals

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.150
and theory.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.749
And then in the second year, which is
the first of the Bachelor in Hospitality Programme,

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.139
you sort of start getting more into
theory in really academics. 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:59.850
You're starting to study different management
principles

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.530
like human resources, economics, tourism
economics and law as well.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.730
Finally the second year, you then
really work a lot with one group on

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.640
integrated projects and there's a
lot of focus on group work.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.040
And then finally, in the thirty year, you
then have a

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.700
combination which is the SBP (Student Business Group) or a
dissertation and again you can do this

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.720
in a group

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.010
and so there is really a lot of interaction
with the industry upon real life projects...

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.020
...and as well as the theory which you learn
in class. So it's definetly a great

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.000
chance to involve yourself with industry
for the future.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.329
Hello! my name is Johanna Lindenstruth, 
I'm half Swiss and half singaporean

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.329
and I'm currently in the second year 
of my Bachelor Programme

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.100
Besides,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.080
going to classes and also

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.090
doing all the group projects there
is many different opportunities for us to

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.000
really get involved in the EHL
community. There are over twenty different

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.610
committees here at school which are all
student-run.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.630
There's definitely something for
everyone from culinary and arts getting

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.429
involved in charity programmes and also
organizing events and sports of course!

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:17.529
I personally, I am involved in the inter-religious
committee which really try to help

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:22.169
students and also staff to become aware
of the diversity of cultures,

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.239
backgrounds,

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.359
and also with all religions which are
represented here at EHL.

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.179
And in order to also fasterned openness

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:34.449
and acceptance for such
differences.

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:39.749
I believe all these activities really
help us to have the possibility to make

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:44.769
use of what we have learned in class. So put
into practice all the theories 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.809
and things we have learned.

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:50.999
Most importantly it gives us a
good balance between work and fun.

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:55.549
I believe EHL is definitely a great
experience.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:02.549
Hello! my name is Joshua Gan. I'm from Singapour and
I'm a third year student here at EHL.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.109
For the introduction week, when we first came to
school in our first year

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.339
And during that week we got to meet everybody. 
All the 80 nationalities on campus. 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.849
We go to the have different activities together: 
visited cheese factory, Chocolate factory,

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.409
we visited a restaurants

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.849
we had barbecues together and all that. 
So it was great fun and it really help us

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.269
get out our homesickness right at the start.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.339
And also getting used to
different culture, different opening

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.759
hours of shops. Because in Switzerland
nothing's open on sunday. 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.919
Everything close at six or seven otherwise.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.899
and then back home, everything is open all the time.
That was something i need to get

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.369
used to and being together people coming
from different countries really help on that.

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:46.369
