 Few months ago something similar to this Tteyuu trunk feeling around with it in the background Tan 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:25.110

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.840
 Yes I took it out of the bag 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.469
 Expressed worship cheat to have Nehonto simple 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.469
 It is 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:44.320
 Such a pattern is cute, but it is a commonly used pattern 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:52.050
 I just wrote something down just for this purpose 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:58.290
 I was very happy if it was, but it is a pattern that makes it feel like a little use over time 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.970
 I thought that the side of the can and the area around here was 6 d- but also the children of the tribe 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.310
 Already 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.430
 Unexpected solved shadow Usura 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.890
 Mark hono buono is included 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.890
 Here I did not notice first at all 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:20.000
 Then I will open the inside Here if I have nothing to do with rock or anything, I just addicted to Paco 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.660
 Niro is in 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 There is nothing in particular of 2 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.430
 I will 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:35.870
 I would like to see the card of this Meramera ion that comes with 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.520
 Youkai Rank c's Melamella Ion at the Seikeien Burning 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:46.260
 Yuju level is 1 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:49.090
 Another recently opened ice came out with melamel ions, but the front side looks like this 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.340
 hp Toka lift whether the goods 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.340
 You're wrong hp 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:03.300
 Whether hp is Toka force but I know together 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:07.190
 Protect and duck a little but I thought a little by you I Oh do exactly the same difference, respectively 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.190
 The power seems to be different 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:16.160
 Here is ice cemetery had been included this time 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.680
 It was attached to Can-can 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.670
 The pattern is also slightly different 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.400
 A little more behind 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.150
 Like this kind of ice 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:34.740
 I was glad if the pattern was included but it is common 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:39.420
 The back is such a propaganda in the feeling that I poke to a fan book or hand 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:44.099
 There are even more such melamella ions and ice, so this is more 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.520
 It would be better if the cards with only ufo catcher prizes were included 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.960
 I think 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.960
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.590
 When I put a card in 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.230
 Right 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.560
 It's a little larger than the card 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:07.300
 It looks good to put in here and carry around 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.099
 Today are five of the mini can bags with Yo- Kai watch card that I took with ufo catcher 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:15.330
 I tried to introduce the type 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.330
 I think that I want to come to take in the other type was also cute
