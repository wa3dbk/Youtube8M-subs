00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:09.530
 carlos an average economic cutoff 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.250
 of one year you have to know leg one 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.250
 Once you are tender 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.840
 I watered the little flower dress for 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.570
 please please I want to start now 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.570
 thank you my life thank you what I do 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.300
 let's start cooking the meat with 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.360
 one part snap sauce garnish 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.360
 bittersweet can really good 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.360
 we started 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.199
 let's go with a little oil and this 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.960
 piece of red and how it is 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.449
 we're going to start browning in that pan 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.850
 in this oil so warm up a 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.370
 little and in the idea as I told you that 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.979
 it is a magnificent political cut to this 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.170
 there are you feel crackling part 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.269
 external of the meat is the small amount 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.010
 of oil that we have put in there 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.510
 achieve it a little bit on one side and the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.150
 another one and meanwhile I'll go 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:15.680
 adding some salt 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:18.020
 obviously I have the room and I put him 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.659
 quite salt because I will not put 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.729
 never again in all the preparation and they are 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.600
 talking air a piece of more or less 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.729
 kilo 800 two kilos of meat a meat 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.850
 means forest days and needle or robbie 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.220
 now you're not going to pretend to take out a robot 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.080
 very tender in a very short corruption 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.330
 this is going to take a cooking 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.250
 about an hour and a half once 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.409
 that we brown them from one side we will go 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.770
 giving good we are going to give it back 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.990
 spicy like that for worshiping the other side 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.850
 this is a kind of makeup by 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.909
 true because the meat is recontracted 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.420
 raw inside but it is essential to go 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.380
 giving it this color tonality in a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.119
 skillet 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.619
 while we wash sautéing with a 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.580
 little bit of aromatic garnish 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.120
 carrot 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.860
 there is the carrot to stand 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.509
 remember that I will not put more salt 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.990
 because I already put enough of a 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.810
 now we're going with onions and 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.150
 all this will accompany this meat 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.310
 during his hour and a half of traveling in 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.430
 the oven an oven that does not have to be 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.630
 to the sheets you'll need three quarters 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.940
 of its power 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.610
 previously undertaken already three quarters 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.250
 and the moment you go in the tray 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.880
 capped to the oven and count an hour and 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.690
 half 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.430
 we have green sachets or the inside 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.930
 this whole aromatic position 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.660
 comes very well to the meat is going to 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.850
 generate a lot of aromas from there comes the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.340
 name and apart will give you moisture 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.470
 during cooking because if I did 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.280
 they were putting in a pan the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.640
 purpose of marking it to seal it to start 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.310
 to generate flavor the main cooking goes 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.170
 to elapse inside that can 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.310
 where and how are they leading 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.160
 why 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.250
 in this new pleasant night will be the 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.250
 career 300 other large 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.010
 apart more let's go with more leaf scent 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.319
 laurel a leaf of laurel 210 teeth 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.440
 of garlic barely crushed with the tenderloin 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.050
 knife that they're going to aromatize and now 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.739
 that we come with that although with a wine 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.739
 red 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.140
 there we are going to raise the whole fund of 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.920
 cooking we will generate much more 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.709
 humidity with this wine and logically that 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.100
 we are going to flavor red wine and other 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.350
 wine agüita agüita in the tap broth 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.820
 mixture of wine in this case because 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.890
 we wanted to make a red video could 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.860
 be a white wine or directly if not 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.870
 you want wine you go with the broth and apart 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.580
 something that you should not forget to give 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.209
 a really a differential flavor is a 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.770
 very good my old man is balmy 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.500
 Argentine chefs use the line 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.990
 of dressings two anchors two anchors gives 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.990

 we are going to cover it with aluminum foil 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.440
 I do not have too much time to lose 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.520
 capello send it an hour and a half to 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.740
 oven without more 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.900
 wrap up today as I sent it to 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.370
 oven and now we're going with this sauteed 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.530
 of the times of garrison 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.780
 titled acidulated that I want to say with 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.060
 This has some sweet nuances and has 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.830
 been amply terrific I'm going to 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.720
 hurry I will support you to turn on the 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.479
 fire now we start then with the 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.300
 feel a little bit of oil and this is 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.150
 I insist that a mixture of sauce and 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.000
 garrison and then on the oil 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.310
 hot let's do if to that onion 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.500

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.080
 and there he will know that the announcer starts 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.949
 to talk faster and faster 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.860
 faster to do it with a little bit of salt 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.620
 and now let's go stirring onions 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.599
 I remove and nothing more than a little more than 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.500
 green onion and this base is very 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:42.810
 simple but if you at this moment 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.320
 Want to give it a spin thread as 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:50.139
 we work with league and cough 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:53.009
 friends a bass with dried apricots 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:56.270
 to go back with him 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.270
 we go with dates 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:05.060
 corresponding expensive please let 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.280
 with little things like drums 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.040
 then we go with the nuts that 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.370
 you have kept and moth-eaten for 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.010
 Christmas so that the worms are very 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.110
 nutritious are very tasty I tell you 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.360
 that you put everything but at least one 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.200
 You can do it with dried apricots and it's 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.169
 previously boiled or softened with me 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.639
 with dates with plums or by 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.790
 interspersed in gandesa onion 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.919
 scallion and here a few colors 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.380
 hachemí the cute colors flavors 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:39.320
 books contrasts flavors and apart 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.479
 that we have here a little bit of also 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.080
 red wine to follow the wave of the 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:48.080
 jove for cooking the roaming rhythm and 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.479
 I'm going to put honey here 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.150
 but if this is done very quickly with the 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:55.320
 onion with scallions and those 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:59.400
 different 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:02.550
 dried fruit this quickly takes color 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.580
 and does not need more than a few 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.370
 approximately six minutes of fire 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.940
 soft the onion takes the color of the wine 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.920
 red everything is sweet sweet and sour 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.950
 sweetly remember that you have the onion 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.450
 verdeo and notice that later we're going to 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.500
 ride once that meat is 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:24.210
 shows about a good way to puree 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.170
 sweet potato with all those fruits is 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:31.580
 really barbarian barbarian 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.580
 so I do one thing
