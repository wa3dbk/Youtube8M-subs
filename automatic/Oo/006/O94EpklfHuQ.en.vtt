hi<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.170> Juanita<00:00:10.440> Pasquale<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.420> today

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
hi this is Juanita Pasquale and today

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.289 
hi this is Juanita Pasquale and today
I'm<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.929> talk<00:00:13.259> about<00:00:13.500> speed<00:00:14.490> burst<00:00:14.700> for

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
I'm going to talk about speed burst for

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.410 
I'm going to talk about speed burst for
improving<00:00:15.990> picado<00:00:16.650> first<00:00:17.580> I'm<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> talk

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
improving picado first I'm going to talk

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.349 
improving picado first I'm going to talk
about<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:19.140> they<00:00:19.289> are<00:00:19.609> why<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:20.939> them<00:00:21.119> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
about what they are why we use them and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.220 
about what they are why we use them and
then<00:00:21.510> I'm<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.960> give<00:00:22.170> five<00:00:22.800> or<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.460> simple

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
then I'm going to give five or so simple

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.380 
then I'm going to give five or so simple
exercises<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.439> how<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.800> use<00:00:26.580> them<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.029> good

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
exercises on how to use them to good

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.630 
exercises on how to use them to good
effect<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.289> first<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.340> is

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
effect so first of all what they are is

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.150 
effect so first of all what they are is
as<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.210> name<00:00:30.330> implies<00:00:30.660> they're<00:00:30.929> their<00:00:31.230> bursts

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
as the name implies they're their bursts

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.889 
as the name implies they're their bursts
of<00:00:32.250> notes<00:00:32.489> several<00:00:32.880> notes<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> time<00:00:33.329> usually

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
of notes several notes at a time usually

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.340 
of notes several notes at a time usually
three<00:00:34.230> four<00:00:34.469> five<00:00:34.739> up<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:36.090> seven<00:00:36.450> or<00:00:36.960> more<00:00:37.140> but

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
three four five up to seven or more but

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
three four five up to seven or more but
usually<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> compress<00:00:38.399> instead<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.149> five<00:00:39.540> or<00:00:39.690> so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
usually a compress instead of five or so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.979 
usually a compress instead of five or so
notes<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:44.690> you<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:45.780> why

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
notes that we do like and you know why

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.270 
notes that we do like and you know why
we<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.320> them<00:00:46.469> first<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.710> there's<00:00:46.920> musical

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
we do them first of all there's musical

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.889 
we do them first of all there's musical
reasons<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.610> use<00:00:47.640> them<00:00:47.940> musically<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.690> in

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
reasons we use them musically like in

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.209 
reasons we use them musically like in
passages<00:00:49.500> such<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:54.649> so<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:55.739> give<00:00:55.920> they

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
passages such as this so they give they

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.490 
passages such as this so they give they
give<00:00:56.250> an<00:00:56.460> energy<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.420> give<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> nice<00:00:57.840> infusion

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
give an energy to give a nice infusion

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.160 
give an energy to give a nice infusion
of<00:00:58.559> energy<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.329> but<00:01:00.329> secondly<00:01:00.719> they're<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
of energy and but secondly they're a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.860 
of energy and but secondly they're a
tremendous<00:01:01.949> tool<00:01:02.160> for<00:01:02.460> helping<00:01:02.870> improve

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
tremendous tool for helping improve

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.760 
tremendous tool for helping improve
speed<00:01:04.260> overall<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.189> terms<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:06.590> longer<00:01:07.590> scale

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
speed overall in terms of longer scale

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250 
speed overall in terms of longer scale
passages<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.490> our<00:01:08.580> picado<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.049> they're

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
passages in our picado and so they're

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.100 
passages in our picado and so they're
not<00:01:10.409> meant<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> replace<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:12.210> normal<00:01:12.869> scale

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
not meant to replace a normal scale

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.200 
not meant to replace a normal scale
practice<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.280> work<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.880> very

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
practice but they work in a very

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.149 
practice but they work in a very
complimentary<00:01:15.990> fashion<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.680> fact<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
complimentary fashion in fact I like to

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.430 
complimentary fashion in fact I like to
think<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.460> practicing<00:01:17.970> scales<00:01:18.540> longer<00:01:19.110> scales

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.100 

in<00:01:24.440> a<00:01:25.310> slower<00:01:25.640> more<00:01:26.030> deliberate<00:01:26.390> fashion<00:01:26.630> and

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
in a slower more deliberate fashion and

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.090 
in a slower more deliberate fashion and
then<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:27.380> work<00:01:27.560> separately<00:01:28.070> on<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.340> purse

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.680 

sort<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.190> introduced<00:01:34.580> speed<00:01:35.000> into<00:01:35.509> your

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
sort of introduced speed into your

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.870 
sort of introduced speed into your
technique<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.470> then<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.340> becomes<00:01:37.729> I<00:01:37.850> think

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
technique and then it becomes I think

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.480 
technique and then it becomes I think
much<00:01:38.330> easier<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:39.050> do<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.350> scales<00:01:39.710> at<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.009> faster

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
much easier to do the scales at a faster

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.820 
much easier to do the scales at a faster
speed<00:01:40.520> as<00:01:41.090> we<00:01:41.300> once<00:01:41.570> we<00:01:41.750> have<00:01:41.869> developed<00:01:42.020> that

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
speed as we once we have developed that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.290 
speed as we once we have developed that
initial<00:01:43.280> relationship<00:01:43.790> through<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.090> purse

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
initial relationship through the purse

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.120 
initial relationship through the purse
with<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.659> faster<00:01:45.050> speed<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:45.560> then<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.860> can<00:01:46.009> do

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
with the faster speed so then you can do

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.820 
with the faster speed so then you can do
your<00:01:46.220> scale<00:01:47.799> kind<00:01:48.799> of<00:01:48.920> with<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.360> burst<00:01:50.360> like

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
your scale kind of with that burst like

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.370 
your scale kind of with that burst like
energy<00:01:52.420> spend<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.659> know<00:01:53.690> stretched<00:01:54.200> out<00:01:54.350> over

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
energy spend you know stretched out over

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.160 
energy spend you know stretched out over
a<00:01:54.590> longer<00:01:54.799> span<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.640> notes<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.509> that's<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
a longer span of notes so that's the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.719 
a longer span of notes so that's the
idea<00:01:57.410> that<00:01:57.440> they<00:01:57.740> work<00:01:57.920> together<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.550> think

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
idea that they work together I think

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.419 
idea that they work together I think
very<00:01:59.119> well<00:01:59.300> so<00:01:59.660> I'm<00:01:59.810> going<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.020> talk<00:02:00.200> about<00:02:00.560> my

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
very well so I'm going to talk about my

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.669 
very well so I'm going to talk about my
favorite<00:02:01.850> burst<00:02:02.090> exercises<00:02:02.960> this<00:02:03.170> all<00:02:03.380> draws

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
favorite burst exercises this all draws

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.620 
favorite burst exercises this all draws
very<00:02:03.920> heavily<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:04.580> my<00:02:05.000> first<00:02:05.300> pick<00:02:05.479> out<00:02:05.600> a

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
very heavily on my first pick out a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.930 
very heavily on my first pick out a
video<00:02:05.929> that<00:02:06.229> if<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.039> haven't<00:02:07.220> seen<00:02:07.550> that<00:02:07.580> yet

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
video that if you haven't seen that yet

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.609 
video that if you haven't seen that yet
you<00:02:08.090> should<00:02:08.269> check<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.479> out<00:02:08.630> because<00:02:08.899> this

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
you should check that out because this

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.620 
you should check that out because this
is<00:02:09.679> very<00:02:09.950> much<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.100> continuation<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.000> so

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
is very much a continuation of that so

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.559 
is very much a continuation of that so
my<00:02:12.500> favorite<00:02:12.890> basic<00:02:13.580> exercise<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.330> four

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
my favorite basic exercise is a four

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:26.620 
my favorite basic exercise is a four
note<00:02:14.750> burst<00:02:24.940> very<00:02:25.940> straightforward<00:02:26.480> it's

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
note burst very straightforward it's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.880 
note burst very straightforward it's
exactly<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.019> same<00:02:27.140> thing<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.350> do<00:02:27.470> for<00:02:27.650> normal

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
exactly the same thing I do for normal

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.430 
exactly the same thing I do for normal
picado<00:02:28.220> it's<00:02:28.880> just<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.329> I<00:02:29.360> stop<00:02:29.780> after<00:02:30.049> each

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
picado it's just that I stop after each

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.500 
picado it's just that I stop after each
for<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:30.860> have<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> little<00:02:31.280> pause<00:02:34.329> whereas<00:02:35.329> in<00:02:35.420> a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
for and have a little pause whereas in a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.990 
for and have a little pause whereas in a
normal<00:02:35.540> picado<00:02:36.140> exercise<00:02:36.620> you'd<00:02:36.799> have<00:02:40.000> be

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
normal picado exercise you'd have be

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.120 
normal picado exercise you'd have be
continuous<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:41.780> here<00:02:41.930> we<00:02:42.019> have<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.380> four

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
continuous so here we have the four

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.490 
continuous so here we have the four
separate<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.450> set<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.750> four<00:02:44.959> notes<00:02:49.360> and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
separate the set of four notes and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.539 
separate the set of four notes and
ideally<00:02:51.500> like<00:02:51.620> with<00:02:51.799> everything<00:02:52.250> we<00:02:52.370> just

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
ideally like with everything we just

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.630 
ideally like with everything we just
want<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.820> start<00:02:53.030> slow<00:02:54.400> placement<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.459> each

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
want to start slow placement of each

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.710 
want to start slow placement of each
finger<00:02:55.910> in<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.209> right<00:02:56.329> hand<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:56.570> very

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
finger in the right hand is very

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.530 
finger in the right hand is very
important<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.850> way<00:03:01.940> we<00:03:02.090> actually<00:03:02.420> get

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
important so that way we actually get

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.090 
important so that way we actually get
the<00:03:02.630> same<00:03:02.930> quality<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.530> sound<00:03:03.769> from<00:03:03.859> every

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
the same quality of sound from every

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.920 
the same quality of sound from every
single<00:03:04.280> note<00:03:04.549> so<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.060> would<00:03:05.329> just<00:03:05.450> go<00:03:05.600> up<00:03:05.630> the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
single note so I would just go up the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.990 
single note so I would just go up the
guitar<00:03:06.109> and<00:03:06.739> down<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.220> guitar<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:07.760> do

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
guitar and down the guitar you can do

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.449 
guitar and down the guitar you can do
that<00:03:08.120> on<00:03:08.299> all<00:03:08.450> six<00:03:08.720> strings<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.380> even<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.370> the

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
that on all six strings and even on the

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.150 
that on all six strings and even on the
six<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:15.290> can<00:03:15.320> even<00:03:15.560> go<00:03:15.739> to

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
six you can even go to

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.960 
six you can even go to
hi<00:03:16.340> friends<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:23.330> as<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.600> go<00:03:23.750> down<00:03:23.960> once<00:03:24.650> again

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
hi friends and as you go down once again

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.970 
hi friends and as you go down once again
very<00:03:25.970> often<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.870> direction<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.620> like<00:03:27.830> to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
very often that direction I like to

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.770 
very often that direction I like to
reverse<00:03:28.250> direction<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:28.760> if<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:28.910> start<00:03:29.420> with<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
reverse direction so if I start with the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.990 
reverse direction so if I start with the
index<00:03:30.260> going<00:03:30.830> up<00:03:31.010> index<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.580> pinkie<00:03:31.850> on<00:03:31.880> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
index going up index the pinkie on the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.920 
index going up index the pinkie on the
way<00:03:32.120> down<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.330> would<00:03:32.570> serve<00:03:32.750> pinkie<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.480> again

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
way down I would serve pinkie so again

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.490 
way down I would serve pinkie so again
for<00:03:43.480> practice<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:44.690> may<00:03:44.930> need<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.260> go<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.410> little

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
for practice you may need to go a little

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.200 
for practice you may need to go a little
bit<00:03:45.770> slower<00:03:45.980> at<00:03:46.130> first<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.700> direction

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
bit slower at first in that direction

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.090 
bit slower at first in that direction
I<00:03:47.360> find<00:03:47.660> people's<00:03:48.080> coordination<00:03:48.590> going

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
I find people's coordination going

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.980 
I find people's coordination going
pinkie<00:03:49.640> towards<00:03:50.000> index<00:03:50.390> seems<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.840> be<00:03:50.960> a

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
pinkie towards index seems to be a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.460 
pinkie towards index seems to be a
little<00:03:52.330> more<00:03:53.330> challenging<00:03:53.780> at<00:03:53.930> first<00:03:53.960> than

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
little more challenging at first than

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.730 
little more challenging at first than
index<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.220> pinkie<00:03:55.550> so<00:03:55.760> then<00:03:56.390> once<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.230> feels

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
index to pinkie so then once that feels

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.280 
index to pinkie so then once that feels
relatively<00:03:58.750> established<00:03:59.750> in<00:03:59.870> your<00:03:59.960> hand<00:04:00.140> I

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
relatively established in your hand I

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.470 
relatively established in your hand I
would<00:04:00.440> do<00:04:00.640> exactly<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:02.000> same<00:04:02.060> thing<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.450> I

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
would do exactly the same thing that I

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.120 
would do exactly the same thing that I
do<00:04:02.570> in<00:04:02.720> normal<00:04:02.930> picado<00:04:03.230> exercises<00:04:03.830> as<00:04:03.950> well

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
do in normal picado exercises as well

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.030 
do in normal picado exercises as well
which<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:05.080> stretch<00:04:06.080> out<00:04:06.260> those<00:04:06.440> four<00:04:06.830> notes

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
which is stretch out those four notes

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.230 
which is stretch out those four notes
that<00:04:07.130> you're<00:04:07.280> doing<00:04:07.430> right<00:04:07.580> hand<00:04:07.790> now<00:04:07.910> over

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
that you're doing right hand now over

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.270 
that you're doing right hand now over
all<00:04:08.600> four<00:04:09.020> fingers<00:04:09.170> in<00:04:09.350> left<00:04:09.560> hand<00:04:09.740> so<00:04:15.280> and

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
all four fingers in left hand so and

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.170 
all four fingers in left hand so and
again<00:04:16.519> that<00:04:16.730> can<00:04:16.910> become

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.900 

etc<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.350> then<00:04:24.440> on<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.650> way<00:04:24.740> back<00:04:24.770> down<00:04:25.190> again

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
etc and then on the way back down again

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.830 
etc and then on the way back down again
all<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.180> way<00:04:26.240> up<00:04:26.389> on<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.780> way<00:04:26.900> back<00:04:27.110> down<00:04:28.840> same

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
all the way up on the way back down same

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.870 
all the way up on the way back down same
thing<00:04:30.080> as<00:04:30.290> with<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.100> other<00:04:31.250> exercise<00:04:31.699> we're

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
thing as with the other exercise we're

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:39.460 
thing as with the other exercise we're
gonna<00:04:31.970> go<00:04:32.090> pinky<00:04:32.449> first<00:04:32.720> pinky<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.169> index<00:04:38.470> so

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
gonna go pinky first pinky to index so

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.969 
gonna go pinky first pinky to index so
that's<00:04:40.370> exercise<00:04:41.360> number<00:04:41.540> two<00:04:41.870> once<00:04:42.680> that

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
that's exercise number two once that

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.820 
that's exercise number two once that
becomes<00:04:43.600> fluid<00:04:44.620> obviously<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.650> don't

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
becomes fluid obviously I don't

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.500 
becomes fluid obviously I don't
recommend<00:04:46.220> doing<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.639> at<00:04:46.729> that<00:04:46.940> speed<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.479> I

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
recommend doing it at that speed that I

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.939 
recommend doing it at that speed that I
just<00:04:47.750> did<00:04:47.900> until<00:04:48.199> you're<00:04:48.320> very<00:04:48.590> very<00:04:48.800> very

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
just did until you're very very very

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.409 
just did until you're very very very
comfortable<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.610> want<00:04:49.669> to<00:04:49.790> bet<00:04:49.970> gradually

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
comfortable you want to bet gradually

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.480 
comfortable you want to bet gradually
build<00:04:50.690> towards<00:04:50.990> that<00:04:51.050> speed<00:04:51.410> but<00:04:52.370> once

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
build towards that speed but once

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.400 
build towards that speed but once
there's<00:04:52.850> a<00:04:52.910> basic<00:04:53.479> sense<00:04:53.660> of<00:04:53.780> fluidity<00:04:53.930> I<00:04:54.229> like

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
there's a basic sense of fluidity I like

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.120 
there's a basic sense of fluidity I like
to<00:04:54.500> do<00:04:54.620> it

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
to do it

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.790 
to do it
I<00:04:55.160> basically<00:04:55.639> join<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:57.080> first<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:57.560> second

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
I basically join the first and second

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.890 
I basically join the first and second
half<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.400> last<00:04:58.699> exercise<00:04:59.330> together<00:04:59.539> and

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
half of that last exercise together and

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:18.460 
half of that last exercise together and
I<00:04:59.960> get<00:05:00.110> a<00:05:00.139> seven<00:05:00.500> note<00:05:00.590> verse<00:05:00.830> which<00:05:01.010> is<00:05:17.470> and

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
I get a seven note verse which is and

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.710 
I get a seven note verse which is and
again<00:05:18.740> back<00:05:18.979> down

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
again back down

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.710 
again back down
pinky<00:05:20.720> first<00:05:22.030> pinky<00:05:23.030> ring<00:05:23.270> middle<00:05:23.539> index

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
pinky first pinky ring middle index

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.640 
pinky first pinky ring middle index
middle<00:05:24.350> brain<00:05:25.340> pinky<00:05:29.139> so<00:05:30.139> that<00:05:30.289> kind<00:05:30.500> of<00:05:30.530> thing

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
middle brain pinky so that kind of thing

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.710 
middle brain pinky so that kind of thing
so<00:05:30.830> that's<00:05:31.039> again<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.669> could<00:05:31.820> do<00:05:31.880> that<00:05:32.030> all<00:05:32.150> up

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
so that's again you could do that all up

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.450 
so that's again you could do that all up
and<00:05:32.870> down<00:05:32.960> all<00:05:33.139> six<00:05:33.349> strings<00:05:33.560> to<00:05:34.070> your<00:05:34.190> heart's

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
and down all six strings to your heart's

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.390 
and down all six strings to your heart's
delight<00:05:34.669> and<00:05:35.000> then<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:35.690> can<00:05:35.990> uh<00:05:36.229> if<00:05:37.099> that

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
delight and then you can uh if that

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.760 
delight and then you can uh if that
feels<00:05:37.729> good<00:05:38.030> you<00:05:38.210> can<00:05:38.389> add<00:05:38.660> another<00:05:38.960> run<00:05:39.470> and

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
feels good you can add another run and

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:53.210 
feels good you can add another run and
do<00:05:39.950> it<00:05:40.099> make<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.430> 10<00:05:40.610> out<00:05:42.130> 1<00:05:43.130> 2<00:05:43.370> 3<00:05:43.550> 4<00:05:43.910> 5<00:05:44.180> 6

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.030 

and<00:05:53.430> same<00:05:54.419> as<00:05:54.600> always<00:05:54.780> back<00:05:55.229> down<00:05:55.470> with<00:05:55.740> pinky

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
and same as always back down with pinky

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:04.610 
and same as always back down with pinky
first<00:06:01.190> last<00:06:02.190> but<00:06:02.400> not<00:06:02.520> least<00:06:02.759> a<00:06:03.500> little<00:06:04.500> bit

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
first last but not least a little bit

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.900 
first last but not least a little bit
different<00:06:04.889> exercise<00:06:05.280> finally<00:06:05.789> which<00:06:06.270> is<00:06:06.630> um

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
different exercise finally which is um

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.969 
different exercise finally which is um
you<00:06:08.910> know<00:06:09.060> it<00:06:09.150> works<00:06:09.330> pairs<00:06:09.720> nicely<00:06:10.050> um<00:06:10.560> it

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
you know it works pairs nicely um it

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.080 
you know it works pairs nicely um it
works<00:06:11.190> so<00:06:11.550> it's<00:06:11.669> this<00:06:11.910> it's<00:06:12.120> 1<00:06:12.449> 3<00:06:12.870> 1<00:06:13.110> 3<00:06:13.139> 1<00:06:13.440> 2<00:06:14.430> 4<00:06:14.820> 2

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
works so it's this it's 1 3 1 3 1 2 4 2

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.820 
works so it's this it's 1 3 1 3 1 2 4 2
4<00:06:15.389> 2<00:06:15.690> 1<00:06:16.560> 3<00:06:16.860> 1<00:06:17.130> 3<00:06:17.370> 1<00:06:17.729> 2<00:06:18.150> 4<00:06:18.449> 2<00:06:18.630> 4<00:06:18.900> -<00:06:19.139> so<00:06:19.650> does<00:06:19.800> that

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
4 2 1 3 1 3 1 2 4 2 4 - so does that

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.800 
4 2 1 3 1 3 1 2 4 2 4 - so does that
twice<00:06:20.190> and<00:06:20.460> then<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.669> second<00:06:21.000> half<00:06:21.270> of<00:06:21.419> it<00:06:21.600> is

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
twice and then the second half of it is

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:28.760 
twice and then the second half of it is
justice<00:06:23.180> that's<00:06:24.180> 3<00:06:24.510> 4<00:06:24.720> 3<00:06:24.900> 4<00:06:24.990> 3<00:06:25.199> 2<00:06:25.680> 3<00:06:26.190> 2<00:06:26.520> 3<00:06:26.760> 2<00:06:27.169> 1<00:06:28.169> 2<00:06:28.530> 1

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
justice that's 3 4 3 4 3 2 3 2 3 2 1 2 1

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.450 
justice that's 3 4 3 4 3 2 3 2 3 2 1 2 1
2<00:06:28.979> 1<00:06:29.389> again

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
2 1 again

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:41.570 
2 1 again
that's<00:06:32.460> 1<00:06:32.729> 3<00:06:32.760> 1<00:06:33.210> 3<00:06:33.240> 1<00:06:34.699> and<00:06:35.699> then<00:06:35.880> again<00:06:40.190> 3<00:06:41.190> 4<00:06:41.400> 3<00:06:41.520> 4

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
that's 1 3 1 3 1 and then again 3 4 3 4

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.029 
that's 1 3 1 3 1 and then again 3 4 3 4
3<00:06:41.789> 2<00:06:42.210> 3<00:06:42.599> 2<00:06:42.810> 3<00:06:42.990> 2<00:06:43.729> 1<00:06:44.729> 2<00:06:44.910> 1<00:06:45.060> 2<00:06:45.120> 1<00:06:45.710> so<00:06:46.710> again<00:06:46.740> that's

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
3 2 3 2 3 2 1 2 1 2 1 so again that's

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.439 
3 2 3 2 3 2 1 2 1 2 1 so again that's
like<00:06:47.220> a<00:06:47.250> four<00:06:47.550> thread<00:06:47.760> exercise<00:06:48.150> and<00:06:48.240> you<00:06:48.300> can

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
like a four thread exercise and you can

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.120 
like a four thread exercise and you can
just<00:06:48.599> move<00:06:48.720> it<00:06:48.840> down<00:06:49.020> and<00:06:49.229> that<00:06:49.710> sounds<00:06:50.009> like

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
just move it down and that sounds like

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:59.230 
just move it down and that sounds like
this

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.580 

you<00:07:00.240> can<00:07:00.360> keep<00:07:00.449> going<00:07:00.599> so<00:07:00.840> obviously<00:07:01.439> that

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
you can keep going so obviously that

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.619 
you can keep going so obviously that
that<00:07:01.650> starts<00:07:02.430> to<00:07:02.580> work<00:07:02.610> the<00:07:02.849> coordination<00:07:03.419> and

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:03.629 
that starts to work the coordination and

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:05.869 
that starts to work the coordination and
that's<00:07:03.810> a<00:07:04.080> bit<00:07:05.069> closer<00:07:05.310> to<00:07:05.460> what<00:07:05.550> we<00:07:05.639> have<00:07:05.789> in

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 
that's a bit closer to what we have in

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:07.070 
that's a bit closer to what we have in
music<00:07:06.090> I<00:07:06.150> mean<00:07:06.270> sometimes<00:07:06.419> we'll<00:07:06.810> have<00:07:06.840> in<00:07:07.020> a

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
music I mean sometimes we'll have in a

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.239 
music I mean sometimes we'll have in a
phrase<00:07:07.319> will<00:07:07.529> have<00:07:07.680> on<00:07:08.159> single<00:07:08.580> level<00:07:10.249> you

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:11.249 
phrase will have on single level you

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:18.019 
phrase will have on single level you
know<00:07:11.370> or<00:07:11.669> but<00:07:11.939> a<00:07:11.969> lot<00:07:12.120> of<00:07:12.150> times<00:07:16.520> so<00:07:17.520> I<00:07:17.789> hope<00:07:17.939> you

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:18.029
