suppose<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.500> want<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.799> compute<00:00:08.130> two<00:00:08.520> plus

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
suppose we want to compute two plus

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.930 
suppose we want to compute two plus
three<00:00:08.970> plus<00:00:09.240> five<00:00:09.920> we<00:00:10.920> know<00:00:11.100> how<00:00:11.310> to<00:00:11.430> add<00:00:11.610> two

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
three plus five we know how to add two

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.540 
three plus five we know how to add two
integers<00:00:12.360> at<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> time<00:00:13.050> but<00:00:13.770> here<00:00:14.250> there<00:00:14.430> are

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
integers at a time but here there are

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.290 
integers at a time but here there are
three<00:00:15.060> integers<00:00:15.680> what<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:17.030> do<00:00:18.030> we<00:00:18.150> add

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
three integers what do we do do we add

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.200 
three integers what do we do do we add
them<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:19.080> once<00:00:19.400> do<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.490> add<00:00:20.610> them<00:00:20.820> two<00:00:21.000> at<00:00:21.120> a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
them all at once do we add them two at a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.180 
them all at once do we add them two at a
time<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.690> so<00:00:22.680> which<00:00:23.310> two<00:00:23.610> do<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.820> start<00:00:24.030> with<00:00:24.180> if

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
time if so which two do we start with if

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.740 
time if so which two do we start with if
we<00:00:26.190> wanted<00:00:26.520> to<00:00:26.580> add<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.119> at<00:00:27.240> once

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
we wanted to add them all at once

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.810 
we wanted to add them all at once
we<00:00:28.080> could<00:00:28.260> make<00:00:28.410> three<00:00:28.740> piles<00:00:28.950> of<00:00:29.280> marbles

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
we could make three piles of marbles

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.569 
we could make three piles of marbles
representing<00:00:30.480> each<00:00:30.690> number<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.949> first<00:00:32.250> pile

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
representing each number the first pile

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.479 
representing each number the first pile
has<00:00:32.910> two<00:00:33.210> marbles<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.380> next<00:00:34.710> pile<00:00:34.920> has<00:00:35.160> three

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
has two marbles the next pile has three

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.060 
has two marbles the next pile has three
marbles<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.810> last<00:00:37.079> pile<00:00:37.410> has<00:00:37.710> five

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
marbles and the last pile has five

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580 
marbles and the last pile has five
marbles<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:39.570> add<00:00:39.720> these<00:00:39.960> three<00:00:40.260> numbers

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
marbles to add these three numbers

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
marbles to add these three numbers
together<00:00:40.790> just<00:00:41.790> combine<00:00:42.120> them<00:00:42.300> all<00:00:42.570> into<00:00:42.840> one

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
together just combine them all into one

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.280 
together just combine them all into one
pile<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> count<00:00:44.000> we<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:45.870> ten

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
pile and count we see there are ten

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.790 
pile and count we see there are ten
marbles<00:00:46.739> altogether<00:00:47.870> this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.290> way<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.500> do

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
marbles altogether this is one way to do

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.160 
marbles altogether this is one way to do
it<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.640> want<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.090> fast<00:00:51.450> at<00:00:51.750> addition

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it but we want to get fast at addition

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
it but we want to get fast at addition
we<00:00:52.920> don't<00:00:53.070> want<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> carry<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.670> bag<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> marbles

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
we don't want to carry a bag of marbles

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.110 
we don't want to carry a bag of marbles
with<00:00:54.750> us<00:00:54.870> everywhere<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.290> go<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.760> there<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.880> no

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
with us everywhere we go and there is no

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.090 
with us everywhere we go and there is no
way<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.540> can<00:00:57.690> memorize<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.290> sums<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.829> all

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
way we can memorize the sums of all

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.299 
way we can memorize the sums of all
possible<00:00:59.850> combinations<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.600> three<00:01:00.870> integers

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
possible combinations of three integers

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.849 
possible combinations of three integers
so<00:01:02.309> instead<00:01:02.700> we'll<00:01:03.420> compute<00:01:03.960> two<00:01:04.409> plus<00:01:04.829> three

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:04.859 
so instead we'll compute two plus three

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:07.870 
so instead we'll compute two plus three
plus<00:01:05.100> five<00:01:05.579> by<00:01:06.270> adding<00:01:06.689> them<00:01:06.869> two<00:01:07.289> at<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.499> time

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
plus five by adding them two at a time

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.179 
plus five by adding them two at a time
but<00:01:08.880> which<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.749> start<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:11.039> we

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
but which to do we start with do we

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.209 
but which to do we start with do we
first<00:01:11.490> add<00:01:11.759> two<00:01:12.119> plus<00:01:12.299> three<00:01:12.719> or<00:01:13.109> do<00:01:13.859> we<00:01:13.979> first

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
first add two plus three or do we first

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.029 
first add two plus three or do we first
add<00:01:14.459> three<00:01:14.700> plus<00:01:14.909> five<00:01:15.170> how<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.469> group<00:01:16.859> the

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
add three plus five how do we group the

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.440 
add three plus five how do we group the
integers<00:01:17.689> well<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:19.319> is<00:01:19.619> your<00:01:20.009> lucky<00:01:20.219> day

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
integers well this is your lucky day

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.029 
integers well this is your lucky day
because<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> associative<00:01:22.259> property<00:01:22.319> says

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
because the associative property says

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.830 
because the associative property says
that<00:01:23.069> it<00:01:23.369> does<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.700> matter<00:01:24.179> how<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.479> group

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
that it does not matter how you group

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 
that it does not matter how you group
the<00:01:24.990> integers<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.649> doesn't<00:01:26.429> matter<00:01:26.639> how

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the integers it doesn't matter how

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.839 
the integers it doesn't matter how
they're<00:01:27.179> associated<00:01:27.899> before<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.319> add<00:01:28.469> them

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:28.849 
they're associated before you add them

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:32.690 
they're associated before you add them
let's<00:01:29.849> see<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.209> in<00:01:30.389> action<00:01:31.069> first<00:01:32.069> let's<00:01:32.459> add

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
let's see this in action first let's add

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.839 
let's see this in action first let's add
two<00:01:33.240> plus<00:01:33.569> three<00:01:33.740> we<00:01:34.740> show<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.189> by<00:01:35.429> grouping

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:35.849 
two plus three we show this by grouping

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.120 
two plus three we show this by grouping
them<00:01:35.969> with<00:01:36.179> parentheses<00:01:36.810> two<00:01:37.799> plus<00:01:38.099> three

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
them with parentheses two plus three

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.419 
them with parentheses two plus three
equals<00:01:38.609> five<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.770> five<00:01:41.159> plus

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
equals five so now we have five plus

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.120 
equals five so now we have five plus
five<00:01:41.899> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.229> rid<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> parentheses

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
five you can get rid of the parentheses

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.919 
five you can get rid of the parentheses
if<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.639> just<00:01:44.819> a<00:01:44.939> single<00:01:45.329> number<00:01:45.450> inside

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
if there is just a single number inside

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.109 
if there is just a single number inside
next<00:01:46.919> five<00:01:47.880> plus<00:01:48.149> five<00:01:48.359> equals<00:01:48.689> ten<00:01:49.880> let's<00:01:50.880> do

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
next five plus five equals ten let's do

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
next five plus five equals ten let's do
this<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> second<00:01:51.869> time<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.349> this<00:01:52.829> time<00:01:52.889> we'll

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
this a second time and this time we'll

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.239 
this a second time and this time we'll
start<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:54.149> three<00:01:54.389> plus<00:01:54.630> five<00:01:55.249> again

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
start with three plus five again

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.010 
start with three plus five again
surround<00:01:56.849> them<00:01:57.029> with<00:01:57.060> parentheses<00:01:57.779> to<00:01:57.989> show

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
surround them with parentheses to show

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.739 
surround them with parentheses to show
we're<00:01:58.349> doing<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.859> addition<00:01:59.369> first<00:01:59.749> three

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
we're doing this addition first three

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.109 
we're doing this addition first three
plus<00:02:00.959> five<00:02:01.200> equals<00:02:01.469> eight<00:02:01.859> so<00:02:02.700> we're<00:02:02.909> left

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
plus five equals eight so we're left

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.719 
plus five equals eight so we're left
with<00:02:03.479> two<00:02:03.719> plus<00:02:04.020> eight<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.499> two<00:02:05.279> plus<00:02:05.520> eight

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
with two plus eight and two plus eight

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.620 
with two plus eight and two plus eight
equals<00:02:05.969> ten<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.739> same<00:02:07.979> answer

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
equals ten we get the same answer

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.080
