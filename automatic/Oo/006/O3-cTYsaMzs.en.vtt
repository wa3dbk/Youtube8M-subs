the top as you can see I've actually

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.650 
the top as you can see I've actually
used<00:02:11.799> two<00:02:12.160> colors<00:02:12.190> I've<00:02:12.760> done<00:02:12.940> orange<00:02:13.360> and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
used two colors I've done orange and

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690 
used two colors I've done orange and
I've<00:02:13.750> done<00:02:13.959> red<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.739> can<00:02:14.890> use<00:02:15.040> any<00:02:15.250> colors<00:02:15.670> you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700

I've done red you can use any colors you
like<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.239> fact<00:02:16.450> if<00:02:16.600> you're<00:02:16.750> making<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:17.110> large

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
like in fact if you're making a large

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.229 
like in fact if you're making a large
number<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.799> these<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> party<00:02:18.730> it's

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
number of these for a party it's

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.509 
number of these for a party it's
actually<00:02:19.690> quite<00:02:19.930> good<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.470> make<00:02:21.190> several

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
actually quite good to make several

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.890 
actually quite good to make several
colors<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.209> can<00:02:22.329> put<00:02:22.480> them<00:02:22.570> onto<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
colors and you can put them onto the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.870 
colors and you can put them onto the
tray<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.380> they<00:02:23.500> look<00:02:23.709> sort<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.489> rainbow

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
tray and they look sort of a rainbow

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.850 
tray and they look sort of a rainbow
effect<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.840> these<00:02:25.989> are<00:02:26.140> ready<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.410> go<00:02:26.500> into<00:02:26.709> the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
effect so these are ready to go into the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.040 
effect so these are ready to go into the
fridge<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.130> chill<00:02:27.660> minimum<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.780> four<00:02:29.020> hours

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
fridge to chill minimum of four hours

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.780 
fridge to chill minimum of four hours
probably<00:02:30.040> better<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.370> leave<00:02:30.520> them<00:02:30.640> in<00:02:30.760> for

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
probably better to leave them in for

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.840 
probably better to leave them in for
about<00:02:31.090> six<00:02:31.360> or<00:02:31.510> seven

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850
