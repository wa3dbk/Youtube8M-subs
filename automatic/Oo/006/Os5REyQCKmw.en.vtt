thought why not you know make another
squad<00:03:35.360> and<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:35.989> there<00:03:36.200> will<00:03:36.350> be<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:36.560> a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
squad and so there will be in a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.830 
squad and so there will be in a
different<00:03:36.709> scored<00:03:37.130> just<00:03:37.880> wait<00:03:38.000> for<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.330> so<00:03:38.630> a
