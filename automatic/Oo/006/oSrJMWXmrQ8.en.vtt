00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.340 
take one of my crystals and it should go
right<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.759> I'm<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.900> pull<00:01:28.229> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
right on to it and I'm going to pull it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
on and I'm going to take it to the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.210 
on and I'm going to take it to the
middle<00:01:31.820> there<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.350> looks<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.950> like

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
middle there we go so it looks just like

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.789 
middle there we go so it looks just like
that<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.049> make<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> ruffle<00:01:37.740> on

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that now I'm going to make a ruffle on

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.740 
that now I'm going to make a ruffle on
each<00:01:37.979> side<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.540> really

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
each side as you can see it's really

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.140 
each side as you can see it's really
easy<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.619> side<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.880> still

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
easy on the one side because it's still

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.690 
easy on the one side because it's still
flat<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.409> little<00:01:43.710> harder<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.460> side

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
flat it's a little harder on this side

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
flat it's a little harder on this side
because<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.479> has<00:01:46.290> been<00:01:47.220> squeezed<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.479> by<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
because it has been squeezed down by the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.260 
because it has been squeezed down by the
crystal<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> go<00:01:51.869> though<00:01:53.119> now<00:01:54.119> I'm

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
crystal so there you go though now I'm

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.260 
crystal so there you go though now I'm
going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.570> add<00:01:54.750> three<00:01:55.680> more<00:01:55.710> crystals<00:01:56.640> make

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
going to add three more crystals make

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.620 
going to add three more crystals make
that<00:01:57.509> back<00:01:57.750> into<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.759> three<00:01:59.759> more<00:01:59.969> crystals

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that back into that three more crystals

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.310 
that back into that three more crystals
and<00:02:01.130> each<00:02:02.130> time<00:02:02.549> I'm<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> add<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and each time I'm going to add it and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
and each time I'm going to add it and
then<00:02:05.570> pull<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.930> ruffle

so<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.410> another<00:02:10.680> ruffle<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.370> went

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
so that I have another ruffle I went

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.210 
so that I have another ruffle I went
ahead<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.300> added<00:02:12.450> three<00:02:12.930> crystals<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.100> you

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
ahead and added three crystals so as you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.520 
ahead and added three crystals so as you
can<00:02:14.340> see<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.820> four<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.180> them<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.630> there<00:02:15.870> now

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
can see I have four of them on there now

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.550 
can see I have four of them on there now
I'm<00:02:16.710> going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> take<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.430> other<00:02:17.610> end<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.210> do

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
I'm going to take the other end and do

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.990 
I'm going to take the other end and do
exactly<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.770> same<00:02:20.010> thing<00:02:20.340> I'm<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.940> to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
exactly the same thing I'm going to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.360 
exactly the same thing I'm going to
twist<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.840> until<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.380> becomes<00:02:22.710> like<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> needle

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
twist it until it becomes like a needle

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.120 
twist it until it becomes like a needle
and<00:02:23.520> then<00:02:24.210> start<00:02:24.840> putting<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:28.340> my<00:02:29.340> crystals

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
and then start putting on my crystals

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.620 
and then start putting on my crystals
this<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.310> how<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.580> looks<00:02:32.790> when<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.360> all

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
this is how it looks when I have all

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.590 
this is how it looks when I have all
seven<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.470> crystals<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
seven of the crystals on and all the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.860 
seven of the crystals on and all the
ruffles<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.140> middle<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.660> could<00:02:39.660> leave

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
ruffles in the middle so I could leave

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.380 
ruffles in the middle so I could leave
it<00:02:39.930> like<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.160> rope<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.030> liked<00:02:42.209> it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
it like this like a rope but I liked it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.050 
it like this like a rope but I liked it
better<00:02:42.570> when<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:43.680> straightened<00:02:44.130> out<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.760> I

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
better when it's straightened out so I

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.010 
better when it's straightened out so I
am<00:02:45.630> going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.640> pull<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.820> all<00:02:48.030> out<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.660> whole

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
am going to pull it all out the whole

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.880 
am going to pull it all out the whole
way<00:02:49.320> down<00:02:49.650> just<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.180> into<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:52.320> ruffle

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
way down just like this into a ruffle

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.030 
way down just like this into a ruffle
and<00:02:53.209> get<00:02:54.209> rid<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.630> Rope<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.140> Rope<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.709> made

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and get rid of the Rope the Rope is made

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.360 
and get rid of the Rope the Rope is made
when<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.030> put<00:02:57.570> on<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.260> crystals<00:02:58.800> because<00:02:59.220> it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
when you put on the crystals because it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.940 
when you put on the crystals because it
squeezes<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.209> down<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.260> want<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.590> get<00:03:01.709> back

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
squeezes it down but I want to get back

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.460 
squeezes it down but I want to get back
to<00:03:02.190> its<00:03:02.310> flattened<00:03:02.760> out<00:03:02.910> version<00:03:03.209> which<00:03:04.140> works

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
to its flattened out version which works

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.060 
to its flattened out version which works
pretty<00:03:04.739> well

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
pretty well

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.970 
pretty well
so<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:06.110> ruffle<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.170> out<00:03:07.290> like<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.890> then

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
so you ruffle it out like that and then

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.150 
so you ruffle it out like that and then
just<00:03:08.670> straighten<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:10.620> run

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
just straighten it and then I just run

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.370 
just straighten it and then I just run
my<00:03:11.190> fingers<00:03:11.910> along<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.810> can<00:03:12.989> see<00:03:13.200> I

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
my fingers along it and you can see I

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.280 
my fingers along it and you can see I
have<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:13.830> straightened<00:03:14.670> edge<00:03:14.940> as<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:16.110> see

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
have a straightened edge as you can see

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.080 
have a straightened edge as you can see
I've<00:03:16.500> straightened<00:03:16.830> both<00:03:17.130> sides<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:17.940> it's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
I've straightened both sides so it's

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.000 
I've straightened both sides so it's
back<00:03:18.269> out<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:19.140> one<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.500> great<00:03:19.709> things

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
back out that's one of the great things

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.160 
back out that's one of the great things
about<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.489> tying<00:03:20.790> mesh<00:03:21.090> ribbon<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.989> can

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
about the tying mesh ribbon you can

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.170 
about the tying mesh ribbon you can
rerun<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.040> straighten<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.459> over<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:23.970> over

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
rerun it and straighten it over and over

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.210 
rerun it and straighten it over and over
and<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.510> will<00:03:24.600> go<00:03:24.720> back<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.140> its<00:03:25.260> original<00:03:25.380> form

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and it will go back to its original form

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.190 
and it will go back to its original form
I<00:03:26.340> want<00:03:26.640> my<00:03:26.760> necklace<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.330> be<00:03:27.420> about<00:03:27.600> 18<00:03:28.019> inches

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
I want my necklace to be about 18 inches

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.430 
I want my necklace to be about 18 inches
so<00:03:29.040> I'm<00:03:29.400> going<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.640> cut<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.600> be<00:03:30.720> 17<00:03:31.290> inches

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
so I'm going to cut this to be 17 inches

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.500 
so I'm going to cut this to be 17 inches
because<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.130> additional<00:03:32.549> clasp<00:03:32.940> will<00:03:33.360> make

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
because the additional clasp will make

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.539 
because the additional clasp will make
the<00:03:33.690> extra<00:03:33.989> inch<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:34.950> I'm<00:03:35.010> going<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.220> put<00:03:35.400> my

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
the extra inch so I'm going to put my

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.910 
the extra inch so I'm going to put my
middle<00:03:35.959> crystal<00:03:36.959> at<00:03:37.170> about<00:03:37.410> eight<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.890> half

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
middle crystal at about eight and a half

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.000 
middle crystal at about eight and a half
inches<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.730> then<00:03:39.510> lay<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.780> out<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.500> then<00:03:40.799> that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
inches and then lay it out and then that

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.340 
inches and then lay it out and then that
way<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.190> determine<00:03:41.730> get<00:03:42.000> both<00:03:42.450> sides<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.200> be<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
way I determine get both sides to be the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.270 
way I determine get both sides to be the
same<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.130> then<00:03:44.790> I'm<00:03:44.910> going<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.120> flip<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.930> over

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
same and then I'm going to flip it over

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.310 
same and then I'm going to flip it over
and<00:03:47.280> do<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.459> same<00:03:47.580> thing<00:03:48.060> my<00:03:48.299> middle<00:03:48.750> crystal

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
and do the same thing my middle crystal

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.570 
and do the same thing my middle crystal
at<00:03:50.130> eight<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.670> half<00:03:50.700> inches<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:53.130> I'm

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
at eight and a half inches and then I'm

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.330 
at eight and a half inches and then I'm
going<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:53.940> flip<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.959> off<00:03:55.110> now<00:03:55.860> I'm<00:03:56.040> ready<00:03:56.250> to

coat my ends in glue so I'm going to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.830 
coat my ends in glue so I'm going to
slip<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:01.340> piece<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.489> card<00:04:02.730> stock<00:04:02.790> underneath<00:04:03.090> to

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.680 
work on and there's both of my ends I
use<00:04:07.920> e6000<00:04:08.820> glue<00:04:08.930> it's<00:04:09.930> my<00:04:10.200> favorite<00:04:10.650> glue<00:04:11.690> but

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
use e6000 glue it's my favorite glue but

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.289 
use e6000 glue it's my favorite glue but
it's<00:04:12.810> especially<00:04:13.140> wonderful<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.370> this

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
it's especially wonderful in this

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.599 
it's especially wonderful in this
because<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:15.930> makes<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.260> hardened<00:04:16.739> surface<00:04:17.100> and

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
because it makes a hardened surface and

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.140 
because it makes a hardened surface and
a<00:04:17.669> hardened

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
a hardened

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.830 
a hardened
edge<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.530> ribbon<00:04:20.519> ends<00:04:20.729> can<00:04:21.120> bite<00:04:21.570> into

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
edge that the ribbon ends can bite into

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.629 
edge that the ribbon ends can bite into
so<00:04:22.500> there<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.160> go

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
so there you go

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.689 
so there you go
put<00:04:24.240> some<00:04:24.419> on<00:04:24.600> stick<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.350> my<00:04:25.470> cardstock<00:04:25.860> put

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
put some on stick it to my cardstock put

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.700 
put some on stick it to my cardstock put
a<00:04:26.729> little<00:04:27.000> bit<00:04:27.120> more<00:04:27.330> on<00:04:27.479> stick<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.590> my

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
a little bit more on stick it to my

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.650 
a little bit more on stick it to my
cardstock<00:04:29.040> I<00:04:29.430> try<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.669> go<00:04:29.850> about<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.150> quarter<00:04:30.510> of

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
cardstock I try to go about a quarter of

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.360 
cardstock I try to go about a quarter of
an<00:04:30.930> inch<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.199> can<00:04:31.229> go<00:04:31.410> ahead<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.860> just<00:04:32.040> wipe

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
an inch you can go ahead and just wipe

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.909 
an inch you can go ahead and just wipe
your<00:04:32.400> fingers<00:04:33.120> on<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.449> cardstock<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:34.740> that

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
your fingers on the cardstock so that

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.460 
your fingers on the cardstock so that
helps<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.970> then<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.540> pull<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.930> off<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.110> a

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
helps to and then I pull it off just a

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.830 
helps to and then I pull it off just a
little<00:04:37.710> bit<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.040> let<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.460> dry<00:04:38.790> for<00:04:39.060> me<00:04:39.540> the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
little bit and let it dry for me the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.290 
little bit and let it dry for me the
emitters<00:04:40.530> at<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:40.979> point<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.610> get<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:41.940> little

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
emitters at that point I get a little

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.200 
emitters at that point I get a little
more<00:04:42.540> glue<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:44.130> do<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.460> all<00:04:44.639> over<00:04:44.669> again

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
more glue and I do it all over again

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.500 
more glue and I do it all over again
because<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.780> want<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.080> thicken<00:04:46.440> up<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.889> end

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
because I want to thicken up that end

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.680 
because I want to thicken up that end
and<00:04:48.510> there's<00:04:49.169> that<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.880> why<00:04:51.090> I'm<00:04:51.240> doing<00:04:51.539> that

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
and there's that and why I'm doing that

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.779 
and there's that and why I'm doing that
is<00:04:51.840> that<00:04:52.080> there<00:04:52.440> are<00:04:52.590> teeth<00:04:52.860> inside<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.639> the

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
is that there are teeth inside of the

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.060 
is that there are teeth inside of the
ribbon<00:04:54.030> end<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.870> see<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.530> so<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.710> want

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
ribbon end you see that and so I want

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.100 
ribbon end you see that and so I want
the<00:04:56.490> teeth<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:57.060> bite<00:04:57.210> into<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.720> hardened

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
the teeth to bite into the hardened

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.469 
the teeth to bite into the hardened
glued<00:04:58.380> surface<00:04:58.789> rather<00:04:59.789> than<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.300> delicate

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
glued surface rather than the delicate

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.080 
glued surface rather than the delicate
mesh<00:05:01.020> which<00:05:01.350> it<00:05:01.500> could<00:05:01.710> not<00:05:01.949> last<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:03.030> now

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
mesh which it could not last and now

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.120 
mesh which it could not last and now
that<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.330> glue<00:05:03.510> is<00:05:03.539> dried<00:05:03.930> I'm<00:05:04.169> going<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.830> trim

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
that the glue is dried I'm going to trim

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.800 
that the glue is dried I'm going to trim
off<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.460> ends<00:05:05.789> of<00:05:05.880> my<00:05:06.000> ribbon<00:05:06.360> if<00:05:06.479> they<00:05:06.630> need

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
off the ends of my ribbon if they need

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.350 
off the ends of my ribbon if they need
it<00:05:06.960> these<00:05:07.169> actually<00:05:07.590> look<00:05:07.740> really<00:05:07.770> good<00:05:08.250> but<00:05:09.090> I

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
it these actually look really good but I

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.330 
it these actually look really good but I
would<00:05:09.690> trim<00:05:09.930> them<00:05:10.080> off<00:05:10.199> just<00:05:10.650> so<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:11.100> they

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
would trim them off just so that they

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.990 
would trim them off just so that they
fit<00:05:11.699> flush<00:05:12.210> into<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:13.080> ribbon<00:05:13.380> ends<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:14.000> then

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
fit flush into the ribbon ends and then

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.510 
fit flush into the ribbon ends and then
I'm<00:05:15.150> going<00:05:15.449> to<00:05:15.570> put<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.139> ribbon<00:05:16.320> in<00:05:16.560> in<00:05:17.070> like

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
I'm going to put the ribbon in in like

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.570 
I'm going to put the ribbon in in like
that<00:05:17.880> and<00:05:18.330> with<00:05:19.110> my<00:05:19.289> chain<00:05:19.530> nose<00:05:19.560> plier<00:05:20.430> I'm

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
that and with my chain nose plier I'm

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.339 
that and with my chain nose plier I'm
going<00:05:20.729> to<00:05:20.789> come<00:05:20.940> over<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.389> top<00:05:21.419> and<00:05:22.020> gently

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
going to come over the top and gently

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.219 
going to come over the top and gently
squeeze<00:05:22.770> it<00:05:23.039> and<00:05:23.220> then<00:05:24.150> same<00:05:24.450> thing<00:05:24.479> from<00:05:24.990> both

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
squeeze it and then same thing from both

squeeze it and then same thing from both
sides<00:05:26.180> I've<00:05:27.180> already<00:05:27.539> added<00:05:27.889> the<00:05:29.270> lobster<00:05:30.270> but

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
sides I've already added the lobster but

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.520 
sides I've already added the lobster but
you<00:05:31.680> can<00:05:32.039> use<00:05:32.310> a<00:05:32.340> lobster<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.539> toggle<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.440> s

clasp whatever you'd like if your ribbon
ends<00:05:37.139> weren't<00:05:37.590> quite<00:05:38.010> opened<00:05:38.460> enough<00:05:38.700> you<00:05:38.970> can

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
ends weren't quite opened enough you can

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.760 
ends weren't quite opened enough you can
also<00:05:39.330> hold<00:05:39.930> on<00:05:40.430> with<00:05:41.430> two<00:05:42.000> different<00:05:42.770> chain

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
also hold on with two different chain

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.909 
also hold on with two different chain
nose<00:05:44.010> pliers<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:45.289> open<00:05:46.289> them<00:05:46.410> up<00:05:46.470> just<00:05:46.800> a

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
nose pliers and open them up just a

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.820 
nose pliers and open them up just a
little<00:05:46.949> bit<00:05:47.190> like<00:05:48.120> that

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
little bit like that

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.200 
little bit like that
they<00:05:49.830> were<00:05:49.889> probably<00:05:50.190> okay<00:05:50.580> in<00:05:50.669> this<00:05:50.789> instance

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
they were probably okay in this instance

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.730 
they were probably okay in this instance
but<00:05:51.389> if<00:05:51.539> not<00:05:51.750> that's<00:05:52.080> what<00:05:52.260> you<00:05:52.349> do

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
but if not that's what you do

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.279

and<00:05:52.830> then<00:05:53.760> you<00:05:53.910> want<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.150> put<00:05:54.360> this<00:05:54.510> in<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.080> get

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
and then you want to put this in and get

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.430 
and then you want to put this in and get
it<00:05:55.410> all<00:05:55.530> squared<00:05:55.740> up<00:05:56.010> again<00:05:56.370> on<00:05:56.610> this<00:05:56.940> side

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
it all squared up again on this side

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.110 
it all squared up again on this side
same<00:05:58.440> thing<00:05:58.770> I<00:05:58.919> come<00:05:59.099> over<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.490> top<00:05:59.520> really

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
same thing I come over the top really

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.870 
same thing I come over the top really
gently<00:06:00.479> push<00:06:00.840> it<00:06:01.080> down<00:06:01.349> and<00:06:01.650> come<00:06:02.460> around<00:06:02.580> to

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
gently push it down and come around to

röszke eight millimeter crystals will

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.740 
röszke eight millimeter crystals will
work<00:06:28.680> just<00:06:28.710> fine<00:06:29.180> but<00:06:30.180> if<00:06:30.300> you<00:06:30.419> were<00:06:30.510> to<00:06:30.630> add

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
work just fine but if you were to add

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.279 
work just fine but if you were to add
more

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
more

more
or<00:06:31.349> crystals<00:06:32.009> or<00:06:32.240> seven<00:06:33.240> heavier<00:06:33.629> beads<00:06:33.990> it

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
or crystals or seven heavier beads it

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.170 
or crystals or seven heavier beads it
wouldn't<00:06:34.949> hold<00:06:35.099> its<00:06:35.309> shape<00:06:35.550> and<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:36.029> would

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
wouldn't hold its shape and it would

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.719 
wouldn't hold its shape and it would
unruffle<00:06:36.869> it<00:06:37.529> would<00:06:37.649> just<00:06:37.889> pull<00:06:38.189> out<00:06:38.430> like

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
unruffle it would just pull out like

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.730 
unruffle it would just pull out like
that<00:06:39.349> okay<00:06:40.639> also<00:06:41.639> you<00:06:42.479> can't<00:06:42.749> add<00:06:42.990> a<00:06:43.020> pendant

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
that okay also you can't add a pendant

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.409 
that okay also you can't add a pendant
like<00:06:43.919> this<00:06:44.279> because<00:06:44.819> the<00:06:44.969> weight<00:06:45.149> of<00:06:45.300> the

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
like this because the weight of the

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.959 
like this because the weight of the
pendant<00:06:45.839> would<00:06:46.349> pull<00:06:46.619> it<00:06:46.770> down<00:06:47.039> and<00:06:47.460> it<00:06:47.819> would

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969 
pendant would pull it down and it would

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.629 
pendant would pull it down and it would
straighten<00:06:48.360> out<00:06:48.659> if<00:06:49.050> you<00:06:49.919> did<00:06:50.159> want<00:06:50.399> to<00:06:50.490> add<00:06:50.610> a

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
straighten out if you did want to add a

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.639 
straighten out if you did want to add a
pendant<00:06:51.149> you<00:06:51.659> would<00:06:51.779> have<00:06:51.990> to<00:06:52.199> add<00:06:52.319> another

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:52.649 
pendant you would have to add another

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:55.159 
pendant you would have to add another
straight<00:06:53.309> piece<00:06:53.699> that<00:06:54.389> held<00:06:54.689> the<00:06:54.869> weight<00:06:55.020> of

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
straight piece that held the weight of

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.739 
straight piece that held the weight of
the<00:06:55.259> pendant<00:06:55.740> but<00:06:56.669> it<00:06:56.819> can't<00:06:57.089> be<00:06:57.270> done<00:06:57.449> just

00:06:57.739 --> 00:06:57.749
