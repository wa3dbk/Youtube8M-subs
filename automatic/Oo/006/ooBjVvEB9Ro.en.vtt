00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
braids on each end going down

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.200

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
to protect my edges and then small

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.710 
to protect my edges and then small
braids<00:00:15.809> going<00:00:16.139> halfway<00:00:17.099> up<00:00:17.790> to<00:00:17.849> my<00:00:18.090> crown<00:00:18.360> I

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
braids going halfway up to my crown I

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.779 
braids going halfway up to my crown I
have<00:00:19.290> that<00:00:19.410> race<00:00:19.560> connected<00:00:20.040> going<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.520> way

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
have that race connected going this way

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.060 
have that race connected going this way
and<00:00:21.180> then<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> did<00:00:21.690> another<00:00:21.720> room<00:00:22.260> going<00:00:22.740> this

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and then I did another room going this

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.279 
and then I did another room going this
way<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:23.369> well<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.000> bridge<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:24.900> fall

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
way as well so the bridge to just fall

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.150 
way as well so the bridge to just fall
over<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> back<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.949> braids

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
over and then in the back the braids

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.519 
over and then in the back the braids
start<00:00:29.580> straight<00:00:29.850> down<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.470> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.949 

well<00:02:59.519> yeah<00:02:59.670> I<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.629> it<00:03:00.659> so<00:03:01.079> far<00:03:01.560> um<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.780> hair

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
well yeah I like it so far um the hair

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.050 
well yeah I like it so far um the hair
was<00:03:04.319> really<00:03:04.530> silky<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.519> think<00:03:05.760> that's<00:03:05.909> my

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
was really silky and I think that's my

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.690 
was really silky and I think that's my
only<00:03:06.329> issue<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:07.409> that<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.709> was<00:03:07.920> pretty<00:03:08.159> silky

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
only issue is that it was pretty silky

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.750 
only issue is that it was pretty silky
Sal's<00:03:08.939> worried<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.659> it<00:03:10.019> might<00:03:10.349> slip<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:10.920> so

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
Sal's worried that it might slip out so

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.410 
Sal's worried that it might slip out so
I<00:03:11.790> mean<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.629> lot<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.900> them<00:03:13.200> very<00:03:13.409> well<00:03:13.920> about<00:03:14.790> two

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
I mean a lot of them very well about two
