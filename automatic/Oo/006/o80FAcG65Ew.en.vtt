00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.940
 the center that comes up the ball 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.800
 patita track 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.220
 with the 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.220
 the 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.919
 i 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:36.000
 because I believe in you we are going to return a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 because I believe in you, come on, let's go, but 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.159
 justito I believe in you let's go let's see 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.159
 because I believe in you 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:01:00.290
 because I do not think that 10 is not enough to 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.780
 keep dreaming and see what is coming 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.100
 later I do not think they are very 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.380
 motivated by the result they have 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.050
 got the ecuador front we have seen 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.780
 a team that has fought has fought and 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.190
 is very integrated god want the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.200
 things go well in there 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.479
 colombia.y and can also get 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.759
 results that allow for this to continue 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.960
 with the illusion of the global outside that 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.789
 I know it 's a good match 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.369
 complicated it was shown that we have to 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.100
 playing in Barranquilla is a game 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.899
 very complicated rival but good but 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.030
 I hope that can be a good result 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:36.220
 you have to keep fighting is the last thing 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.770
 you lose are the hopes in the step 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.330
 important last Friday despite 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.800
 that there are the results that 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.259
 we wanted not to be given not in some 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.030
 cases but good to keep fighting is 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.470
 The last thing that is lost are the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.270
 hopes 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.580
 I hope God wants everyone can go 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.620
 well to them and that the slogan of going to 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.450
 get a positive result follow follow 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.960
 I'm not Peruvian, I'm always going to be 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.990
 optimistic 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.880
 it is a separate point from the theme of faith 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.260
 as a Peruvian I will always want what 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.930
 better for my country are we 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.090
 representing and good we come 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.390
 best wishes the greatest blessings 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.569
 for the party that do not accept me anything 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.150
 easy but with what we live 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.660
 against ecuador I think the elections 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.290
 they have the ability then calm before 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.290
 from the Colombian
