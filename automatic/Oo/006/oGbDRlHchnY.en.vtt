00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.150
 hello that as I always hope you 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.860
 find the best and you know that I am 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.330
 here the manager to remove all and in 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.590
 this time we are going to review another 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.119
 elephant song called 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.800
 lying as I have seen at the beginning 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.810
 video we're going to miss the intro and for 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.310
 course the chords the rhythm and how 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.329
 sing and play this song starting 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.710
 with the intro we have to do 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.730
 first the next movement 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.730
 four times 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 first of all we have to place the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.280
 ring finger in the fourth fret of the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 sixth string and the index finger on the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.720
 second fret of the fifth string and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.520
 let's add the finger on the 4th fret 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.750
 of the fifth string to be able to do 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.320
 all this movement first 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.180
 we have to do this let's make a 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.699
 once in the fourth fret of the fifth 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.620
 rope and we'll let sound a little 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.129
 note and then we're going to do 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.770
 of not going to do fourth after sixth 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.790
 and again fifth but removing the finger 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.790
 pinkie so it would be 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.250
 and the next thing we're going to do is this 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.040
 let's do three times in the room 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.940
 fret of the fifth string and after 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.630
 let's do 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.560
 sixth and again fifth but removing the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.120
 little finger so it would be and hitting the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.300
 first and the second part should sound 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.300
 A) Yes 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.740
 and we will repeat that movement 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.740
 four times in total 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.510
 d 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.110
 to do this little solo that is done 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.640
 just before singing and the first thing that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.789
 we have to do for this little single 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.789
 is 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.899
 let's make fourth the 5th fret 2nd of 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.659
 the fourth 4th of the fourth and then 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:12.160
 let's play again to make a 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.610
 hammer on so it would be and once here 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.610
 let's do 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.000
 and that fourth of the fourth 2nd the fourth 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.030
 fourth of the fifth after second of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.400
 the fifth and already to finish a second of 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.930
 the fourth and fourth of the fifth 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.410
 so that bit would be all 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.410
 together they would be 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.990
 that already we fulfilled with the introduction 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.700
 but 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.050
 when we finish on the last note of the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.000
 introduction is when we start to 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.170
 sing first let's review 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.930
 what are the chords that we are going to 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.990
 use specifically we will use do 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.980
 sustained minor without major 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.950
 the biggest 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.049
 and sun sustained with seventh to touch 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.760
 the first verse and in terms of rhythm 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.470
 it's about one that we've already reviewed for 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.330
 other elephant songs only 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.890
 that you have to speed it up a bit by placing 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.330
 a sustained C minor and the rhythm should 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.349
 sound like this is the classic rhythm of 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.140
 radio down quiet two 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.849
 moves up another click and 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.590
 then a move up 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.150
 only that as I say you have to 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.680
 speed it up a bit because the pace 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.049
 who has this song is a little more 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.370
 accelerated so once we finish 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.370
 with the last phrase of the intro 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.340
 101 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.230
 how 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.680
 like other elephant actions the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.959
 pretty basic structure let's touch 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.150
 twice the radio by agreement and in order 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.200
 let's touch first held world 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.350
 minor after without major after the greatest 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.780
 and finally a sun sustained with 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.410
 seventh to play again the same 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.410
 progression 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.199
 and with this we already have the first one covered 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.689
 verse now comes the second verse for 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.070
 this in order we are going to use a yes 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.460
 higher 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.390
 a C sharp minor 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.640
 in the greatest 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.440
 and an older my that is the new one I agreed that 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.390
 we are introducing and just before 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.170
 finish the first verse should sound 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.170
 as well as 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.629
 but no 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.870
 Yes Yes 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.509
 single 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.759
 so that follow 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.759
 t 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.530
 this 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.060
 again here we are only 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.400
 repeating the radio twice by accord 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.380
 and we are going to repeat in a circle 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.510
 say it if do sharp minor 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.830
 and then my and again we're going to go back to 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.390
 do it and already with this simple 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.370
 progression we already have covered the 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.430
 second verse and now it comes of course 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.930
 the choir ending with the last part 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.930
 of the second verse would be 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
 treason 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.810
 i 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.810
 i 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.879
 how could you see the progression of 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:28.700
 chords is the same as the second verse 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:31.040
 do sharp minor the and again 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.570
 as you can see there is no trick just 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.340
 you have to repeat the radio twice 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.850
 I agreed if in the part that says 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.850
 enough is enough 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.750
 is what this story says that is 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:49.400
 start first what we are going to do is 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:52.090
 place a sun held seventh and do 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.340
 down up down 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.340
 an off and this story 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.090
 and then we started with the new radio that 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.780
 we're just going to do the sharps 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.550
 minor and major and once we dominate 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.620
 until the chorus of this song we have 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.389
 practically the whole song due to 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.520
 like many other songs 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:16.070
 structure is always the same since the 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.960
 progression and the melody of the first verse 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.610
 is going to repeat itself as well as the 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.770
 second verse and do not say the chorus that 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.940
 it's always the same remember that for 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.280
 almost all popular songs 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.720
 always the same melody of 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.190
 all forms on the official facebook of 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.470
 guitar tüttös that I leave here below in 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.030
 the description of the video I will put a 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.650
 word document in which I'm going to 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.570
 accommodate the lyrics and chords that 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.130
 carries throughout the song to 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.570
 that in this way you are easy to touch 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.460
 the whole song if you have 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.740
 problems in relation to progressions 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.150
 of chords I really hope that this 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.860
 you tutorial has been quite helpful 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.479
 remember that for any doubt 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.639
