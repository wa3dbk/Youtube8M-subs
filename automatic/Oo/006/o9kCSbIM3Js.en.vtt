 no disturbing control elements 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.610
 You can drag controls into the picture by holding them at the top or bottom 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.260

 Germany always keep strong train and it is back in 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.380
 Home screen

 Surely you have to manage the weather app which is very graphically elaborate 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.420
 Forcing our bidders to dive them will soon be here as a place 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.270
 Munich set 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.160
 they see the band in the animation in the background 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.770
 the little bit like the Tegernsee 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.100

 was in the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490
 9-18 Sion 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.400
 degraded to one 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.860
 by umpteen classical view Meadow from Windows 7 can 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.460
 the new Explorer is included 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.620

 the menu know the hot dog newer big versions 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.270
 I can not care for the love of suffering 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.509
 not to switch between riders that music actually everything 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.460
 type in manually 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.090
 still exists the control panel but hides 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.499
 behind the App Control Bremer 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.209
 if you are in the control panel 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.519
 Incidentally, where percentages can personalize the entire user experience

 Scroll all the way down 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.259
 get to the point must settings 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.279
 and 4 then the dot brings them directly to the Control Panel 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.989
 still briefly to the control 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.279
 this is basically standardized in a network 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.459
 this gives the wiper to the right edge which opens it up 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.959
 former start menu 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.780

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.859
 context menu 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.859
 and when they jump along the turn signal country they jump from Dr 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.179
 our conclusion after half a day with Windows 8 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.069
 it has been clearly programmed is programmed controls it on the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.479
 Katla looked much better too, NPCs feel pretty good 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.939
 relatively intuitive, of course, you have to work briefly 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.439
 and then get used to the controller 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.890
 made out of that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.840
 which is actually pretty good
