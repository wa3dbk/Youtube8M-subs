00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.420 
something on top that's even warmer but

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
it will kind of shield me from the Sun a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
it will kind of shield me from the Sun a
little<00:01:29.700> bit<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.270> it'll<00:01:30.570> look<00:01:30.689> good<00:01:30.840> over<00:01:31.049> like

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
little bit and it'll look good over like

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
little bit and it'll look good over like
I<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.439> fit<00:01:31.680> without<00:01:32.009> being<00:01:32.220> too<00:01:32.340> hot<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I don't fit without being too hot so I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.630

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
looks at the shorts but this is like a

cream-colored off-white crocheted top

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.730 
cream-colored off-white crocheted top
and<00:04:52.039> it's<00:04:52.460> super<00:04:52.940> light<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.380> know<00:04:54.530> it's

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
and it's super light and you know it's

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.080

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
that would be really comfortable and

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.540 
that would be really comfortable and
look<00:06:38.289> at<00:06:38.410> with<00:06:38.500> a<00:06:38.530> lot<00:06:38.710> of<00:06:38.740> stuff<00:06:38.919> all<00:06:39.190> this<00:06:39.400> on

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
look at with a lot of stuff all this on

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.130 
look at with a lot of stuff all this on
my<00:06:39.669> way<00:06:39.820> to<00:06:39.880> check<00:06:40.150> out<00:06:40.360> it<00:06:40.510> was<00:06:40.600> only<00:06:40.690> 5<00:06:40.930> bucks

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
my way to check out it was only 5 bucks

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.380 
my way to check out it was only 5 bucks
so<00:06:41.260> I<00:06:41.289> was<00:06:41.380> like<00:06:41.470> oh<00:06:41.590> might<00:06:42.010> as<00:06:42.070> well<00:06:42.250> it's<00:06:43.180> just

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390 
so I was like oh might as well it's just

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.070 
so I was like oh might as well it's just
like<00:06:43.539> this<00:06:43.690> cool<00:06:44.160> dark<00:06:45.160> but<00:06:45.669> with<00:06:46.030> neon<00:06:46.570> it

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
like this cool dark but with neon it

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.300 
like this cool dark but with neon it
kind<00:06:47.320> of<00:06:47.350> looks<00:06:47.500> like<00:06:47.590> paint<00:06:47.800> splatter<00:06:48.100> so<00:06:48.250> I

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
kind of looks like paint splatter so I

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.370 
kind of looks like paint splatter so I
thought<00:06:48.460> it<00:06:48.520> was<00:06:48.580> coral<00:06:48.940> first<00:06:49.180> but<00:06:49.930> it's<00:06:50.169> just

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
thought it was coral first but it's just

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.890 
thought it was coral first but it's just
like<00:06:50.500> a<00:06:50.530> loose<00:06:50.979> crop<00:06:51.430> Java<00:06:51.669> so<00:06:52.000> this<00:06:52.660> would<00:06:52.810> be

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
like a loose crop Java so this would be

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.960 
like a loose crop Java so this would be
really<00:06:53.110> cute<00:06:53.440> -<00:06:53.620> I'm<00:06:53.950> not<00:06:54.430> sure<00:06:54.580> if<00:06:54.669> I'm<00:06:54.789> gonna
