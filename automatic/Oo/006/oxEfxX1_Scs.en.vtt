00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.820 
be might be too big for a 23 year old
kid<00:02:01.770> who<00:02:01.890> has<00:02:01.980> never<00:02:02.130> been<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.760> this<00:02:03.240> size

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
kid who has never been on one this size

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.200 
kid who has never been on one this size
what<00:02:04.830> would<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.370> see<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.180> I

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
what would you have to see you know I

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.520 
what would you have to see you know I
think<00:02:06.690> it's<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.080> different<00:02:07.350> from

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
think it's a little different from

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.499 
think it's a little different from
fighting<00:02:07.800> on<00:02:07.950> up<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.700> Floyd<00:02:09.060> Mayweather<00:02:09.450> is

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
fighting on up on Floyd Mayweather is

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.600 
fighting on up on Floyd Mayweather is
undercard<00:02:10.020> fight<00:02:10.860> including<00:02:11.040> they<00:02:11.400> want

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
undercard fight including they want

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.700 
undercard fight including they want
itself<00:02:11.910> if<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.960> think<00:02:13.020> it's<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.410> lot<00:02:13.620> of

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
itself if so I think it's a lot of

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.070 
itself if so I think it's a lot of
pressure<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.340> sometimes<00:02:14.880> what<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.720> pressuring

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
pressure in sometimes what is pressuring

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.400 
pressure in sometimes what is pressuring
a<00:02:16.710> guide<00:02:17.490> price<00:02:17.670> better<00:02:18.080> community<00:02:19.080> competes

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
a guide price better community competes

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.830 
a guide price better community competes
better<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.850> already<00:02:21.180> know<00:02:21.330> we're<00:02:21.630> good

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
better so we already know we're good

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.390 
better so we already know we're good
together<00:02:22.020> we<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:23.070> how<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.190> fight

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
plays out but um hopefully on the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.990
