other royal movements no news but I

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.889 
other royal movements no news but I

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
think we can gather at least two things

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.389 
think we can gather at least two things
for<00:02:07.380> sure<00:02:07.439> why

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
for sure why

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.399 
for sure why
there<00:02:08.610> was<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> huge<00:02:09.209> police<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.959> Special

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
there was a huge police and Special

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.039 
there was a huge police and Special
Branch<00:02:10.700> presence<00:02:11.700> earlier<00:02:12.150> today<00:02:12.450> when<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
Branch presence earlier today when the

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.470 
Branch presence earlier today when the
royal<00:02:13.260> family<00:02:13.709> went<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> church<00:02:14.370> there<00:02:15.120> are<00:02:15.239> no

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
royal family went to church there are no

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.750 
royal family went to church there are no
police<00:02:15.870> or<00:02:16.140> virtually<00:02:16.739> none<00:02:16.980> around<00:02:17.220> at<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
police or virtually none around at the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.229 
police or virtually none around at the
moment

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
moment

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.690 
moment
therefore<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.810> think<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.260> departure<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.430> not

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
therefore I think a departure is not

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.420 
therefore I think a departure is not
imminent<00:02:21.409> secondly<00:02:22.409> I'm<00:02:22.650> sure<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.250> will

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
imminent secondly I'm sure what will

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.229 
imminent secondly I'm sure what will
decide<00:02:23.909> how<00:02:24.689> they<00:02:24.930> move<00:02:25.170> when<00:02:25.470> they<00:02:25.709> move<00:02:25.950> is

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
decide how they move when they move is

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.899 
decide how they move when they move is
the<00:02:27.239> benefit<00:02:27.810> what<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.530> needs<00:02:28.829> of<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.730> two

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
the benefit what the needs of the two

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.390 
the benefit what the needs of the two
young<00:02:30.150> princes<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.989> one<00:02:31.590> rumor<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
young princes and one rumor and that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.339 
young princes and one rumor and that
seems<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.879> me<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.120> make<00:02:33.329> a<00:02:33.390> kind<00:02:33.689> of<00:02:33.840> sense<00:02:34.079> is

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
seems to me to make a kind of sense is

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.309 
seems to me to make a kind of sense is

think it's safe to assume that they're
all<00:03:15.090> be<00:03:15.239> thinking<00:03:15.599> that<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:17.250> last

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
thing this morning that perhaps is

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.059
