00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.790
 when I came back I fell down 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.740
 at the moment when was beginning to talk about 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.299
 Minecraft 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.939
 so who is what they did for 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.540
 minecraft a crazy thing but something 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.020
 crazy 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.180
 for those who know paulo lenze if 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.350

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.479
 tell you I will put you the presle 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.400
 to video that is that they showed in 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.439
 live but I was amazed I was in 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.220
 to enjoy when I saw that it will be 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.869
 for xbox standards to what I understood 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.750
 minecraft nilly and what it is 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.640
 lot INSEE is a kind of google 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.890
 ice that 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.010
 microsoft is going out it's kind 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.430
 3d glasses and wherever you can 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.369
 to see things that we can not 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.830
 see kind we can put some kind of 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.140
 TV on a wall when it does not exist 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.060
 not something like that but the thing is 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.340
 that it's not even like google places 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.260
 I'll leave you I'll put you in three 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.930
 also in the description the coach 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.459
 of holden help because it's worth the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.209
 worth to go to see it's really better 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.530
 that google class it's really 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.970
 it's really high-end 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.450
 that they have they are doing 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.090
 so suddenly there they have they have 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.769
 combined minecraft and all all ends and that 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.580
 gives a size trick but it's a 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.570
 crazy thing 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.590
 for those who have xbox that will 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.390
 buy and want to buy hollande 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.000
 I'm jealous I did not say I did not 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.560
 the xbox and everything and that's what but I 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.730
 believe that it will be only for 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.260
 xbox and maybe p4c we never know 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.380
 but in any case for pc it will not be 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.400
 will not be possible pc we need the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.739
 keyboard all that's not it like that so 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.480
 I put you the video is told in the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.459
 comments what you thought 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.780
 in any case I could not miss it 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.269
 of that and I know there are plenty of them 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.510
 who do not know who did not see the 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:24.620
 In any case, conferences are all 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:49.870
 so here's what to go in front of all the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:53.290
 world this Africa what is admitted 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.290
 like that 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:41.130
 I hope that my technique it 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:06:18.060
 6 million 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.640
 Wilders 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:07:16.980
 sewing that will settle here this morning here 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.980
 in my hand wise as
