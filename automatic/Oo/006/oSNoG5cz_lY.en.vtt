know<00:02:32.159> nothing<00:02:32.310> i<00:02:32.579> guess<00:02:32.790> there's<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.659> back

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.030 
know nothing i guess there's the back
and<00:02:34.670> all<00:02:35.670> sides<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.269> have<00:02:36.480> button<00:02:36.989> but<00:02:37.230> yeah
