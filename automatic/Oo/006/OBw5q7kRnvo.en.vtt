Berry's in The Neptunes um when it was
at<00:03:33.000> its<00:03:33.150> peak<00:03:33.240> I<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.990> remember<00:03:34.230> being<00:03:34.560> like

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
at its peak I can remember being like

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.140 
at its peak I can remember being like
this<00:03:34.980> but<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.250> hasn't<00:03:35.520> been<00:03:35.580> like<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.880> for<00:03:36.120> a

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
this but it hasn't been like that for a

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.300
