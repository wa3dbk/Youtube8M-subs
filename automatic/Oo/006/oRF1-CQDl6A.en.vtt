00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
hi I've been not doing digitizing for

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.450 
hi I've been not doing digitizing for
many<00:00:14.070> years<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.599> just<00:00:15.690> upgraded<00:00:16.440> from<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
many years and I just upgraded from a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.349 
many years and I just upgraded from a
competitor<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.949> digital<00:00:19.949> printer<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.880> I'm

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
competitor on digital printer so I'm

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.230 
competitor on digital printer so I'm
here<00:00:21.689> with<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.170> Maya<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.830> I'm<00:00:23.640> showing<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.119> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
here with the Maya and I'm showing you a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.759 
here with the Maya and I'm showing you a
sample<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> how<00:00:25.830> easy<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.840> create<00:00:27.840> all<00:00:28.529> I'm

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
sample of how easy is to create all I'm

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.229 
sample of how easy is to create all I'm
doing<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.340> dragging<00:00:29.900> dropping<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.160> PNG<00:00:32.160> or<00:00:32.460> my

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
doing is dragging dropping a PNG or my

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.950 
doing is dragging dropping a PNG or my
graphic<00:00:33.660> files<00:00:33.899> into<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:35.360> anti<00:00:36.360> rip<00:00:36.570> software

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
graphic files into the anti rip software

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.319 
graphic files into the anti rip software
and<00:00:37.469> what's<00:00:38.070> nice<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.520> could<00:00:38.640> change<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and what's nice you could change the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.030 
and what's nice you could change the
color<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> background<00:00:40.140> if<00:00:40.890> this

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
color of the background if this

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.450 
color of the background if this
transparency<00:00:41.820> background<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.989> more<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
transparency background and more so you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.119 
transparency background and more so you
could<00:00:44.969> actually<00:00:45.329> see<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:46.980> going

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
could actually see right here I'm going

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.760 
could actually see right here I'm going
to<00:00:47.219> put<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> green<00:00:48.090> shirt<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:49.559> going

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
to put this on a green shirt I'm going

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.360 
to put this on a green shirt I'm going
to<00:00:49.860> reposition<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:51.180> ought<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.980> be<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.129> little

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
to reposition this ought to be a little

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
to reposition this ought to be a little
higher<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> shirt<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:55.230> Center<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
higher up on a shirt and then Center it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.700 
higher up on a shirt and then Center it
I<00:00:55.949> could<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> make<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> graphic<00:00:58.320> change

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
I could go and make the graphic change

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.670 
I could go and make the graphic change
by<00:00:58.949> adding<00:00:59.399> more<00:00:59.609> colors<00:01:00.120> right<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.379> if

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
by adding more colors right there or if

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.369 
by adding more colors right there or if
you<00:01:01.890> make<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.129> brighter<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:03.300> also<00:01:03.600> could<00:01:04.110> add

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you make it brighter I'm also could add

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.310 
you make it brighter I'm also could add
a<00:01:04.439> little<00:01:04.949> more<00:01:05.189> saturation<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> design

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a little more saturation to the design

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.940 
a little more saturation to the design
or<00:01:07.680> remove<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.610> help<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.350> printing

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
or remove it to help with the printing

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.190 
or remove it to help with the printing
process<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:12.740> could<00:01:13.740> also<00:01:14.240> show<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
process I could also show you that I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.010 
process I could also show you that I
could<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.799> create<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.119> preview<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
could actually create the preview and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.289 
could actually create the preview and
then<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.799> would<00:01:19.950> happen<00:01:20.549> without<00:01:20.670> white<00:01:21.090> ink

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
then what would happen without white ink

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.830 
then what would happen without white ink
by<00:01:21.720> enabling<00:01:22.350> white<00:01:22.890> ankle<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:24.060> how

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
by enabling white ankle you can see how

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.770 
by enabling white ankle you can see how
it<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> three<00:01:26.520> different<00:01:27.150> dimension

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it is with the three different dimension

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
it is with the three different dimension
the<00:01:28.020> true<00:01:28.290> view<00:01:28.560> or<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.829> original<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:30.030> white

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the true view or the original the white

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.620 
the true view or the original the white
graphic<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.040> TrueView<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.729> could

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
graphic and then the TrueView I could

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.710 
graphic and then the TrueView I could
then<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:34.049> through<00:01:34.860> here<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.759> different

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
then go through here and just different

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.100 
then go through here and just different
color<00:01:37.400> contrasts<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:39.479> bring<00:01:39.900> back

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
color contrasts and actually bring back

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
color contrasts and actually bring back
the<00:01:40.290> choke<00:01:40.650> which<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> white<00:01:41.490> base

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the choke which is the white base

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.139 
the choke which is the white base
underlay<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.720> could<00:01:43.290> also<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:44.100> through<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> add

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
underlay I could also go through and add

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.740 
underlay I could also go through and add
more<00:01:46.020> white<00:01:46.490> underneath<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.030> colors<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.630> make

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
more white underneath the colors to make

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870 
more white underneath the colors to make
it<00:01:48.899> more<00:01:49.140> popped<00:01:49.530> out<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.159> example<00:01:50.729> this

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
it more popped out for example this

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.389 
it more popped out for example this
yellow<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.509> may<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> higher<00:01:52.979> value

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
yellow I may want to have a higher value

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.730 
yellow I may want to have a higher value
so<00:01:54.060> there<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.270> more<00:01:54.810> brightness<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
so there is more brightness of the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.429 
so there is more brightness of the
yellow<00:01:56.250> causing<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.509> white<00:01:57.780> ink<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
yellow causing more white ink to the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.730 
yellow causing more white ink to the
logo<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.170> other<00:02:01.439> colors

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
logo and I can do that with other colors

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.359 
logo and I can do that with other colors
through<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:03.210> will<00:02:03.360> also<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:03.810> what<00:02:04.409> you

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
through here you will also see what you

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.700 
through here you will also see what you
get<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.570> see<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.930> sample<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
get as you see the sample with the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.180 
get as you see the sample with the
wedding<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> color<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.770> get

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
wedding and now with the color you get

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.120 
wedding and now with the color you get
what<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.520> have

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
what you have

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.430 
what you have
on<00:02:12.400> your<00:02:12.700> screen<00:02:13.090> that's<00:02:13.750> what<00:02:14.020> makes<00:02:14.260> this

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
on your screen that's what makes this

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.410 
on your screen that's what makes this
software<00:02:14.920> are<00:02:15.540> truly<00:02:16.540> unique<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.880> could<00:02:19.060> save

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
software are truly unique you could save

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.380 
software are truly unique you could save
your<00:02:19.600> file<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.550> bring<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.640> back<00:02:21.670> at<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.240> later

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
your file and bring it back at a later

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.670 
your file and bring it back at a later
date<00:02:23.550> that's<00:02:24.550> another<00:02:25.360> advantage<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.380> if<00:02:26.530> your

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
date that's another advantage so if your

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.920 
date that's another advantage so if your
customer<00:02:27.100> comes<00:02:27.310> back<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.660> and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
customer comes back you have that and
