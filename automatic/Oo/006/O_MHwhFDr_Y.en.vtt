all that good stuff
well<00:02:44.250> I've<00:02:45.030> tried<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.829> plenty<00:02:46.829> of<00:02:46.920> times<00:02:47.220> and

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
well I've tried this plenty of times and

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.339 
well I've tried this plenty of times and
I<00:02:48.239> failed

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
I failed

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.729 
I failed
plenty<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.340> times<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:51.359> I<00:02:52.139> think<00:02:52.379> it<00:02:52.439> has<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> lot

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
plenty of times and I think it has a lot

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.849 
plenty of times and I think it has a lot
to<00:02:52.799> do<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.129> how<00:02:53.340> my<00:02:53.639> hair<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.000> textured<00:02:54.859> just

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
no point for me it doesn't solve

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:10.819 
no point for me it doesn't solve
anything

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
anything

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.050 
anything
I<00:03:11.069> don't<00:03:11.280> know<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:12.510> um<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.500> yeah<00:03:13.940> but<00:03:14.940> it

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
I don't know so um but yeah but it

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.399 
I don't know so um but yeah but it
really<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.510> curly<00:03:15.810> girl<00:03:15.959> method<00:03:15.989> really

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
really the curly girl method really

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.469 
really the curly girl method really
depends<00:03:16.859> on<00:03:16.979> what<00:03:17.250> kind<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.549> type<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.060> hair<00:03:18.449> you

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:18.479 
depends on what kind of type of hair you

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.170 
depends on what kind of type of hair you
have<00:03:18.659> you<00:03:19.470> know<00:03:19.590> sometimes<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.159> harder<00:03:20.699> when

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
have you know sometimes it's harder when

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.000 
have you know sometimes it's harder when
you<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.329> hair<00:03:21.840> that's<00:03:21.959> like<00:03:22.229> wavy<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.889> I'm

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
you have hair that's like wavy and I'm

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.189 
you have hair that's like wavy and I'm
assuming<00:03:23.549> that's<00:03:23.760> what<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.239> mean<00:03:24.389> by<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.569> 3c

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
assuming that's what you mean by the 3c

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.099 
assuming that's what you mean by the 3c
I<00:03:25.470> think<00:03:25.979> the<00:03:26.099> c<00:03:26.310> 3c<00:03:26.669> is<00:03:27.060> kind<00:03:27.419> of<00:03:27.510> winged<00:03:27.690> my

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
I think the c 3c is kind of winged my

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.439 
I think the c 3c is kind of winged my
hair<00:03:28.319> is<00:03:28.379> really<00:03:28.560> wavy<00:03:28.889> in<00:03:29.099> a<00:03:29.190> front<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:29.729> the

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
hair is really wavy in a front so the

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.990 
hair is really wavy in a front so the
curly<00:03:30.750> girl<00:03:30.959> method<00:03:30.989> doesn't<00:03:31.979> work<00:03:32.159> for<00:03:32.609> me<00:03:32.760> in

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
curly girl method doesn't work for me in

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.979 
curly girl method doesn't work for me in
the<00:03:33.510> front<00:03:33.810> now<00:03:34.349> like<00:03:34.889> on<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.220> sides<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:36.060> like

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
the front now like on the sides and like

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.110 
the front now like on the sides and like
in<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.229> back<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.430> little<00:03:38.669> differently

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
in the back it's a little differently

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.390 
in the back it's a little differently
because<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.769> my<00:03:40.769> hair<00:03:40.949> is<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.069> little<00:03:41.159> bit

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
because the my hair is a little bit

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.449 
because the my hair is a little bit
curly<00:03:41.699> but<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:43.769> know<00:03:43.889> it's<00:03:44.099> just<00:03:44.159> kind<00:03:44.400> of

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
curly but you know it's just kind of

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.009
