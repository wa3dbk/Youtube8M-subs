creating your braids that have the yarn

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.050 
creating your braids that have the yarn
you're<00:01:39.799> also<00:01:39.950> going<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.310> need<00:01:40.430> to<00:01:40.579> grab<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.790> tool

which<00:01:41.329> is<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.509> pull<00:01:41.780> through<00:01:42.110> this<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:43.070> an

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
which is a pull through this is an

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.039 
which is a pull through this is an
example<00:01:43.549> of<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:43.880> homemade<00:01:44.240> pull<00:01:44.479> through<00:01:44.780> which

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
example of a homemade pull through which

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.249 
example of a homemade pull through which
was<00:01:45.259> made<00:01:45.470> with<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.100> thin<00:01:46.310> gauge<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.850> wire

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
was made with just a thin gauge of wire

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.960 
was made with just a thin gauge of wire
and<00:01:48.259> if<00:01:48.649> you<00:01:48.770> have<00:01:48.979> hay<00:01:49.250> bales<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.729> come<00:01:49.850> in

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
and if you have hay bales that come in

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.190 
and if you have hay bales that come in
wire<00:01:50.119> that's<00:01:50.360> actually<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.869> really<00:01:51.079> really

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
wire that's actually a really really

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.770 
wire that's actually a really really
good<00:01:51.470> gauge<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:51.890> wire<00:01:52.189> to<00:01:52.460> use<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.970> then<00:01:53.540> some

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
good gauge of wire to use and then some

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.249 
good gauge of wire to use and then some
electrical<00:01:54.380> tape<00:01:54.409> at<00:01:55.299> this<00:01:56.299> end<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:56.840> it's<00:01:57.020> easy

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
electrical tape at this end so it's easy

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.120 
electrical tape at this end so it's easy
to<00:01:57.470> hold<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.340> then<00:01:59.030> you<00:01:59.270> can<00:01:59.719> just<00:02:00.229> push<00:02:00.920> this

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
to hold and then you can just push this

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.069 
to hold and then you can just push this
through<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.579> top<00:02:01.790> of<00:02:01.820> your<00:02:01.969> braid<00:02:02.329> put<00:02:02.899> your

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
through the top of your braid put your

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.109 
through the top of your braid put your
yarn<00:02:03.619> through<00:02:03.740> there<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.340> pull<00:02:04.399> through<00:02:05.000> to

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
yarn through there and pull through to

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.370 
yarn through there and pull through to
start<00:02:05.390> creating<00:02:05.659> your<00:02:05.810> rosette<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:09.200> is

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
start creating your rosette this is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.350 
start creating your rosette this is
another<00:02:09.649> example<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:10.489> a<00:02:10.820> pull<00:02:11.030> through<00:02:11.209> that

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
another example of a pull through that

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.570 
another example of a pull through that
you<00:02:11.480> can<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:12.140> can<00:02:12.349> use<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:12.980> can<00:02:13.190> find<00:02:13.430> these

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
you can you can use you can find these

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.290 
you can you can use you can find these
at<00:02:13.790> your<00:02:13.940> local<00:02:14.560> sewing<00:02:15.560> and/or<00:02:15.980> craft<00:02:16.220> store

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300
