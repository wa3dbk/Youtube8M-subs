00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.520
To the southeast of the River Omo is the territory of the Karo,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.520
 an ethnic group of barely 1,000 people.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.480
They are constantly under threat: 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.600
persistent droughts that cause a cycle of famine, 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.720
a severe pandemic or a simple war with their powerful neighbors

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.120
 the Mursi could lead to their ultimate extinction.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.360
Their customs and ways of life have remained the same for 500 years. 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.400
The Karo mark their social statuses and personal identities 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.680
with ornaments on their skin: 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.760
they are considered masters of body painting. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.520
Their artistic designs imitate the plumage of birds and the stripes of 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.280
zebra; the white chalk mixed with water highlights their bodies, and, 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.120
though it lasts only for one day, is long enough to shine out in 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.280
ceremonial feasts. 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.080
Men, women and children alike all dance. 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.400
And the rhythm is especially striking in courtship rituals.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.920
The women of this Ethiopian tribe colour their hair 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.080
with a mixture of animal fat and red clay; they wear brightly coloured 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.920
necklaces, their arms boast numerous bracelets 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.400
and they wear leather skirts.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.320
Although the men are always more painted, the women often employ 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.240
decorative scarring, shallow incisions that, with a coating of ink, 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.440
acquire a unique touch that attracts the men. 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.120
The Karo were originally a tribe of hunter-herders, 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.440
but they were forced to work the land in order to survive,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.800
 due to the continuing scourges of tsetse fly which infected their 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.840
animals and decimated their herds.â€¨
