many<00:03:08.560> watts<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.070> have<00:03:09.250> 30<00:03:09.820> 30<00:03:10.300> watts<00:03:10.510> 30<00:03:10.810> amps

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
many watts you have 30 30 watts 30 amps

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.130 
many watts you have 30 30 watts 30 amps
so<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.860> no<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.970> solar<00:03:13.150> panel<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.660> more

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
so it no but the solar panel is more

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.810 
so it no but the solar panel is more
than<00:03:14.320> 30<00:03:14.500> watts<00:03:14.709> right<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.160> looks<00:03:15.310> bigger<00:03:15.520> it's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
than 30 watts right it looks bigger it's

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.479 
than 30 watts right it looks bigger it's
I<00:03:16.090> think<00:03:16.450> it's<00:03:16.739> 185<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.920> was<00:03:18.070> gonna<00:03:18.190> say<00:03:18.370> it

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
I think it's 185 I was gonna say it

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.130 
I think it's 185 I was gonna say it
looks<00:03:18.610> at<00:03:18.790> least<00:03:18.820> uh<00:03:19.239> between<00:03:19.720> one<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:19.959> two

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
looks at least uh between one and two

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.320 
looks at least uh between one and two

am<00:03:37.299> uh<00:03:37.329> almost<00:03:37.959> well<00:03:38.380> I'm<00:03:38.500> actually<00:03:38.650> 6<00:03:39.040> feet

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
am uh almost well I'm actually 6 feet

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.380 
am uh almost well I'm actually 6 feet
tall<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:40.090> if<00:03:40.209> I

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
tall and if I

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.540 
tall and if I
stand<00:03:40.630> down<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:41.440> yeah<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.040> still<00:03:42.340> got<00:03:42.400> about

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
stand down here yeah I still got about

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.980 
stand down here yeah I still got about
an<00:03:42.760> inch<00:03:42.819> above<00:03:43.060> me<00:03:43.210> right<00:03:43.330> maybe<00:03:43.720> with<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
an inch above me right maybe with the

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.540 
an inch above me right maybe with the
hat<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.590> think<00:03:44.709> this<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.069> about<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.310> same

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
hat so I think this is about the same

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.820 
hat so I think this is about the same
height<00:03:45.730> as<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.000> Explorer<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:47.530> padded

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
height as the Explorer and it's padded

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.230 
height as the Explorer and it's padded
so<00:03:48.130> if<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.370> do<00:03:48.520> if<00:03:48.700> you're<00:03:48.819> really<00:03:48.970> tall

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
so if you do if you're really tall

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.390 
so if you do if you're really tall
you're<00:03:49.390> not<00:03:49.510> going<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.690> hurt<00:03:49.780> yourself
