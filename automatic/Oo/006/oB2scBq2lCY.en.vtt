probably<00:00:13.559> know<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.099> already<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:15.179> if<00:00:15.389> you

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
probably know it already but if you

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
don't it's like voice control except far

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.689 
don't it's like voice control except far
more<00:00:18.810> advanced<00:00:19.260> let<00:00:20.250> me<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.520> demonstrate

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
very useful things like I just

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.670 
very useful things like I just
previously<00:01:53.159> showed<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.420> time<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.439> date

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
previously showed you for time to date

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.499 
previously showed you for time to date
location<00:01:57.049> etc<00:01:58.280> but<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.820> as<00:02:00.060> well<00:02:00.090> make

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
location etc but you can as well make

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.639 
location etc but you can as well make
Google<00:02:00.899> searches<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:02.130> example<00:02:03.049> Google<00:02:04.049> search

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
Google searches as example Google search

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.630 
Google searches as example Google search
iphone<00:02:07.849> searching<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.090> iphone<00:02:10.190> so

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
iphone searching for iphone so

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.080 
iphone searching for iphone so
Google<00:02:12.150> search<00:02:12.830> anything<00:02:13.830> any<00:02:14.250> word<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.850> it's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
Google search anything any word and it's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.940 
Google search anything any word and it's
just<00:02:15.390> automatically<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.410> search<00:02:16.620> for

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
just automatically going to search for

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.940 
just automatically going to search for
it<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.030> said<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.660> phone<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.590> makes<00:02:19.830> a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
it so I said I phone so it makes a

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.000 
it so I said I phone so it makes a
google<00:02:20.190> search<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.430> iphone<00:02:21.740> so<00:02:22.740> that's

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
google search for iphone so that's

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.699 
google search for iphone so that's
pretty<00:02:23.310> nice<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.750> know<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:24.900> don't<00:02:25.050> really<00:02:25.470> know

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
pretty nice you know I don't really know

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.150 
pretty nice you know I don't really know
anything<00:02:25.950> else<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.430> tell<00:02:26.640> Siri<00:02:27.170> but<00:02:28.170> these<00:02:28.980> are

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
anything else to tell Siri but these are

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.100 
anything else to tell Siri but these are
the<00:02:29.340> main<00:02:29.550> things<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.390> do<00:02:30.570> with<00:02:30.720> series

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
the main things you can do with series

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.630 
the main things you can do with series
so<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:33.030> very<00:02:33.150> useful<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.260> think

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
so you know it's very useful and I think

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.840 
so you know it's very useful and I think
Apple<00:02:35.640> did<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.880> great<00:02:36.180> job<00:02:36.209> with<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.720> um

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
Apple did a great job with that um

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.640 
Apple did a great job with that um
something<00:02:38.850> else<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.300> can<00:02:39.330> ask<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:40.050> our

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.340 

mathematical<00:02:43.940> equations<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.420> calculations

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
mathematical equations and calculations

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:55.000 
mathematical equations and calculations
like<00:02:47.989> what's<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.140> square<00:02:49.620> root<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:50.160> 32

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.560 

checking<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.310> for<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.640> would<00:02:57.420> you

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
checking on that for you would you

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.170 
checking on that for you would you
answer<00:02:57.959> your<00:02:58.290> question<00:02:58.890> there<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.400> go<00:02:59.519> exact

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
answer your question there you go exact

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.960 
answer your question there you go exact
result<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:01.519> that's<00:03:02.519> more<00:03:02.790> approximation<00:03:04.970> you

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
result and that's more approximation you
