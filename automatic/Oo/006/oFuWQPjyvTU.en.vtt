like this hook right here and the first
place<00:00:23.660> I<00:00:23.779> pick<00:00:23.930> my<00:00:24.110> toes<00:00:24.289> is<00:00:24.560> right<00:00:24.980> through

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
place I pick my toes is right through

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.480 
place I pick my toes is right through
the<00:00:25.400> nostrils<00:00:25.940> and<00:00:26.480> come<00:00:26.720> up<00:00:26.980> or<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:28.010> hope<00:00:28.310> them

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
the nostrils and come up or I hope them

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.609 
the nostrils and come up or I hope them
right<00:00:28.760> below<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.539> dorsal<00:00:29.930> fin<00:00:30.080> right<00:00:30.289> here

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
right below the dorsal fin right here

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.409 
right below the dorsal fin right here
and<00:00:30.800> try<00:00:31.220> not<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.580> stay<00:00:31.850> away<00:00:32.059> from<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.300> middle

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
and try not to stay away from the middle

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.049 
and try not to stay away from the middle
because<00:00:33.289> that's<00:00:33.499> where<00:00:33.649> their<00:00:33.769> main<00:00:34.059> nervous

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
because that's where their main nervous

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.229 
because that's where their main nervous
and<00:00:35.839> their<00:00:35.989> main<00:00:36.140> spine<00:00:36.850> so<00:00:37.850> this<00:00:37.999> is<00:00:38.149> the

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
and their main spine so this is the

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.790 
and their main spine so this is the
first<00:00:38.449> way<00:00:38.659> I<00:00:38.719> hold<00:00:38.899> him<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:39.170> just<00:00:39.319> right<00:00:39.530> under

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
first way I hold him is just right under

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.459 
first way I hold him is just right under
that<00:00:39.829> nerve<00:00:40.249> and<00:00:40.879> they'll<00:00:41.659> stay<00:00:41.899> live<00:00:42.199> there

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
that nerve and they'll stay live there

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:43.750 
that nerve and they'll stay live there
for<00:00:42.620> quite<00:00:42.829> a<00:00:42.859> while<00:00:43.069> as<00:00:43.339> long<00:00:43.489> as<00:00:43.579> you<00:00:43.639> don't

nostril<00:01:04.670> but<00:01:05.540> right<00:01:06.200> here<00:01:06.230> I'm<00:01:06.620> gonna<00:01:06.770> hook<00:01:06.950> it

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
nostril but right here I'm gonna hook it

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.710 
nostril but right here I'm gonna hook it
right<00:01:07.130> through<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> nostril<00:01:08.300> of<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.420> mouth

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.990 

through<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.870> nostril<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:16.430> down<00:01:16.670> through<00:01:16.910> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
through the nostril and down through the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.300 
through the nostril and down through the
bottom<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.420> mouth<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:18.980> usually

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
bottom of the mouth and that usually

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.670 
bottom of the mouth and that usually
keeps<00:01:19.730> them<00:01:19.880> from<00:01:20.030> dying<00:01:20.270> pretty<00:01:20.510> well<00:01:20.780> and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
keeps them from dying pretty well and

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.750 
keeps them from dying pretty well and
you<00:01:21.830> don't<00:01:22.010> have<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.190> risk<00:01:22.370> hitting<00:01:22.550> your

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
you don't have to risk hitting your

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.940 
you don't have to risk hitting your
spine<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:23.990> usually<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.410> lasts<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.680> little<00:01:24.830> bit

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
spine so usually it lasts a little bit

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.560 
spine so usually it lasts a little bit
longer<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.550> I<00:01:25.640> seem<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:25.970> have<00:01:26.120> pretty<00:01:26.390> good

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
longer and I seem to have pretty good

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.210 
longer and I seem to have pretty good
hook<00:01:26.900> ups<00:01:27.110> just<00:01:27.380> like<00:01:27.500> hooking<00:01:27.950> them<00:01:28.040> through

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
hook ups just like hooking them through

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.440 
hook ups just like hooking them through
the<00:01:28.310> spine<00:01:28.580> sometimes<00:01:29.060> I<00:01:29.120> get<00:01:29.240> off<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.390> little

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
the spine sometimes I get off a little

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.930 
the spine sometimes I get off a little
bit<00:01:29.720> more<00:01:30.040> but<00:01:31.040> you're<00:01:31.430> less<00:01:31.580> like<00:01:31.790> your

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
bit more but you're less like your

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.670 
bit more but you're less like your
minnow<00:01:32.270> stays<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.690> little<00:01:32.810> bit<00:01:33.020> more<00:01:33.200> likely<00:01:33.410> in

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
minnow stays a little bit more likely in

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.220 
minnow stays a little bit more likely in
my<00:01:33.770> opinion
