00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.690
 the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.130
 ah 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.950
 ah 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.840
 and what is today this good day in 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.500
 first instance we have a course for 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.470
 everything is this police fireman and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.340
 this is an educational course of simulacra 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.830
 CPR CPR let 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.830
 to go through polytrauma we are going to 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.420
 also go through burned and what to do and 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.750
 what not to do in each performance with 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.960
 injured after we have a small 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.270
 break and we start with a drill 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.160
 free for all public in which it goes 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.950
 to treat fairly accident victims in a 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.690
 vehicle how to get it out of the vehicle that 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.540
 is going to act also together with 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.880
 the police all the medical team in this 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.030
 case all the Sami medical team and 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.770
 this 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.260
 and there you will see how to get the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.940
 patients of a fire vehicle goes to 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.810
 open the vehicles is going to be a person 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.990
 trapped 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.580
 there will be motorcycle accidents how to get out 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.240
 the hulls of an accident victim 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.580
 fundamental that unfortunately you have left 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.890
 many injuries at cervical level and others 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.319
 for acting badly then what is 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.060
 try to give a course so that all the 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.200
 civil and non-civilian population 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.810
 updated on how you should do 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.510
 maneuvers 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.209
 to participate also people the public 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.640
 in general in that part and in that part 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.040
 the idea is to explain to the public 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.840
 just what you should not do but 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.480
 let's grab a surprise way to 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.370
 people from the public to help by 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.160
 example with the lifting of the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.130
 parihuela that the relief table this 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.160
 massaging will help to take the patient out 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.720
 of the vehicle and already know what 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.569
 maneuver has to do and that does not 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.269
 fundamentally, the 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.850
 health centers for a serious accident 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.880
 for example in this area yes yes in this 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.880
 case the hospital performed more or 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.500
 less a month and a half also a course 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.870
 this one that resuscitated 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.730
 Cardiopulmonary also gave 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.890
 polytraumatized they bought here 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.720
 new elements that are used in all the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.440
 mobile emergencies for example in the 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.780
 advanced hospitals and they learned how 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.450
 use them within that course or 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.160
 that are prepared in this area 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.829
 how is it in Montevideo hospitals 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.780
 a problem none the staff that 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.560
 the staff here will also do it 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.550
 he already made it 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.310
 he already did he is the same if he performed 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.760
 all the hospital staff and this 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.190
 both administrative and medical as 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.680
 nursing the director herself the 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.950
 we did work in all the acts that 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.720
 We made health, that is, the 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.930
 personal part of the hospital is all 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.880
 prepared, it is good that all the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.490
 world in this case true what to do 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.010
 when we are on the route by 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.220
 example anyone to do in 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.100
 that case how to act if yes is 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.590
 fundamental we aim that the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.330
 public in general knew person by 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.060
 people start at schools in 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.280
 reality to give first aid fourth 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.620
 fifth or sixth year of school goes through 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.510
 the lyceum advance a little more thing 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.060
 after adult are prepared 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.040
 so that the situation outside the house and 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.900
 inside the house it is essential that a 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.630
 person knows how to act on one's own 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.160
 house a cardiac arrest of a relative by 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.050
 example 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.539
 the mule 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.490
 how to explain it if we wait for the 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.259
 ambulance that really even if it arrives 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.900
 light we are talking about five or seven 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:35.030
 minutes nine minutes can be left with 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.440
 54% sequelae 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.070
 if we know how to act 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.150
 only remains with 1% 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.640
 that is, the importance of knowing how to act 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.560
 it is essential for you to have children 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.020
 also fundamental not because they are the 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.550
 same methods change some there 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.550
 some variants that also 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.820
 explain in the course just in case 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.850
 the people who come to give the course and the 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.120
 people who are inside the course have 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.580
 children, then we will teach you how to 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.260
 act with different ages and what kind 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.410
 of massage is made for adults to 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.080
 the children is certified the entire staff 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.660
 the staff that has certified not the 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.760
 staff in general but one by one 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.140
 has certificate one by one like that 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.520
 they received the rcp management course and 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.860
 I can tell you by polytraumatized 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.080
 example on the new regulation of the 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.060
 road education to me it seems 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.270
 sensational everything that is added to 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.180
 level of caring for the people themselves up 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.210
 the first aid kit now with each vehicle 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.790
 I think it's great, I work in the 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.740
 health 33 years ago at the level of 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.560
 mobile emergencies 15 that I am 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.660
 instructor and I've advanced a lot myself 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.660
 advances to the world I think it's unicef 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.090
 and this and if each measure you take out of 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.420
 protection to ourselves seems to me 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.420
 fundamental
