very high fire rate along with a very
large<00:00:15.929> clip<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.740> comes<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> lot<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.699> ammo

large clip it comes with a lot of ammo
you<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.990> believe<00:00:19.320> 50<00:00:19.949> bullets<00:00:20.340> per<00:00:20.640> clip

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
you have I believe 50 bullets per clip

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
you have I believe 50 bullets per clip
and<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:22.080> get<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> hundred<00:00:22.650> extra<00:00:23.100> bullets

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and you get a hundred extra bullets

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.029 
and you get a hundred extra bullets
that's<00:00:23.580> 150<00:00:24.390> bullets<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.779> total<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.260> that's

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
that's 150 bullets in total and that's

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.620 
that's 150 bullets in total and that's
that's<00:00:26.369> quite<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> lot<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.029> bullets<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.599> can

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630

that's quite a lot of bullets you can
cause<00:00:28.410> quite<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.800> lot<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.070> deaths<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:30.029> this

weapon<00:00:31.700> but<00:00:32.700> apparently<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.570> can't<00:00:33.780> shoot

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
weapon but apparently you can't shoot

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170

through<00:00:34.230> walls<00:00:34.260> -<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:35.940> very

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
through walls - well I was just very

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.950 
through walls - well I was just very
inaccurate<00:00:36.540> there<00:00:37.550> anyways<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.960> definitely

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
inaccurate there anyways I definitely

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.389

like<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.260> gun<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> lot<00:00:40.739> better<00:00:40.980> than<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
like this gun a lot better than the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.630 
like this gun a lot better than the
vector<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.480> used<00:00:42.750> yesterday<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:44.550> off

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
vector which I used yesterday I get off

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580 
vector which I used yesterday I get off
to<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> great<00:00:45.090> start<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.200> there

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
to a great start as you can see there

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040 
to a great start as you can see there
it<00:00:47.010> killed<00:00:47.610> quite<00:00:47.879> quickly<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.539> no<00:00:48.780> I

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.560 
actually do quite well this game I'm
using<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.730> 5<00:00:54.329> 7<00:00:54.780> 9<00:00:55.039> kill<00:00:56.039> streak<00:00:56.280> setup<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.879> not

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
using a 5 7 9 kill streak setup so not

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
using a 5 7 9 kill streak setup so not
gonna<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.870> getting<00:00:57.989> avoid<00:00:58.379> too<00:00:58.710> many<00:00:58.829> kills

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
gonna be getting avoid too many kills

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.349 
gonna be getting avoid too many kills
from<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> kill<00:00:59.550> streaks<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.030> don't<00:01:00.180> believe

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
from the kill streaks I don't believe

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.670 
from the kill streaks I don't believe
but<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:02.090> do<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> few<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.780> them

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
but I do get a few of them

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.390 
but I do get a few of them
this<00:01:05.189> gun<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.700> actually<00:01:06.110> decent<00:01:07.110> any<00:01:07.619> medium

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
this gun is actually decent any medium

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.230 
this gun is actually decent any medium
longest<00:01:09.240> range<00:01:10.460> I'd<00:01:11.460> still<00:01:11.729> recommend<00:01:11.850> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
longest range I'd still recommend you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480 
longest range I'd still recommend you
stay<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:12.930> short<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.950> medium<00:01:14.280> range

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
stay kind of like short to medium range

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.550 
stay kind of like short to medium range
with<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.939> gun

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
with this gun

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
with this gun
like<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> saw<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.460> wish<00:01:17.790> again<00:01:17.909> people

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
like you saw there I wish again people

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
like you saw there I wish again people
from<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.540> distance<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.250> was

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
from a distance and because I was

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.950 
from a distance and because I was
shooting<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.759> them<00:01:20.970> from<00:01:21.240> such<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> distance<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
shooting at them from such a distance I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
shooting at them from such a distance I
wasn't<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.380> killing<00:01:22.830> them<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> moved

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
wasn't really killing them so I moved

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.539 
wasn't really killing them so I moved
closer<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:25.140> why<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.409> using<00:01:25.530> marathon<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
closer that's why I'm using marathon I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.550 
closer that's why I'm using marathon I
do<00:01:27.000> recommend<00:01:27.390> using<00:01:27.659> marathon<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
do recommend using marathon with this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.740 
do recommend using marathon with this
gun<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.119> large<00:01:30.240> clip<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
gun because you have that large clip you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.820 
gun because you have that large clip you
don't<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.049> need<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> worry

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
don't really need to worry

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.310 
don't really need to worry
loading<00:01:32.480> really<00:01:33.480> quickly<00:01:33.810> or<00:01:33.930> anything<00:01:34.110> like

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
loading really quickly or anything like

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.340 
loading really quickly or anything like
that<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.370> you<00:01:35.910> can<00:01:36.120> put<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.080> marathon

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that so you can put on the marathon

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.070 
that so you can put on the marathon
sneak<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:38.010> behind<00:01:38.040> them<00:01:38.550> what<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> tend<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> do

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
sneak up behind them what I tend to do

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.700 
sneak up behind them what I tend to do
with<00:01:40.320> smg's<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.490> either<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.530> sneak<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.650> behind

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
with smg's is either I sneak up behind

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.360 
with smg's is either I sneak up behind
people<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> run<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.990> use<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> marathon<00:01:47.040> in

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
people or I run I use the marathon in

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.760 
people or I run I use the marathon in
the<00:01:47.490> mobility<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.120> run<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.870> an<00:01:49.110> area<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.530> near

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the mobility to run to an area like near

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.070 
the mobility to run to an area like near
their<00:01:49.920> spawn<00:01:50.280> where<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.080> continually

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
their spawn where I can just continually

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.740 
their spawn where I can just continually
shoot<00:01:52.290> them<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> once<00:01:53.700> they<00:01:53.940> either<00:01:54.150> start

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
shoot them and once they either start

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.080 
shoot them and once they either start
moving<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.800> different<00:01:55.890> spot<00:01:56.370> or<00:01:56.700> their

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
moving to a different spot or their

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.050 
moving to a different spot or their
spawn<00:01:57.360> changes<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:57.960> something<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:59.100> you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
spawn changes or something all then you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.280 
spawn changes or something all then you
know<00:02:00.150> take<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.480> moment<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.930> catch<00:02:01.050> my<00:02:01.080> breath

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
know take a moment to catch my breath

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.520 
know take a moment to catch my breath
and<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:01.740> find<00:02:02.160> where<00:02:02.400> they<00:02:02.610> are<00:02:03.530> spawning

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and then find where they are spawning

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.730 
and then find where they are spawning
next<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.760> I'll<00:02:06.210> go<00:02:06.450> run<00:02:07.170> over<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.470> where<00:02:07.590> their

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
next and I'll go run over to where their

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.470 
next and I'll go run over to where their
new<00:02:07.890> spawn<00:02:08.250> point<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:09.320> so<00:02:10.320> then<00:02:10.590> that's<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.520> good

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
new spawn point is so then that's a good

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.340 
new spawn point is so then that's a good
strategy<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.470> use<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:14.459> an<00:02:14.760> SMG<00:02:15.510> I

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
strategy that you can use with an SMG I

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.820 
strategy that you can use with an SMG I
also<00:02:16.800> recommend<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.220> silence<00:02:17.760> most<00:02:18.420> SMGs<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
also recommend you silence most SMGs the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.410 
also recommend you silence most SMGs the
p90<00:02:20.250> definitely<00:02:20.670> definitely<00:02:21.240> like<00:02:21.390> it

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
p90 definitely definitely like it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.530 
p90 definitely definitely like it
silenced<00:02:22.580> kind<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:23.760> lowers<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> recoil

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
silenced kind of like lowers the recoil

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.290 
silenced kind of like lowers the recoil
a<00:02:24.570> little<00:02:24.810> bit<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:26.459> know<00:02:26.750> right<00:02:27.750> here<00:02:28.190> I

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
a little bit and you know right here I

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.460 
a little bit and you know right here I
thought<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.510> really<00:02:30.720> gonna<00:02:30.840> kicked<00:02:31.290> out<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
thought I was really gonna kicked out of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.120 
thought I was really gonna kicked out of
this<00:02:31.680> game<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:34.170> lag<00:02:34.350> kind<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.890> went<00:02:35.040> away

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
this game but the lag kind of went away

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.199 
this game but the lag kind of went away
and<00:02:35.780> I'm<00:02:36.780> alive<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.160> was<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.640> was<00:02:38.820> kind<00:02:39.090> of

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
and I'm alive so I was I was kind of

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.759 
and I'm alive so I was I was kind of
grateful<00:02:39.330> for<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.230> do<00:02:40.290> get<00:02:40.530> a

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
grateful for that because I do get a

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.370 
grateful for that because I do get a
very<00:02:41.220> nice<00:02:41.370> score<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:41.910> game<00:02:42.150> for<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> regular

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
very nice score this game for a regular

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.910 
very nice score this game for a regular
team<00:02:43.620> deathmatch<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> good<00:02:46.560> thing<00:02:46.800> I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
team deathmatch so it's a good thing I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920

didn't<00:02:47.160> get<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.430> go<00:02:47.640> because<00:02:47.940> valannus<00:02:48.720> I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
didn't get to go because valannus I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.890 
didn't get to go because valannus I
think<00:02:49.769> that's<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.100> last<00:02:50.130> stuff<00:02:50.700> there

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
think that's my last stuff there

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.199 
think that's my last stuff there
my<00:02:52.320> source<00:02:52.590> fifteen<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.190> three<00:02:53.459> right<00:02:53.670> now<00:02:53.730> so

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
my source fifteen and three right now so

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.550 
my source fifteen and three right now so
it's<00:02:54.780> gonna<00:02:54.870> go<00:02:55.050> up<00:02:55.200> quite<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.470> bit<00:02:56.720> anyways<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it's gonna go up quite a bit anyways the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.460 
it's gonna go up quite a bit anyways the
p90<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.700> decent<00:03:00.420> amount<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.810> accuracy<00:03:01.110> it

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
p90 is a decent amount of accuracy it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.890 
p90 is a decent amount of accuracy it
bounces<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> little<00:03:02.250> bit<00:03:02.400> but<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.480> always<00:03:03.630> goes

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
bounces a little bit but it always goes

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.680 
bounces a little bit but it always goes
back<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.530> same<00:03:04.709> point<00:03:05.120> which<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.300> good<00:03:06.510> you

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
back to the same point which is good you

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.790 
back to the same point which is good you
know<00:03:06.720> some<00:03:06.959> guns<00:03:07.170> they'll<00:03:07.380> bounce<00:03:07.560> all<00:03:07.769> over

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
know some guns they'll bounce all over

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.680 
know some guns they'll bounce all over
the<00:03:08.010> place<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.519> won't<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.180> back<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.570> the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
the place and you won't get back to the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.009 
the place and you won't get back to the
point<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.709> started<00:03:11.280> aiming<00:03:11.670> at<00:03:12.019> which

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
point that you started aiming at which

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.509 
point that you started aiming at which
is<00:03:13.560> kind<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.950> annoying<00:03:14.160> sometimes<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.340> is

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
is kind of annoying sometimes so this is

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.120 
is kind of annoying sometimes so this is
it's<00:03:18.090> decent<00:03:18.900> at<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.290> medium<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.709> longer<00:03:19.920> it

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
it's decent at the medium to longer it

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.740 
it's decent at the medium to longer it
medium<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.390> wouldn't<00:03:21.540> really<00:03:21.630> recommend

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
medium and I wouldn't really recommend

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.650 
medium and I wouldn't really recommend
long<00:03:22.440> range<00:03:22.709> but<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.209> can<00:03:24.300> see<00:03:24.450> right<00:03:24.600> here

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
long range but as you can see right here

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.780 
long range but as you can see right here
the<00:03:25.380> guys<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.800> plane<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.610> good

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
the guys in the plane and a good

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.750 
the guys in the plane and a good
distance<00:03:27.150> and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
distance and

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.940 
distance and
I<00:03:27.879> kill<00:03:28.390> him<00:03:28.569> and<00:03:28.720> then<00:03:28.780> my<00:03:28.989> my<00:03:29.349> pave<00:03:29.590> low<00:03:29.799> get

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
I kill him and then my my pave low get

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.199 
I kill him and then my my pave low get
to<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.099> other<00:03:30.220> kill<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.459> thought<00:03:30.670> I'd<00:03:30.790> gotten<00:03:31.030> a

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
to the other kill I thought I'd gotten a

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.479 
to the other kill I thought I'd gotten a
double<00:03:31.390> spray<00:03:31.750> or<00:03:31.930> something<00:03:32.079> but<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:33.250> was<00:03:33.370> my

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
double spray or something but it was my

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.610 
double spray or something but it was my
payload<00:03:33.939> doing<00:03:34.180> some<00:03:34.360> damage<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.840> them

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.720 

because<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.860> gun<00:03:39.010> has<00:03:39.189> lots<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.489> ammo<00:03:39.700> I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
because this gun has lots of ammo I

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.390 
because this gun has lots of ammo I
recommend<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.299> don't<00:03:40.720> use<00:03:40.930> scavenger<00:03:41.620> like<00:03:42.220> I

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
recommend you don't use scavenger like I

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.759 
recommend you don't use scavenger like I
guess<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:43.420> if<00:03:43.599> you<00:03:43.720> really<00:03:43.750> want<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.500> but

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
guess you can if you really want to but

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.750 
guess you can if you really want to but
I<00:03:45.610> tend<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.900> tend<00:03:47.349> to<00:03:47.379> do<00:03:47.560> fairly<00:03:47.920> well<00:03:48.040> with

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
I tend I tend to do fairly well with

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.809 
I tend I tend to do fairly well with
just<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.150> ammo<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.040> get<00:03:51.250> with<00:03:51.370> an<00:03:51.519> SMG

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
just the ammo that you get with an SMG

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.360 
just the ammo that you get with an SMG
you<00:03:52.420> know<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:53.260> point<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.739> SMG<00:03:54.099> really

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
you know the point of the SMG really

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.899 
you know the point of the SMG really
isn't<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.819> get<00:03:55.510> 30<00:03:56.349> or<00:03:56.440> 40<00:03:56.890> kill<00:03:57.099> streaks<00:03:57.400> the

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
isn't to get 30 or 40 kill streaks the

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.699 
isn't to get 30 or 40 kill streaks the
point<00:03:58.120> of<00:03:58.209> using<00:03:58.329> an<00:03:58.510> SMG<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.319> kind<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.530> like

point of using an SMG is to kind of like

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.759 
point of using an SMG is to kind of like
be<00:04:00.700> mobile<00:04:01.150> and

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
be mobile and

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.440 
be mobile and
you<00:04:02.769> know<00:04:02.890> be<00:04:03.220> really<00:04:03.549> powerful<00:04:03.940> in

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
you know be really powerful in

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.839 
you know be really powerful in
close-range<00:04:04.870> situations<00:04:05.620> an<00:04:06.340> objective

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
close-range situations an objective

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.910 
close-range situations an objective
games<00:04:07.090> there<00:04:07.450> they're<00:04:08.049> good<00:04:08.260> for<00:04:08.440> actually

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
games there they're good for actually

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.899 
games there they're good for actually
like<00:04:09.069> capturing<00:04:09.549> flags<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.209> stuff<00:04:11.010> but<00:04:12.010> I'm

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
like capturing flags and stuff but I'm

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.720 
like capturing flags and stuff but I'm
using<00:04:13.420> these<00:04:13.659> spas<00:04:14.019> as<00:04:14.349> a<00:04:14.500> secondary<00:04:15.010> because

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
using these spas as a secondary because

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.900 
using these spas as a secondary because
I<00:04:16.660> don't<00:04:17.530> know<00:04:17.590> why<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.739> tend<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.250> like<00:04:18.639> using

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
I don't know why I tend to like using

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.449 
I don't know why I tend to like using
the<00:04:19.389> spas<00:04:19.660> but<00:04:19.889> basically<00:04:20.889> whenever<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.280> have<00:04:21.430> a

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
the spas but basically whenever I have a

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.150 
the spas but basically whenever I have a
mobile<00:04:21.760> class<00:04:22.090> like<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.449> SMG<00:04:23.410> or<00:04:23.590> something<00:04:24.070> of

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
mobile class like a SMG or something of

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.510 
mobile class like a SMG or something of
that<00:04:24.220> sort<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:26.800> it's<00:04:27.039> a<00:04:27.160> decent

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
that sort and it's it's a decent

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.400 
that sort and it's it's a decent
secondary<00:04:28.000> like<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.330> can<00:04:28.479> get<00:04:28.630> kills<00:04:28.870> like<00:04:29.110> 20

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
secondary like you can get kills like 20

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.520 
secondary like you can get kills like 20
feet<00:04:29.620> away<00:04:29.710> with<00:04:30.039> it<00:04:30.190> so<00:04:30.850> it's<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.630> good<00:04:32.139> close

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
feet away with it so it's a good close

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.010 
feet away with it so it's a good close
range<00:04:32.860> but<00:04:33.449> if<00:04:34.449> you're<00:04:34.599> really<00:04:34.720> worried<00:04:34.990> about

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
range but if you're really worried about

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.360 
range but if you're really worried about
running<00:04:35.380> out<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:35.500> ammo<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:35.919> can<00:04:36.070> use

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
running out of ammo you can use

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.390 
running out of ammo you can use
something<00:04:36.639> like<00:04:36.789> a<00:04:37.169> pp-2000<00:04:38.229> or<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:39.250> then

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
something like a pp-2000 or a and then

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.820 
something like a pp-2000 or a and then
3r<00:04:39.729> Africa<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.479> that<00:04:41.080> will<00:04:41.260> help<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.620> get

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
3r Africa and that will help you get

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.150 
3r Africa and that will help you get
kills<00:04:42.280> until<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:43.210> can<00:04:43.330> find<00:04:43.570> another<00:04:43.840> weapon

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160
