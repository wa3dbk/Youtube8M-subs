00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello all today i have you one 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.549
 nice grumps to look at 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.500
 I really like it because it's for 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.660
 a large proportion of loosers but just for a moment 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.330
 what special on the front and on one 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.620
 side we'll start seeing one 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.620
 he is ready super fast 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.800
 First of all, start with you well 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.330
 to come 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.070
 this is a very easy haircut because 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.520
 a large part remains loose 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.169
 so it is also ready very quickly 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.240
 but I always like to start 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.680
 with the basics and that's the worry that 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.150
 all tangles are so what you now 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.220
 is going to do that is a haircut that goes to one 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.290
 side so choose the chance it 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.589
 easiest for me is that this one 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.059
 side so I am going a bit 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.059
 to this end day 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 and then you make sure that this is just what 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.250
 nicer, I take something more 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.800
 yes just about and you tilt in the beginning 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.860
 just a little tuft here and I go 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.530
 you turn and turn your head 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.530
 sometimes you every time with her 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.509
 all the way through 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.000
 make sure you are not too much hair meepakt 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.000
 from the back 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.490
 now you grab that is part of it 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.689
 then you come here then you fix him 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.170
 just put them with you 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.170
 sliders 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.710
 so on this side 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.479
 let 's hang a bundle of this hair 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.350
 goes to the other side and then has to 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:51.490
 you make sure it is as smooth as possible 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.530
 the rest is just this is very much on 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.020
 feeling so must make this off my 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.420
 god comes and i also take a part just 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.880
 under the crown 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.649
 you see and that goes along with this one 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.610
 side up 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.130
 that just puts you a little bit on your with 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.060
 Slider pins train him well 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.650
 stays firmly in place 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.049
 and then you go with this hair you go 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.950
 totally messy 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.950
 he stuck that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.920
 you see it he is already sitting so 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.069
 you go everywhere to make sure it is tasty 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.000
 stays messy and you take care of that 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.000
 that sits securely 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.190
 do who has one more concern here 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.190
 to be sure 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.580
 and then pull him something that he 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.580
 nice and messier 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.120
 you just have to see for yourself where you put it 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.310
 good enough 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.260
 and so you see how easy and fast 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.690
 This is done so you have to 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.940
 front the twisted pick and then 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.530
 take this all to a tilt and 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.690
 you stick that in a bar 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.880
 this way you will have a nice hair 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.040
 loose you have something playful again 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.780
 your face and it also ensures that 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.130
 you don't have too much hair along your face 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.890
 it becomes difficult 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.540
 copy a plots that you can do like that or 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.459
 a piece behind the ear that makes in 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.069
 principle does not matter but it ensures 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.320
 that this side just a little less a little less 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.930
 is fixed 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.360
 I was just showing to you or 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.140
 look the tighter side on one side and 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.980
 on this side 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.690
 it is clear that this was nice weather 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.670
 I hope you like it
