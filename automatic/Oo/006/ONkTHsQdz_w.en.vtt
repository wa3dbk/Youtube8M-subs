00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
over time it'll then end up drying out

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.080 
over time it'll then end up drying out
but<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.739> long<00:00:50.010> time<00:00:50.280> it'll<00:00:50.550> remain<00:00:50.760> sticky

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
but for a long time it'll remain sticky

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.670 
but for a long time it'll remain sticky
and<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.809> help<00:00:51.960> hold<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> figure<00:00:52.559> in

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680

making<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.939> sticky<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> sometimes<00:01:55.320> it'll

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
making it sticky and sometimes it'll

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.230 
making it sticky and sometimes it'll
feel<00:01:55.710> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.219> dried<00:01:56.790> out<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.000> bit

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
feel kind of like it's dried out a bit

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.569 
feel kind of like it's dried out a bit
and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:57.960> take<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> off<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> then<00:01:59.280> ball<00:01:59.490> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and you can take it off and then ball it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.149 
and you can take it off and then ball it
back<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.119> it'll<00:02:00.469> hopefully<00:02:01.469> get<00:02:01.829> sticky

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
back up and it'll hopefully get sticky

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.740 
back up and it'll hopefully get sticky
again<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.969> what<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> good<00:02:03.390> stuff<00:02:03.630> is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
again that's what the good stuff is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.840

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
surfaces that it will not stick to very

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.530 
surfaces that it will not stick to very
easily<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.850> just<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.180> know

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
into it now it's supposed to stand on

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.070 
into it now it's supposed to stand on
its<00:02:56.340> own<00:02:56.630> when<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.660> stand<00:02:58.760> look<00:02:59.760> at<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.150> on

two dollars when I picked it up and so
that's<00:03:10.140> always<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.800> bonus<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:11.430> cheaper

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
that's always a bonus that it's cheaper

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.920 
that's always a bonus that it's cheaper
and<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.000> can<00:03:12.150> see<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.360> footprint<00:03:12.720> in<00:03:12.810> there

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
and you can see the footprint in there

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.870 
and you can see the footprint in there
so<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.530> good<00:03:13.770> stuff<00:03:14.010> get<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.459> I'm

so this is good stuff get this I'm
looking<00:03:15.360> forward<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.630> using<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.990> now<00:03:16.640> as<00:03:17.640> far

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
looking forward to using it now as far

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.060 
looking forward to using it now as far
as<00:03:18.030> how<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.420> actually<00:03:18.870> apply<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.769> figures

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
as how you actually apply it to figures

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.229 
as how you actually apply it to figures
and<00:03:20.250> stuff<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.640> don't<00:03:20.730> want<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:20.970> shown

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
sometimes we'll have to use a little bit

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.699 
sometimes we'll have to use a little bit
less<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.480> scene<00:03:24.690> or<00:03:24.870> whatever<00:03:25.019> but

less of it and a scene or whatever but
the<00:03:26.010> stuff<00:03:26.250> seems<00:03:26.519> it's<00:03:26.640> actually<00:03:26.880> pretty
