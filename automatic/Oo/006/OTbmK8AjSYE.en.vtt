go wrong with either of them this one's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.500

probably<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:03.809> versatile<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.769> least<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.100> my

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
probably more versatile at least in my

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.500 
probably more versatile at least in my
collection<00:01:07.700> just<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> Blues

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
collection just because of all the Blues

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
collection just because of all the Blues
on<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:12.710> both<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> shoes<00:01:14.159> also<00:01:14.400> featured

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
on it both of the shoes also featured

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.380 
on it both of the shoes also featured
this<00:01:15.390> checkerboard<00:01:15.840> pattern<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> midsole

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
this checkerboard pattern on the midsole

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.550 
this checkerboard pattern on the midsole
which<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.570> would<00:01:18.810> turn<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> lot<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> people

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
which I know would turn a lot of people

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
which I know would turn a lot of people
off<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.310> actually<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:20.850> liked<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.450> I

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
off but I actually really liked it I

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.999 
off but I actually really liked it I
think<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.810> gives<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.110> more<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.770> vintage

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
think it gives them more of that vintage

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:31.880 
think it gives them more of that vintage
vibe<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:29.610> style<00:01:29.909> 36<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.229> similar<00:01:31.680> to
