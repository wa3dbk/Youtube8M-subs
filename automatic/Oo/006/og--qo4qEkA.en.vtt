that if you're going for a curl and you
find<00:03:10.440> yourself<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.920> little<00:03:11.700> bit<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:11.879> a<00:03:11.910> back

spot<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.230> very<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.590> know<00:03:16.650> edge<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.310> rail

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
spot the very you know edge of the rail

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.000 
spot the very you know edge of the rail
or<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.150> box<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.840> want<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.140> aim<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.500> directly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
or the box you want to aim like directly

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.680 
or the box you want to aim like directly
for<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.090> want<00:03:21.150> your<00:03:21.329> truck<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.569> be

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
for that you want your truck to be

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.930 
for that you want your truck to be
straight<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.590> all<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.370> pressure<00:03:23.640> on<00:03:23.819> this

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
straight like all the pressure on this

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.890 
straight like all the pressure on this
little<00:03:24.120> piece<00:03:24.359> that's<00:03:24.510> when<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.720> get<00:03:24.840> that

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
little piece that's when you get that

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.720 
little piece that's when you get that
that<00:03:25.260> tweaked<00:03:25.829> up<00:03:25.950> crook<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.459> get<00:03:26.579> that

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
that tweaked up crook and you get that

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:37.099 
that tweaked up crook and you get that
that<00:03:26.940> pop<00:03:27.120> out<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.359> everything<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:36.660> another

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
that pop out and everything so another

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.390 
that pop out and everything so another
thing<00:03:37.230> people<00:03:37.349> have<00:03:37.560> trouble<00:03:37.709> with<00:03:37.859> is<00:03:38.160> when

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
thing people have trouble with is when

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.580 
thing people have trouble with is when
they<00:03:38.519> get<00:03:38.669> out<00:03:38.849> I<00:03:39.180> guess<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.870> ends<00:03:40.079> up<00:03:40.169> clicking

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
they get out I guess it ends up clicking

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.960 
they get out I guess it ends up clicking
on<00:03:40.709> them<00:03:40.889> and<00:03:41.069> they<00:03:41.130> land<00:03:41.340> primo

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
on them and they land primo

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.849 
on them and they land primo
their<00:03:42.299> way<00:03:42.419> which<00:03:42.599> way<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:43.049> way<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.530> prevent

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
their way which way a way to prevent

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.259 
their way which way a way to prevent
that<00:03:43.980> would<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.459> make<00:03:44.669> sure<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.910> keep<00:03:45.090> your

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
that would just make sure you keep your

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.390 
that would just make sure you keep your
your<00:03:45.660> feet<00:03:45.930> flat<00:03:46.290> on<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.739> towards<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.280> very

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
your feet flat on it towards the very

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.190 
your feet flat on it towards the very
end<00:03:47.609> of<00:03:47.700> your<00:03:47.849> feet<00:03:48.060> are<00:03:48.150> flat<00:03:48.389> you'll<00:03:48.989> never

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
end of your feet are flat you'll never

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.839 
end of your feet are flat you'll never
let<00:03:49.380> room<00:03:49.620> for<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.829> to<00:03:49.950> flip<00:03:50.099> over<00:03:50.280> it'll<00:03:50.639> hold

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
let room for it to flip over it'll hold

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.420 
let room for it to flip over it'll hold
it<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.180> matter<00:03:51.419> what<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.750> win<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.260> just<00:03:53.190> you

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
it so matter what you win that just you

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:03.080 
it so matter what you win that just you
know<00:03:53.459> kind<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.030> like<00:03:54.209> your<00:03:54.329> feet<00:03:54.480> come<00:03:54.630> up

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.850 

so<00:04:04.090> for<00:04:04.690> round<00:04:04.840> rails<00:04:05.170> it's<00:04:05.410> pretty<00:04:05.590> much<00:04:05.680> all

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
so for round rails it's pretty much all

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.070 
so for round rails it's pretty much all
the<00:04:05.980> same<00:04:06.160> thing<00:04:06.400> except<00:04:06.670> for<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.810> want<00:04:07.990> to

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
the same thing except for you want to

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.020 
the same thing except for you want to
aim<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.500> very<00:04:08.740> top<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.400> rail<00:04:09.610> because

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
aim the very top of a rail because

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.330 
aim the very top of a rail because
there's<00:04:10.750> no<00:04:10.930> edge<00:04:11.200> so<00:04:11.890> you<00:04:11.950> don't<00:04:12.100> want<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.280> be

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
there's no edge so you don't want to be

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.250 
there's no edge so you don't want to be
off<00:04:12.460> this<00:04:12.640> side<00:04:12.940> or<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.420> know<00:04:13.510> you<00:04:13.990> just<00:04:14.080> want

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
off this side or you know you just want

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.780 
off this side or you know you just want
to<00:04:14.320> try<00:04:14.800> to<00:04:14.860> keep<00:04:15.070> all<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.370> pressure<00:04:15.580> in<00:04:15.730> the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
to try to keep all the pressure in the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.900 
to try to keep all the pressure in the
very<00:04:16.030> tip<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.930> round<00:04:17.380> rail<00:04:17.650> just<00:04:18.519> right<00:04:18.760> on

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
very tip of the round rail just right on

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.670 
very tip of the round rail just right on
top<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.239> all<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.510> way<00:04:19.600> straight<00:04:19.989> on<00:04:20.320> top<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:20.590> it

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
top it all the way straight on top of it

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.750 
top it all the way straight on top of it
just<00:04:20.799> like<00:04:20.890> you<00:04:20.980> would<00:04:21.070> do<00:04:21.160> any<00:04:21.340> other<00:04:21.459> grind

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
just like you would do any other grind

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.250 
just like you would do any other grind
on<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:21.940> round<00:04:22.150> rail<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.780> just<00:04:22.930> want<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.140> keep

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
on a round rail you just want to keep

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:32.820 
on a round rail you just want to keep
right<00:04:23.980> on<00:04:24.010> top<00:04:24.310> of<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:31.380> all<00:04:32.380> right<00:04:32.500> guys<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:32.770> I
