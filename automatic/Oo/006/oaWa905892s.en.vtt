one would expect it's also a little bit

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.910 
one would expect it's also a little bit
more<00:00:35.190> difficult<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.940> would<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.300> would<00:00:36.510> argue

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
more difficult I would I would argue

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.850 
more difficult I would I would argue

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
unlock or I should say wake swipe that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.480 
unlock or I should say wake swipe that
down<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.750> swipe<00:04:51.020> over<00:04:51.260> and<00:04:51.650> that<00:04:52.130> should<00:04:52.370> take

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
down and swipe over and that should take

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.270 
down and swipe over and that should take
me<00:04:52.550> right<00:04:52.850> into<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.090> camera<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:54.070> sure<00:04:55.070> enough

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
me right into the camera and sure enough

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.159 
me right into the camera and sure enough
it<00:04:55.400> does<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:56.000> we<00:04:56.060> can<00:04:56.270> take<00:04:56.539> a<00:04:56.570> picture<00:04:56.930> of<00:04:56.960> my

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
it does and we can take a picture of my

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.070 
it does and we can take a picture of my
beautiful<00:04:57.500> nexus<00:04:58.039> 4<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:59.180> that<00:04:59.270> didn't<00:04:59.630> focus

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
beautiful nexus 4 and that didn't focus

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.870 
beautiful nexus 4 and that didn't focus
but<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.470> still<00:05:00.680> works<00:05:00.889> right<00:05:01.160> so<00:05:01.310> it's<00:05:01.460> quick

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
but it still works right so it's quick

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.700 
but it still works right so it's quick
way<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.090> get<00:05:02.300> into<00:05:02.479> your<00:05:02.600> camera<00:05:02.870> although<00:05:03.440> I

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
way to get into your camera although I

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.589 
way to get into your camera although I
would<00:05:03.949> argue<00:05:04.100> that's<00:05:04.430> not<00:05:04.729> really<00:05:05.210> that<00:05:05.360> fast

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
would argue that's not really that fast

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.600 
would argue that's not really that fast
because<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.020> have<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.199> swipe<00:05:06.410> down<00:05:06.650> here<00:05:07.070> then

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
because you have to swipe down here then

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.270 
because you have to swipe down here then
swipe<00:05:08.000> over<00:05:08.210> now<00:05:08.960> if<00:05:09.229> you<00:05:09.500> didn't<00:05:09.919> want<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:10.220> to

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
swipe over now if you didn't want it to

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.620 
swipe over now if you didn't want it to
that<00:05:10.699> you<00:05:10.940> could<00:05:11.060> just<00:05:11.120> put<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.360> camera

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
that you could just put a camera

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.060 
that you could just put a camera
shortcut<00:05:12.080> like<00:05:12.169> I've<00:05:12.349> done<00:05:12.530> right<00:05:12.680> here<00:05:12.949> and

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
shortcut like I've done right here and

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.350 
shortcut like I've done right here and
so<00:05:13.160> I<00:05:13.190> have<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.400> camera<00:05:13.580> shortcut<00:05:14.060> up<00:05:14.210> and

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
so I have the camera shortcut up and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.390 
so I have the camera shortcut up and
that's<00:05:14.690> much<00:05:14.990> faster<00:05:15.020> so<00:05:15.740> keep<00:05:15.979> that<00:05:16.130> in<00:05:16.190> mind

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
that's much faster so keep that in mind

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.040 
that's much faster so keep that in mind
but<00:05:17.090> that's<00:05:17.210> essentially<00:05:17.539> how<00:05:17.720> do<00:05:17.780> you<00:05:17.870> work

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
but that's essentially how do you work

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.439 
but that's essentially how do you work

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
can actually swipe back up over here in

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.770 
can actually swipe back up over here in
this<00:05:48.770> right<00:05:49.039> sort<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.580> area<00:05:50.240> if<00:05:50.419> write<00:05:50.570> it<00:05:50.690> on

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
this right sort of area if write it on

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.330 
this right sort of area if write it on
the<00:05:50.900> left<00:05:51.110> tube<00:05:51.380> that's<00:05:51.650> just<00:05:51.830> a<00:05:51.949> good<00:05:52.099> way<00:05:52.130> to

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
the left tube that's just a good way to

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.760 
the left tube that's just a good way to
swipe<00:05:53.240> up<00:05:53.419> and<00:05:53.570> hide<00:05:53.750> them<00:05:53.990> if<00:05:54.199> your<00:05:54.530> swipe

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
swipe up and hide them if your swipe

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.649 
swipe up and hide them if your swipe
down<00:05:55.010> you<00:05:55.190> can<00:05:55.310> actually<00:05:55.550> grab<00:05:55.789> the<00:05:56.000> lock<00:05:56.240> icon

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
down you can actually grab the lock icon

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.629 
down you can actually grab the lock icon
and<00:05:57.199> swipe<00:05:57.320> and<00:05:57.620> it'll<00:05:57.770> unlock<00:05:58.039> the<00:05:58.250> phone<00:05:58.430> for

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.010 
and swipe and it'll unlock the phone for
you<00:05:58.729> so<00:05:58.789> you<00:05:58.849> don't<00:05:58.940> have<00:05:59.060> to<00:05:59.360> swipe<00:05:59.599> back<00:05:59.810> up

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
you so you don't have to swipe back up

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.200 
you so you don't have to swipe back up
necessarily<00:06:00.440> to<00:06:00.620> lock<00:06:00.860> your<00:06:01.099> phone<00:06:01.280> or<00:06:01.520> unlock

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
necessarily to lock your phone or unlock

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.909 
necessarily to lock your phone or unlock
so<00:06:02.840> anyway<00:06:03.229> that's<00:06:03.440> just<00:06:03.500> a<00:06:03.620> quick<00:06:03.740> tour

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
so anyway that's just a quick tour

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.409 
so anyway that's just a quick tour
hopefully<00:06:04.460> that<00:06:04.610> explains<00:06:05.060> its<00:06:05.270> when<00:06:05.389> you

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
hopefully that explains its when you

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.120 
hopefully that explains its when you
