00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 and so hello everyone today would like to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.030
 tell about how 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.580
 turn off the computer in time that is 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.620
 Take for example torrents 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.430
 when you download any torrent in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.140
 there is a function where you can 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.560
 put that is on completion 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.689
 download shut down computer yes but no 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.400
 such a function of turning on the computer 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.970
 like when you 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.520
 install the game that is almost all 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.380
 launcher installation ah nusup exe game 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.160
 it says the type of time remaining 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.690
 until about but can not be turned off 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.520
 computer meaning you can't go anywhere 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.980
 leave is you want to leave 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.690
 computer enabled utility that means you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.449
 you will either have to wait and then yourself 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 turn off or leave and it will remain 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.879

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.960
 computer but here more or less in torrents 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.750
 as soon as it turns off and everything that is like 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.280

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.140
 don't guess but you can 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.310

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.310
