much simpler than having to carry like

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.140 
much simpler than having to carry like
blush<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.709> then<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> blush<00:02:58.250> brush<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.970> bunch

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
blush and then a blush brush and a bunch

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.510 
blush and then a blush brush and a bunch
of<00:02:59.270> stuff<00:02:59.600> to<00:03:00.080> look<00:03:00.110> like<00:03:00.410> you're<00:03:00.530> alive<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.489> I

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
of stuff to look like you're alive so I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.630 
of stuff to look like you're alive so I
just<00:03:01.910> apply<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.630> few<00:03:02.989> swipes<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.860> on<00:03:04.130> each

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
just apply a few swipes of this on each

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.699 
just apply a few swipes of this on each
cheek<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.510> blend<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.080> with<00:03:06.110> my<00:03:06.350> fingers

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
cheek and I blend it in with my fingers

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.920 
cheek and I blend it in with my fingers
in<00:03:06.980> my<00:03:07.459> opinion<00:03:07.790> it's<00:03:08.030> just<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:08.450> much<00:03:08.480> faster

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
in my opinion it's just so much faster

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.680 
in my opinion it's just so much faster
and<00:03:09.320> so<00:03:09.890> much<00:03:10.070> easier<00:03:10.550> than<00:03:10.820> carrying<00:03:11.150> blush

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
and so much easier than carrying blush

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.229 
and so much easier than carrying blush
and<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.410> brush<00:03:12.620> already<00:03:13.400> said<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.730> or<00:03:13.910> clean

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
and a brush already said that or clean

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.580

yeah I just carry this because it's a

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.690 
yeah I just carry this because it's a
really<00:04:35.570> good<00:04:35.660> mascara<00:04:36.140> and<00:04:36.410> in<00:04:36.860> my<00:04:37.190> travel<00:04:37.670> bag

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.030 
really good mascara and in my travel bag
I<00:04:38.090> definitely<00:04:38.600> need<00:04:38.870> mascara<00:04:39.290> because<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:39.920> I

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
I definitely need mascara because if I

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.370 
I definitely need mascara because if I
had<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.430> choose<00:04:40.460> one<00:04:41.390> makeup<00:04:41.660> product<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.200> wear

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
had to choose one makeup product to wear

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.290 
had to choose one makeup product to wear
it<00:04:42.680> would<00:04:42.860> probably<00:04:43.070> be<00:04:43.310> mascara<00:04:43.790> and<00:04:44.090> like

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
it would probably be mascara and like

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.390 
it would probably be mascara and like
lip<00:04:44.540> balm<00:04:44.720> because<00:04:45.410> mascara<00:04:45.830> just<00:04:46.040> defines

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
lip balm because mascara just defines

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.010 
lip balm because mascara just defines
your<00:04:46.550> eyes<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:47.030> makes<00:04:47.180> them<00:04:47.360> look<00:04:47.570> way<00:04:47.990> more

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
your eyes and makes them look way more

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.360 
your eyes and makes them look way more
awake<00:04:48.440> if<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.680> don't<00:04:48.830> have<00:04:48.950> time<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.280> do

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
awake if you don't have time to do

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.400 
awake if you don't have time to do
anything<00:04:49.610> else<00:04:49.820> just<00:04:50.240> apply<00:04:50.480> mascara<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:51.110> I'm
