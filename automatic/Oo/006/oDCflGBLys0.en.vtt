00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.149 
to map out this with penguins so people
can<00:01:54.749> actually<00:01:54.869> see<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.380> shot<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> kind<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> know

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
can actually see the shot I kind of know

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.620 
can actually see the shot I kind of know
where<00:01:56.340> penguins<00:01:56.700> are<00:01:56.789> gonna<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.179> at<00:01:57.299> various

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
where penguins are gonna be at various

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
where penguins are gonna be at various
parts<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> frame<00:01:58.289> this<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> where<00:01:59.460> Tom

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
parts of the frame this is where Tom

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.969 
parts of the frame this is where Tom
Bryant<00:02:00.179> my<00:02:00.420> visual<00:02:00.929> effects<00:02:01.259> editor<00:02:01.560> came<00:02:01.740> in

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
Bryant my visual effects editor came in

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
Bryant my visual effects editor came in
and<00:02:02.189> did<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> lot<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.329> did<00:02:03.659> amazing

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and did a lot of that did amazing

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.350 
and did a lot of that did amazing
so<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.530> could<00:02:04.680> visualize<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.340> scenes<00:02:05.640> then

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
so you could visualize the scenes then

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.120 
so you could visualize the scenes then
we<00:02:06.600> turn<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.900> over<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.290> Rhythm<00:02:07.530> &amp;<00:02:07.590> Hues<00:02:07.680> rhythm

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
we turn it over to Rhythm &amp; Hues rhythm

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.940 
we turn it over to Rhythm &amp; Hues rhythm
used<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:08.880> Heath<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.270> Roberts<00:02:09.599> would<00:02:10.140> do

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
used and then Heath of Roberts would do

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.830 
used and then Heath of Roberts would do
blocking<00:02:11.520> animation<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.090> very<00:02:12.270> rough<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:12.780> of

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
blocking animation a very rough kind of

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.020 
blocking animation a very rough kind of
animation<00:02:13.349> where<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.010> show<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.849> enough

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
animation where you show just enough

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.580 
animation where you show just enough
frames<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.510> understand<00:02:15.930> what's<00:02:16.110> happening

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
frames to understand what's happening

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.699 
frames to understand what's happening
the<00:02:16.770> various<00:02:17.069> Penguins<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.700> shot<00:02:18.000> and

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
the various Penguins in the shot and

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.229 
the various Penguins in the shot and
then<00:02:19.709> once<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.130> would<00:02:20.250> prove<00:02:20.520> on<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.910> approve

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
then once you would prove on the approve

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.600 
then once you would prove on the approve
the<00:02:21.420> blocking<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.500> would<00:02:22.620> take<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the blocking you would take it to the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.670 
the blocking you would take it to the
next<00:02:23.880> level<00:02:24.000> which<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.080> kind<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.350> we<00:02:25.470> call

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
next level which is kind of we call

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.820 
next level which is kind of we call
splined<00:02:26.550> full<00:02:27.030> animation<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.560> start<00:02:28.770> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
splined full animation and you start to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.040 
splined full animation and you start to
kind<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.040> kind<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.090> fill<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> blanks<00:02:30.989> of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
kind of kind of fill in the blanks of

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.780 
kind of kind of fill in the blanks of
the<00:02:31.170> animation<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.100> them<00:02:32.280> actually<00:02:32.580> move

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the animation and see them actually move

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.210 
the animation and see them actually move
they<00:02:33.060> still<00:02:33.269> look<00:02:33.390> like<00:02:33.420> cartoon<00:02:33.989> characters

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
they still look like cartoon characters

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.759 
they still look like cartoon characters
but<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.370> are<00:02:35.550> moving<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.180> much<00:02:36.390> more<00:02:36.769> full

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
but they are moving and much more full

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.190 
but they are moving and much more full
fleshed<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.580> way<00:02:38.819> like<00:02:39.150> real<00:02:39.360> penguins<00:02:39.930> might

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
fleshed out way like real penguins might

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.160 
fleshed out way like real penguins might
and<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:41.790> know<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.209> taking<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.630> Captain

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
and you know and then taking of Captain

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.650 
and you know and then taking of Captain
here<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:44.100> know<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.310> on<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.269> top<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.569> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
here you know that on the top of the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.270 
here you know that on the top of the
fountain<00:02:45.870> mark<00:02:46.440> do<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.590> remember<00:02:46.769> we<00:02:47.040> shot<00:02:47.250> a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
fountain mark do you remember we shot a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.370 
fountain mark do you remember we shot a
real<00:02:47.549> penguin<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.810> put<00:02:48.989> them<00:02:49.080> up<00:02:49.200> there

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
real penguin and then put them up there

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.430 
real penguin and then put them up there
and<00:02:49.560> that's<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:50.580> not<00:02:50.760> real<00:02:53.390> where<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.930> we

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and that's that's not real where we we

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.770 
and that's that's not real where we we
render<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.950> penguins<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.610> then<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> ton

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
render the penguins and then do a ton

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.809 
render the penguins and then do a ton
and<00:02:57.989> ton<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.230> lighting<00:02:58.680> work<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.430> make<00:02:59.610> them

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
and ton of lighting work to make them

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.809 
and ton of lighting work to make them
look<00:03:00.060> real<00:03:00.360> into<00:03:00.660> space<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.319> then<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.730> know

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
look real into space and then you know

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.000 
look real into space and then you know
within<00:03:03.180> an<00:03:03.390> animation<00:03:03.810> movie<00:03:04.080> you're<00:03:04.650> able<00:03:04.980> to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
within an animation movie you're able to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.370 
within an animation movie you're able to
then<00:03:05.370> like<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:06.540> nuance<00:03:06.690> work<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.230> make

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
then like do this nuance work to make

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.750 
then like do this nuance work to make
these<00:03:07.560> look<00:03:07.739> like<00:03:07.920> real<00:03:08.100> penguins<00:03:08.549> in<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
these look like real penguins in the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.989 
these look like real penguins in the
space<00:03:09.000> that's<00:03:09.600> complicated
