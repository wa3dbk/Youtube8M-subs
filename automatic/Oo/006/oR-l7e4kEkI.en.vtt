no-frills car everything on a career RS
was<00:01:08.020> an<00:01:08.110> option<00:01:08.500> so<00:01:08.800> really<00:01:09.730> each<00:01:09.850> car<00:01:10.180> is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
was an option so really each car is

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.470 
was an option so really each car is
different<00:01:10.620> my<00:01:11.620> car<00:01:11.950> for<00:01:12.220> instance<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.850> serial

so<00:01:25.869> that<00:01:26.020> gives<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.290> an<00:01:26.410> idea<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.400> number

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
so that gives you an idea of the number

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.180 
so that gives you an idea of the number
of<00:01:28.030> different<00:01:28.450> options<00:01:28.600> there<00:01:29.080> were<00:01:29.260> I<00:01:29.590> think

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
of different options there were I think

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.940 
of different options there were I think
the<00:01:30.310> most<00:01:30.520> expensive<00:01:31.090> option<00:01:31.240> in<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.560> day<00:01:32.740> was

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
the most expensive option in the day was

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.890 
the most expensive option in the day was
air<00:01:33.160> conditioning<00:01:33.790> at<00:01:33.940> about<00:01:34.360> $1,000<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.600> RS

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
air conditioning at about $1,000 the RS

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.020 
air conditioning at about $1,000 the RS
was<00:01:41.140> really<00:01:41.800> popular<00:01:42.009> they<00:01:42.369> set<00:01:42.610> out<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.759> build

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
was really popular they set out to build

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.170 
was really popular they set out to build
500<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:44.170> first<00:01:44.440> series<00:01:44.830> run<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.340> they<00:01:46.000> ended

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
500 in a first series run and they ended

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.540 
500 in a first series run and they ended
up<00:01:46.330> building<00:01:46.570> two<00:01:47.050> more<00:01:47.229> series<00:01:47.650> of<00:01:47.800> 500s

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
up building two more series of 500s

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.320 
up building two more series of 500s
because<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.450> response<00:01:49.840> was<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.410> great

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.760 

the<00:01:54.330> idea<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.810> putting<00:01:55.080> a<00:01:55.230> race<00:01:55.470> car<00:01:55.620> on<00:01:55.650> the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.309 
then you'll say yes people have a great
response<00:03:32.300> because<00:03:32.690> they're<00:03:32.810> not<00:03:32.930> used<00:03:33.200> to

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
response because they're not used to

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.350 
response because they're not used to

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.490 

it<00:03:39.340> really<00:03:39.550> can<00:03:39.970> get<00:03:40.240> away<00:03:40.480> from<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:41.110> rear

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
engine 911 s or that way I mean it's

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.480 
engine 911 s or that way I mean it's
just<00:03:43.600> part<00:03:43.960> of<00:03:44.020> their<00:03:44.110> characteristic<00:03:44.740> but<00:03:44.890> if

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
just part of their characteristic but if

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.950 
just part of their characteristic but if
you<00:03:45.610> know<00:03:45.730> how<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:45.880> drive<00:03:46.150> those<00:03:46.390> cars<00:03:46.660> then
