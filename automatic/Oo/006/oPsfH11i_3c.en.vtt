 of cooking with violet today I will show you 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.270
 how to create a bent equal to the same 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.740
 to that of starbucks so you don't have to 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.750
 travel the world to drink a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.240
 frappuccino if you are passionate about 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.370
 life but powerful with these ingredients 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.290
 do it very well alone at home i 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.590
 passages are very simple and 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.960
 aki ingredients are few and available 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.420
 to stay with competitors for the child e 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.700
 if you like leave a forcing on a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.670
 commentary needed let me know if it 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.380
 sends him a kiss and a hug a 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.820
 all of us get a next video 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.260
 most of them smile but then 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.000
 ingredients to drop a very good 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.100
 cappuccino or are the following 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.040
 then you need a glass of milk 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.880
 a cup of the cherry sugar coffee 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.950
 5 competitive ice as regular 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.519
 frappuccino so nice when mounted 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.070
 and as topping above containing rules 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.650
 that you want the chocolate caramel 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.320
 I don't need the idiots of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.590
 chocolate to put on and more 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 I want a too top flavor of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.390
 suitcases that there is not only coffee and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.430
 I will use sava for garments and then I will put 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.659
 a spoon of vanity inside the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.640
 they therefore manufacture nothing 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.070
 let's start had forgotten before 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.479
 tell you that you also need a blender and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.159
 less powerful because it has to be captured 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.460
 all the ice 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.130
 We start committing the blender 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.000
 milk coffee 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.670
 the spoons of sugar after which if 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 so you also want to add the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 suitcase and then slowly put the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.170
 I make up for it 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.210
 I started screaming 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.850
 if our cappuccino is ready, here it is 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.570
 here and now we must pour it then 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.570
 in the glass 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.640
 so 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.640
 now above we put our mother 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.689
 now let's move on as above 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.790
 we want I put these flakes of 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.859
 chocolate 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.500
 so to decorate a little we put the 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:54.000
 our straw and here is ours 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.189
 cappuccino like starbucks is ready for 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.530

 not just starbucks quatino 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.609
 absolutely nothing changes 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.250
 it takes a few ingredients not 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:08.519
 turn almost nothing off and do it at home 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.949
