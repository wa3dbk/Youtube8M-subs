reflections<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:03.200> things<00:04:06.190> feels<00:04:07.190> nice

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
reflections and things feels nice

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.370 
reflections and things feels nice
buttons<00:04:09.310> buttons<00:04:10.310> do<00:04:10.520> field<00:04:10.790> I<00:04:10.880> say<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:11.420> it

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
buttons buttons do field I say just it

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.449 
buttons buttons do field I say just it
just<00:04:12.410> feels<00:04:12.650> nicer<00:04:14.770> so<00:04:15.770> I<00:04:15.830> put<00:04:16.040> my<00:04:16.130> finger<00:04:16.430> on

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
just feels nicer so I put my finger on

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.710 
just feels nicer so I put my finger on
it<00:04:16.579> but<00:04:16.730> there's<00:04:17.060> no<00:04:17.150> covering<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.690> protect

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
it but there's no covering to protect

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.960 
it but there's no covering to protect
that<00:04:18.170> screens<00:04:18.890> that<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.209> essentially<00:04:21.970> come

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
that screens that is it essentially come

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.000 
that screens that is it essentially come
like<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.210> almost<00:04:23.810> carbon-fiber<00:04:24.500> like<00:04:24.770> that

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
like a almost carbon-fiber like that

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.040 
like a almost carbon-fiber like that
it's<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.220> fingerprint<00:04:25.700> magnet<00:04:25.850> though<00:04:26.210> I<00:04:26.450> think

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
it's a fingerprint magnet though I think

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.620 
it's a fingerprint magnet though I think
that<00:04:27.140> would<00:04:27.230> be<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.320> mark<00:04:27.590> magnet<00:04:28.040> -<00:04:28.510> how<00:04:29.510> are

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
that would be a mark magnet - how are

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:38.920 
that would be a mark magnet - how are
the<00:04:29.720> new<00:04:29.840> buttons<00:04:33.669> yeah<00:04:34.669> they're<00:04:34.940> okay<00:04:37.930> yeah

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
the new buttons yeah they're okay yeah

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.360 
the new buttons yeah they're okay yeah
you<00:04:39.590> know<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.770> kind<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:40.010> works

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
you know it kind of works

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.230 
you know it kind of works
you<00:04:40.790> got<00:04:40.940> your<00:04:41.710> 3d<00:04:42.710> in<00:04:42.919> your<00:04:43.040> volume<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:44.120> the

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
you got your 3d in your volume on the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.620 
you got your 3d in your volume on the
sides<00:04:47.470> they're<00:04:48.470> pretty<00:04:48.680> nice<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:49.480> will<00:04:50.480> say

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
sides they're pretty nice I will say

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.140 
sides they're pretty nice I will say
that<00:04:50.810> 3d<00:04:51.200> is<00:04:51.470> more<00:04:51.919> there's<00:04:52.760> more<00:04:52.820> friction

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
that 3d is more there's more friction

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.500 
that 3d is more there's more friction
than<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.930> volume<00:04:54.260> volumes<00:04:54.730> bit<00:04:55.730> smoother<00:04:56.300> a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
than the volume volumes bit smoother a

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.170 
than the volume volumes bit smoother a
bit<00:04:57.440> looser<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:59.240> buttons<00:04:59.630> feel<00:04:59.750> nice<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.970> just

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
bit looser the buttons feel nice it just

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.000 
bit looser the buttons feel nice it just
feels<00:05:02.360> nicer<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.200> doesn't

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
feels nicer it doesn't

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.140 
feels nicer it doesn't
mmm<00:05:04.910> doesn't<00:05:05.300> wobble<00:05:05.450> as<00:05:05.690> much<00:05:06.669> put<00:05:07.669> your<00:05:07.790> card

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
mmm doesn't wobble as much put your card

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.969 
mmm doesn't wobble as much put your card
in<00:05:08.300> there<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.970> then<00:05:11.090> here's<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.360> stylus

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
in there and then here's the stylus

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.260 
in there and then here's the stylus
don't<00:05:12.979> know<00:05:13.070> about<00:05:13.280> this<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:13.760> think<00:05:13.940> this<00:05:14.090> is

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
don't know about this I think this is

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.850 
don't know about this I think this is
smaller<00:05:16.000> might<00:05:17.000> be<00:05:17.120> -<00:05:17.300> yeah<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.140> feels<00:05:18.290> even

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
smaller might be - yeah it feels even

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.010 
smaller might be - yeah it feels even
too<00:05:18.979> small<00:05:19.010> for<00:05:19.400> me<00:05:19.550> I<00:05:19.790> think<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.479> was<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.660> step

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
too small for me I think that was a step

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.590 
too small for me I think that was a step
in<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:21.229> wrong<00:05:21.350> direction<00:05:21.410> I<00:05:22.100> think<00:05:22.280> the

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
in the wrong direction I think the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.890 
in the wrong direction I think the
longer<00:05:23.600> one<00:05:23.750> would<00:05:23.900> have<00:05:23.960> been<00:05:24.050> nicer<00:05:24.500> but<00:05:24.890> oh

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
longer one would have been nicer but oh

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.270 
longer one would have been nicer but oh
well<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.710> then<00:05:27.830> you've<00:05:27.950> got<00:05:27.979> the<00:05:28.100> power

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
well and then you've got the power

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.780 
well and then you've got the power
button<00:05:28.610> there<00:05:28.760> we'll<00:05:29.660> just<00:05:29.840> switch<00:05:30.410> it<00:05:30.440> on<00:05:30.790> see

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
button there we'll just switch it on see

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:40.380 
button there we'll just switch it on see
what<00:05:31.910> happens<00:05:36.400> there<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:37.460> go<00:05:37.610> so<00:05:37.940> start<00:05:38.270> up

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
what happens there you go so start up

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.360 
what happens there you go so start up
now<00:05:41.390> you<00:05:41.540> got<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.810> do<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:41.960> all<00:05:42.080> by<00:05:42.229> the<00:05:42.290> touch<00:05:42.590> so

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
now you got to do it all by the touch so

weight-wise though I can't tell I touch
this<00:06:24.279> one's<00:06:24.520> lighter<00:06:24.819> a<00:06:25.210> touch<00:06:26.310> and<00:06:27.310> it<00:06:27.400> does

this one's lighter a touch and it does
feel<00:06:27.819> lighter<00:06:28.199> feels<00:06:29.199> quite<00:06:29.409> light<00:06:29.620> for<00:06:30.009> for

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
feel lighter feels quite light for for

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.070 
feel lighter feels quite light for for
its<00:06:30.729> size<00:06:30.939> actually<00:06:31.479> it's<00:06:32.139> just<00:06:32.439> a<00:06:32.620> sweet<00:06:32.949> spot

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
its size actually it's just a sweet spot

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.730 
its size actually it's just a sweet spot
anything<00:06:35.080> lighter<00:06:35.439> and<00:06:35.889> yeah<00:06:36.669> you<00:06:36.969> might<00:06:37.740> drop

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
anything lighter and yeah you might drop

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.399 
anything lighter and yeah you might drop
it<00:06:39.009> but<00:06:39.310> anything<00:06:39.819> heavier<00:06:40.300> or<00:06:40.689> be<00:06:40.840> like<00:06:41.199> this

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
it but anything heavier or be like this

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:42.629 
it but anything heavier or be like this
where<00:06:41.650> you<00:06:41.740> can't<00:06:41.979> really<00:06:42.099> forget<00:06:42.250> that<00:06:42.520> it's

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
where you can't really forget that it's

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:43.290 
where you can't really forget that it's
in<00:06:42.729> your<00:06:42.819> hands

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
in your hands

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.659 
in your hands
I<00:06:43.330> think<00:06:43.750> this<00:06:43.840> would<00:06:43.990> be<00:06:44.080> more<00:06:44.229> comfortable

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
I think this would be more comfortable

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.499 
I think this would be more comfortable
for<00:06:45.669> longer<00:06:46.240> periods<00:06:46.599> of<00:06:46.629> time<00:06:48.120> the<00:06:49.120> edges<00:06:49.389> are

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
for longer periods of time the edges are

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:53.610 
for longer periods of time the edges are
certainly<00:06:49.779> not<00:06:49.930> sharp<00:06:51.029> so<00:06:52.029> that<00:06:52.439> is<00:06:53.439> the

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
certainly not sharp so that is the

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.550 
certainly not sharp so that is the
unboxing<00:06:54.009> of<00:06:54.099> the<00:06:54.159> new<00:06:54.310> Nintendo<00:06:54.639> 3ds<00:06:55.560> I'll

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
unboxing of the new Nintendo 3ds I'll

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.909 
unboxing of the new Nintendo 3ds I'll
just<00:06:56.740> show<00:06:56.919> you<00:06:56.949> them<00:06:57.219> open<00:07:01.080> there<00:07:02.080> you<00:07:02.139> go<00:07:02.319> so

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 
just show you them open there you go so

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.700 
just show you them open there you go so
it<00:07:03.099> gives<00:07:03.249> you<00:07:03.460> kind<00:07:03.610> of<00:07:03.729> it<00:07:04.409> gives<00:07:05.409> you<00:07:05.500> kind

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
it gives you kind of it gives you kind

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.950 
it gives you kind of it gives you kind
of<00:07:05.740> like<00:07:05.889> the<00:07:05.979> differences<00:07:06.460> there<00:07:06.839> we've<00:07:07.839> got

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960

the<00:07:08.050> power<00:07:08.229> button<00:07:08.589> um<00:07:08.740> on<00:07:09.159> the<00:07:09.759> edge<00:07:10.650> stylus

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
the power button um on the edge stylus

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.899 
the power button um on the edge stylus
there<00:07:12.810> you've<00:07:13.810> got<00:07:13.839> these<00:07:13.990> buttons<00:07:14.169> here<00:07:14.909> same

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:15.909 
there you've got these buttons here same

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:17.579 
there you've got these buttons here same
they<00:07:16.479> look<00:07:16.599> a<00:07:16.659> bit<00:07:16.689> further<00:07:16.960> apart<00:07:17.379> though

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:17.589 
they look a bit further apart though

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:21.869 
they look a bit further apart though
you've<00:07:18.279> got<00:07:18.310> this<00:07:18.520> c-stick<00:07:19.419> knob<00:07:20.639> 3ds<00:07:21.639> in<00:07:21.819> the

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 
you've got this c-stick knob 3ds in the

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:24.869 
you've got this c-stick knob 3ds in the
same<00:07:22.029> place<00:07:22.270> but<00:07:23.259> volume<00:07:23.680> is<00:07:23.860> now<00:07:24.009> there<00:07:24.279> and

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 
same place but volume is now there and

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.339 
same place but volume is now there and
the<00:07:25.000> speaker's<00:07:25.419> a<00:07:25.449> little<00:07:25.689> bit<00:07:25.779> different<00:07:26.169> and

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:26.349 
the speaker's a little bit different and

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:28.019 
the speaker's a little bit different and
the<00:07:27.009> sound<00:07:27.250> is<00:07:27.430> I<00:07:27.550> watched<00:07:27.729> a<00:07:27.789> couple<00:07:27.909> of

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:28.029 
the sound is I watched a couple of

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:31.290 
the sound is I watched a couple of
videos<00:07:28.120> sound<00:07:28.629> is<00:07:29.129> definitely<00:07:30.129> louder<00:07:30.460> so<00:07:31.210> if

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
videos sound is definitely louder so if

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.439 
videos sound is definitely louder so if
you<00:07:31.389> thought<00:07:31.629> the<00:07:32.529> old<00:07:32.649> one<00:07:32.860> was<00:07:33.180> quite<00:07:34.180> quiet

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449 
you thought the old one was quite quiet

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.490 
you thought the old one was quite quiet
possible<00:07:35.699> reason<00:07:36.699> to<00:07:36.789> upgrade<00:07:37.149> and<00:07:37.509> the<00:07:38.349> other

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500 
possible reason to upgrade and the other

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.670 
possible reason to upgrade and the other
big<00:07:38.680> reason<00:07:38.889> to<00:07:39.250> upgrade<00:07:39.370> of<00:07:39.669> course<00:07:39.909> is<00:07:40.210> the

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 
big reason to upgrade of course is the

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.510 
big reason to upgrade of course is the
camera<00:07:41.680> and<00:07:42.580> that<00:07:43.569> moves<00:07:43.919> with<00:07:44.919> your<00:07:45.039> face<00:07:45.250> and

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 
camera and that moves with your face and

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.079 
camera and that moves with your face and
things<00:07:45.729> so<00:07:46.089> yeah<00:07:46.949> really<00:07:47.949> chopped<00:07:48.339> so<00:07:48.729> I<00:07:49.000> think

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:49.089 
things so yeah really chopped so I think

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:51.029 
things so yeah really chopped so I think
what<00:07:49.810> I'll<00:07:49.870> do<00:07:49.960> is<00:07:49.990> are<00:07:50.199> this<00:07:50.500> is<00:07:50.649> kind<00:07:50.860> of<00:07:50.919> like

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 
what I'll do is are this is kind of like

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:52.740 
what I'll do is are this is kind of like
the<00:07:51.159> unboxing<00:07:51.520> and<00:07:51.639> first<00:07:52.539> initial

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 
impressions which are good I think I'll

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.600 
impressions which are good I think I'll
do<00:07:55.509> a<00:07:55.539> separate<00:07:55.870> video<00:07:55.960> well<00:07:56.319> just<00:07:56.649> do<00:07:57.430> a<00:07:57.460> few
