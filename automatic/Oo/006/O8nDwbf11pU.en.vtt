00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.060
The Sun.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:11.810
It provides warmth and light to everyone on
the planet, but could also be the source of

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.760
significant problems in our increasingly wired
world.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.060
When they're strong enough, solar eruptions
like these have the capability of damaging

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.449
electronics and causing electricity and communications
outages on Earth.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.199
To better understand what's going on, NASA
on Thursday evening launched a new solar telescope.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.910
IRIS, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph,
was put into orbit by a rocket dropped from

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.660
an aircraft above the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.940
It promises to provide the most detailed view
yet of the Sun's lower atmosphere.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.650
This region exhibits an unusual effect: temperatures
are believed to be around 6,000 Kelvin near

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.860
the Sun's surface and heat up to around a
million Kelvin at the top of the region.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.100
That's different to our conventional experience
with heat sources, where temperatures rise

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.610
as the source is approached.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.800
It's a mystery for scientists.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.059
Alan Title, IRIS principal investigation at
Lockheed Martin

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.600
"The instruments that looked at this region
in the past have had about 20 times poorer

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:23.990
resolution spatially and about 20 times poorer
resolution spectrally.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:38.549
Basically, we've been looking at things that
happened so fast, that data taken as slowly

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.999
as previous instruments has done hasn't given
us any information."

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.939
Data from the spacecraft will be received
and analyzed here at NASA's Ames Research

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.389
Center in Mountain View in the heart of Silicon
Valley.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:57.719
Ames is home to Pleiades, currently the 19th
most powerful supercomputer on the planet.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.439
"There's not been a push to look at this region
because the atomic physics in this region

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.110
is very, very, very complicated."

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.940
As ever more sensitive electronics are used
around the world, study of the effects of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.170
the Sun on Earth are becoming more pressing.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.590
A recent study by Lloyd's of London said between
20 million and 40 million people in the U.S.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.310
are at risk of being without power for between
two weeks and two years should a violent solar

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.560
storm hit.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.880
The country is particularly at risk because
of its aging power grid.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.210
Pete Worden, director of NASA's Ames Research
Center

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.460
"We believe that some, maybe a lot of power
outages, actually have a lot to do with solar

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.460
activity.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.520
So the better we can understand the physics
going on, the better we can understand the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.180
activity, the better we can potentially predict
and mitigate these problems."
