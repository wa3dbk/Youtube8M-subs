tomorrow's<00:00:58.829> probably<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.510> caveat<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> best<00:01:01.170> in

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
tomorrow's probably but caveat I best in

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
tomorrow's probably but caveat I best in
Melbourne<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.949> spring<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.520> feel<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.030> don't

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
Melbourne this spring I feel I don't

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.850 
Melbourne this spring I feel I don't
think<00:01:03.690> she<00:01:03.780> could<00:01:03.930> go<00:01:04.049> any<00:01:04.229> faster<00:01:04.710> she

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
think she could go any faster she

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.020 
think she could go any faster she
probably<00:01:05.040> travel<00:01:05.369> back<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.519> time<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.939> she

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
probably travel back in time if she

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.160 
probably travel back in time if she
weren't<00:01:06.150> any<00:01:06.299> quicker<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.610> she's<00:01:08.610> uh<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.510> think

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
weren't any quicker so she's uh I think

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
weren't any quicker so she's uh I think
we<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.409> sent<00:01:10.710> her<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> best<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.490> think

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we have sent her the best but I think

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.270 
we have sent her the best but I think
she<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.740> furnish<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.979> she's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
she was just going to furnish and she's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
she was just going to furnish and she's
smitten<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:15.119> better<00:01:15.540> most<00:01:16.290> mature<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.450> as<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
smitten now better most mature so as a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100 
smitten now better most mature so as a
result<00:01:20.240> she's<00:01:21.240> got<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.659> or<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> little

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
result she's got over or a little

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.770 
result she's got over or a little
niglets<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.830> stuff<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.549> she's

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
niglets and stuff like that but she's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.270 
niglets and stuff like that but she's
she's<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> hundred<00:01:25.229> percent<00:01:25.290> grown<00:01:25.710> up<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
um any mature so we might I don't think

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.359 
um any mature so we might I don't think
I<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.409> even<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> break<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.159> clock
