00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.689 
to kind of see if you can see this on
camera<00:00:48.329> or<00:00:48.570> not<00:00:48.829> probably<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:53.280> cockpit

of<00:01:15.689> sit<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.439> really<00:01:17.159> well<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:19.189> don't<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
of sit in a really well I don't like a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.679 
of sit in a really well I don't like a
Batman<00:01:20.850> properly<00:01:21.299> seated<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.810> all<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> way

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.090 

but<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.869> Robins<00:01:28.470> legs

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
but you have Robins legs

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
but you have Robins legs
they<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:29.939> didn't<00:01:30.210> make<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> cockpit<00:01:30.869> wide

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
they just didn't make the cockpit wide

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.600 
they just didn't make the cockpit wide
enough<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.430> cycle<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.250> he<00:01:35.369> will

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
enough because of the cycle so he will

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.010 
enough because of the cycle so he will
sit<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:38.240> place<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.750> little<00:01:40.140> crooked

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
sit in place it's a little crooked

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.630 
sit in place it's a little crooked
and<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.170> had<00:01:43.290> Batman<00:01:43.530> strapped<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.520> there

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and if I had Batman strapped in there

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:53.520 
and if I had Batman strapped in there
you<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:49.820> playing<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.119> there

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.270 

Nightwing<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.680> kind<00:01:54.830> of<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.950> same<00:01:55.100> way

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
Nightwing is kind of the same way

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.760 
Nightwing is kind of the same way
although<00:01:55.540> Robin<00:01:56.540> this<00:01:57.020> cockpit<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:57.560> much

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
although Robin this cockpit is much

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.230 
although Robin this cockpit is much
whiter<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.840> get<00:02:02.990> Batman<00:02:03.860> out<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.280> here

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
whiter so to get Batman out of here

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.080 
whiter so to get Batman out of here
pretty<00:02:05.690> much<00:02:06.070> even<00:02:07.070> any<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.400> figures<00:02:07.790> will

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
pretty much even any of the figures will

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.690 
pretty much even any of the figures will
be<00:02:08.180> able<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.390> slide<00:02:08.630> down<00:02:08.960> inside<00:02:09.700> this

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
be able to slide down inside this

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.290 
be able to slide down inside this
cockpit<00:02:11.270> as<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:11.840> completely<00:02:12.350> open<00:02:13.300> down

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
cockpit as it's completely open down

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.820 
cockpit as it's completely open down
through<00:02:14.540> here<00:02:17.140> there's<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:18.200> with<00:02:18.440> Robins

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
through here there's just with Robins

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.120 
through here there's just with Robins
cycle<00:02:23.710> as<00:02:24.710> that<00:02:25.100> just<00:02:25.280> completely<00:02:25.700> came<00:02:25.970> off

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
cycle as that just completely came off

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.100 
cycle as that just completely came off
so<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.220> can<00:02:28.370> see<00:02:28.490> there<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.850> little<00:02:29.540> bit<00:02:29.900> of

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
so you can see there is a little bit of

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.480 
so you can see there is a little bit of
a<00:02:31.900> manufacturing<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.710> kind<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:33.980> see<00:02:34.130> Robins

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
a manufacturing to kind of see Robins

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.530 
a manufacturing to kind of see Robins
legs<00:02:34.790> were<00:02:34.940> really<00:02:35.240> squeezed<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:35.990> tight<00:02:36.260> there

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.790 

one<00:02:41.540> called<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.840> defect<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:42.590> think<00:02:42.740> it

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
one called a defect I just think it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.520 
one called a defect I just think it
wasn't<00:02:43.040> enough<00:02:43.190> foresight<00:02:43.730> when<00:02:44.270> they<00:02:44.420> were

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
wasn't enough foresight when they were

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.520 
wasn't enough foresight when they were
building<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:46.870> I'm<00:02:47.870> trying<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.260> put<00:02:48.410> this

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
building this I'm trying to put this

00:02:48.530 --> 00:03:00.660 
building this I'm trying to put this
back<00:02:48.980> together<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:58.760> we<00:02:58.880> go

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
back together there we go

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.640 
back together there we go
but<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:04.489> for<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.700> most<00:03:04.850> part<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.650> now

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
but that for the most part is that now

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.930 
but that for the most part is that now
there<00:03:06.800> were<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.890> couple<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.280> reasons<00:03:07.400> why<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.700> got

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
there were a couple of reasons why I got

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.770 
there were a couple of reasons why I got
this<00:03:08.060> Batmobile

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
this Batmobile

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.530 
this Batmobile
one<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.410> thought<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.709> was<00:03:09.830> very<00:03:10.070> cool<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.580> have

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
one I thought it was very cool to have

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.580 
one I thought it was very cool to have
for<00:03:12.470> my<00:03:12.590> figures<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.040> stand<00:03:13.280> by<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:17.560> got<00:03:18.560> a

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
Animated Series also this one's really

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.480 
Animated Series also this one's really
kind<00:05:57.110> of<00:05:57.169> dusty<00:05:57.529> and<00:05:57.710> this<00:05:58.069> is<00:05:58.159> my<00:05:58.279> little

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
kind of dusty and this is my little

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.429 
kind of dusty and this is my little
front<00:05:58.669> piece<00:05:58.819> here<00:05:59.029> but<00:05:59.930> kind<00:06:00.110> of<00:06:00.139> give<00:06:00.259> you<00:06:00.349> a

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:00.439 
front piece here but kind of give you a

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:05.399 
front piece here but kind of give you a
size<00:06:00.830> comparison<00:06:00.860> of<00:06:01.729> the<00:06:01.849> two<00:06:03.069> Batmobiles

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
size comparison of the two Batmobiles

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:15.490 
size comparison of the two Batmobiles
and<00:06:07.719> significantly<00:06:14.199> actually<00:06:15.199> I<00:06:15.229> wouldn't

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
and significantly actually I wouldn't

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.110 
and significantly actually I wouldn't
say<00:06:15.650> significally<00:06:16.069> they're<00:06:16.279> both<00:06:16.610> very<00:06:17.029> much

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
say significally they're both very much

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.450 
say significally they're both very much
in<00:06:17.569> the<00:06:17.629> same<00:06:17.839> scale<00:06:18.139> the<00:06:18.889> Batman<00:06:19.190> animated

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
in the same scale the Batman animated

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.629 
in the same scale the Batman animated
series<00:06:20.229> Batmobile<00:06:21.229> is<00:06:21.529> roughly<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.400> same

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
series Batmobile is roughly the same

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.629 
series Batmobile is roughly the same
length<00:06:23.029> so<00:06:23.979> lengthwise<00:06:24.979> they're<00:06:25.339> pretty

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
length so lengthwise they're pretty

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.999 
length so lengthwise they're pretty
close<00:06:25.819> as<00:06:26.509> you<00:06:26.719> can<00:06:26.870> tell<00:06:27.050> from<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.349> front

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:36.640 

obviously<00:06:32.889> very<00:06:33.889> much<00:06:34.069> wider<00:06:34.930> in<00:06:35.930> this<00:06:36.379> piece

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
obviously very much wider in this piece

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.980 
obviously very much wider in this piece
back<00:06:36.889> here<00:06:37.189> I<00:06:37.219> doubt<00:06:37.699> I<00:06:37.939> will<00:06:38.000> keep<00:06:38.300> on<00:06:38.569> is<00:06:38.839> it

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
back here I doubt I will keep on is it

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.399 
back here I doubt I will keep on is it
looks<00:06:39.469> a<00:06:39.620> little<00:06:39.740> funny<00:06:40.009> I<00:06:40.129> get<00:06:40.909> why<00:06:41.409> they

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 
looks a little funny I get why they

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:48.790 
looks a little funny I get why they
would<00:06:42.560> have<00:06:42.740> it<00:06:45.759> on<00:06:46.759> there<00:06:47.300> but<00:06:47.800> traditionally

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
would have it on there but traditionally

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.480 
would have it on there but traditionally
there<00:06:48.979> is<00:06:49.189> no<00:06:49.930> back<00:06:50.930> wingspan<00:06:52.750> as<00:06:53.889> I<00:06:54.889> did<00:06:55.159> drop

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
there is no back wingspan as I did drop

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.019 
there is no back wingspan as I did drop
the<00:06:55.550> piece<00:06:57.279> now<00:06:58.279> that<00:06:58.490> I'm<00:06:58.580> looking<00:06:58.729> on<00:06:59.000> the

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.029 
the piece now that I'm looking on the

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.490 
the piece now that I'm looking on the
ground<00:06:59.120> trying<00:06:59.629> to<00:06:59.719> find<00:06:59.930> my<00:07:00.110> other<00:07:00.259> little

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
ground trying to find my other little

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.260 
ground trying to find my other little
piece<00:07:00.680> I<00:07:00.919> can't<00:07:01.460> find<00:07:01.610> it<00:07:01.729> but<00:07:01.819> the<00:07:01.939> piece<00:07:02.089> that

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
piece I can't find it but the piece that

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.629 
piece I can't find it but the piece that
does<00:07:02.389> fit<00:07:02.599> around<00:07:02.810> here<00:07:02.990> does<00:07:03.229> fit<00:07:03.529> around<00:07:04.339> the

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 
does fit around here does fit around the

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.730 
does fit around here does fit around the
figures<00:07:05.029> so<00:07:05.719> they<00:07:05.930> would<00:07:06.050> kind<00:07:06.169> of<00:07:06.289> be<00:07:06.379> looking

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
figures so they would kind of be looking

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.879 
figures so they would kind of be looking
you<00:07:06.949> know<00:07:07.759> like<00:07:08.029> that<00:07:08.300> which<00:07:09.289> I'm<00:07:09.439> sure<00:07:09.620> it's

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:09.889 
you know like that which I'm sure it's

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:11.800 
you know like that which I'm sure it's
on<00:07:10.039> the<00:07:10.159> floor<00:07:10.400> with<00:07:10.580> all<00:07:10.729> the<00:07:10.879> cardboard<00:07:11.210> and

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
on the floor with all the cardboard and

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.949 
on the floor with all the cardboard and
everything<00:07:12.229> else<00:07:12.940> but<00:07:13.940> there<00:07:14.810> you<00:07:14.930> go

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:14.959 
everything else but there you go

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:17.649 
everything else but there you go
hopefully<00:07:15.620> this<00:07:15.889> review<00:07:16.180> went<00:07:17.180> a<00:07:17.270> little<00:07:17.389> long

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:17.659 
hopefully this review went a little long

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:19.060 
hopefully this review went a little long
as<00:07:17.839> I'm<00:07:17.930> trying<00:07:18.259> to<00:07:18.500> pee

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
as I'm trying to pee

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.280 
as I'm trying to pee
everything<00:07:19.670> together<00:07:19.820> but<00:07:20.780> there<00:07:20.960> is<00:07:21.110> the

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.290 
everything together but there is the

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:29.110 
everything together but there is the
2003<00:07:24.490> Batman<00:07:25.490> Batmobile<00:07:26.240> from<00:07:26.390> Mattel<00:07:28.120> as

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 
2003 Batman Batmobile from Mattel as

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.540 
2003 Batman Batmobile from Mattel as
most<00:07:29.450> of<00:07:29.630> us<00:07:29.720> know<00:07:30.020> that<00:07:30.050> these<00:07:30.860> figures<00:07:31.160> this

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
most of us know that these figures this

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.690 
most of us know that these figures this
Batman<00:07:32.060> line<00:07:32.650> was<00:07:33.650> a<00:07:33.680> precursor<00:07:34.220> to<00:07:34.670> the<00:07:35.240> DC

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:36.700 
Batman line was a precursor to the DC

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.460 
Batman line was a precursor to the DC
superheroes<00:07:37.700> line<00:07:37.940> which<00:07:38.180> these<00:07:38.780> two<00:07:39.080> were<00:07:39.260> in

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470 
superheroes line which these two were in

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.710 
superheroes line which these two were in
some<00:07:39.770> of<00:07:39.830> the<00:07:39.890> initial<00:07:39.950> waves<00:07:40.430> and<00:07:40.820> then<00:07:41.450> that

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 
some of the initial waves and then that

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.410 
some of the initial waves and then that
turned<00:07:42.050> into<00:07:44.050> this<00:07:45.050> Batman<00:07:45.550> so<00:07:46.550> there<00:07:47.180> you<00:07:47.270> go

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:47.420 
turned into this Batman so there you go

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.880 
turned into this Batman so there you go
as<00:07:47.660> they<00:07:47.810> faint<00:07:48.110> from<00:07:48.490> seeing<00:07:49.490> another<00:07:50.060> Batman

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:50.890 
as they faint from seeing another Batman

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.850 
as they faint from seeing another Batman
but<00:07:51.890> anyway<00:07:52.220> hopefully<00:07:53.090> this<00:07:53.870> you<00:07:54.620> know<00:07:54.740> what

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:54.860 
but anyway hopefully this you know what

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.020 
but anyway hopefully this you know what
Batman<00:07:55.160> or<00:07:55.250> Robin<00:07:55.280> they<00:07:55.580> don't<00:07:55.730> want<00:07:55.850> to<00:07:55.910> stand

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.030 
Batman or Robin they don't want to stand

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.100 
Batman or Robin they don't want to stand
next<00:07:56.150> to<00:07:56.270> the<00:07:56.390> Batmobile<00:07:56.570> so<00:07:56.900> they're<00:07:57.020> not

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.110 
next to the Batmobile so they're not

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.500 
next to the Batmobile so they're not
going<00:07:57.320> to<00:07:57.500> so<00:07:58.160> hopefully<00:07:58.430> this<00:07:59.120> review<00:07:59.270> is

00:07:59.500 --> 00:07:59.510
