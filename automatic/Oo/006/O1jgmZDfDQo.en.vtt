vertical here and what we're going to do
if<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:17.150> when<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.529> my<00:00:19.529> whole<00:00:19.949> my<00:00:20.189> blade<00:00:20.580> up<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
if this when I my whole my blade up to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.660 
if this when I my whole my blade up to
the<00:00:21.210> roof<00:00:21.539> right<00:00:21.810> here<00:00:22.220> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> line

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the roof right here this is the line

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.269 
the roof right here this is the line
here<00:00:24.090> there's<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.750> lot<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.170> light<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:26.130> on

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
here there's a lot of light on on on

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550 
here there's a lot of light on on on
this<00:00:26.400> side<00:00:26.480> when<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.570> put<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.869> over<00:00:28.109> here

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
this side when you put it over here

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.950 
this side when you put it over here
there's<00:00:29.070> not<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.519> much<00:00:29.699> light<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.660> what

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
there's not that much light so what

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.990 
there's not that much light so what
probably<00:00:31.320> happened<00:00:31.769> was<00:00:31.830> when<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.279> when

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
probably happened was when they when

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.119 
probably happened was when they when
they<00:00:33.149> first<00:00:33.390> paint<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.880> this<00:00:35.880> piece<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:37.380> was

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the rough end and then they probably put

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.709 
the rough end and then they probably put
the<00:00:40.590> recessed<00:00:41.160> piece<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.570> there's

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the recessed piece right here so there's

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.440 
the recessed piece right here so there's
a<00:00:42.870> lot<00:00:42.899> more<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.160> concave<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.149> the

turn it upside down here like that I'm
going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> lie<00:02:00.649> since<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.830> line<00:02:02.039> is<00:02:02.280> here

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
going to lie since the line is here

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.490 
going to lie since the line is here
right<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.869> going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> fit<00:02:04.350> her

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
right here this is going to fit her

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.010
