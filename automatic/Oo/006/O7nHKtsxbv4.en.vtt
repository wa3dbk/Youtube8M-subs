quality of the gear that was the main
thing<00:01:28.940> for<00:01:29.000> me<00:01:29.210> I've<00:01:29.390> had<00:01:29.600> inexpensive

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
thing for me I've had inexpensive

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.320 
thing for me I've had inexpensive
bicycles<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.070> had<00:01:31.220> inexpensive<00:01:31.820> bicycles

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
bicycles and had inexpensive bicycles

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.510 
bicycles and had inexpensive bicycles
for<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.630> kids<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.650> always<00:01:33.979> seems<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.430> be

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
for the kids and it always seems to be

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.800 
for the kids and it always seems to be
the<00:01:34.729> gears<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.090> they<00:01:35.330> have<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.600> problem

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
the gears that they have the problem

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.520 
the gears that they have the problem
with<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.470> chain<00:01:37.130> slips<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.270> teeth<00:01:38.690> do<00:01:39.229> weird

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
with the chain slips the teeth do weird

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.020 
with the chain slips the teeth do weird
thing<00:01:39.920> if<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:40.310> spend<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.670> little<00:01:40.700> more<00:01:40.970> money

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
thing if you spend a little more money

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.120 
thing if you spend a little more money
you'll<00:01:41.780> get<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:41.990> bike<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:42.590> doesn't<00:01:42.619> frustrate

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
you'll get a bike that doesn't frustrate

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.100 
you'll get a bike that doesn't frustrate
you<00:01:43.610> with<00:01:43.760> all<00:01:43.850> mechanical<00:01:44.420> problems<00:01:44.869> and

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
you with all mechanical problems and

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.630 
you with all mechanical problems and
you'll<00:01:45.260> be<00:01:45.409> more<00:01:45.590> inclined<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.040> ride<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.460> and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
you'll be more inclined to ride it and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.890 
you'll be more inclined to ride it and
not<00:01:46.790> just<00:01:47.000> stick<00:01:47.210> in<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.420> corner<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.810> the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
not just stick in the corner of the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.450 
not just stick in the corner of the
garage<00:01:48.020> now<00:01:48.650> you're<00:01:48.799> definitely<00:01:49.070> going<00:01:49.369> to

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
garage now you're definitely going to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.399 
garage now you're definitely going to
want<00:01:49.549> some<00:01:49.909> gears<00:01:50.240> on<00:01:50.479> your<00:01:50.630> bicycle<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.320> you

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
want some gears on your bicycle so you

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.740 
want some gears on your bicycle so you
are<00:01:51.560> going<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.979> need<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.939> derailleur<00:01:53.510> and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
are going to need the derailleur and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.210 
are going to need the derailleur and
that<00:01:53.930> does<00:01:54.110> involve<00:01:54.380> some<00:01:54.710> mechanical

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
that does involve some mechanical

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.670 
that does involve some mechanical
complexity<00:01:55.759> but<00:01:56.000> riding<00:01:56.180> around<00:01:56.540> a<00:01:56.840> single

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
complexity but riding around a single

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.160 
complexity but riding around a single
speed<00:01:58.130> bike<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.700> chore<00:01:59.150> on<00:01:59.180> even<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.840> small

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
speed bike is a chore on even a small

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.230 
speed bike is a chore on even a small
hill<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:00.890> have<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.159> seven-speed<00:02:01.909> on<00:02:02.090> my

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
hill and I have a seven-speed on my

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.030 
hill and I have a seven-speed on my
bicycle<00:02:02.630> but<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:03.110> would<00:02:03.470> say<00:02:03.650> of<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:04.009> I

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
bicycle but I would say of that I

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.190 
bicycle but I would say of that I
probably<00:02:04.549> only<00:02:04.939> use<00:02:05.090> about<00:02:05.450> three<00:02:05.689> or<00:02:05.840> four<00:02:06.080> of

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
probably only use about three or four of

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.020 
probably only use about three or four of
the<00:02:06.290> gears<00:02:06.590> here's<00:02:07.070> my<00:02:07.220> daughter's<00:02:07.549> bicycle

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the gears here's my daughter's bicycle

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.609 
the gears here's my daughter's bicycle
as<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.360> can<00:02:08.540> see<00:02:08.720> there's<00:02:08.989> all<00:02:09.079> kinds<00:02:09.530> of

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
as you can see there's all kinds of

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.590 
as you can see there's all kinds of
hardware<00:02:10.070> down<00:02:10.280> there<00:02:10.549> for<00:02:10.790> shifting<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.420> is

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
hardware down there for shifting this is

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.539 
hardware down there for shifting this is
an<00:02:11.720> 18-speed<00:02:12.140> so<00:02:12.829> it<00:02:12.920> needs<00:02:13.100> an<00:02:13.250> extra

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
an 18-speed so it needs an extra

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.310 
an 18-speed so it needs an extra
derailleur<00:02:14.090> which<00:02:14.269> means<00:02:14.930> there's<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.170> lot

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
derailleur which means there's a lot

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.410 
derailleur which means there's a lot
more<00:02:15.470> stuff<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.890> go<00:02:16.010> wrong<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:16.610> also<00:02:16.790> much

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
more stuff to go wrong it's also much

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.120 
more stuff to go wrong it's also much
less<00:02:17.660> expensive<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:18.470> it's<00:02:18.590> much<00:02:18.739> more<00:02:18.920> likely

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
less expensive so it's much more likely

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.880 
less expensive so it's much more likely
to<00:02:19.370> have<00:02:19.489> problems<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.750> as<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.019> 18<00:02:21.410> years<00:02:21.680> it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
to have problems and as the 18 years it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.650 
to have problems and as the 18 years it
has<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.130> would<00:02:22.549> say<00:02:22.730> she<00:02:23.000> pretty<00:02:23.209> much<00:02:23.329> only

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
has I would say she pretty much only

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.410 
has I would say she pretty much only

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.660 
uses three and the trek pure model
bicycle<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.110> uses<00:02:27.680> what's<00:02:27.860> called<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.310> pedal

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
bicycle it uses what's called a pedal

bicycle it uses what's called a pedal
forward<00:02:29.090> design<00:02:29.660> makes<00:02:30.320> it<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> lot<00:02:30.590> easier<00:02:30.650> on

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
forward design makes it a lot easier on

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.979 
forward design makes it a lot easier on
the<00:02:31.250> knees<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.790> easier<00:02:32.269> on<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.480> back<00:02:32.600> let<00:02:32.959> me

the knees and easier on the back let me

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:49.920 
the knees and easier on the back let me
ride<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.380> around<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.680> little<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:33.919> show<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.360 

not<00:02:50.930> more<00:02:51.109> comfortable<00:02:51.590> than<00:02:51.769> being<00:02:51.799> hunched

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
not more comfortable than being hunched

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.039 
not more comfortable than being hunched
over<00:02:52.549> with<00:02:52.909> your<00:02:53.090> knees<00:02:53.239> up<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:53.629> your<00:02:53.750> chest

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
over with your knees up in your chest

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.599 
over with your knees up in your chest
and<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:54.409> look<00:02:54.650> at<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:54.799> white<00:02:55.129> strikes<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
and just look at that white strikes the

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:21.780 
and just look at that white strikes the
whole<00:02:55.730> time

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.979 

I'm<00:03:22.790> not<00:03:22.970> in<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.120> hurry<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.330> get<00:03:23.480> anywhere<00:03:23.780> so

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
I'm not in a hurry to get anywhere so

I'm not in a hurry to get anywhere so
that's<00:03:24.170> my<00:03:24.349> bicycling<00:03:24.920> story<00:03:25.280> I've<00:03:25.610> really

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
that's my bicycling story I've really

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.089 
that's my bicycling story I've really
enjoyed<00:03:25.970> my<00:03:26.569> Trek<00:03:26.959> pure<00:03:27.319> bike<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.769> got<00:03:27.799> it<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.069> few

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
enjoyed my Trek pure bike I got it a few

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.580 
enjoyed my Trek pure bike I got it a few
months<00:03:28.549> ago<00:03:28.640> after<00:03:28.970> much<00:03:29.299> research<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.470> was

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
months ago after much research and I was

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.229 
months ago after much research and I was
just<00:03:30.799> looking<00:03:31.159> to<00:03:31.250> put<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.459> link<00:03:31.700> down<00:03:31.849> below

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
just looking to put a link down below
