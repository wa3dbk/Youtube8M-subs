00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
breakers so most important thing is i

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.039

perfectly<00:03:14.930> there<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.049> go<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.409> that's<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.859> three

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
perfectly there you go so that's a three

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.640 
perfectly there you go so that's a three
story<00:03:17.760> then<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.389> was<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.599> pretty<00:03:18.780> easy<00:03:19.019> basin<00:03:19.500> I

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
story then it was a pretty easy basin I

story then it was a pretty easy basin I
think<00:03:19.919> you'd<00:03:20.099> be<00:03:20.489> able<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.790> do<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.120> start

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
think you'd be able to do to start

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.229 
think you'd be able to do to start
pretty<00:03:21.660> easy<00:03:21.900> with<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:26.549> I'm<00:03:26.669> back<00:03:26.879> again<00:03:26.910> this
