so strangely if it wasn't finest for
modern<00:01:27.400> junks<00:01:27.700> we<00:01:27.790> don't<00:01:27.940> usually<00:01:28.030> fine<00:01:28.360> we'd

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
modern junks we don't usually fine we'd

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.450 
modern junks we don't usually fine we'd
obviously<00:01:28.960> go<00:01:29.290> on<00:01:29.409> places<00:01:29.799> where<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:30.040> people

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
obviously go on places where this people

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.270 
obviously go on places where this people
been<00:01:30.640> recently<00:01:31.290> bought<00:01:32.290> anyway<00:01:32.680> expendable

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
been recently bought anyway expendable

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.740 
been recently bought anyway expendable
again<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:33.940> can<00:01:34.120> get<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> bit<00:01:34.390> more<00:01:34.510> money

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
again so you can get a bit more money

again so you can get a bit more money
out<00:01:34.930> this<00:01:35.440> signal<00:01:35.830> will<00:01:35.950> not<00:01:35.979> have<00:01:36.130> even<00:01:36.340> much

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
out this signal will not have even much

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.100 
out this signal will not have even much
look<00:01:36.850> today<00:01:37.090> because<00:01:37.299> it's<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.540> great<00:01:37.810> so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.590 
it's a mystery that one but it was very
date<00:02:03.200> about<00:02:03.920> 910<00:02:04.610> inches<00:02:04.940> deep<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.360> must<00:02:05.510> be

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
date about 910 inches deep so it must be

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.260 
date about 910 inches deep so it must be
quite<00:02:05.750> old<00:02:06.110> but<00:02:06.850> we'll<00:02:07.850> try<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.119> get<00:02:08.179> it

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
quite old but we'll try and get it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.410 
quite old but we'll try and get it
cleaned<00:02:08.509> up<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.869> train<00:02:09.140> there<00:02:09.850> see<00:02:10.850> wait<00:02:11.060> see

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
cleaned up and train there see wait see

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.770 
cleaned up and train there see wait see
what<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:11.660> ends<00:02:11.840> up<00:02:11.900> past<00:02:12.140> it's<00:02:12.380> got<00:02:12.530> this<00:02:13.780> right

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
what it ends up past it's got this right

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.630 
what it ends up past it's got this right
out<00:02:15.050> are<00:02:15.200> down<00:02:15.380> there<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:15.890> about<00:02:16.040> good<00:02:16.340> 10

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
out are down there it's about good 10

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.390 
out are down there it's about good 10
inches<00:02:17.000> D<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:18.230> like<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.380> big<00:02:18.650> lump<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:19.040> ler<00:02:19.190> to

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
inches D it's like a big lump of ler to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.360 
inches D it's like a big lump of ler to
but<00:02:19.550> I'm<00:02:19.640> hoping<00:02:20.090> just<00:02:20.330> bounce<00:02:20.720> from<00:02:20.840> it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
but I'm hoping just bounce from it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.010 
but I'm hoping just bounce from it
I'm<00:02:22.370> hoping<00:02:22.730> it's<00:02:23.030> got<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> hole<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> middle

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
I'm hoping it's got a hole in the middle

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.300 
I'm hoping it's got a hole in the middle
if<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.440> has<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.860> it's<00:02:24.980> possibly<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.430> loom<00:02:25.670> wet

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
if it has and it's possibly a loom wet

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.720 
if it has and it's possibly a loom wet
and<00:02:29.170> by<00:02:30.170> June<00:02:30.230> boy<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:30.830> got<00:02:31.010> off<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.340> appears

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
and by June boy it's got off it appears

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.280 
and by June boy it's got off it appears
to<00:02:31.910> yet<00:02:32.090> meets<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> piers<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.750> have<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.900> hole<00:02:33.110> in

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
to yet meets the piers to have a hole in

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.009 
to yet meets the piers to have a hole in
the<00:02:33.380> middle<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:37.390> possibly<00:02:38.390> mean<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.840> said

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
the middle of it possibly mean it said

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.930 
the middle of it possibly mean it said
