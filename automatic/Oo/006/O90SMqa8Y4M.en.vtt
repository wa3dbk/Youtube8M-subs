00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.790
 Welcome to this skins tutorial 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.370
 specifically the lol 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.889
 Well, what is this program going to do? 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.889
 program will allow us to get 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.200
 any skin of the original game is worth 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.650
 are not the custom ones that I put in 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.790
 another video or nothing are the originals 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.550
 we have to do it we are not going to this 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.779
 page we will put in the description 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.849
 we will register here register and 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.610
 we download them when we have 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.309
 downloaded we will get this file worth 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.520
 we installed it and when we have it 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.800
 installed we will bring the program 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.120
 what's in the good program we have 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.170
 what to achieve our account you can 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.199
 good is not with tranquility 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.690
 to be able to link and this way too 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.989
 has an interesting function that is 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.540
 use the types of the jungle is worth 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.890
 every time 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.180
 let's kill a buffoon who is going to put us 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.160
 the time it has left for him to return to 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.300
 appear like the baron and the dragon 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.790
 but we have active because I do not like and 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.730
 we go direct something that we change 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.650
 skin is what has this we take 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:21.600
 any screen you see how are you watching 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.650
 here this sadness is what is called pax 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.830
 he has sad faith and that is where he puts you 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.960
 all the characters see one and 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.630
 change who you want is worth you give to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.730
 apply and you'll have the game any 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.650
 corner 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.500
 what happens if you have a champion's skin 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.220
 like for example I have from there is 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.909
 written out this one if I want to have this 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.299
 what I have to do is 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.520
 catch in the game in long the selection 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.479
 of skins give to these other than the 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.900
 classical normal because if not you 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.960
 will put the ones that you already have 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.460
 another thing to keep in mind in others 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.290
 they do not know the corners like 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.890
 previous the video is only for 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.990
 everyone 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.990
 and this and I fear the delay and for you 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.560
 I just installed it so I do not know very 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.360
 fine if it is updated only with the lol 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.250
 they installed again and such 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.360
 but for example right now he has to 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.770
 leave the skin of asus la infernal na sus 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.590
 conquests and it's already here 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.190
 it's I do not know how it's going I'm very good 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.070
 I guess I'll update 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.200
 automatically or in the long and such good 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.330
 another option that allows us is this 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.820
 change the course but if you want 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.850
 Well that's all the video is already 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.470
 sap play whatever and I'm going to launch 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.190
 in boat 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.190
 until the next video
