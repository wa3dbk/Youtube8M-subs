00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.600 
seven or eight minutes to get it out but
it's<00:04:03.970> worth<00:04:04.210> it<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:05.350> know<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.220> don't

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
it's worth it and you know you don't

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.670 
it's worth it and you know you don't
want<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:07.000> break<00:04:07.180> or<00:04:07.420> anything<00:04:07.630> so<00:04:08.140> be<00:04:08.500> very

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
careful when you're pulling it out use

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.540 
careful when you're pulling it out use
something<00:04:11.440> small<00:04:11.740> like<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:12.010> shows<00:04:12.220> we're

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
something small like the shows we're

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:29.890 
something small like the shows we're
using<00:04:12.820> or<00:04:13.630> else<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.290> will<00:04:14.470> break

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.660 

the

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:43.390 

of<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:35.820> chance

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:05:01.120 

looks<00:04:43.790> like<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:44.000> foot

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.100 

step<00:05:02.130> 7<00:05:02.820> started<00:05:03.270> trying<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.510> get<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.810> sand

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
step 7 started trying to get the sand

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.560 
step 7 started trying to get the sand
off<00:05:04.320> by<00:05:04.680> scraping<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:05.520> off<00:05:05.670> or<00:05:06.000> rubbing<00:05:06.360> it<00:05:06.450> off

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
off by scraping it off or rubbing it off

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.140 
off by scraping it off or rubbing it off
with<00:05:06.840> your<00:05:06.990> hands<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:08.430> is<00:05:08.610> an<00:05:08.730> optional<00:05:09.090> step

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
with your hands this is an optional step

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.300 
with your hands this is an optional step
if<00:05:09.570> you<00:05:10.290> feel<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.710> you're<00:05:10.920> moving<00:05:11.670> too

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
if you feel that you're moving too

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.010 
if you feel that you're moving too
sensitive<00:05:14.310> store<00:05:14.610> at<00:05:14.700> this<00:05:14.820> point<00:05:15.150> then<00:05:15.450> don't

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
sensitive store at this point then don't

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.620 
sensitive store at this point then don't
do<00:05:16.170> it<00:05:16.430> like<00:05:17.430> I<00:05:17.580> said<00:05:17.790> it's<00:05:17.910> an<00:05:18.000> optional<00:05:18.360> step

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
do it like I said it's an optional step

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.960 
do it like I said it's an optional step
and<00:05:18.900> seventh<00:05:19.680> of<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.890> deduct<00:05:20.160> number<00:05:20.460> anyway<00:05:20.910> so

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
and seventh of a deduct number anyway so

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.550 
and seventh of a deduct number anyway so
you<00:05:21.210> might<00:05:21.600> want<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:21.960> skip<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.380> step

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
you might want to skip that step

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.920 
you might want to skip that step
entirely<00:05:23.040> anyway<00:05:23.640> and<00:05:25.730> yeah<00:05:26.730> I<00:05:26.970> would<00:05:27.690> let<00:05:27.810> it

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
entirely anyway and yeah I would let it

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.400 
entirely anyway and yeah I would let it
dry<00:05:28.140> for<00:05:28.170> an<00:05:28.620> hour<00:05:28.740> like<00:05:29.750> half<00:05:30.750> hour<00:05:30.990> seems<00:05:31.290> to

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
dry for an hour like half hour seems to

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:44.500 
dry for an hour like half hour seems to
be<00:05:31.500> short<00:05:32.210> but<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.270> know<00:05:33.480> it's<00:05:33.660> up<00:05:33.780> to<00:05:33.930> you

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.800 

baby<00:05:45.710> by<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.770> way<00:05:46.980> I'm<00:05:47.360> putting<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.600> pieces

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
baby by the way I'm putting the pieces
