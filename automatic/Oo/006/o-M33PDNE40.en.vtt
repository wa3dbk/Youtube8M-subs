we're counting off the moments here one
of<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> features<00:01:30.119> by<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> way<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.900> ink<00:01:31.229> ink

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
of the features by the way this ink ink

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.880 
of the features by the way this ink ink
technology<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:34.079> arranged<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
technology is that it arranged is the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.260 
technology is that it arranged is the
screen<00:01:35.250> which<00:01:35.549> looks<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.000> higher

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
screen which looks like a higher

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
resolution and it actually has to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730 
resolution and it actually has to
rearrange<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.420> molecules<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.290> whatever<00:01:40.560> on

rearrange the molecules or whatever on

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.950 
rearrange the molecules or whatever on
the<00:01:40.860> screen<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:42.150> make<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.450> different<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> can

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the screen to make it different you can

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.139 
the screen to make it different you can
see<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.409> there's<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:44.149> progress

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
see here that there's a progress

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.580 
see here that there's a progress
indicator<00:01:45.659> that's<00:01:45.960> showing<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.439> it's

better to me so I don't know while this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.899 
better to me so I don't know while this
is<00:02:04.740> starting<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.310> compared<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
is starting up with compared to the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.719 
is starting up with compared to the
kindle<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> kid

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
kindle to this is the kid

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.699 
kindle to this is the kid
two<00:02:08.879> right<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.229> two<00:02:10.440> side

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
two right here you can see the two side

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.979 
two right here you can see the two side
by<00:02:10.920> side<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:12.269> you'll<00:02:12.420> notice<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.930> that

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
by side and what you'll notice is that

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.119 
by side and what you'll notice is that
the<00:02:13.260> screen<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:14.239> exactly<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.360> same<00:02:15.569> size<00:02:16.129> but

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
the screen is exactly the same size but

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.479 
the screen is exactly the same size but
the<00:02:17.190> unit<00:02:18.090> itself<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:19.129> noticeably<00:02:20.129> smaller

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
the unit itself is noticeably smaller

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.320 
the unit itself is noticeably smaller
and<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:22.290> actually<00:02:22.730> noticeably<00:02:23.730> lighter<00:02:23.970> as

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and it's actually noticeably lighter as

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.740 
and it's actually noticeably lighter as
well<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.319> it's<00:02:25.950> thinner<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:27.120> if<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.510> see

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
well and it's thinner so if you can see

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.670 
well and it's thinner so if you can see
it<00:02:27.870> right<00:02:28.410> here<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:30.110> quite<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.170> bit<00:02:31.349> thinner

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
it right here it's quite a bit thinner

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.780 
it right here it's quite a bit thinner
than<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.580> kindle<00:02:32.790> two<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:34.370> this<00:02:35.370> one's<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.670> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790

way of comparison and this is the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.190
