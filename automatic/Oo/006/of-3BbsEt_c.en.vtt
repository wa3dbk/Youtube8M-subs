00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.170 
actually wouldn't be any function know
what<00:06:03.260> they<00:06:03.380> are<00:06:03.520> but<00:06:04.520> get<00:06:04.669> somebody<00:06:04.940> else<00:06:05.060> to

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
what they are but get somebody else to

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.490 
what they are but get somebody else to
do<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.330> who<00:06:05.840> thinks<00:06:06.080> they're<00:06:06.200> cool<00:06:06.410> I<00:06:08.500> would

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
do it who thinks they're cool I would

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.690 
do it who thinks they're cool I would
assume<00:06:09.680> at<00:06:09.830> least<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.100> amaretto<00:06:10.400> there's

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
assume at least the amaretto there's

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.820 
assume at least the amaretto there's
something<00:06:10.910> covered<00:06:11.350> but<00:06:12.350> there's<00:06:12.500> a<00:06:12.560> little

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
something covered but there's a little

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.600 
something covered but there's a little
bite<00:06:13.100> which<00:06:13.940> I'm<00:06:14.090> guessing<00:06:14.330> is<00:06:14.570> the<00:06:14.630> lime<00:06:14.960> and

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.680 
what it is and I can see how drinking a
couple<00:06:25.400> of<00:06:25.520> these<00:06:25.640> would<00:06:26.030> be<00:06:26.180> absolutely

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
couple of these would be absolutely

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.740

destructive<00:06:27.290> to<00:06:27.890> your<00:06:28.010> body<00:06:28.160> so<00:06:28.940> just<00:06:29.180> try<00:06:29.419> one

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
destructive to your body so just try one
