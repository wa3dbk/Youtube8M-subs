hi<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.220> simple<00:00:02.520> tutorial<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:03.510> show<00:00:03.540> you

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
hi this is a simple tutorial to show you

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.410 
hi this is a simple tutorial to show you
how<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.259> use<00:00:04.529> one<00:00:05.009> lego<00:00:05.279> mindstorm<00:00:05.879> mother<00:00:06.180> or

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
how to use one lego mindstorm mother or

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.040 
how to use one lego mindstorm mother or
using<00:00:07.049> erbe<00:00:07.760> first<00:00:08.760> run<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.389> ER<00:00:09.420> be<00:00:09.630> console

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
using erbe first run the ER be console

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.610 
using erbe first run the ER be console
as<00:00:10.290> usual<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.599> we<00:00:12.599> will<00:00:12.780> be<00:00:12.900> using<00:00:13.080> one<00:00:13.440> single

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
as usual and we will be using one single

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.740 
as usual and we will be using one single
motor<00:00:14.009> plugged<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.299> mind<00:00:15.509> stone

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
motor plugged in the mind stone

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.609 
motor plugged in the mind stone
controller<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.359> actually<00:00:18.359> connected<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
controller and actually connected in the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.790 
controller and actually connected in the
a<00:00:19.830> plug<00:00:20.430> here<00:00:21.080> so<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.170> first<00:00:22.410> thing<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.769> have

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
a plug here so the first thing we have

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.720 
a plug here so the first thing we have
to<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.760> create<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.420> motor<00:00:24.930> control

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
to do is to create a motor control

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.689 
to do is to create a motor control
object<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:28.039> instance<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
object that is an instance of the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.560 
object that is an instance of the
generic<00:00:30.090> servo<00:00:30.570> controller<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.239> what

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
generic servo controller so that's what

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.200 
generic servo controller so that's what
we<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> C++<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.370> syntax<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
we do here with the C++ like syntax and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.799 
we do here with the C++ like syntax and
we<00:00:36.690> also<00:00:36.870> tell<00:00:37.399> server<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.910> motor<00:00:39.420> is

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
we also tell server that motor is

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.040 
we also tell server that motor is
plugged<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.770> connector<00:00:41.600> as<00:00:42.600> soon<00:00:42.899> as

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
plugged in the a connector as soon as

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.869 
plugged in the a connector as soon as
this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.260> done<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:43.920> start<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.460> use<00:00:44.520> this

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
this is done we can start to use this

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.840 
this is done we can start to use this
model<00:00:45.140> by<00:00:46.140> using<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.860> Val<00:00:47.070> attribute<00:00:47.670> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
model by using the Val attribute to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360 
model by using the Val attribute to
control<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.300> position<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.340> example<00:00:50.340> let's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
control this position for example let's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.180 
control this position for example let's
move<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> model<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> position<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.530> 100

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
move the model to the position of 100

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.299 
move the model to the position of 100
degrees<00:00:54.140> as<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> video<00:00:55.890> it's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
degrees as you can see on the video it's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.990 
degrees as you can see on the video it's
moving<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.050> can<00:00:58.050> also<00:00:58.199> go<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.859> two<00:00:59.070> minutes<00:00:59.399> 30

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
moving I can also go back two minutes 30

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.429 
moving I can also go back two minutes 30
and<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.649> executed<00:01:02.809> of<00:01:03.809> course<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> can

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
and it's executed of course you can

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.679 
and it's executed of course you can
check<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> value<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> current<00:01:06.090> titian<00:01:06.479> by

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
check the value of the current titian by

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.469 
check the value of the current titian by
evaluating<00:01:07.200> motor<00:01:07.860> dot<00:01:08.100> Val<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.299> not

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
evaluating motor dot Val which is not

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
evaluating motor dot Val which is not
like<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> current<00:01:11.700> video

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
like that and you get the current video

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
like that and you get the current video
you<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> small<00:01:13.560> difference

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you see that there is a small difference

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.550 
you see that there is a small difference
between<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.240> command<00:01:15.600> which<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.990> means<00:01:16.200> 30

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
between the command which is means 30

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
between the command which is means 30
and<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.700> sensor<00:01:18.180> because

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and what you see on the sensor because

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.649 
and what you see on the sensor because
the<00:01:18.750> model<00:01:19.080> are<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.439> perfect<00:01:20.390> most<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the model are not perfect most of the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.350 
the model are not perfect most of the
time<00:01:21.900> people<00:01:21.930> will<00:01:22.590> assign<00:01:23.040> an<00:01:23.400> alias<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
time people will assign an alias to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
time people will assign an alias to
motor<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.080> Val<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> most

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
motor that Val because it's the most

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
motor that Val because it's the most
used<00:01:26.670> variable<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> quick

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
used variable and you want a quick

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.899 
used variable and you want a quick
access<00:01:28.820> something<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.030> arias<00:01:31.610> m-model<00:01:32.610> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
access something like arias m-model that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.140 
access something like arias m-model that
val<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:34.100> then<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.250> will<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.549> able<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> control

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
val and then you will be able to control

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.910 
val and then you will be able to control
your<00:01:36.329> model<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:37.409> em<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.689> like<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.200> like

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
your model with em so like this or like

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.469 
your model with em so like this or like
this<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.530> also<00:01:43.710> use<00:01:44.100> motto<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.329> name

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
this you can also use motto as the name

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.960 
this you can also use motto as the name
of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.689> ideas<00:01:46.140> instead<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.829> em<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
of the ideas instead of em which is a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.260 
of the ideas instead of em which is a
bit<00:01:48.180> confusing<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.290> allowed<00:01:50.210> there<00:01:51.210> are

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
bit confusing but it's allowed there are

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
bit confusing but it's allowed there are
more<00:01:51.390> interesting<00:01:51.960> ways<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.530> assign<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
more interesting ways to assign the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.850 
more interesting ways to assign the
value<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> variable<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.720> model<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.350> ER<00:01:55.680> be

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
value to a variable so to model in ER be

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.200 
value to a variable so to model in ER be
using<00:01:56.759> speed<00:01:57.149> time<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:57.960> oxidation<00:01:58.530> control

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
using speed time or oxidation control

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.300 
using speed time or oxidation control
let's<00:02:00.210> start<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:00.869> time<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> say<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.920> want<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
let's start with time and say I want to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.060 
let's start with time and say I want to
get<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.850> minutes<00:02:03.390> 20<00:02:03.719> degrees<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.110> 10<00:02:04.649> seconds

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
get two minutes 20 degrees in 10 seconds

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.449 
get two minutes 20 degrees in 10 seconds
so<00:02:05.549> we'll<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:05.969> something<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:07.459> assign

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
so we'll do something like assign

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.470 
so we'll do something like assign
minutes<00:02:08.970> 20<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:10.679> take<00:02:10.979> 10<00:02:11.400> seconds<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.300> get

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
minutes 20 but take 10 seconds to get

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.990 
minutes 20 but take 10 seconds to get
there

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
there

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.229 
there
as<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.329> see<00:02:15.510> on<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.689> video<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:16.620> moving

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
as you can see on the video it's moving

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.479 
as you can see on the video it's moving
towards<00:02:18.239> target<00:02:18.689> and<00:02:19.200> takes<00:02:19.650> 10<00:02:19.859> seconds<00:02:20.280> I

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
towards target and takes 10 seconds I

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.509 
towards target and takes 10 seconds I
could<00:02:20.939> put<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:22.049> one<00:02:22.349> hour<00:02:22.500> or<00:02:22.799> two<00:02:22.980> hours<00:02:23.010> if

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
could put like one hour or two hours if

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.420 
could put like one hour or two hours if
I<00:02:23.700> want<00:02:23.969> to<00:02:24.030> do<00:02:24.590> something<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.890> clock<00:02:26.219> for

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
I want to do something like a clock for

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.890 
I want to do something like a clock for
example<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.120> doesn't<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.370> not<00:02:29.519> limited<00:02:29.900> now

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
example it doesn't it is not limited now

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.710 
example it doesn't it is not limited now
if<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.379> want<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> move<00:02:31.829> back<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.250> 150<00:02:33.209> with<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
if I want to move back to 150 with the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.780 
if I want to move back to 150 with the
speed<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.019> let's<00:02:34.530> say<00:02:34.709> 30<00:02:35.099> degrees<00:02:35.549> per

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
speed of let's say 30 degrees per

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.110 
speed of let's say 30 degrees per
seconds<00:02:36.209> as<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.319> can<00:02:37.470> guess<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:38.129> like<00:02:38.849> that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
seconds as you can guess it's like that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.129 
seconds as you can guess it's like that
by<00:02:39.840> specifying<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.709> speed<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.989> once<00:02:42.989> again

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
by specifying the speed and once again

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.990 
by specifying the speed and once again
the<00:02:43.379> model<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.739> moving<00:02:44.129> with<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.730> given<00:02:44.909> speed

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
the model is moving with the given speed

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.360 
the model is moving with the given speed
note<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.239> these<00:02:49.139> commands<00:02:49.590> take<00:02:49.859> a<00:02:49.889> certain

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
note that these commands take a certain

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.429 
note that these commands take a certain
time<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.760> execute<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.540> they<00:02:51.840> must<00:02:52.079> terminate

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
time to execute and they must terminate

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.710

before anything else after the semicolon
is<00:02:55.169> executed<00:02:55.859> there<00:02:56.760> are<00:02:56.849> ways<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.090> urbe<00:02:57.689> to

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
is executed there are ways in urbe to

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.929 
is executed there are ways in urbe to
put<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> comment<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.889> background<00:02:59.489> so<00:02:59.909> that

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
put a comment in the background so that

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.449 
put a comment in the background so that
you<00:03:00.269> can<00:03:00.480> execute<00:03:01.019> other<00:03:01.470> things<00:03:01.799> while<00:03:02.189> it's

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
you can execute other things while it's

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.899 
you can execute other things while it's
in<00:03:03.000> progress<00:03:03.560> simply<00:03:04.560> use<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.950> comma<00:03:05.280> instead

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
in progress simply use a comma instead

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.699 
in progress simply use a comma instead
of<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> semicolon<00:03:06.599> at<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.959> end<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.379> command

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
of a semicolon at the end of the command

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.319 
of a semicolon at the end of the command
like<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.579> example<00:03:08.669> i<00:03:09.260> go<00:03:10.260> back<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.470> zero<00:03:11.040> i

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
like for example i go back to zero i

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.349 
like for example i go back to zero i
take<00:03:12.329> two<00:03:12.569> seconds<00:03:13.079> i<00:03:13.439> put<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> comma<00:03:14.700> here<00:03:14.819> and

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
take two seconds i put a comma here and

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.580 
take two seconds i put a comma here and
i<00:03:16.079> do<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.290> simple<00:03:16.769> thing<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.189> a<00:03:17.430> pink<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.470> as

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
i do a simple thing like a pink so as

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.159 
i do a simple thing like a pink so as
you<00:03:19.709> can<00:03:19.859> see<00:03:20.099> i<00:03:20.129> get<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.549> phone<00:03:20.760> immediately

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
you can see i get the phone immediately

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.710 
you can see i get the phone immediately
even<00:03:22.169> if<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.440> command<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.859> that<00:03:23.069> finished<00:03:23.879> if

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
even if the command is that finished if

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.229 
even if the command is that finished if
i<00:03:24.930> had<00:03:25.199> used<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.799> semicolon<00:03:26.430> instead<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.150> a

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
i had used a semicolon instead of a

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.780 
i had used a semicolon instead of a
color<00:03:27.510> comma<00:03:28.109> here<00:03:28.530> then<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.190> pink<00:03:29.519> would<00:03:29.760> be

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
color comma here then the pink would be

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.909 
color comma here then the pink would be
executed<00:03:30.540> after<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.349> two<00:03:31.650> seconds<00:03:32.959> now<00:03:33.959> let's

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
executed after the two seconds now let's

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.770 
executed after the two seconds now let's
play<00:03:35.159> with<00:03:35.340> an<00:03:35.489> oscillation<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.479> model

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
play with an oscillation of the model

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.189 
play with an oscillation of the model
something<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:38.269> oscillate<00:03:39.269> around<00:03:39.599> the

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
something like oscillate around the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.640 
something like oscillate around the
value<00:03:40.500> zero<00:03:41.299> with<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.329> period<00:03:42.659> of<00:03:42.870> three

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
value zero with a period of three

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.170 
value zero with a period of three
seconds<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.370> an<00:03:44.459> amplitude<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.329> 80<00:03:46.290> degrees

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
seconds and an amplitude of 80 degrees

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.449 
seconds and an amplitude of 80 degrees
here<00:03:48.180> i<00:03:48.209> will<00:03:48.419> use<00:03:48.750> at<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.079> end<00:03:49.709> not<00:03:50.190> a

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
here i will use at the end not a

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.059 
here i will use at the end not a
semicolon<00:03:51.209> by<00:03:51.479> the<00:03:51.540> coma<00:03:51.870> because<00:03:52.709> this

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
semicolon by the coma because this

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.399 
semicolon by the coma because this
command<00:03:53.459> as<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.849> can<00:03:54.060> see<00:03:54.299> on<00:03:54.479> the<00:03:54.599> screen<00:03:54.690> is

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
command as you can see on the screen is

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.080 
command as you can see on the screen is
never<00:03:55.739> terminating<00:03:56.489> it's<00:03:56.699> going<00:03:56.939> to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
never terminating it's going to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.059 
never terminating it's going to
oscillate<00:03:57.120> forever<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.560> if<00:03:58.680> i<00:03:58.829> put<00:03:59.040> a

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
oscillate forever so if i put a

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.250 
oscillate forever so if i put a
semicolon<00:03:59.340> i<00:03:59.879> will<00:04:00.239> never<00:04:00.419> be<00:04:00.659> able<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.079> put

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
semicolon i will never be able to put

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.509 
semicolon i will never be able to put
any<00:04:01.290> other<00:04:01.650> comments<00:04:01.919> afterwards<00:04:03.919> as<00:04:04.919> i<00:04:05.310> said

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
any other comments afterwards as i said

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.580 
any other comments afterwards as i said
this<00:04:05.669> comment<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.060> never<00:04:06.299> terminating<00:04:06.989> but

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
this comment is never terminating but

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.920 
this comment is never terminating but
there<00:04:07.739> is<00:04:07.859> a<00:04:07.889> way<00:04:07.979> to<00:04:08.159> stop<00:04:08.579> it<00:04:08.729> anyway<00:04:09.180> by

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
there is a way to stop it anyway by

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.909 
there is a way to stop it anyway by
using<00:04:10.439> the<00:04:10.979> stop<00:04:11.250> command<00:04:11.669> and<00:04:12.349> specifying<00:04:13.349> no

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
using the stop command and specifying no

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.569 
using the stop command and specifying no
tag<00:04:14.359> so<00:04:15.359> what<00:04:15.569> is<00:04:15.599> a<00:04:15.720> tag<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.349> tag<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.400> name

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
tag so what is a tag a tag is the name

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.490 
tag so what is a tag a tag is the name
that<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.940> can<00:04:18.120> assign<00:04:18.449> to<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> command<00:04:19.139> in<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
that you can assign to a command in the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.860 
that you can assign to a command in the
previous<00:04:19.769> case<00:04:20.070> there<00:04:20.549> was<00:04:20.729> no<00:04:20.970> specific<00:04:21.630> tag

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
previous case there was no specific tag

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.620 
previous case there was no specific tag
assigned<00:04:22.349> so<00:04:22.590> no<00:04:22.830> tag<00:04:23.099> is<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.550> generic<00:04:23.909> term
