00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.310 
home is very stressful whatever it is
and<00:00:47.250> then<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.000> pair<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> high<00:00:48.719> intensity

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
stressful physical workout your cortisol

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.639 
stressful physical workout your cortisol
levels<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> stay<00:00:54.660> high<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.199> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
levels are going to stay high and you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.350 
levels are going to stay high and you
are<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> probably<00:00:56.610> lose<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
are not going to probably lose the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.939 
are not going to probably lose the
weight<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.079> hormones<00:00:58.230> are<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.800> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
weight because your hormones are out of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.700 
weight because your hormones are out of
balance<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.989> shuffle<00:01:01.469> job

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
balance so if you have the I shuffle job

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.219 
balance so if you have the I shuffle job
what<00:01:02.340> would<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> best<00:01:03.000> thing<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
bring those clothes all levels down be

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.179 
bring those clothes all levels down be
something<00:01:06.720> more<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.020> yoga<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.830> relaxation
