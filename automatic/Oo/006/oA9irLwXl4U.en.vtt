00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.950
 How about friends today we go to the west 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.110
 to talk about a sports icon of 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.509
 our city that is also a place 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.999
 unique in its kind in Mexico I mean the 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.009
 Racecourse of the Americas from late 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.230
 from the 19th century racecourses emerged in 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.510
 mexico if in the first in the city the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.870
 peralvillo racecourse inaugurated in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.940
 1882 however because of its difficult access and 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.920
 some other discomforts with the 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.290
 time it was decaying constructing itself 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.350
 then and to replace it the racecourse 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.750
 of the Countess colony inaugurated in 1910 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.100
 by President Porfirio Díaz the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 hippodrome of peralvillo would be 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.270
 dismantled in 1913 while that of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.480
 the colony hides these would only last 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.430
 until 1925 arising in both areas 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.230
 new colonies that would preserve the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.210
 names but leaving the city without 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.800
 racecourse for several years until the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 40's new one would emerge in 1941 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.570
 italian bruno pagliai came to american 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.649
 and tried to install a hippodrome in the usa 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.239
 In Las Vegas 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.579
 however, the permits were not 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.170
 granted for what he tried to do in 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.570
 the state of california where neither 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.890
 he succeeded then he decided 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.260
 try it in mexico 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.550
 There was only one race track in Tijuana for 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.040
 what traveled to our country to 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.590
 process the respective permits 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.760

 horse riding enthusiast who 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 quickly convinced of the viability 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.280
 of the project and the procedures were facilitated 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.570
 besides that there was already a concession 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.030
 given by President Lázaro Cardenas 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 to build a racecourse which 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.500

 to build a majestic racecourse 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.630
 with enough space for a track 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.080
 6.5 furlongs long plus 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.399

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.459
