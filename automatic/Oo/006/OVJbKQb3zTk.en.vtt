00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
so let's begin right away number 10

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.100 
so let's begin right away number 10
turning<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.760> phone<00:00:36.120> without<00:00:36.450> actually

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
turning on this phone without actually

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.080 
turning on this phone without actually
pressing<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> power<00:00:37.890> button<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.030> do

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
pressing the power button and you can do

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.030 
pressing the power button and you can do
this<00:00:39.180> by<00:00:39.300> simply<00:00:39.360> dragging<00:00:39.989> from<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> bottom

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
this by simply dragging from the bottom

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040 
this by simply dragging from the bottom
upwards<00:00:41.280> however<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.450> could<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:42.780> laggy

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
upwards however it could get laggy

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.840 
upwards however it could get laggy
sometimes<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> recommend<00:00:44.010> simply<00:00:44.520> turning

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
sometimes and I recommend simply turning

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.400 
sometimes and I recommend simply turning
on<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> phone<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:45.809> turning<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> back

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
on the phone and then turning it back

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.040 
on the phone and then turning it back
off<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.460> try<00:00:47.670> dragging<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
off and then try dragging it and then it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
off and then try dragging it and then it
will<00:00:49.170> simply<00:00:49.500> turn<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.160> where<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.489> were

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
people don't have it because they

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.130 
people don't have it because they
usually<00:02:38.340> don't<00:02:38.670> really<00:02:39.030> focus<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.720> lot<00:02:39.870> about

quickly see how nice this effect looks

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.759 
quickly see how nice this effect looks
like<00:02:55.040> as<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.780> see<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.170> pockets<00:02:58.620> slow

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
like as you can see the pockets slow

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.009 
like as you can see the pockets slow
down<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.459> then<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> water<00:03:00.269> falls<00:03:00.629> and<00:03:00.870> all

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
down and then the water falls and all

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.170 
down and then the water falls and all
spills<00:03:01.410> over<00:03:01.769> in<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.040> nice<00:03:02.220> slow-motion<00:03:03.060> effect

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
spills over in a nice slow-motion effect

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.500 
spills over in a nice slow-motion effect
and<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:04.410> actually<00:03:04.590> do<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.510> slow-motion

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
and to actually do this slow-motion

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.229 
and to actually do this slow-motion
effect<00:03:06.599> you<00:03:06.930> need<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.170> head<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.410> videos

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
effect you need to head to videos

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.180 
effect you need to head to videos
basically<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.599> camera<00:03:10.019> itself<00:03:10.379> let's<00:03:10.950> see

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
basically the camera itself let's see

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.400 
basically the camera itself let's see
there<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.819> then<00:03:12.810> what<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.049> have<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.200> do

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
here and then go to slow-motion it will

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.370 
here and then go to slow-motion it will
be<00:03:19.650> an<00:03:19.769> image<00:03:20.100> of<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.340> person<00:03:20.900> walking<00:03:21.900> pretty

not<00:05:12.389> sure<00:05:12.629> if<00:05:12.750> you<00:05:12.840> could<00:05:12.990> actually<00:05:13.199> see<00:05:13.680> it

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
not sure if you could actually see it

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.330 
not sure if you could actually see it
but<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:15.120> looks<00:05:15.419> 3d<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.529> me<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:16.949> you<00:05:17.279> should

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
but it looks 3d to me and you should

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.769 
but it looks 3d to me and you should
actually<00:05:17.610> try<00:05:17.939> out<00:05:18.029> the<00:05:18.240> few<00:05:18.419> photos

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
actually try out the few photos

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.540 
actually try out the few photos
especially<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:19.289> photo<00:05:19.529> where<00:05:19.800> an<00:05:19.949> object<00:05:20.129> your

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
especially a photo where an object your

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.330 
especially a photo where an object your
taking<00:05:20.879> a<00:05:20.969> picture<00:05:21.180> of<00:05:21.389> is<00:05:21.539> tall<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.080> large<00:05:22.800> it

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
taking a picture of is tall and large it

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.980 
taking a picture of is tall and large it
doesn't<00:05:23.520> look<00:05:23.729> very<00:05:23.759> nice<00:05:24.180> but<00:05:24.479> I<00:05:24.509> think<00:05:24.629> it's

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
doesn't look very nice but I think it's

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.040 
doesn't look very nice but I think it's
a<00:05:25.080> cool<00:05:25.259> effect<00:05:25.560> that<00:05:25.949> you<00:05:26.069> could<00:05:26.189> use<00:05:26.840> okay

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
a cool effect that you could use okay

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.040 
a cool effect that you could use okay
