00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
yep basically it's about the new render

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.300 
yep basically it's about the new render
setting<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.420> they've<00:00:15.660> added<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:17.160> an

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
setting that they've added and it's an

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.179 
setting that they've added and it's an
effect<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.650> basically<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.920> could<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.070> is

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
effect so basically what you could do is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.240 
effect so basically what you could do is
you<00:00:20.279> could<00:00:20.369> add<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> watermark<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:22.100> they<00:00:23.100> did

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
you could add a watermark and they did

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.429 
you could add a watermark and they did
not<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> previous<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
not have this in the previous one so and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.439 
not have this in the previous one so and
you<00:00:25.529> would<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.279> post<00:00:27.029> cinema

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
you would have to do it in post cinema

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
you would have to do it in post cinema

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
you could even put the machine info in

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.560 
you could even put the machine info in
there<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.829> let's<00:01:56.610> say<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.909> want<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> render

if<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.850> just<00:02:15.030> put<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.480> as<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> zero<00:02:16.110> but

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
if I just put this on as a zero but

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.430 
if I just put this on as a zero but
let's<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.830> put<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> sphere<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:19.170> let's<00:02:19.320> see

let's just put a sphere in and let's see

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.850 
let's just put a sphere in and let's see
this<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.670> 288<00:02:20.670> that's<00:02:21.360> actually<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> lot<00:02:22.020> all

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
check this and check

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.360 
check this and check
I<00:02:46.310> feel<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.400> checking<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:49.010> okay<00:02:50.010> whatever<00:02:50.250> it

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
I feel like checking on okay whatever it

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.990 
I feel like checking on okay whatever it
doesn't<00:02:50.580> matter

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
doesn't matter

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.830 
doesn't matter
um<00:02:52.730> yes<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.880> could<00:02:54.000> change<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.240> opacity<00:02:54.510> of

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
um yes you could change the opacity of

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
um yes you could change the opacity of
the<00:02:54.900> background<00:02:55.380> let's<00:02:56.160> say<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.370> run<00:02:56.520> this

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
the background let's say you run this

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.710 
the background let's say you run this
out<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:58.320> could<00:02:58.560> make<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.550> darker<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.540> mean

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
out you could make this darker I mean

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.810 
out you could make this darker I mean
blend<00:03:01.530> into<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.980> background<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.430> little<00:03:02.460> more

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
blend into the background a little more

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.500 
blend into the background a little more
obviously<00:03:03.980> self-explanatory<00:03:04.980> yet<00:03:05.430> again<00:03:05.670> you

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
obviously self-explanatory yet again you

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.600 
obviously self-explanatory yet again you
can<00:03:06.600> even<00:03:06.690> change<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.050> font<00:03:07.610> pretty

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
can even change the font pretty

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.800 
can even change the font pretty
interesting<00:03:11.300> so<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.360> could<00:03:12.450> do<00:03:12.570> something

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
interesting so you could do something

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.750 
interesting so you could do something
like<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.550> see<00:03:14.670> everything

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
like this so I can see everything

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.800 
like this so I can see everything
changes<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.630> know<00:03:15.720> it's<00:03:16.080> fully<00:03:16.650> customizable

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
changes you know it's fully customizable

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.880 
changes you know it's fully customizable
I<00:03:18.810> don't<00:03:19.200> know<00:03:19.260> whether<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.500> was<00:03:19.560> long<00:03:19.710> before

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
I don't know whether it was long before

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.800 
I don't know whether it was long before
but<00:03:20.220> I'll<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:20.370> put<00:03:20.700> on<00:03:20.790> Ariel<00:03:21.830> Darris<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.190> bet

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
but I'll just put on Ariel Darris I bet

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.080 
but I'll just put on Ariel Darris I bet
it<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:24.930> also<00:03:25.080> change<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.370> safe<00:03:26.700> one<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:26.910> put

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
it can also change it's a safe one I put

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.050 
it can also change it's a safe one I put
it<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.450> top<00:03:29.840> there<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.870> go<00:03:31.050> um<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:33.000> not

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
it on the top there you go um it's not

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.440 
it on the top there you go um it's not
on<00:03:33.180> top<00:03:33.920> all<00:03:34.920> right<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.730> mean<00:03:35.940> if<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.180> put<00:03:36.210> it

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
on top all right so I mean if you put it

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.940 
on top all right so I mean if you put it
on<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> Ohio<00:03:37.350> pass<00:03:37.710> I<00:03:38.010> mean<00:03:38.160> like<00:03:38.310> low<00:03:38.490> opacity<00:03:38.790> I

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
on a Ohio pass I mean like low opacity I

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.080 
on a Ohio pass I mean like low opacity I
think<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.010> takes<00:03:41.160> longer<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.610> render<00:03:41.760> because

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
think it takes longer to render because

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.970 
think it takes longer to render because
obviously<00:03:42.300> had<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.750> fuse<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.560> background

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
obviously had to fuse in the background

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.060 
obviously had to fuse in the background
and<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:46.680> watermark<00:03:47.580> itself<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.920> yeah<00:03:49.920> if

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
and the the watermark itself so yeah if

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.670 
and the the watermark itself so yeah if
you<00:03:50.190> keep<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.550> like<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:51.690> sometimes<00:03:52.560> would

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
you keep it like that it sometimes would

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.100 
you keep it like that it sometimes would
take<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> little<00:03:53.070> longer<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.840> heads-up

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
take a little longer so just a heads-up

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.900 
take a little longer so just a heads-up
on<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.740> let's<00:03:56.190> scroll<00:03:56.430> down<00:03:56.640> here<00:03:56.820> you

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
on that and let's scroll down here you

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.900 
on that and let's scroll down here you
could<00:03:57.000> also<00:03:57.120> change<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.570> color<00:03:58.220> there<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.280> go

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
could also change the color there you go

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.190 
could also change the color there you go
she's<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.870> color<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.680> they<00:04:02.310> put<00:04:02.520> this<00:04:02.640> too

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
she's the color and they put this too

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.050 
she's the color and they put this too
wait<00:04:06.349> interesting<00:04:07.349> yes

little bit actually a lot and you can I
mean<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.450> default<00:04:33.810> right<00:04:33.930> here<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.200> civil

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
mean the default right here is a civil

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.400 
mean the default right here is a civil
40<00:04:34.740> logo<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:36.180> could<00:04:36.300> change<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:37.050> opacity

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
40 logo and you could change the opacity

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.610 
40 logo and you could change the opacity
on<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.220> as<00:04:38.340> well<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:39.139> you<00:04:40.139> don't<00:04:40.290> see<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.530> as

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
on it as well so you don't see it as

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.610 
on it as well so you don't see it as
much<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:42.479> go<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.960> could<00:04:43.080> probably<00:04:43.200> paint<00:04:43.500> you

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
much you go you could probably paint you

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.930 
much you go you could probably paint you
change<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.950> positioning<00:04:44.990> you<00:04:45.990> can<00:04:46.110> Center<00:04:46.410> it

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
change the positioning you can Center it

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.540 
change the positioning you can Center it
like<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.150> verticals<00:04:52.250> actually<00:04:53.250> let's<00:04:53.370> load

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
like that verticals actually let's load

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.200 
like that verticals actually let's load
an<00:04:53.669> image<00:04:53.729> it's<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:54.750> lot<00:04:54.900> better<00:04:55.290> let's<00:04:56.040> and<00:04:56.370> I

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
an image it's a lot better let's and I

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.010 
an image it's a lot better let's and I
gotta<00:04:57.479> side<00:04:57.630> this<00:04:57.720> one<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:59.690> as<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.870> can<00:05:00.960> see

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
gotta side this one and as you can see

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.620 
gotta side this one and as you can see
when<00:05:01.440> we<00:05:01.470> render<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.800> out<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:03.000> he<00:05:03.090> doesn't<00:05:03.270> fit

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
when we render it out and he doesn't fit

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.500 
when we render it out and he doesn't fit
so<00:05:03.900> if<00:05:04.440> you<00:05:04.530> want<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.740> change<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.550> fit<00:05:05.760> you

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
so if you want to change it to fit you

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.480 
so if you want to change it to fit you
got<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.690> uncheck<00:05:07.200> keep<00:05:07.380> original<00:05:07.770> size<00:05:07.950> so<00:05:08.310> it

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
got a uncheck keep original size so it

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.969 
got a uncheck keep original size so it
just<00:05:08.669> messes<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.090> aspect<00:05:09.510> ratio<00:05:09.570> and<00:05:10.140> there

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
just messes the aspect ratio and there

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.640 
just messes the aspect ratio and there
you<00:05:11.070> go<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.400> kind<00:05:11.550> of<00:05:11.669> fits<00:05:11.910> it<00:05:12.090> in<00:05:12.180> there<00:05:12.650> kind

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
you go it kind of fits it in there kind

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.990 
you go it kind of fits it in there kind
of<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:15.330> best<00:05:15.539> kind<00:05:15.870> of<00:05:15.960> can<00:05:16.169> but<00:05:16.470> oh<00:05:16.620> well<00:05:17.000> I'm
