 those of high definition publish me 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.380
 some transition because all together 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.280
 Write separately and separately write 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.020
 all together 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.580
 it will not be that they are because all together 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.050
 they are with words differences so 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.780
 general when you want to write the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.640
 different words separates them and the 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.020
 separate word is a single word and 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:59.440
 usually the words are from a 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:05:00.490
 only thing clear how old were you 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.850
 when you were born 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.250
 year zero photo or tit or data as I know that 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.310

 I want a lot and good the truth that I am 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.670
 boring that man always has 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.560
 that see the woman as a sexual object 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.390
 and that your first visual contact is 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.340
 see some of his body parts 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.800
 I think we should spend a little more 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.770
 beyond the superficial and carl photos 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.599

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.110
