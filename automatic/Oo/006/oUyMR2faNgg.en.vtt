though he's not going to be spawning
pools<00:02:50.879> almost<00:02:51.359> finished<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:51.900> he's<00:02:52.019> gonna<00:02:52.109> have

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
some servings up really soon but I don't

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.740 
some servings up really soon but I don't
think<00:02:53.730> then<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:54.030> able<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.209> do<00:02:54.329> too<00:02:54.569> much<00:02:54.690> damage

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
think then be able to do too much damage

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.199 
think then be able to do too much damage
I<00:02:55.319> think<00:02:56.129> white<00:02:56.280> might<00:02:56.489> even<00:02:56.640> decide<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.030> put<00:02:57.180> a

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
I think white might even decide to put a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.789 
I think white might even decide to put a
bunker<00:02:57.569> at<00:02:57.659> that<00:02:57.780> natural<00:02:58.109> expansion<00:02:58.349> put<00:02:58.769> a

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.330 
safe in that is gonna actually put a
second<00:03:10.019> racks<00:03:10.200> down<00:03:10.379> just<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.739> connect<00:03:11.040> get

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
second racks down just to connect get

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.970 
second racks down just to connect get
some<00:03:11.730> heavy<00:03:11.940> production<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.659> Marines<00:03:13.650> out<00:03:13.859> to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
some heavy production of Marines out to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.259 
some heavy production of Marines out to

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
help himself to fan just to make sure

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.270 
help himself to fan just to make sure
yeah<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.870> meanwhile<00:03:16.290> getting<00:03:16.500> messy<00:03:16.739> Scout<00:03:17.069> in

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
yeah is gonna start building the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.339 
yeah is gonna start building the

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
refinery so he's going to be putting

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.229 
refinery so he's going to be putting
down<00:03:25.560> his<00:03:25.650> Academy<00:03:26.069> frozen<00:03:26.370> alongside<00:03:26.579> for<00:03:27.180> is

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.969 
likely be entering that's from the north
side<00:04:57.509> it<00:04:57.689> has<00:04:57.779> very<00:04:58.110> small<00:04:58.199> chokes<00:04:58.680> fine<00:04:58.949> a

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
side it has very small chokes fine a

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.429 
side it has very small chokes fine a
couple<00:04:59.310> workers<00:04:59.699> they're<00:04:59.969> always<00:05:00.840> initial

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
will be enough to defend it and but yeah

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:06.350
