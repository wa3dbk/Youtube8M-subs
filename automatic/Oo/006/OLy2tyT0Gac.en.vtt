00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
the creation suite I still can't believe

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.290 
the creation suite I still can't believe
2k<00:02:37.620> validate<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.190> such<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> great<00:02:38.790> feature

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
2k validate it's such a great feature

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.730 
2k validate it's such a great feature
and<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.540> really<00:02:39.810> levels<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.470> playing<00:02:40.500> field

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
and it really levels the playing field

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.920 
and it really levels the playing field
so<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.130> all<00:02:41.430> creators<00:02:41.820> can<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.240> use<00:02:42.450> custom

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
so that all creators can now use custom

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.660 
so that all creators can now use custom
textures<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.250> much<00:02:44.400> better<00:02:44.520> than

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
textures and it's so much better than

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.490 
textures and it's so much better than
like<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.240> paint<00:02:45.510> tool<00:02:45.690> or<00:02:45.990> even<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.350> face

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
like so the paint tool or even the face

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.340
