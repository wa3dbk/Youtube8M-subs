00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.700
 resurrection sunday the animals 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.190
 they were entertained with food in containers 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.900
 who brought the Easter bunny we want 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.810
 that the animals can also enjoy 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.090

 with non-toxic papier mache obviously with 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 special food for animals 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.779
 depending on the food each one of the

 who usually eat them but the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.370
 children also joined the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.559
 celebrations with painted faces 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 contact with animals representations and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.930
 other activities were surprised in 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.579
 the wonderful capital city precinct 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.520
 cute because children approach the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.320
 nature animals touch the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.320
 bunnies and we can also help 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.870
 really exceptional because first that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.780
 nothing holy week and that the park 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.120
 also integrate what they mean 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.270
 in the pretty ones what the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.300
 resurrection of Christ overlap 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.250
 this tradition according to some 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.170
 to the Egyptian era where the egg was 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.990
 became a universal symbol of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.450
 fertility others say that the average age 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.250
 It was common that during the Holy Week 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.490
 the debt censuses will be paid to them 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.340
 eggs the chocolate as it joined 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.320
 early 19th century with the beginning of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.250
 this industry in countries like switzerland 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.020
 Germany Italy and France in Chile 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.510
 custom has also charged special 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.540
 force and its overcrowding has raised the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.120
 national chocolate industry is each 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.860
 year is prepared months in advance 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.220
 to meet the explosive demand of 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.100
 holy week I think we got to 4 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.590
 thousand 5000 units and there was a growth 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.090
 permanent 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.609
 do not 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.740
 no big numbers let's say but if 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.929
 we have let's say a permanent trend 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.969
 to growth year after year a 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.649
 tradition that transcends ages and that 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.719
 even on this occasion I add to the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.299
 animals who also received the 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.799
 visit of the Easter rabbit also the 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.799
