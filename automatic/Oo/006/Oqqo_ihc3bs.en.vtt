he<00:03:48.140> was<00:03:48.260> after<00:03:48.410> really<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:48.800> don't<00:03:48.950> think<00:03:49.070> he's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
he was after really I don't think he's

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.560 
he was after really I don't think he's
partial<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.550> that<00:03:49.700> much<00:03:49.820> alcohol<00:03:50.060> he's<00:03:50.390> got<00:03:50.540> a

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
partial to that much alcohol he's got a

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.060 
partial to that much alcohol he's got a
steer<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.080> because<00:03:51.440> he's<00:03:51.560> got<00:03:51.709> a<00:03:51.739> lot<00:03:51.830> of<00:03:51.950> work

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
steer so because he's got a lot of work

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.400 
steer so because he's got a lot of work
to<00:03:52.190> do<00:03:52.280> at<00:03:52.400> home<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:53.750> don't<00:03:54.019> think<00:03:54.200> he<00:03:54.320> was

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410
