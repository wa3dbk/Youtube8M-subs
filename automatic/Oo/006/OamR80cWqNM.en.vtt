00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.180
 [Music] 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.119
 yes 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.549
 hello everyone welcome to this video 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.920
 tutorial a little long but that will be 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.610
 useful especially to those users 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.579
 of windows 7 starter good let's start with 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.410
 this blessed hello tutorial cybernauts 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:31.169
 earthlings welcome to this tutorial of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.720
 a tutorial in which we will teach 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:38.260
 something that good has asked me enough the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.800
 people to do this is good as 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.680
 change the background to windows 7 starter 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.230
 right now they were a netbook too 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.610
 a true netbook a hp netbook 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:55.610
 hewlett packard with windows 7 starter 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.840
 and I do not know about you listening to him 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.840
 the motto I do not know about hp hewlett 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.710
 packard that says now if the computer 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.700
 it's personal but let me tell you that 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:15.080
 It's very personal because I can not change 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.050
 the blessed screen that is in the background does not 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.180
 I can change it is not the option about 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.240
 that screen resolution does not come out 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.920
 nothing personalized, well, not like that 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.920
 it can be center and it will never change 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.270
 this blessed windows background 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.020
 well that as time has not been 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 problem because I found an option 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.480
 good 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.880
 with windows 7 starter 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.580
 and I know that what I am explaining here is not 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.050
 will allow to change the wallpaper 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.110
 as you can see it does not appear 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.380
 says it says windows 7 starter no 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.440
 will allow you to avoid the wallpaper or 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.780
 reproduce / among other restrictions 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.440
 of software the hardware 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.440
 unrecognizable 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.290
 then we already know that we can not 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.600
 use and that's something official not 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.210
 we can change for more than we want 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.150
 change the windows wallpaper 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.040
 7 starter I do not know why companies 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.710
 are selling these computers or are 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.670
 they are getting rid of them they are seeing 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.490
 most windows 7 starter although yes 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.610
 windows 7 starter is a good comfortable 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.760
 economic price and this hp computer 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.549
 It is very good 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.930
 and then but let me tell you that no 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.540
 the world ends because there is a 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.069
 solution friends I'll leave this link 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.579
 which is from a program that is going to 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.220
 serve to change the background if you 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.840
 will change the background here is going very well 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.819
 we type download free user 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.440
 because I do not think it's that they 're paying 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:57.870
 a true premium user and here we put 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.430
 in the Martian codes 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.469
 we put the codes 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.469
 we give you here slower download 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.319
 then you have to wait a few 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.480
 23-22 seconds they want it but it's going to 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.340
 to pass this is not going to be a bit fast 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.620
 with my magic to the house maybe here is 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.189
 good and let's see where you download 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.189
 slower 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.860
 we wait a little here this time 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.010
 we download we give you save the ocean and 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.069
 strange background and you start at 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.130
 download let's do this a little more 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.540
 fast too 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.500
 well here we already have it downloaded 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.600
 then once downloaded we open it 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.430
 remember that they have to have winrar 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.150
 they can do it in the description itself 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.150
 they do not have wilmar which is a compressor 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.400
 of files wilber is to compress 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.069
 file and things like that but I'm going to load in 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.159
 the description of the video is free 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.150
 so here we execute this 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.099
 active 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.840
 and it is the program that will allow us 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.260
 change the background 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.519
 we speak in Spanish unless they know 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.069
 another language 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.290
 well then we give you next 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:22.520
 We give to install and we wait a little bit 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.520
 nothing more than a little 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.530
 and restart the system now 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.460
 well in this case I'm going to restart 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.700
 now 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.650
 and I'll be back in a minute 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.650
 I'll be back soon , I'll come 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:49.740
 and I'm back and restart my 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.890
 computer and how can you see wow I have 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.750
 changed the background of the windows 7 starter 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.240
 I continue with windows 7 starter and can 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.010
 change the world now as you will see the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.540
 program called potions change 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.730
 Windows 7 background can no longer 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.150
 change the background only look for the 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.670
 program creates a link 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.520
 a shortcut on the desktop and in 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.050
 this program that they use and back then 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.080
 Friends open it 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.790
 it's not much about opening this there 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.460
 also several funds that come by 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.160
 default can be changed but then 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.590
 they choose to examine 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.380
 and looking for him where he says 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.580
 or any image me here for example 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.300
 let's choose any image 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.389
 in a moment 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.830
 we must keep looking here I think that 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:50.360
 this is understood is carlos annoying 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.879
 we must accept the folder encouragement in 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:58.020
 this photo we always give you to bed 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:01.259
 they can also search the network 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.410
 and they can activate it with the network they have 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.030
 access to the internet and then here they give you 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.180
 guardian 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:13.389
 [Music] 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:17.130
 we wait a little longer and the house here already 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:22.249
 we have the wallpaper changed 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:24.949
 alleluia we already changed it uy uy uy good 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.239
 usually me in windows 7 starter I do not 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.690
 I use my computer this 

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:30.169
 computer currently is not mine 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.969
 [Music] 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:37.090
 but I prefer a windows 7 ultimate 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:40.480
 basic and all that 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.100
 and you have another option that is either a 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.470
 bit heavier is formatting the 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.479
 computer and reinstall windows 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.180
 but it was in windows 7 a new 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:52.090
 version that already allows what is 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.010
 change the wallpaper but good 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.530
 in case you do not want to lose your things or not 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.560
 they have time to make a backup 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:03.580
 you can use this method which is very 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.620
 effective good I hope I have helped you already
