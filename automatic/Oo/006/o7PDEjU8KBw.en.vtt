 annuity of the day and the truth is that 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.960
 Well, it's so that if we have some 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.290
 or suddenly old books and is already 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.030
 I came up with the perfect example because 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.210

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.999

 sacred this idea for that to renew 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.940
 the books that we have out there are going to 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.940

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.200
 yes it was like the beginning principle of 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.940
 classes then this for example that I 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.430
 I want to have this book but I do not want 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.960
 have this cover so that it does not 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.210
 abuse not to have them all 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.660

 I liked it 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 what I like is capable of all 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.120
 we can do is a combination like in 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.660
 this case we have this paper that is 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.860
 as an effect like water like that 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.580

 after little fish then we can 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.260
 find the perfect design 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.260

 so 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.070

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.980
 school in the normal I was getting by month is 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.159
 one of many even with plastic on top 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.080
 for what 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.819
 from the amorous plastic that you 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.819
 sticks to notebooks notebooks 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.620
 but how did they reach those of their 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.410

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.580
 If you do not want maybe it locks 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.320
 as for all life because we use the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.270
 truth I'll tell you one thing is that 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.000
 now come some designs so parents in 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.680
 notebooks that information is what is going to 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.110
 save the nothing else you have also 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.650
 like a plastic and let's go 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.650

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.430
 just this charm this we can do you 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.160
 you're going to pass everything before you 're capable if the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.720
 I think we can give the same 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.720
 the three ideas and ok 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.390
 and you know very well that I facilitated 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.390
 I'm going to cut here 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.159

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.840
 Pure dining strips 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.840

 already begins to erase and now I 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.010

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.939
 I'm going to take a sheet of this 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.939
 paper to my house is good as I said 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.450
 this part is like highlighting and if it's 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.970
 as in relief it also seems like 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.860
 to water it but also over with 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.860
 plastic gives a touch as well 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.780
 and what we do is since we have then 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.740

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.410

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.210
