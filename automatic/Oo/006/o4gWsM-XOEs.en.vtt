00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.130
 the race I'm with David is the master 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:28.060
 of the universe in meat in flesh of flesh 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.360
 to pass so that you give me the clouds that 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.619
 has to pass has to happen that 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.600
 when the document is learned the change 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.370
 of raisins that you have to have that 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.500
 kept coming in that I'm outgoing has 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.699
 regularized with their chairs 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.559
 corresponding 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.170
 if this document did not start 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.820
 properly regularized could not be 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.900
 return the bank guarantee because 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.059
 really what a pass card 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.519
 it is a permit of a customs document 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.690
 for temporary imports if it is not 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.690
 sharia the wolf the country 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.460
 is issued to avoid imports 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.460
 illegal here are 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.970
 the channel passes it takes two days there are two 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.840
 types of passes of 10 leaves and 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.800
 of 25 sheets of 10 sheets are 156 euros 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.600
 and that of 25 sheets are 182 euros for 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.950
 race partners or if not the partner of the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.420
 race is 10 sheets are 259 euros to 25 a 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.410
 285 euros and the race is made how much 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.740
 It costs 179 per year 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.740
 in two days 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.940
 two days later because here in this 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.520
 house are very efficient we have meat 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.350
 so that it lasts for a year and if 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.300
 you want to renew with the way is possible 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.250
 or it is not possible every change you went through 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.520
 have their own mayor and documentation 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.860
 in the bank 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.110
 that generates a new bank guarantee 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:08.950
 unless you give me the previous one 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:10.840
 regularized and then I was in 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.000
 a country that felt the pass card 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.470
 You can fly no longer regularized so 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.319
 So much you have to ask for a new one in the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.079
 Street 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.909
 so then one thing that happens very 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.700
 typical I am in Kenya I have been 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:26.379
 expired and I need it for egypt and if 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.659
 I get that fills out 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:33.310
 telemetry do not sign me at the entrance to 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.310
 up I have all of them sent it by 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.530
 here is regularized then we can 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.830
 take advantage of the bank guarantee for 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.700
 meat 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.930
 if it is regularized 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.930
 since it is very important 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.340
 very well 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.880
 good a thing done one more thing 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.880
 It is a rejection
