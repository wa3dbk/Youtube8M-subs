00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.910

 Special effects can not be avoided 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.390

 But who knows about me is I think that you know already 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.300
 I'm not familiar with the Masked Rider at all 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.670
 That's why 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.520

 If 11 riders join forces and release a kick, any strong opponent can be defeated in one shot 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.359
