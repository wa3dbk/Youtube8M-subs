sometimes play session destroy

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170 
sometimes play session destroy
defensively<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.310> good<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

claymore and I thought was a nice
CalFire<00:01:16.860> falling<00:01:17.310> down<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.659> reaction<00:01:19.080> when

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
CalFire falling down as a reaction when

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.090 
CalFire falling down as a reaction when

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.010 
same as an Toby check or they've all got
one<00:04:36.760> I've<00:04:36.880> got<00:04:36.910> one<00:04:37.180> as<00:04:37.300> well<00:04:37.450> we<00:04:37.720> all<00:04:37.810> made<00:04:37.960> it

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
one I've got one as well we all made it

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.260 
one I've got one as well we all made it
the<00:04:38.140> same<00:04:38.350> time<00:04:38.380> we<00:04:38.740> played<00:04:38.950> that<00:04:39.130> for<00:04:39.280> fun<00:04:39.460> for

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
the same time we played that for fun for

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.590 
the same time we played that for fun for
black<00:04:40.450> ops<00:04:40.660> which<00:04:41.700> Toby<00:04:42.700> thinks<00:04:43.000> that<00:04:43.300> game<00:04:43.480> is

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
black ops which Toby thinks that game is

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.970 
black ops which Toby thinks that game is
going<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.750> feel<00:04:43.930> quite<00:04:44.170> a<00:04:44.200> lot<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.530> don't<00:04:44.800> I

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
going to feel quite a lot I don't I

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.430 
going to feel quite a lot I don't I
think<00:04:45.160> it'll<00:04:45.310> be<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.400> very<00:04:45.580> good<00:04:45.640> game<00:04:46.290> just<00:04:47.290> the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
think it'll be a very good game just the

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.470 
think it'll be a very good game just the
co<00:04:47.710> streaks<00:04:48.010> are<00:04:48.250> going<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.490> let<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.240> down

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
co streaks are going to let it down

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.240 
co streaks are going to let it down
slightly<00:04:49.780> but<00:04:50.080> apart<00:04:50.590> from<00:04:50.620> that<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.890> think<00:04:51.010> the

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
slightly but apart from that I think the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.130 
slightly but apart from that I think the
game<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:51.430> going<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.640> be<00:04:51.700> really<00:04:51.940> good<00:04:52.090> so<00:04:53.020> I'm

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
game is going to be really good so I'm

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.690 
game is going to be really good so I'm
actually<00:04:53.350> looking<00:04:53.740> really<00:04:53.920> forward<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.580> it

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
actually looking really forward to it

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.640 
actually looking really forward to it
and<00:04:54.880> also<00:04:55.300> I'm<00:04:55.690> gonna<00:04:55.810> keep<00:04:56.020> avoiding<00:04:56.290> my

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
and also I'm gonna keep avoiding my

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.550 
and also I'm gonna keep avoiding my
fallout<00:04:57.490> three<00:04:57.820> games<00:04:58.300> but<00:04:58.930> I've<00:04:59.050> decided<00:04:59.350> to

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
fallout three games but I've decided to

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.430 
fallout three games but I've decided to
i<00:05:00.070> was<00:05:00.850> uploading<00:05:01.090> i<00:05:01.570> think<00:05:01.750> how<00:05:01.870> uplifted

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
about 18 followed videos and I will

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.390 
about 18 followed videos and I will
didn't<00:05:05.050> know<00:05:05.200> college<00:05:05.500> ET<00:05:05.680> videos<00:05:05.950> and<00:05:06.250> that

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
didn't know college ET videos and that

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.190 
didn't know college ET videos and that

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
was like a few weeks ago so what I'm

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.150 
was like a few weeks ago so what I'm
going<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.350> try<00:05:08.470> and<00:05:08.500> do<00:05:08.650> is<00:05:08.740> I'm<00:05:08.830> going<00:05:08.920> to<00:05:08.980> try

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
going to try and do is I'm going to try

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.830 
going to try and do is I'm going to try
and<00:05:09.190> get<00:05:09.400> maybe<00:05:09.580> two<00:05:09.640> followed<00:05:10.210> videos<00:05:10.510> for

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
and get maybe two followed videos for

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.480 
and get maybe two followed videos for
everyone<00:05:11.290> college<00:05:11.650> is<00:05:11.770> your<00:05:11.920> video<00:05:12.130> so<00:05:12.340> I<00:05:12.400> got

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
everyone college is your video so I got

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.860 
everyone college is your video so I got
an<00:05:12.580> extra<00:05:12.760> ratio<00:05:13.030> going<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:13.450> that<00:05:13.600> I<00:05:13.630> don't

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
an extra ratio going so that I don't

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.840 
an extra ratio going so that I don't
leave<00:05:13.990> my<00:05:14.110> subscribers<00:05:14.620> out<00:05:14.740> because<00:05:15.730> it

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
leave my subscribers out because it

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.460 
leave my subscribers out because it

takes longer to make call juicy ones and

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.410 
takes longer to make call juicy ones and
it<00:05:17.530> does<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.860> make<00:05:17.950> fall<00:05:18.220> at<00:05:18.370> videos<00:05:18.640> because

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
it does to make fall at videos because

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.000 
it does to make fall at videos because
the<00:05:19.570> follow<00:05:19.780> I<00:05:19.960> play<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:20.470> commentate<00:05:20.980> the
