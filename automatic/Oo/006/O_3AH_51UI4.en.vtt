okay<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.589> wanted<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.920> show<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.100> after<00:00:02.340> I<00:00:02.399> get<00:00:02.490> my

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay I wanted to show you after I get my

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.579 
okay I wanted to show you after I get my
cylinder<00:00:03.000> heads<00:00:03.149> off<00:00:03.330> with<00:00:03.360> my<00:00:03.629> pistons<00:00:04.170> stuff

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
cylinder heads off with my pistons stuff

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.590 
cylinder heads off with my pistons stuff
look<00:00:04.740> like<00:00:04.920> little<00:00:05.460> crud<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.120> everything

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
look like little crud and everything

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.450 
look like little crud and everything
down<00:00:06.810> here<00:00:06.839> wha<00:00:09.800> I'm<00:00:10.800> not<00:00:10.980> sure<00:00:11.219> I'm<00:00:11.340> just

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
down here wha I'm not sure I'm just

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.980 
down here wha I'm not sure I'm just
actually<00:00:11.790> fell<00:00:12.210> down<00:00:12.420> there<00:00:12.599> through<00:00:12.929> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
actually fell down there through the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.720 
actually fell down there through the
holes<00:00:13.200> but<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.469> don't<00:00:13.650> think<00:00:13.920> too<00:00:14.250> much<00:00:14.400> at<00:00:14.610> all

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
holes but I don't think too much at all

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.109 
holes but I don't think too much at all
but<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.089> mean<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.800> crud<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.250> pistons

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
but I mean just the crud on the pistons

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.460 
but I mean just the crud on the pistons
that<00:00:18.420> built<00:00:18.690> up<00:00:18.869> carbon<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> lot<00:00:19.740> here<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:21.470> and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that built up carbon a lot here on and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.560 
that built up carbon a lot here on and
then<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.250> far<00:00:23.550> back<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.269> could<00:00:24.420> see

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
then this far back one you could see

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.040 
then this far back one you could see
some<00:00:24.720> oil<00:00:24.990> residue<00:00:26.180> okay<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.689> I'm<00:00:27.810> trying

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
some oil residue okay so what I'm trying

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.720 
some oil residue okay so what I'm trying
what<00:00:28.619> I'm<00:00:28.740> seeing<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:34.460> if<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.579> look

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
what I'm seeing on this is if you look

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.459 
what I'm seeing on this is if you look
to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> bottom<00:00:36.360> left<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:36.989> there<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> looks

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to the bottom left right there it looks

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.819 
to the bottom left right there it looks
like<00:00:37.649> hospital<00:00:38.190> leakage<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:39.260> either<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.559> oil

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
like hospital leakage of either the oil

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.299 
like hospital leakage of either the oil
or<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.719> coolant<00:00:42.719> most<00:00:43.379> likely<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> oil

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
or the coolant most likely the oil

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.740 
or the coolant most likely the oil
because<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.850> wasn't<00:00:45.059> losing<00:00:45.300> coolant

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
because then it wasn't losing coolant

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.930 
because then it wasn't losing coolant
but<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.020> losing<00:00:46.260> oil<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.610> either<00:00:47.700> I'm

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
but I was losing oil so either I'm

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.209 
but I was losing oil so either I'm
losing<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> through<00:00:48.570> past<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.469> this

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
losing it through past there or this

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.369 
losing it through past there or this
one's<00:00:50.460> causing<00:00:52.370> wear<00:00:53.370> issue<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:54.289> if<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
one's causing wear issue which if you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.660 
one's causing wear issue which if you
look<00:00:55.469> way<00:00:55.680> doubt<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.219> way<00:00:56.340> down<00:00:56.489> there

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
look way doubt when it's way down there

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.970 
look way doubt when it's way down there
it<00:00:56.940> does<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.570> gap<00:01:00.770> refer<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it does have a little gap refer the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.380 
it does have a little gap refer the
other<00:01:02.160> ones<00:01:03.979> maybe<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.250> warm<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
other ones maybe it's warm or it's the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.170 
other ones maybe it's warm or it's the
harder<00:01:06.720> piston<00:01:07.170> /<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.250> back<00:01:08.490> who<00:01:08.700> knows<00:01:08.939> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
harder piston / in the back who knows I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.390 
harder piston / in the back who knows I
don't<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.010> wanted<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
show you guys what my pistons look like

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.550 
show you guys what my pistons look like
it's<00:01:14.490> got<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.790> ring<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.390> them<00:01:15.560> started

clean all this up and what else don't
want<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.250> mean<00:01:50.549> these<00:01:50.670> pistons<00:01:51.149> look

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
want to do I mean these pistons look

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.610 
want to do I mean these pistons look
really<00:01:51.630> clean<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:55.460> mean

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
really clean I mean

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.080 
really clean I mean
if<00:01:58.620> you<00:01:58.740> look<00:01:58.950> inside<00:01:59.130> them<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.700> has

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
if you look inside them that has

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.930 
if you look inside them that has
criss-cross<00:02:00.810> bores<00:02:03.050> not<00:02:04.050> sure<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.500> that's

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
criss-cross bores not sure if that's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
criss-cross bores not sure if that's
manufacture<00:02:05.940> or<00:02:06.150> what<00:02:08.600> but<00:02:09.600> inside<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> board

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
manufacture or what but inside the board

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.020 
manufacture or what but inside the board
I<00:02:10.860> mean<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.570> crisscross<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.640> crisscross

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
I mean it's crisscross so the crisscross

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.950 
I mean it's crisscross so the crisscross
is<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:16.820> that<00:02:17.820> from<00:02:18.350> manufacture<00:02:19.350> Oh<00:02:20.960> what

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
is in it that from manufacture Oh what
