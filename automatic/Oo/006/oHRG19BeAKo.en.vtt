00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
braiding it the reason we're doing this

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.460 
braiding it the reason we're doing this
is<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.000> when<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.840> braid<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.350> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
is because when we take this braid to be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.350 
is because when we take this braid to be
the<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.830> headband<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.880> don't<00:01:12.119> start

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the little headband if you don't start

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.520 
the little headband if you don't start
the<00:01:12.479> braid<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.200> take<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the braid like this when you take it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
the braid like this when you take it
over<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.830> you'll<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> weird<00:01:14.430> lump<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.939> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
over and you'll get a weird lump and I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.899 
over and you'll get a weird lump and I
want<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:15.990> smooth<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.520> start
