and take a closer look at each of them

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.280 
and take a closer look at each of them
but<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.070> will<00:00:44.339> be<00:00:44.460> doing<00:00:44.670> kind<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.449> like<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> coral

but I will be doing kind of like a coral

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.910 
but I will be doing kind of like a coral
profile<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.909> fish<00:00:48.239> profile<00:00:48.839> of<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.559> corals

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
profile and a fish profile of the corals

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.619 
profile and a fish profile of the corals
and<00:00:50.040> fish<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.460> own<00:00:50.729> in<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.089> coming<00:00:51.420> weeks

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and fish that I own in the coming weeks

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.630 
and fish that I own in the coming weeks
so<00:00:51.900> I'll<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.140> looking<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.619> each<00:00:52.860> coral<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.549> in

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so I'll be looking at each coral and in

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.240 
so I'll be looking at each coral and in
each<00:00:54.150> fish<00:00:54.479> individually<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.949> tell<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.220> a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.979 
each fish individually to tell you a
little<00:00:56.489> bit<00:00:56.610> about<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.659> I've<00:00:57.780> noticed

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
little bit about them what I've noticed

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.560 
little bit about them what I've noticed
kind<00:00:58.470> of<00:00:58.589> what<00:00:58.739> they're<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.330> if<00:01:00.330> you're

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
kind of what they're like if you're

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.109 
kind of what they're like if you're
looking<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.379> stock<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.979> tank<00:01:02.369> of<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.610> own<00:01:02.790> so

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
looking to stock a tank of your own so

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.490 
looking to stock a tank of your own so
I'm<00:01:03.239> gonna<00:01:03.360> go<00:01:03.540> from<00:01:03.780> right<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:03.989> left<00:01:04.110> here

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
I'm gonna go from right to left here

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.050 
I'm gonna go from right to left here
we're<00:01:05.189> gonna<00:01:05.280> move<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.930> we've<00:01:07.110> got

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
we're gonna move up and here we've got

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.140 
we're gonna move up and here we've got
the<00:01:09.350> Australian<00:01:10.350> purple<00:01:10.740> torch<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the Australian purple torch that is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.300 
the Australian purple torch that is
looking<00:01:12.570> pretty<00:01:12.720> good<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.710> quite<00:01:14.100> as

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
looking pretty good it's not quite as

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.249 
looking pretty good it's not quite as
open<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.049> I

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
open as I would like it to be but I

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.420 
open as I would like it to be but I
think<00:01:17.150> it's<00:01:18.150> definitely<00:01:18.570> growing<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:20.220> sure

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
think it's definitely growing for sure

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.630 
think it's definitely growing for sure
and<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.800> I<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.040> need<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.310> bit

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and I think I just need a little bit

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.040 
and I think I just need a little bit
more<00:01:23.820> flow<00:01:24.120> in<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> tank<00:01:24.570> which<00:01:24.750> I'll<00:01:24.900> touch

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
more flow in the tank which I'll touch

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.180 
more flow in the tank which I'll touch
upon<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.700> bit<00:01:26.820> later<00:01:27.530> back<00:01:28.530> there<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.160> a

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
upon a little bit later back there is a

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.910 
upon a little bit later back there is a
hammer<00:01:29.940> coral<00:01:30.390> looking<00:01:31.080> good<00:01:31.260> I've<00:01:31.440> never<00:01:31.740> had

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
hammer coral looking good I've never had

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440 
hammer coral looking good I've never had
a<00:01:31.950> problem<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.580> it's<00:01:32.909> continued<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a problem with that it's continued to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.950 
a problem with that it's continued to
grow

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
grow

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.610 
grow
it's<00:01:34.290> continued<00:01:34.650> its<00:01:34.860> continuing<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> grow<00:01:35.909> in

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's continued its continuing to grow in

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.620 
it's continued its continuing to grow in
the<00:01:37.620> back<00:01:37.860> you'll<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.760> aqua<00:01:39.120> bag<00:01:39.330> with

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the back you'll see the aqua bag with

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.310 
the back you'll see the aqua bag with
the<00:01:39.720> GSP<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.620> it<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:41.310> GSP<00:01:41.730> is<00:01:42.210> also<00:01:42.840> starting

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the GSP on it the GSP is also starting

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.030 
the GSP on it the GSP is also starting
to<00:01:43.850> grow<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.240> cover<00:01:45.690> more<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.320> rock<00:01:46.620> it's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
to grow and cover more of the rock it's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.940 
to grow and cover more of the rock it's
it's<00:01:47.520> happening<00:01:48.090> slowly<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.690> surely<00:01:48.950> again

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it's happening slowly but surely again

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.950 
it's happening slowly but surely again
that's<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.400> it's<00:01:51.000> sort<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> back

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that's because it's sort of in the back

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530 
that's because it's sort of in the back
of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.260> tank<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:52.979> much<00:01:53.190> light<00:01:53.550> as<00:01:53.760> it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
of the tank not as much light as it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
of the tank not as much light as it
would<00:01:54.659> probably<00:01:54.870> need<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.260> grow<00:01:55.530> quickly<00:01:55.800> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
would probably need to grow quickly and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.000 
would probably need to grow quickly and
also<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.810> much<00:01:57.990> flow<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.710> would<00:01:58.830> need

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
also not as much flow as it would need

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.010 
also not as much flow as it would need
to<00:01:59.159> grow<00:01:59.400> quickly<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.210> doing<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.630> fine

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
to grow quickly but it's doing just fine

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.940 
to grow quickly but it's doing just fine
back<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:04.049> zoa's<00:02:04.409> are<00:02:04.560> looking<00:02:04.799> good

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
back there the zoa's are looking good

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.039 
back there the zoa's are looking good
they've<00:02:05.340> expanded<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.299> rock<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.750> little

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
they've expanded on that rock a little

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.949 
they've expanded on that rock a little
bit<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.770> overall<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.060> huge<00:02:09.569> amount<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
bit but overall not a huge amount of

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
about a month of not having it in a good

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.010 
about a month of not having it in a good
spot<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.980> wasn't<00:02:51.340> getting<00:02:51.430> good<00:02:51.760> flow<00:02:52.030> move

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
spot so it wasn't getting good flow move

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.720 
spot so it wasn't getting good flow move
some<00:02:53.350> things<00:02:53.380> around<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:54.430> getting

some things around and it's getting

some things around and it's getting
better<00:02:54.940> flow<00:02:55.360> as<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.720> can<00:02:55.990> see<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.880> goes

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
better flow as you can see it goes

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.270 
better flow as you can see it goes
through<00:02:58.510> periods<00:02:59.170> where<00:02:59.680> it's<00:02:59.709> not<00:02:59.980> moving

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.720 
see the white tips around the edges that
means<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.530> it's<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.160> growing<00:03:36.610> in

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
means that it's that it's growing in

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.440 
means that it's that it's growing in
that<00:03:36.760> direction<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:39.670> blue<00:03:39.880> chalice

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
that direction and the blue chalice

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.120 
that direction and the blue chalice
hasn't<00:03:40.870> really<00:03:41.019> been<00:03:41.140> doing<00:03:41.320> too<00:03:41.650> much<00:03:41.920> I

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
hasn't really been doing too much I

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.400 
hasn't really been doing too much I
think<00:03:42.190> if<00:03:42.550> you<00:03:42.640> can<00:03:42.820> see<00:03:43.180> there's<00:03:43.600> some<00:03:43.930> hair

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
think if you can see there's some hair

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.040 
think if you can see there's some hair
algae<00:03:44.890> behind<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.450> I'm<00:03:46.450> not<00:03:46.570> sure<00:03:46.630> if<00:03:46.930> I'm

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
algae behind it I'm not sure if I'm

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.199 
algae behind it I'm not sure if I'm
going<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:48.190> know<00:03:48.280> detach<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.970> try<00:03:49.150> to

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
going to you know detach it try to

remove some of that algae it might be

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.440 
remove some of that algae it might be
stunting<00:03:51.340> its<00:03:51.489> growth<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.880> little<00:03:51.970> bit<00:03:52.239> but

attached<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.830> tentacles<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:34.780> might<00:04:35.380> be

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
attached to the tentacles so I might be

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.670 
attached to the tentacles so I might be
moving<00:04:35.800> him<00:04:36.039> into<00:04:36.430> another<00:04:36.669> tank

moving him into another tank

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.740 
moving him into another tank
but<00:04:38.680> other<00:04:38.830> than<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.520> added<00:04:39.730> some<00:04:40.540> cleaner

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
days after I cleaned the glass I started

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.380 
days after I cleaned the glass I started
to<00:05:11.830> get<00:05:11.890> some<00:05:12.070> algae<00:05:12.430> on<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.580> glass<00:05:12.670> light

to get some algae on the glass light
green<00:05:13.690> algae<00:05:14.550> there<00:05:15.550> are<00:05:15.670> a<00:05:15.730> few<00:05:15.940> reasons<00:05:16.150> this

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
green algae there are a few reasons this

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.270 
green algae there are a few reasons this
could<00:05:16.690> be<00:05:16.810> happening

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
could be happening

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.690 
could be happening
my<00:05:18.730> pure<00:05:19.060> gen<00:05:19.360> needed<00:05:19.990> recharged<00:05:20.620> so<00:05:21.190> I<00:05:21.220> put<00:05:21.580> in

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
my pure gen needed recharged so I put in

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.360 
my pure gen needed recharged so I put in
new<00:05:21.850> pure<00:05:22.150> gen<00:05:22.360> I<00:05:22.450> just<00:05:22.630> did<00:05:22.750> that<00:05:22.870> yesterday

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
new pure gen I just did that yesterday

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.210 
new pure gen I just did that yesterday
and<00:05:24.370> I<00:05:25.240> sort<00:05:26.170> of<00:05:26.260> slipped<00:05:26.650> on<00:05:26.830> some<00:05:27.040> of<00:05:27.130> my

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
and I sort of slipped on some of my

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.070 
and I sort of slipped on some of my
water<00:05:27.430> changes<00:05:28.000> for<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.240> while<00:05:28.420> there<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:28.840> I've

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
water changes for a while there and I've

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.270 
water changes for a while there and I've
been<00:05:29.200> trying<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.470> keep<00:05:29.650> up<00:05:29.830> with<00:05:29.860> them<00:05:30.100> more

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
been trying to keep up with them more

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.000 
been trying to keep up with them more
lately<00:05:30.670> so<00:05:31.360> I'm<00:05:31.450> hoping<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.900> those<00:05:32.080> those

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
lately so I'm hoping that those those

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.660 
lately so I'm hoping that those those
couple<00:05:33.370> things<00:05:33.610> will<00:05:33.910> improve<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:36.160> growth

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
couple things will improve the growth

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.790 
couple things will improve the growth
rate<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.030> the<00:05:37.240> algae<00:05:37.720> in<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:37.870> tank<00:05:38.170> but

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
rate of the algae in the tank but

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.770 
rate of the algae in the tank but
besides<00:05:39.100> that<00:05:39.510> everything's<00:05:40.510> looking<00:05:40.630> really

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
besides that everything's looking really

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.870 
besides that everything's looking really
good<00:05:41.140> oh<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:42.130> last<00:05:42.280> thing<00:05:42.400> I<00:05:42.550> want<00:05:42.730> to<00:05:42.820> mention

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
good oh the last thing I want to mention

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.520 
good oh the last thing I want to mention
is<00:05:43.270> that<00:05:43.450> I<00:05:43.510> don't<00:05:43.630> believe<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:44.170> have<00:05:44.320> enough

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
is that I don't believe I have enough

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.180 
is that I don't believe I have enough
flow<00:05:44.770> in<00:05:44.920> the<00:05:45.010> tank<00:05:45.220> I<00:05:45.840> added<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.140> hide<00:05:48.010> or

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
flow in the tank I added the hide or

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.240 
flow in the tank I added the hide or
Corellia<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:49.090> believe<00:05:49.690> it's<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:49.900> 240<00:05:50.530> gallon<00:05:51.100> per

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
Corellia I believe it's a 240 gallon per

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.310 
Corellia I believe it's a 240 gallon per
hour<00:05:51.280> pump<00:05:51.520> back<00:05:51.910> there<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.420> I<00:05:52.990> think<00:05:53.200> it's

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
hour pump back there and I think it's

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.110 
hour pump back there and I think it's
just<00:05:53.410> not<00:05:53.620> cutting<00:05:53.920> it<00:05:54.100> so<00:05:54.370> I'm<00:05:54.700> pretty<00:05:54.730> sure

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
just not cutting it so I'm pretty sure

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.060 
just not cutting it so I'm pretty sure
that<00:05:55.300> I'm<00:05:55.540> going<00:05:55.750> to<00:05:55.840> upgrade<00:05:56.380> that<00:05:56.410> pump<00:05:56.890> in

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
that I'm going to upgrade that pump in

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.580 
that I'm going to upgrade that pump in
the<00:05:57.250> near<00:05:57.430> future<00:05:57.670> to<00:05:58.030> roughly<00:05:58.330> I<00:05:58.450> think<00:05:58.870> the

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
the near future to roughly I think the

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.590 
the near future to roughly I think the
next<00:05:59.860> one<00:05:59.980> up<00:06:00.100> is<00:06:00.220> like<00:06:00.340> a<00:06:00.400> 400<00:06:01.120> or<00:06:01.300> a<00:06:01.330> 425<00:06:03.570> but<00:06:04.570> I

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
next one up is like a 400 or a 425 but I

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.300 
next one up is like a 400 or a 425 but I
have<00:06:05.290> a<00:06:05.320> feeling<00:06:05.710> that<00:06:05.800> that<00:06:05.860> will<00:06:06.040> work<00:06:06.190> out

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
have a feeling that that will work out

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.490 
have a feeling that that will work out
better<00:06:06.550> in<00:06:06.670> this<00:06:06.790> tank<00:06:07.090> so<00:06:07.360> if<00:06:07.750> you've<00:06:08.470> been

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
better in this tank so if you've been

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.350 
better in this tank so if you've been
following<00:06:08.860> my<00:06:09.130> videos<00:06:09.460> all<00:06:09.640> along<00:06:09.910> and<00:06:10.210> you're

following my videos all along and you're

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.060 
following my videos all along and you're

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.530 
starting a bio cube tank of your own I
would<00:06:12.280> say<00:06:12.460> if<00:06:12.580> you're<00:06:12.730> going<00:06:12.760> to<00:06:13.090> add<00:06:13.240> another

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
would say if you're going to add another

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.910 
would say if you're going to add another
pump<00:06:14.170> the<00:06:15.160> hydraulic<00:06:15.940> Oralia<00:06:16.540> 240<00:06:17.440> is<00:06:17.620> not

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
pump the hydraulic Oralia 240 is not

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.590 
pump the hydraulic Oralia 240 is not
quite<00:06:18.280> strong<00:06:18.640> enough<00:06:18.700> so<00:06:19.150> you'll<00:06:19.270> want<00:06:19.510> to

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
quite strong enough so you'll want to

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.750 
quite strong enough so you'll want to
beef<00:06:19.780> it<00:06:19.900> up<00:06:20.020> a<00:06:20.200> little<00:06:20.470> bit<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:20.950> go<00:06:21.520> with<00:06:21.670> the

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
beef it up a little bit I go with the

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.680 
beef it up a little bit I go with the
four<00:06:22.060> like<00:06:22.480> I<00:06:22.570> said<00:06:22.750> 400<00:06:23.350> 425<00:06:23.920> whatever<00:06:24.690> model

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
four like I said 400 425 whatever model

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.320 
four like I said 400 425 whatever model
they<00:06:25.840> they<00:06:26.770> have<00:06:26.980> available<00:06:27.250> there<00:06:27.760> oh<00:06:27.910> look

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
they they have available there oh look

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.620 
they they have available there oh look
'iron<00:06:28.630> he's<00:06:28.870> swimming<00:06:29.200> out<00:06:29.290> in<00:06:29.320> the<00:06:29.380> middle

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
'iron he's swimming out in the middle

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.340 
'iron he's swimming out in the middle
it's<00:06:31.630> kind<00:06:31.750> of<00:06:31.810> cool<00:06:32.160> anyway<00:06:33.720> so<00:06:34.720> this<00:06:35.230> has

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
it's kind of cool anyway so this has

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.890 
it's kind of cool anyway so this has
been<00:06:35.470> five<00:06:35.650> months<00:06:36.150> I'm<00:06:37.150> hoping<00:06:37.420> to<00:06:37.540> get<00:06:37.660> one

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
been five months I'm hoping to get one

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.170 
been five months I'm hoping to get one
more<00:06:38.080> coral<00:06:38.590> that'll<00:06:38.950> probably<00:06:39.100> go<00:06:39.310> down<00:06:39.760> here

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
more coral that'll probably go down here

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.330 
more coral that'll probably go down here
I<00:06:40.330> don't<00:06:40.990> know<00:06:41.260> what<00:06:41.530> I'd<00:06:41.650> like<00:06:41.770> to<00:06:41.830> get<00:06:42.070> yet

I don't know what I'd like to get yet
I'm<00:06:42.820> still<00:06:43.090> thinking<00:06:43.450> about<00:06:43.510> that<00:06:43.660> and<00:06:44.669> other

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669

than that like I said I'm going to try
to<00:06:47.620> get<00:06:47.950> a<00:06:48.130> stronger<00:06:49.090> power<00:06:49.660> head

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
to get a stronger power head

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.670 
to get a stronger power head
to<00:06:50.729> move<00:06:51.150> the<00:06:51.389> water<00:06:51.599> through<00:06:52.169> the<00:06:52.289> tank<00:06:52.560> a

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
to move the water through the tank a

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.770 
to move the water through the tank a
little<00:06:52.710> bit<00:06:53.099> more<00:06:53.849> often<00:06:54.030> than<00:06:54.389> it<00:06:54.509> is<00:06:54.629> right

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
little bit more often than it is right
