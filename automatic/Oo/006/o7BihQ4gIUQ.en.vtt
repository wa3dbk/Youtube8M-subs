00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:23.783
Tucket the Bucket

00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:29.033
By Kuzhali Manickavel

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:36.033
Tucket was the saddest bucket in the world.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.533
He had once been

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.033
a garden favourite

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.700
and the gardener used to swing him

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.117
by his strong handle as he went to fetch water.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:51.783
“What a good bucket”,

00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:57.033
he said.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:08.117
But as time passed, Tucket the bucket got a hole.

00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:12.533
What good is a bucket with a hole?

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:18.617
Tucket was tossed into the corner of the garden.

00:01:18.617 --> 00:01:22.200
He was left out in the rain and the sun

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.617
and began to rust.

00:01:25.617 --> 00:01:29.367
Sometimes he even got

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.283
kicked around.

00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:34.950
“I should throw that bucket away”,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.450
the gardener muttered.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.617
Tucket didn’t want to be thrown away.

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:46.700
He felt very sad,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.533
though his good friends in the garden

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:52.283
tried to cheer him up.

00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:55.367
The squirrels set him back up

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:58.700
when he was kicked down

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.783
and the birds cheerfully flapped about him.

00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:05.617
“Don’t worry Tucket!” they chirped

00:02:05.617 --> 00:02:09.033
soothingly.

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.450
Tucket really tried to be happy

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.283
but it was very, very hard.

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:19.200
One day,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.617
a little girl ran through the garden

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:24.700
and stopped in front of Tucket.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.283
He sighed and waited for the usual kicks

00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:33.367
when suddenly he heard “Perfect!”

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:35.617
Soon he found himself

00:02:35.617 --> 00:02:38.617
blinking and spluttering

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:40.700
under the garden hose.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.617
The girl was cleaning him!

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:46.783
He felt heavy chunks of rust fall off

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:52.450
and his spirits brightened.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.033
“Oh! You already have a big hole  in the bottom!”

00:02:56.033 --> 00:03:00.283
said the girl as she peered inside.

00:03:00.283 --> 00:03:02.617
“Even better!”

00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:04.367
Tucket could not believe

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:08.950
what he had just heard.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.617
She wanted a bucket with a hole?

00:03:15.617 --> 00:03:18.617
The girl took him to the veranda,

00:03:18.617 --> 00:03:20.867
filled him with rich soil

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:29.867
and planted a tiny rose inside.

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:33.200
“This is a baby rose.” she said to Tucket.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.783
“You must help me

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:42.033
take care of her, ok?”

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:45.867
Tucket was so happy.

00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:49.950
The girl really wanted him!

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.117
She even asked him to take care of this small rose.

00:03:56.117 --> 00:03:59.617
Tucket nearly burst with joy.

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:02.450
He straightened himself

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.450
up proudly as the girl

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.700
finished planting.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.117
She carefully placed Tucket

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:16.117
in the best spot of the veranda.

00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:18.200
It was a cozy corner,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.700
protected from the wind and the rain.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.867
Tucket winked and smiled

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:31.117
at his friends in the garden.

00:04:31.117 --> 00:04:37.950
“Look, I’m taking care of this little rose!”

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.450
“We're very happy for you Tucket,”

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.867
chattered the squirrels

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:48.617
and the birds chirped happily.

00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:51.033
Tucket took great care

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:53.700
of the rose

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.700
and was visited by the girl

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.950
and his friends

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.950
every day.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.283
He was now

00:05:02.283 --> 00:05:06.533
the happiest bucket in the world.
