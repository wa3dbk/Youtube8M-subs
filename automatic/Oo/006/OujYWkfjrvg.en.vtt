00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
teammates do this glitch of all the time

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.000 
teammates do this glitch of all the time
in<00:00:21.570> every<00:00:21.869> live<00:00:22.020> stream<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.529> beginning<00:00:22.920> of

can see here I've upgraded the b23r in
this<00:00:41.910> second<00:00:42.210> clip<00:00:42.450> here<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.230> actually

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the trample steam on like round three

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.830 
the trample steam on like round three
years<00:00:59.010> off<00:00:59.190> then<00:00:59.370> jump<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.180> grab<00:01:00.719> your

trample steam and what you want to do is
base<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.000> off<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.420> line<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:03.870> here

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
base it off of this line right here

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.649 
base it off of this line right here
right<00:01:04.619> by<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:05.970> rock<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.510> see

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
right by this this little rock you see

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.090 
right by this this little rock you see
on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.810> ground<00:01:07.080> you'll<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> black<00:01:07.740> line<00:01:08.070> on

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
on the ground you'll see a black line on

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.219 
on the ground you'll see a black line on
it<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.090> basically<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> line<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.020> up

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
it and you basically want to line it up

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
it and you basically want to line it up
with<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.619> now<00:01:11.100> go<00:01:11.310> over<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> left<00:01:12.030> side

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
with that now go over to the left side

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.039 
with that now go over to the left side
or<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:12.810> side<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> b23r<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.549> move

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
or the right side of the b23r and move

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.249 
or the right side of the b23r and move
slightly<00:01:16.049> forward<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.600> should<00:01:18.990> get

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
be in the glitch you can actually stay

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.830 
be in the glitch you can actually stay
right<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:33.000> safe<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.810> i

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
right here but it's not safe so i

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.660 
right here but it's not safe so i
recommend<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.530> move<00:01:34.770> forward<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.250> bit<00:01:35.430> get

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
recommend you move forward a bit get

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
recommend you move forward a bit get
smacked<00:01:36.000> again<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.540> you'll<00:01:36.689> stay<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.079> here

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

where<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.549> new<00:01:38.820> after<00:01:39.299> patch<00:01:39.329> glitch<00:01:40.259> will

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
where the new after patch glitch will

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.170 
where the new after patch glitch will
work<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> here's<00:01:43.049> another<00:01:43.399> little<00:01:44.399> tutorial

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
work so here's another little tutorial

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
work so here's another little tutorial
on<00:01:45.509> doing<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.990> basically<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> exact

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
on doing it basically it's the exact

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.770 
on doing it basically it's the exact
same<00:01:47.280> line<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> line<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.210> with<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.540> rock

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
same line I line it up with that rock

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.819 
same line I line it up with that rock
right<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.250> go<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.850> side<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
right there go to the right side of the

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.130 
right there go to the right side of the
b23r<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.820> want<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.180> closer<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
b23r and you want to be closer to the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.520 
b23r and you want to be closer to the
wall<00:01:55.380> than<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:55.920> trample<00:01:56.430> steam<00:01:57.409> you'll<00:01:58.409> get

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
wall than your trample steam you'll get

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
wall than your trample steam you'll get
launched<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.850> see<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
launched there and you have to see the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
launched there and you have to see the
gun<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.170> or<00:02:01.680> else<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.009> know<00:02:02.159> you're

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
gun like this or else you know you're

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
gun like this or else you know you're
not<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> glitch<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.479> want<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.719> get

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
not in the glitch you want to get

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.830 
not in the glitch you want to get
smacked<00:02:04.229> twice<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.520> boom<00:02:06.210> you're<00:02:06.390> behind<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
smacked twice and boom you're behind the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.979 
smacked twice and boom you're behind the
thing<00:02:07.049> now<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:08.009> was<00:02:08.220> before<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.270> patch<00:02:09.479> so

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
thing now this was before the patch so

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.620 
thing now this was before the patch so
you<00:02:10.050> want<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.349> get<00:02:10.410> hit<00:02:10.649> up<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.220> more<00:02:11.610> time

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
you want to get hit up one more time

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.120 
you want to get hit up one more time
basically<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.110> works<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.440> exact<00:02:13.710> same<00:02:13.920> way

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
basically it works the exact same way
