00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.450
 people I think it's going to cost us 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.870
 very much come but with a lot of salt 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.870
 First 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.420

 I have not counted the 12 seconds again and 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.540
 he has sent me a 1 to 1 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.800
 and that's what I'd be living the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.680
 car if he were alive 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.530

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.950
 hill the sun is telling me to go 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.440

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.200

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.950

 side and nothing else in the air what 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.280

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.880

 It's worth if you play in races of 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:33.490
 SUVs do not trust the public 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:37.060
 wait for me at two doors is to expect less 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.190

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.639
