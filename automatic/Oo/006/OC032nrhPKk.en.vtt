he's<00:00:19.830> been<00:00:19.980> keeping<00:00:20.070> his<00:00:20.279> bar<00:00:20.460> pretty<00:00:20.640> high

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.859 
made a lot of really cool maps back in
reach<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.580> enjoyed<00:00:23.880> he<00:00:24.119> was<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> I

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
reach that I enjoyed he was in the I

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.509 
reach that I enjoyed he was in the I
think<00:00:25.109> an<00:00:25.170> episode<00:00:25.500> or<00:00:25.529> two<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.800> forge<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
think an episode or two of forge of the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.259 
think an episode or two of forge of the
future

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
future

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.419 
future
so<00:00:27.689> he's<00:00:28.050> back<00:00:28.230> where<00:00:28.560> he's<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.099> channel

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so he's back where he's on this channel

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.359 
so he's back where he's on this channel
again<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.210> always<00:00:31.019> loved<00:00:31.170> his<00:00:31.320> Maps<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:31.890> anyway

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
again I always loved his Maps but anyway

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.310 
again I always loved his Maps but anyway
this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.850> 8<00:00:33.210> o'clock<00:00:33.270> reminiscence<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.230> it's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
this is 8 o'clock reminiscence and it's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
this is 8 o'clock reminiscence and it's
a<00:00:34.380> very<00:00:34.649> well<00:00:34.950> done<00:00:35.280> urban<00:00:35.730> map<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:36.120> on

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
a very well done urban map here on

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.880 
a very well done urban map here on
ravine<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.410> probably<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
ravine it's probably one of the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.569 
ravine it's probably one of the
better-looking

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
better-looking

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.510 
better-looking
urban<00:00:38.969> maps<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.329> I've<00:00:39.420> ever<00:00:39.510> seen<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.960> ravine

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
urban maps that I've ever seen on ravine

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.069 
urban maps that I've ever seen on ravine
urban<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> very<00:00:41.910> hard<00:00:42.210> style<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> pull<00:00:42.899> off

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
urban is a very hard style to pull off

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.500 
urban is a very hard style to pull off
just<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.969> difficult<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> do

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
just because it's it's difficult to do

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.610 
just because it's it's difficult to do
something<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.930> doesn't<00:00:46.050> look<00:00:46.230> too<00:00:46.350> blocky

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
something that doesn't look too blocky

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.779 
something that doesn't look too blocky
it<00:00:46.860> doesn't<00:00:47.100> look<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.670> just

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it doesn't look like it's just

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
it doesn't look like it's just
completely<00:00:48.390> made<00:00:48.600> out<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.780> forged<00:00:49.020> blocks<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
completely made out of forged blocks I

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.270 
completely made out of forged blocks I
don't<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.770> how<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.890> explain<00:00:50.219> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
don't really know how to explain that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.790 
don't really know how to explain that
but<00:00:50.489> there's<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> look<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> this

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
but there's it is not that look to this

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.279 
but there's it is not that look to this
map<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.250> looks<00:00:53.280> Obon<00:00:53.910> uses<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> pieces<00:00:55.140> in

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
map it looks Obon uses the pieces in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.319 
map it looks Obon uses the pieces in
interesting<00:00:55.710> ways<00:00:55.890> rotate<00:00:56.340> some<00:00:56.460> round<00:00:56.730> uses

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
interesting ways rotate some round uses

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.490 
interesting ways rotate some round uses
things<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.690> ways<00:00:57.809> yet<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.199> wouldn't<00:00:58.350> normally

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
things in ways yet you wouldn't normally

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
things in ways yet you wouldn't normally
expect<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:59.370> try<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> create<00:00:59.910> something<00:01:00.180> that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
expect they try to create something that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.389 
expect they try to create something that
looked<00:01:00.539> interesting<00:01:01.170> there's<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.190> nicely

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
looked interesting there's like nicely

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
looked interesting there's like nicely
paved<00:01:02.730> roads<00:01:03.120> everywhere<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:03.870> even<00:01:04.049> like

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
paved roads everywhere there's even like

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
paved roads everywhere there's even like
a<00:01:04.199> phone<00:01:04.530> booth<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.280> there's<00:01:05.670> lots<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
a phone booth and there's lots of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.250 
a phone booth and there's lots of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
different rooftops and stuff to go on

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.140 
different rooftops and stuff to go on
too<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.729> let<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> guys<00:01:09.030> know

too and I do want to let you guys know

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.730 
too and I do want to let you guys know
that<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.420> map<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.780> currently<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.200> flux<00:01:10.470> it's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that this map is currently in flux it's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.399 
that this map is currently in flux it's
still<00:01:11.070> being<00:01:11.220> worked<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:12.020> he's<00:01:13.020> making

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
still being worked on he's making

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170 
still being worked on he's making
updates<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.070> map<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.460> fixes<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
updates to this map and fixes and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.710 
updates to this map and fixes and
balancing<00:01:15.740> changes<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:16.920> time<00:01:17.280> goes<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
balancing changes as time goes on so the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.060 
balancing changes as time goes on so the
version<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> map<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.560> download<00:01:19.860> from<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
version of the map you download from a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.440 
version of the map you download from a
Spile<00:01:20.280> sure<00:01:20.460> may<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> final<00:01:21.180> one

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
Spile sure may not be the final one

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.700 
Spile sure may not be the final one
again<00:01:21.750> he's<00:01:21.930> always<00:01:22.080> working<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.530> map

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
again he's always working on this map

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
again he's always working on this map
it's<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:22.979> 100%<00:01:23.610> finished<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> want<00:01:24.450> you
