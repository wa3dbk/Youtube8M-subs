00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
a really important one for me so I think

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.240 
a really important one for me so I think
it<00:02:28.440> was<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> season<00:02:31.050> of

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
it was the the this is a season of

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.160 
it was the the this is a season of
