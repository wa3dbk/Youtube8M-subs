00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:40.060
 el o mundi is an emotion that can not 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.560
 explain 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.560
 I just recently arrived at the 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.740
 Sao Paulo and thank God I was able to debut 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.090
 well in the first game and to score a goal and 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.599
 help the team out with the win 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.250
 I'm happy now to give 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.250
 continuity in this has another game 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.440
 difficult now in Campinas and and ask the 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.580
 God, everything went well, we left. 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.400
 thing whenever positive results 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.349
 and it was an important game neither for our 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.840
 pretension in the championship we knew that 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.370
 had to win at home and we did not 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.860
 can play in the center and in the mind that is 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.310
 But in this field that campus 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.050
 of the field considered bad but ours 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.780
 The team was brave, huh? 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.569
 left the front then take a turn 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.060
 they can have the strength to turn and that's it 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.310
 there is the spirit the spirit of your 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.020
 winning spirit policy that wants 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.919
 always win and always be champion 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.009

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.690
