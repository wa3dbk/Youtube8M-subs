00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.520
 hello how good in this video I'm going 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.410
 to teach how to make a line in the video 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.410
 I taught you how to do 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.310
 a lipstick we did this that good here not 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.460
 you see the color that is but has been 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.930
 super black does not look good because the line 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.579
 I will explain how it is much more 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.240
 easy but I'm going to do it 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.970
 I've taken three tapas that would be line 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.730
 ers labiales bases 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.910
 but 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.150
 the labials and the lines are almost 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:48.030
 Exactly the same, just take it away 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:50.940
 skin and well then if you have not seen the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.930
 another video that easy 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.930
 you need two Vaseline materials 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.869
 eye shadow of the color that you want 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.840
 I gave myself my eyeliner I want it to be from 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.450
 another different color so I'm going to 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.759
 like me I know surely the rose 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.759
 or something can also be used blusher 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.500
 well then 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.330
 we just need good weight already apart 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.759
 I'm going to use a palette to go scratch 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.509
 You can also use a knife but that 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.509
 not of teeth 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.500
 good 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.180
 please watch the previous video for 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.530
 know why I have children machines 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.750
 that go east of the hello kitty ships 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.750
 of children but this one 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.040
 and in explaining 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.120
 and we are going to put a little bit of Vaseline 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.980
 keep in mind that if I put 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.980
 for example in 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.049
 ten centimeters of Vaseline does not 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.270
 it means that I'm going to have ten 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.650
 centimeters of line so that we have 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.500
 very much in mind now I'm going to catch 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.030
 this purple color I'm going to put on but 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.850
 very little because I am already 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.680
 scratching and even if it's girls I like 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.680
 this site 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.609
 Well, I'm going 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.609
 to throw 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:35.720
 and well I'm going to clean my 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.880
 stick because from another you can already use 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.010
 You can use this joke both 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.010
 much as they had as d 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.730
 line and keep in mind that if by 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.050
 example and now I see this color but at 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.100
 I wear the same disc also 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.020
 transfer 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.800
 as I told them completely 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.800
 transparent 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.350
 Well, I'm going to blush 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.350
 there are blogs 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.410
 terrassa 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.590
 but if you do it next to another one like that 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.940
 tapita is that I forgot to say 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:30.650
 I already had the materials in the cap 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.670
 it really has to have, as you say 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.049
 it has to be a plastic box 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.890
 Bone that you can put something of 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.890
 this substance 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.409
 It has to be that it has a cap because 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.409
 why 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.319
 I do not, I do not have it, so I'm going to 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.900
 put film paper and you can already 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.530
 take flour he says that there is more 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.530
 weather 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.760
 and there I did take the color that I want 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.060
 a great price 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.430
