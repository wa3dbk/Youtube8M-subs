00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.129
 Hi, guys and girls, I hope so 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.480
 see 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.700
 this great lord of reals close to how 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.290
 you take it pulls the locks later here 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.110
 on a map that I do not frequent with 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.990
 a weapon that I do not usually use 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.170
 too much that is with the cc is all 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.090
 dt is clear was adapted envy not 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.650
 I've seen nothing there, what are you 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.080
 entering and I say then let's go down 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.750
 a little something that they should have and 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.300
 the truth is that the truth is that something 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.340
 has has a male peculiarity and 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.350
 has a peculiarity and that is already a 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.970
 weapon that at the beginning the game did not 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.250
 ends of convincing is not a weapon 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.870
 let me say a lot 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.240
 the first big update that there was 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.380
 the famous big update as the 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.360
 truth is that I actually made a 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.590
 video I made a video where you play with 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.970
 and she just spoke good because 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.970
 poquillo on her 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.760
 but I really liked I liked it but 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.860
 really do not arrive do not get to use 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.650
 I really left the goddess 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.430
 parked again and after this last 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.930
 patch 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.220
 Well three quarters of the same thing because 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.330
 now I'm going to use those away from the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.300
 problem with this weapon when the 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.760
 game apart from that it was very mediocre 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.310
 I had the problem that I was so 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.040
 tired of seeing her in the first gameplay that 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:26.830
 it came out uncle is that it was uploaded to youtube 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.050
 my mother, we did not see much because 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.350
 everything in the first trailer because not such 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.910
 but but I swallowed it we go one 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.350
 behind another in is that the first 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.780
 battlefield trailer four more than 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.830
 more than ip arme what he did was download a 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.830
 little the illusion 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.140
 because there is no danger 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.310
 to lay right 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.420
 5 km has an impressive range the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.460
 another day I heard an explanation for 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.220
 what are you still burning and is that 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.200
 seen the explanation is that well that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.880
 it follows you is that you left once you feel like 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.060
 of the radius of the incendiary 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.430
 you're still good, it 's good 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.080
 explanation yes good explanation a little 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.300
 unnecessary because the truth that has been 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.410
 become very very upset yes yes 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.410
 especially in marjah 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.780
 On the other hand, on the other hand, I just 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.440
 fall right now in a coincidence or 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.300
 curiosity as I want to call it 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.760
 It's worth, it's worth a chance or 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.680
 curiosity as you want to call and it's that 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.120
 I became a fan very much a fan of 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.130
 incendiary and Molotov cocktails 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.930
 in Harlem I liked them very much and 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.930
 here from battlefield 4 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.900
 but talking about filling the eye is that 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.770
 just that to see so many hip marker 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.770
 per second 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.690
 is that it is very satisfactory, it is not 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.030
 can explain that is that something that does not 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.400
 get the low you throw the cocktail there 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.730
 molotov to the vault and you start 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.730
 to see that there is an epileptic seizure 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.150
 last the much I started I started we like 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:35.010
 the attacks be identified 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.010
 mlg prof by tuenti by tuenti blazer 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:46.219
 the reason for calling this weapon and that is 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:48.049
 is a direct competitor of the loud 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:50.420
 which is another weapon that also does not use 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.060
 much of the other day I actually took it out on 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.310
 a video and it goes well goes well after the 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.780
 update but the thing is that it's the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.630
 competitor the direct competitor 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.520
 why alone 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.380
 there's only one like this one there's only one with 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.810
 seven hundred bullets of cadence and in addition 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.300
 is that they are pretty similar and good 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.240
 statistically speaking crisis is 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.820
 practically speaking we go visually 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.920
 it does not look like mythical code you know no 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.770
 being is very ugly of what for 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.100
 compete against the boom in that sense 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.100
 that's the problem 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.720
 you have you have there is an enemy support 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.240
 and the one on the roof 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.320
 we can kill through the lion this one 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.600
 good 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:50.130
 like the fattest 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.660
 I'm royal as applied now how many 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.490
 Sometimes I will have died to revive a gray 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.860
 that he does not give a shit about me 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.069
 lifetime 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.210
 but but very little is good is good is 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.180
 good to be realistic 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.349
 yes I do not give a fuck and you 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.680
 they play in the skin to relive the 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.509
 guiri 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.210
 the best thing is when they kill you and the payment 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.289
 it happens and your duty that it goes away of the wood in 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.820
 how much is dead 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.820
 I'm very dead 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.480
 Well yes the truth is that 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.520
 to 805 is a weapon that does not seem very 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.780
 ugly that is, it does not seem ugly to me 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.670
 It seems pretty cool 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.960
 well that goes well the truth that goes very 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.540
 well what happens is that I do not know as if I 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.040
 missing some kind of personality that 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.240
 it's something that I 've complained about and you 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.070
 we have also complained enough 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.930
 times of many weapons of the toilet film 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.960
 sad as they lack a little that 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.120
 that touch say look i'm different 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.760
 I am the exact recipe something that says I am 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.860
 the recipe 805 the one that does a little 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.840
 different because it really is like a 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.820
 416 and in aesthetics you will not compete 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.610
 against a 416 and less in aesthetics 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.190
 it's that German aesthetic 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.400
 it's really not true that he has something 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.340
 that identifies it and is that it's hello 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.650
 the recipe and I'm mediocre 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.260
 but I do not think it's mediocre 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.660
 as now not now worked now not 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:17.100
 now not but welcomed the reputation it 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.050
 the cultores feel good for that image 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.190
 which has since good all the 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.560
 year practically we've been with 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.940
 he builds those conditions and even though 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.890
 then they had improved it because it leaves them 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.300
 a little bit there, I think it can be 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.280
 have been the case in my case to the 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.160
 less 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.830
 and also in the title and good here 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.150
 ends this game etc. you team does not 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.780
 we have done the truth great thing but it is 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.760
 that we are very and degreased 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.330
 I've been several days without playing and you have to 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.070
 to warm 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.930
 we are very degreased good 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.350
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.950
 next 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.950
 chao chao
