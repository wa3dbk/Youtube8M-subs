on<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> prototype<00:01:19.170> machine<00:01:19.619> didn't<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> lot

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
on a prototype machine didn't have a lot

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
on a prototype machine didn't have a lot
of<00:01:21.030> information<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.170> didn't<00:01:22.500> know

where<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.920> start<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.580> did<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.689> her<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
where to start I did have her have a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.140 
where to start I did have her have a
connection<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.950> someone<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> prototype

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
connection to someone with a prototype

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.649 
connection to someone with a prototype
printer<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:28.100> had<00:01:29.100> no<00:01:29.340> idea<00:01:29.369> how<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> printer

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
printer I had no idea how the printer

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.469 
printer I had no idea how the printer
worked<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.200> far<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.920> file<00:01:32.159> composition<00:01:32.939> size

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
worked as far as file composition size

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.560 
worked as far as file composition size
and<00:01:34.049> type<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.829> file<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.729> would<00:01:35.909> take<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.360> make

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and type of file it would take to make

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
and type of file it would take to make
this<00:01:36.900> work<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> phone<00:01:38.939> call<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
this work so with a phone call to the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.569 
this work so with a phone call to the
contact<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.509> found<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> took<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> sca<00:01:43.680> stl

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
contact I found that it took the sca stl

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.410 
contact I found that it took the sca stl
file<00:01:45.090> type<00:01:46.130> we<00:01:47.130> couldn't<00:01:47.549> tell<00:01:47.850> me<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.329> was

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
file type we couldn't tell me if it was

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.319 
file type we couldn't tell me if it was
binary<00:01:48.960> or<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> ski<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.520> normal<00:01:50.820> file<00:01:51.000> size

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
binary or a ski or the normal file size

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.840 
binary or a ski or the normal file size
so<00:01:51.630> i<00:01:51.659> made<00:01:51.930> my<00:01:52.110> project<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.799> guessed<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
so i made my project and guessed the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.220 
so i made my project and guessed the
wrist

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
wrist

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.940 
wrist
as<00:01:56.040> far<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.520> file<00:01:57.060> composition<00:01:57.870> i<00:01:58.140> started<00:01:58.800> in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
as far as file composition i started in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.150 
as far as file composition i started in
ZBrush<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.820> used<00:02:00.390> Z<00:02:00.900> spheres<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.710> create<00:02:02.010> the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
ZBrush and used Z spheres to create the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.100 
ZBrush and used Z spheres to create the
body<00:02:03.620> create<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.710> body<00:02:04.950> pose<00:02:05.280> only<00:02:05.910> he<00:02:06.720> had<00:02:06.900> no

exported<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.580> as<00:02:12.020> an<00:02:13.020> object<00:02:13.230> file<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:14.010> three

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
exported it as an object file with three

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.390 
exported it as an object file with three
subdivisions<00:02:14.760> i<00:02:15.800> created<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.920> head<00:02:17.130> using

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
subdivisions i created the head using

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.910 
subdivisions i created the head using
face<00:02:17.820> chin<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.450> save<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:19.590> an<00:02:19.740> object

for<00:02:36.180> all<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> fine<00:02:37.080> detailing<00:02:38.000> after

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
for all of the fine detailing after

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.790 
for all of the fine detailing after
doing<00:02:39.180> some<00:02:39.450> research<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.140> internet<00:02:40.560> I

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
doing some research on the internet I

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.210 
doing some research on the internet I
found<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.580> stl<00:02:42.240> file<00:02:42.800> format<00:02:43.800> could<00:02:44.070> be

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
found that the stl file format could be

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.670 
found that the stl file format could be
exported<00:02:44.700> from<00:02:44.970> 3d<00:02:45.300> studio<00:02:45.510> max<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.500> its

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
exported from 3d studio max and that its

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.210 
exported from 3d studio max and that its
information<00:02:47.160> came<00:02:47.790> from<00:02:47.850> surface<00:02:48.750> data<00:02:49.220> so

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
information came from surface data so

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.620 
information came from surface data so
once<00:02:50.460> all<00:02:50.730> my<00:02:51.480> detailing<00:02:52.110> was<00:02:52.260> complete<00:02:52.680> and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
once all my detailing was complete and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.550 
once all my detailing was complete and
zbrush<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.840> reopen<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.410> file<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.980> 3ds<00:02:56.820> max

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
added the gun created the helmet and

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.140 
added the gun created the helmet and

a bucket bucket hopefully a lot I
believe<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.100> bucket<00:04:18.669> comes<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.239> gallon<00:04:19.660> sized

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
believe a bucket comes in a gallon sized

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.860 
believe a bucket comes in a gallon sized
container<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.400> project<00:04:21.730> did<00:04:22.660> not

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
research I'm sure you can find companies

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.629 
research I'm sure you can find companies
that<00:04:28.389> will<00:04:28.540> print<00:04:28.840> your<00:04:29.080> stl<00:04:29.800> files<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:30.430> the
