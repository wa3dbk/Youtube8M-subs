00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.150

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.430

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.489

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.770
 where two lives that you will meet in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.649
 course of history in the neighborhoods 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:47.039
 popular negroni then climb which 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.079
 stairs and you will find this graffiti on 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.940
 this graffiti is written i 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.059
 messages concerning the old 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.320
 gta game protagonists as ad 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.390
 example victor never forget you always 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.480
 therefore all the messages 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.480
 addressed to the old characters 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.140
 then guys we will now have to direct 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.250
 in the shar and hicks neighborhood on 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.540
 dukes boulevard can be seen 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.310
 some artworks or some graffiti 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:43.320
 regarding the old top branded games 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:47.690
 star of the gta creed series and among them 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:56.610
 there are those of eightball the butter 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:59.840
 mixed today the ok but motion of the cover 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.840
 legitimized the sites 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.460
 in short, there really is everything here 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.240
 we can see gta san's helicopter 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.880
 andreas that is found on the cover is 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.200
 in short, this building is covered here 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:21.360
 there is the vice squad covered in graffiti 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:25.650
 concerning the old games then a 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.430
 really curious place spectacular 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.430
 these pieces 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.540
 I even know that all the facades 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.080
 they are covered, yes, ok, then anyway 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.080
 they repeat regularly 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.440
 I also checked on the roof 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.870
 there is no building on the roof 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.580
 nothing except a jacket 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:59.080
 bulletproof so if you need it is 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:02.069
 went to get it anyway really 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.069
 beautiful pieces 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.590
 here you can go up to the roof and 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.590
 take the jacket 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.630
 in short, the tour is over therefore 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.630
 I'd say move on to the next 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:33.120
 then we should go to the pitch from 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:38.420
 firefly island minigolf exactly 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:43.320
 ca and we can find some references 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.380
 in miniature of things already present in the 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:51.810
 For example, here is the lighthouse of 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:57.270
 various sites on the right we can 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:01.050
 find the big becker he was in 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.320
 was let's say a mascot in gta san 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.320
 andreas 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.960
 and from here 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.850
 there is the mill I warn that it was in the 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.020
 desert always by gta san andreas 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:20.570
 and here the hotel or is a virus ok gentlemen 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:23.240
 now let's head to an area near 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.530
 the previous one 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.530
 exactly here 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.060
 and the villa of the mafia in other words where 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.669
 we will also go throughout history 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.320
 and here on the back we could find some 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:45.340
 traces of blood that probably are 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.389
 due to a dragging of corpses in 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.590
 following the tracks 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:53.110
 we can then get here to the sea where 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.310
 the mafioso would have gotten rid of 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.310
 whose channel they were 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:07.300
 the next is in the hospital 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:13.080
 of the first island therefore we will have to enter 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.080
 meanwhile bugs have disappeared civilians 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.550
 oh well anyway it wasn't that anyway 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.050
 the important 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.500
 we can read here we are at the department of 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.810
 room radiology at 93 there is the number 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.669
 Satanic 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.320
 and here below are scratches on the floor 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:36.479
 that could have been done by a 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.479
 patient half stoned we say 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.479
 possessed 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.110
 and this is very interesting as a thing 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.379
 then there are rumors that say that 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.360
 around 2 am we say yes 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.520
 they would also hear screams coming 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.050
 from the room but unfortunately we are not 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.889
 at the right time so I can't 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:01.150
 check for this installment is everything and 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.150
 see you soon. Bye
