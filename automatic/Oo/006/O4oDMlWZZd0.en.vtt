completely<00:00:43.860> myself<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.700> basically<00:00:45.510> when<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
completely myself but basically when you

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.569 
completely myself but basically when you
should<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> bullet<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.890> gives<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.430> much

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
honey badger like I said the recoil is a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
honey badger like I said the recoil is a
little<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.829> noticeable<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> three
