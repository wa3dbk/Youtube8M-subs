 I like it too with the anglers too 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.610
 there is a lot to discuss here 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.460
 experienced anglers and it is always a 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.690
 to share pleasure information 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:49.149
 while sport is always love and 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:51.069
 Passion in doing what we can from 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:57.339
 people shell still expect what comes 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:58.299
 like every year we have a whole 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.460
 amount of novelties 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.889
 but we have a big event in the year 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.650
 and present the whole person like 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:07.000
 promote a long gap we believe it 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.039
 is something everyone can afford 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.070
 and at the same time very technically mature 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.070
 is 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.460
 We love this idea that you for 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:32.590
 cheap money all technical 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:34.630
 get the competition to fish well 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.310
 came to the market two years ago like 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.229
 it looks like that now that's actually 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.549
 a nice story because it's on 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.429
 only in our heads 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.869
 This michelle is an old company and 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.509
 We have a lot of experience 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.679
 we wanted something new and modern 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.369
 stylish for the young generation 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.369
 do 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.689
 So he started with his back 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.210
 Last year was a great year for 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.319
 our minds a full success many 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.390
 Fish were on our body 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.520
 caught and now we even have the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.369
 ruben still improved so comes one 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.630
 second generation of devices the high 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.670
 are cheaper and therefore better 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:20.500
 affordable for the plant and on it 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:22.600
 we are very proud and the other part 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.150
 from the series the bushes series has become 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:33.370
 but not changed in price 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:35.530
 new development the latest drinstecken 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.780
 be new features for the blanks 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.670
 a new carbon much lighter than 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:47.410
 the previous series and thus you have a lot 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:49.420
 more fun with it cheaper price for 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.260
 abi and the same price for 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.790
 the misere 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:06.100
 so we have twice the amount 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:08.290
 to adapt routes and we thought 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.630
 Software is not enough for us 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.370
 also bring out like all fish with 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.170
 heart beats and that is not outdated 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.080
 and just bring us a lot of fish 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.920
 So I want to show you a few 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.920
 come out this year 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.350
 what are you holding there 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.480
 i hold a size of the engine of the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.100
 ultras a slim built mini of the very 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.140
 is useful and in three different 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.790
 sizes and the possibility gives in three 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.220
 various deep with it to fish 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.260
 and so you can with the same model 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:53.740
 reach the fish where they are 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:56.470
 are active and what is your goal for 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.230
 its fish host this bait target 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.100
 zander hisses but mainly harsh 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.690
 and Schwarzbach 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.410
 if you're lucky what that 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.410
 energies are 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.920
 what is your preferred color 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.290
 favorite color is a few steaks and 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.120
 I like this yellow orange color because it 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.980
 it is very bright even when very dark 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.260
 Conditions are the same as on this day 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.490
 it rains and a cold front come as 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.490
 I use grille color
