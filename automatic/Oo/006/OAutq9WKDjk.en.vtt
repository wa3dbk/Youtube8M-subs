think it's a splendid show it also has

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.710 
think it's a splendid show it also has
some<00:00:25.050> how<00:00:25.169> his<00:00:25.380> personality<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:26.999> his

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
some how his personality is in there his

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.169 
some how his personality is in there his
constant<00:00:28.229> desire<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.739> reinvent<00:00:29.579> himself<00:00:29.729> with

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
constant desire to reinvent himself with

constant desire to reinvent himself with
every<00:00:30.390> new<00:00:30.509> project<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.979> really<00:00:32.160> recreate

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
every new project and to really recreate

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.100 
every new project and to really recreate
the<00:00:32.760> world<00:00:32.880> every<00:00:33.360> time<00:00:33.570> he<00:00:33.690> takes<00:00:33.930> on

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the world every time he takes on

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.360 
the world every time he takes on
something<00:00:34.470> new<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.830> I<00:00:34.860> think<00:00:34.890> that's<00:00:35.160> very

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
something new and I think that's very

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.580 
something new and I think that's very
inspiring<00:00:35.580> for<00:00:35.880> young<00:00:36.180> people<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.750> think

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
inspiring for young people I think

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.150 
inspiring for young people I think
Khan's<00:00:38.220> work<00:00:38.580> is<00:00:39.000> really<00:00:39.330> about<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.770> essence

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
Khan's work is really about the essence

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.390 
Khan's work is really about the essence
of<00:00:41.450> architecture<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.900> the<00:00:43.710> nature<00:00:44.010> of

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
of architecture about the nature of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.610 
of architecture about the nature of
architecture<00:00:45.240> and<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.260> role<00:00:46.590> that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
architecture and the role that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.890 
architecture and the role that
architecture<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.730> play<00:00:47.970> many<00:00:48.630> of<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
architecture can play many of the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.670 
architecture can play many of the
buildings<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.320> Luis<00:00:49.590> Khan<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.670> based<00:00:51.000> on

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
buildings of Luis Khan are based on

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.960 
buildings of Luis Khan are based on
ground<00:00:52.680> ground<00:00:53.280> plans<00:00:53.640> which<00:00:54.090> seem<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.780> follow

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
ground ground plans which seem to follow

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.180 
ground ground plans which seem to follow
polygonal<00:00:56.970> structures<00:00:57.630> that<00:00:57.810> somehow<00:00:58.190> remind

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
polygonal structures that somehow remind

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.729 
polygonal structures that somehow remind
the<00:00:59.370> shapes<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.940> crystal<00:01:00.540> forms<00:01:00.960> another

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the shapes of crystal forms another

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
the shapes of crystal forms another
aspect<00:01:02.220> in<00:01:02.340> his<00:01:02.460> work<00:01:02.700> is<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.030> treatment<00:01:03.600> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
aspect in his work is the treatment of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.739 
aspect in his work is the treatment of
lights<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:05.579> really<00:01:05.729> master<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.390> treating

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:06.749 
lights the is really master of treating

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:08.569 
lights the is really master of treating
light<00:01:06.899> in<00:01:07.109> architecture<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.399> also

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
light in architecture so we are also

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.940 
light in architecture so we are also
looking<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.329> a<00:01:09.450> work<00:01:09.659> which<00:01:10.079> continues<00:01:10.679> very

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
looking at a work which continues very

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.370 
looking at a work which continues very
concretely<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.850> inspire<00:01:12.569> some<00:01:12.929> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> most

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
concretely to inspire some of the most

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.289 
concretely to inspire some of the most
important<00:01:13.950> contemporary<00:01:14.579> architects<00:01:15.030> today

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
important contemporary architects today

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.739 
important contemporary architects today
well<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.200> had<00:01:16.819> discussions<00:01:17.819> with<00:01:18.060> our

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:18.749 
well we've had discussions with our

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.569 
well we've had discussions with our
friends<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.380> Swarovski<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.369> just

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
friends at Swarovski was not just

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.120 
friends at Swarovski was not just
barosky's

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
barosky's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.739 
barosky's
telling<00:01:23.130> them<00:01:23.280> about<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> preparation

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:24.749 
telling them about the the preparation

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:25.969 
telling them about the the preparation
of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.929> exhibition<00:01:25.319> at<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.469> very<00:01:25.619> early<00:01:25.799> stage

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
of the exhibition at a very early stage

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.700 
of the exhibition at a very early stage
and<00:01:26.249> somehow<00:01:26.939> these<00:01:27.119> are<00:01:27.179> aspects<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and somehow these are aspects which I

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
and somehow these are aspects which I
think<00:01:29.100> ours<00:01:29.249> are<00:01:29.399> very<00:01:29.609> important<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.149> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
think ours are very important in the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.050 
think ours are very important in the
work<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.600> philosophy<00:01:31.429> dealing<00:01:32.429> with<00:01:32.549> crystal

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
work of philosophy dealing with crystal

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.440 
work of philosophy dealing with crystal
and<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:34.280> distribution<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.729> lights<00:01:36.030> through

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and the distribution of lights through

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
and the distribution of lights through
crystal<00:01:36.899> but<00:01:37.020> also<00:01:37.170> through<00:01:37.530> their<00:01:37.649> projects

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
crystal but also through their projects

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.050 
crystal but also through their projects
that<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.520> designers<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.329> architects

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.800 

can't<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.570> words<00:01:44.810> here<00:01:45.439> is<00:01:45.619> that<00:01:46.329> it<00:01:47.329> wasn't

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
can't the words here is that it wasn't

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.419 
can't the words here is that it wasn't
till<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:47.990> Sun<00:01:48.380> shot<00:01:48.679> on<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.009> building<00:01:49.399> that

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
till the Sun shot on the building that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.179 
till the Sun shot on the building that
the<00:01:49.729> Sun<00:01:50.000> recognized<00:01:50.659> how<00:01:51.469> powerful<00:01:52.009> he<00:01:52.159> was

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
the Sun recognized how powerful he was

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.179 
the Sun recognized how powerful he was
and<00:01:52.789> an<00:01:53.450> architecture<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.530> beginning<00:01:55.069> of

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
and an architecture is beginning of

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.460 
and an architecture is beginning of
truth
