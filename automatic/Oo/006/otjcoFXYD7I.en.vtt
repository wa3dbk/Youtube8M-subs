00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.250 
guys can see I have a picture up it is
basically<00:00:34.120> just<00:00:34.270> a<00:00:34.540> little<00:00:34.810> bit<00:00:34.930> shorter<00:00:35.230> than

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
basically just a little bit shorter than

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.290 
basically just a little bit shorter than
a<00:00:35.380> full<00:00:35.710> block<00:00:35.950> layer<00:00:36.220> and<00:00:36.520> it's<00:00:36.610> like<00:00:36.970> pressed

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
a full block layer and it's like pressed

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.110 
a full block layer and it's like pressed
dirt<00:00:37.600> so<00:00:38.200> I'm<00:00:38.530> in<00:00:38.710> would<00:00:38.920> act<00:00:39.340> perfectly<00:00:39.730> as

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
dirt so I'm in would act perfectly as

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.270 
dirt so I'm in would act perfectly as
trails<00:00:40.450> roads<00:00:40.840> or<00:00:41.140> any<00:00:41.350> other<00:00:41.560> pathways<00:00:42.100> that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
trails roads or any other pathways that

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.040 
trails roads or any other pathways that
you<00:00:42.340> could<00:00:42.610> possibly<00:00:42.790> think<00:00:43.270> of<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.690> it<00:00:43.840> is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
you could possibly think of and it is

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.950 
you could possibly think of and it is
very<00:00:45.010> very<00:00:45.160> cool<00:00:45.910> I've<00:00:46.180> been<00:00:46.390> waiting<00:00:46.720> for

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.180 
see a pictures of Pocket Edition later
but<00:01:31.000> it's<00:01:31.119> basically<00:01:31.540> just<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:32.590> just<00:01:32.740> tested

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
but it's basically just you just tested

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.590

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
it out and made a little trail with it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.149 
it out and made a little trail with it
in<00:01:34.690> between<00:01:34.780> two<00:01:35.140> trees<00:01:35.170> very<00:01:35.650> nice<00:01:35.890> and

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
in between two trees very nice and

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.899 
in between two trees very nice and
that's<00:01:36.310> really<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:38.070> Jeb<00:01:39.070> then<00:01:39.340> tweeted<00:01:39.760> an

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
that's really it so Jeb then tweeted an

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.570 
that's really it so Jeb then tweeted an
mcpe<00:01:40.869> screenshot<00:01:41.650> of<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.830> path<00:01:42.010> this<00:01:42.310> same

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
mcpe screenshot of the path this same

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.510 
mcpe screenshot of the path this same
day<00:01:43.000> so<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.659> same<00:01:43.900> day<00:01:44.170> he<00:01:44.650> found<00:01:44.860> this<00:01:45.100> he

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
day so the same day he found this he

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.820 
day so the same day he found this he
made<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.060> he<00:01:46.210> put<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.479> in<00:01:46.600> two<00:01:46.830> different

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830

made it and he put it in two different
versions<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.340> game<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:48.729> ridiculous<00:01:49.270> so

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
versions of the game it's ridiculous so

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.679

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
this is a mcpe screenshot of the path

was proposing this idea he said maybe
you<00:02:14.349> could<00:02:14.590> right-click<00:02:14.889> the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
you could right-click the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.130 
you could right-click the
grass<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:16.220> get<00:02:16.610> press<00:02:17.210> dirt<00:02:17.450> kind<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:17.960> how

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
grass to get press dirt kind of like how

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.830 
grass to get press dirt kind of like how
you<00:02:18.250> right-click<00:02:19.250> dirt<00:02:19.820> with<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> hoe<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.330> get

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
you right-click dirt with a hoe to get

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.160 
you right-click dirt with a hoe to get
um<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:22.010> know<00:02:22.130> tilled<00:02:22.790> wind<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.420> he<00:02:23.930> basically

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
um you know tilled wind so he basically

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.540 
um you know tilled wind so he basically
said<00:02:24.440> let's<00:02:24.620> use<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.800> shovel<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.340> right-click

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
said let's use a shovel and right-click

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.880 
said let's use a shovel and right-click
the<00:02:25.910> dirt<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:27.290> will<00:02:27.440> create<00:02:27.560> press

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
the dirt and that will create press

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.460 
the dirt and that will create press
press<00:02:28.340> tile<00:02:28.610> press<00:02:28.910> land<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.390> I'm<00:02:29.690> assuming

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
press tile press land so I'm assuming

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.280 
press tile press land so I'm assuming
the<00:02:30.860> way<00:02:31.010> MCPE<00:02:31.730> works<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.330> if<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.630> tap<00:02:32.960> land

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the way MCPE works is if you tap land

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.830 
the way MCPE works is if you tap land
with<00:02:33.470> hoe<00:02:33.710> it'll<00:02:34.670> tell<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.270> if<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.510> hold

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
with hoe it'll tell it and if you hold

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.510 
with hoe it'll tell it and if you hold
on<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.380> land<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.680> hotel<00:02:37.010> break<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.340> I'm

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
on the land of the hotel break it I'm

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.760 
on the land of the hotel break it I'm
assuming<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.000> same<00:02:38.180> thing<00:02:38.450> will<00:02:38.870> work<00:02:38.900> with

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
assuming the same thing will work with

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.950 
assuming the same thing will work with
shovels<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.340> press<00:02:40.730> dirt<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.150> I'm<00:02:41.240> excited<00:02:41.510> to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
shovels and press dirt so I'm excited to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.680 
shovels and press dirt so I'm excited to
see<00:02:42.140> how<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.350> comes<00:02:42.830> along<00:02:43.180> obviously<00:02:44.180> we

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
see how that comes along obviously we

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.270 
see how that comes along obviously we
had<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:44.960> get<00:02:45.260> some<00:02:45.440> feedback<00:02:45.590> from<00:02:45.800> Tom<00:02:46.250> oh

later<00:03:05.750> these<00:03:06.230> roads<00:03:06.590> are<00:03:06.800> indeed<00:03:07.100> pretty<00:03:07.400> nice

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
later these roads are indeed pretty nice

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.060 
later these roads are indeed pretty nice
maybe<00:03:08.120> villages<00:03:08.990> could<00:03:09.200> use<00:03:09.350> them<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.800> being

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
maybe villages could use them and being

again the epic developer that he is he

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.120 
again the epic developer that he is he
decided<00:03:14.210> to<00:03:14.420> whip<00:03:14.660> up<00:03:14.870> out<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.380> nowhere<00:03:15.650> a

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
decided to whip up out of nowhere a

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.150 
decided to whip up out of nowhere a
village<00:03:16.880> generated<00:03:17.750> with<00:03:17.960> this<00:03:18.410> pressed<00:03:18.860> dirt

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
village generated with this pressed dirt

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.550 
village generated with this pressed dirt
instead<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.700> gravel<00:03:20.180> or<00:03:20.260> or<00:03:21.260> whatever

instead of gravel or or whatever

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.560 
instead of gravel or or whatever
sometimes<00:03:22.100> saying<00:03:22.550> obviously<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:23.090> one<00:03:23.270> is

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
sometimes saying obviously this one is

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.600 
sometimes saying obviously this one is
in<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.900> savanna<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.680> is<00:03:24.830> replacing<00:03:25.460> the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
in the savanna so it is replacing the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.580 
in the savanna so it is replacing the
road<00:03:26.240> blocks<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:26.900> were<00:03:27.080> there<00:03:27.320> which<00:03:27.500> are

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
road blocks that were there which are

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.690 
road blocks that were there which are
just<00:03:27.770> regular<00:03:27.980> blocks<00:03:28.370> would<00:03:28.460> have<00:03:28.610> already

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
just regular blocks would have already

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.650 
just regular blocks would have already
been<00:03:28.880> in<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.000> game<00:03:29.150> now<00:03:29.360> they<00:03:29.540> are

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
been in the game now they are

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.570 
been in the game now they are
specifically<00:03:30.320> road<00:03:30.590> blocks<00:03:30.860> or<00:03:31.040> path<00:03:31.220> blocks

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
specifically road blocks or path blocks

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.670 
specifically road blocks or path blocks
so<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.300> villagers<00:03:32.660> have<00:03:32.810> real<00:03:33.080> roads<00:03:33.410> now<00:03:33.650> I

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
so the villagers have real roads now I

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.230 
so the villagers have real roads now I
mean<00:03:34.010> they<00:03:34.100> were<00:03:34.160> sort<00:03:34.460> of<00:03:34.520> real<00:03:34.730> roads<00:03:34.970> but

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
mean they were sort of real roads but

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.060 
mean they were sort of real roads but
now<00:03:35.720> they're<00:03:36.020> real<00:03:36.290> roads<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:36.800> I'm<00:03:36.890> pretty

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
now they're real roads so I'm pretty

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.740 
now they're real roads so I'm pretty
excited<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.550> see<00:03:37.730> if<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.270> actually<00:03:38.630> going

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
excited to see if this is actually going

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.780 
excited to see if this is actually going
to<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:38.990> added<00:03:39.290> or<00:03:39.350> not<00:03:39.560> obviously<00:03:40.520> it<00:03:40.640> looks

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
to be added or not obviously it looks

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.000 
to be added or not obviously it looks
really<00:03:41.360> good<00:03:41.540> in<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.780> savanna<00:03:42.200> may<00:03:42.830> look

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
really good in the savanna may look

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.199 
really good in the savanna may look
different<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.460> different<00:03:43.550> biomes<00:03:44.090> just

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
different in different biomes just

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.490 
different in different biomes just
because<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.450> savanna<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.050> grass<00:03:45.260> is

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
because the savanna and the grass is

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.710 
because the savanna and the grass is
sort<00:03:45.830> of<00:03:45.920> brownish<00:03:46.580> orange<00:03:46.850> already<00:03:47.450> um

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
sort of brownish orange already um

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.110 
sort of brownish orange already um
obviously<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:48.890> would<00:03:49.040> not<00:03:49.310> go<00:03:49.610> well<00:03:49.820> in

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
obviously this would not go well in

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.810 
obviously this would not go well in
deserts<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:51.080> because<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:51.650> know<00:03:51.820> deserts

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
deserts just because you know deserts

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.449 
deserts just because you know deserts
and<00:03:53.120> dirt<00:03:54.020> doesn't<00:03:54.500> really<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:55.010> know<00:03:55.130> there'd

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
and dirt doesn't really you know there'd

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.400 
and dirt doesn't really you know there'd
be<00:03:55.610> pressed<00:03:55.910> sand<00:03:56.300> not<00:03:56.600> pressed<00:03:56.870> dirt<00:03:57.110> see<00:03:57.350> you

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
be pressed sand not pressed dirt see you

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.870 
be pressed sand not pressed dirt see you
guys<00:03:57.530> hear<00:03:57.709> them<00:03:57.830> saying<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:58.520> this<00:03:58.640> would<00:03:58.760> be

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
guys hear them saying but this would be

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.090 
guys hear them saying but this would be
really<00:03:59.000> cool<00:03:59.270> to<00:03:59.810> see<00:03:59.840> in<00:04:00.110> different<00:04:00.290> biomes<00:04:00.890> I

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
really cool to see in different biomes I

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.740 
really cool to see in different biomes I
mean<00:04:01.280> at<00:04:01.490> least<00:04:01.520> have<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.330> in<00:04:02.420> some<00:04:02.570> of<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
mean at least have it in some of the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.880 
mean at least have it in some of the
biomes<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.170> think<00:04:03.380> that<00:04:03.470> would<00:04:03.560> be<00:04:03.650> pretty<00:04:03.770> cool

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
biomes I think that would be pretty cool

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.410 
biomes I think that would be pretty cool
let<00:04:04.190> me<00:04:04.220> go<00:04:04.430> let<00:04:04.610> me<00:04:04.670> know<00:04:04.760> guys<00:04:05.030> what<00:04:05.270> do<00:04:05.330> you

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
let me go let me know guys what do you

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.850 
let me go let me know guys what do you
think<00:04:05.510> about<00:04:05.930> this<00:04:06.170> do<00:04:06.350> you<00:04:06.440> think<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.770> would

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
think about this do you think it would

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.380 
think about this do you think it would
look<00:04:07.010> cool<00:04:07.190> in<00:04:07.340> villages<00:04:07.730> or<00:04:08.120> would<00:04:08.270> you

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
look cool in villages or would you

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.720 
look cool in villages or would you
rather<00:04:08.510> just<00:04:08.630> have<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.170> on<00:04:09.770> your<00:04:10.100> own<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.550> not

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
rather just have it on your own and not

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.640 
rather just have it on your own and not
really<00:04:11.060> generated<00:04:11.630> with<00:04:11.810> villagers<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.410> think

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
really generated with villagers I think

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.260 
really generated with villagers I think
that's<00:04:13.070> pretty<00:04:13.310> sweet<00:04:13.700> but<00:04:13.730> yeah<00:04:14.000> that's

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
that's pretty sweet but yeah that's

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.699 
that's pretty sweet but yeah that's

know that you know because this is a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.840 
know that you know because this is a
monstrous<00:04:20.930> new<00:04:21.830> block<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.310> mean<00:04:22.460> new<00:04:22.610> blocks

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
monstrous new block I mean new blocks

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.580 
monstrous new block I mean new blocks
rarely<00:04:23.330> come<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.690> Minecraft<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.290> this<00:04:24.410> is

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
rarely come to Minecraft and this is

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.680 
rarely come to Minecraft and this is
coming<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:25.040> all<00:04:25.220> platforms<00:04:25.729> so<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.240> lot<00:04:26.570> of

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
coming to all platforms so a lot of

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.870 
coming to all platforms so a lot of
people<00:04:26.990> have<00:04:27.440> been<00:04:27.560> speculating<00:04:27.740> on

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
people have been speculating on

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.460 
people have been speculating on
different<00:04:29.090> ways<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.360> use<00:04:29.510> this<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:30.020> different

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
different ways to use this and different

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.980 
different ways to use this and different
ways<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.650> I<00:04:31.010> don't<00:04:31.280> know<00:04:31.400> change<00:04:31.730> it<00:04:31.880> up<00:04:32.000> modify

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
ways to I don't know change it up modify

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.270 
ways to I don't know change it up modify
it<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.260> stuff<00:04:33.440> like<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:33.980> know<00:04:34.100> I've

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
it and stuff like that you know I've

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.310 
it and stuff like that you know I've
seen<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.520> lot<00:04:34.790> of<00:04:34.850> pictures<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.450> people<00:04:35.540> you

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
seen a lot of pictures of people you

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.150 
seen a lot of pictures of people you
know<00:04:36.530> saying<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:37.460> know<00:04:37.580> our<00:04:37.760> people<00:04:38.180> you<00:04:38.960> know

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
know saying you know our people you know

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.960 
know saying you know our people you know
theorizing<00:04:40.160> what<00:04:40.310> this<00:04:40.460> thing<00:04:40.640> would<00:04:40.820> look

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
theorizing what this thing would look

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.660 
theorizing what this thing would look
like<00:04:41.180> with<00:04:41.540> texture<00:04:41.990> packs<00:04:42.200> so<00:04:42.440> I<00:04:42.650> have<00:04:43.460> seen

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
like with texture packs so I have seen

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.610 
like with texture packs so I have seen
it<00:04:43.820> look<00:04:44.000> I've<00:04:44.330> seen<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.870> same<00:04:45.050> kind<00:04:45.350> of<00:04:45.410> deal

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
it look I've seen the same kind of deal

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.920 
it look I've seen the same kind of deal
but<00:04:45.830> people<00:04:46.460> have<00:04:46.550> put<00:04:46.790> wooden<00:04:47.180> textures<00:04:47.600> over

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
but people have put wooden textures over

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.480 
but people have put wooden textures over
it<00:04:48.050> cobblestone<00:04:48.560> textures<00:04:49.010> stone<00:04:49.280> brick

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
it cobblestone textures stone brick

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.650 
it cobblestone textures stone brick
textures<00:04:49.880> all<00:04:50.030> these<00:04:50.150> different<00:04:50.390> types<00:04:50.510> of

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
textures all these different types of

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.170 
textures all these different types of
textures<00:04:51.080> over<00:04:51.260> this<00:04:52.040> pressed<00:04:52.460> dirt<00:04:52.700> so<00:04:53.150> they

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
textures over this pressed dirt so they

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.850 
textures over this pressed dirt so they
could<00:04:53.450> make<00:04:53.600> their<00:04:53.780> own<00:04:53.810> paths<00:04:54.200> like<00:04:54.470> wooden

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
could make their own paths like wooden

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.110 
could make their own paths like wooden
paths<00:04:55.070> that<00:04:55.250> go<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.430> little<00:04:55.580> bit<00:04:55.760> under<00:04:55.820> grass

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
paths that go a little bit under grass

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.210 
paths that go a little bit under grass
like<00:04:56.360> normal<00:04:56.750> I<00:04:56.900> like<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.590> normal<00:04:57.830> press<00:04:58.010> dirt

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
like normal I like the normal press dirt

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.010 
like normal I like the normal press dirt
but<00:04:58.430> just<00:04:58.640> you<00:04:59.030> know<00:04:59.060> it's<00:04:59.360> just<00:04:59.480> a<00:04:59.630> little<00:04:59.900> bit

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
but just you know it's just a little bit

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.190 
but just you know it's just a little bit
different<00:05:00.500> than<00:05:00.830> regular<00:05:01.660> wooden<00:05:02.660> force<00:05:02.930> and

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
different than regular wooden force and

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.780 
different than regular wooden force and
I<00:05:03.260> think<00:05:03.290> that<00:05:03.680> is<00:05:03.830> epic<00:05:04.070> if<00:05:04.370> we<00:05:04.490> could<00:05:04.640> get

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
I think that is epic if we could get

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.970 
I think that is epic if we could get
different<00:05:05.030> textures<00:05:05.630> or<00:05:05.930> different<00:05:06.470> types<00:05:06.710> of

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
different textures or different types of

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.710 
different textures or different types of
Road<00:05:07.280> I<00:05:07.640> think<00:05:08.000> that<00:05:08.120> would<00:05:08.210> be<00:05:08.240> pretty<00:05:08.450> sweet

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
Road I think that would be pretty sweet

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.630 
Road I think that would be pretty sweet
obviously<00:05:09.230> the<00:05:09.320> texture<00:05:09.620> bag<00:05:09.800> is<00:05:10.010> a<00:05:10.280> good

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
obviously the texture bag is a good

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.800 
obviously the texture bag is a good
solution<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.300> I<00:05:11.360> don't<00:05:11.420> know<00:05:11.600> if<00:05:11.690> different

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
solution to it I don't know if different

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.780 
solution to it I don't know if different
types<00:05:12.110> of<00:05:12.260> roads<00:05:12.980> would<00:05:13.190> be<00:05:13.310> very<00:05:13.520> more

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
types of roads would be very more

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.970 
types of roads would be very more
friendly<00:05:14.180> for<00:05:14.210> Minecraft<00:05:14.840> but<00:05:15.410> texture<00:05:15.770> packs

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
friendly for Minecraft but texture packs

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.740 
friendly for Minecraft but texture packs
would<00:05:16.220> offer<00:05:16.370> a<00:05:16.550> pretty<00:05:17.000> cool<00:05:17.210> variant<00:05:17.660> to

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
would offer a pretty cool variant to

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.420 
would offer a pretty cool variant to
anyone<00:05:18.050> who's<00:05:18.200> looking<00:05:18.470> for<00:05:18.710> more<00:05:18.920> fun<00:05:19.190> and

anyone who's looking for more fun and

I<00:05:22.220> think<00:05:22.520> seeing<00:05:23.000> that<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.330> future<00:05:23.600> is<00:05:23.660> going

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
I think seeing that the future is going

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.810 
I think seeing that the future is going
to<00:05:23.900> be<00:05:23.990> pretty<00:05:24.170> exciting<00:05:24.560> I<00:05:24.920> don't<00:05:25.370> have<00:05:25.580> no

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
to be pretty exciting I don't have no

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.880 
to be pretty exciting I don't have no
idea<00:05:26.150> I'm<00:05:26.390> just<00:05:26.420> very<00:05:26.990> very<00:05:27.440> excited<00:05:27.800> we're

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
getting a new Block in population and we

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.740 
getting a new Block in population and we
had<00:05:30.140> no<00:05:30.320> idea<00:05:30.350> until<00:05:30.920> a<00:05:31.430> few<00:05:31.730> days<00:05:31.820> ago<00:05:32.030> I<00:05:32.360> think

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750
