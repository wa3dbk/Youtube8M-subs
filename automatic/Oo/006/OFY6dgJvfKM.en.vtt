player chats in chat and the interface

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.929 
player chats in chat and the interface
we're<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> add<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.769> listener<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.820> this

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
we're going to add is listener so this

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.780 
we're going to add is listener so this
is<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.830> easier<00:00:31.830> way<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.430> typing

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
is a an easier way of just typing

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.880 
is a an easier way of just typing
implements<00:00:33.690> listener<00:00:34.079> every<00:00:34.320> time<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.800> the

implements listener every time at the
top<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.160> every<00:00:35.370> class<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.149> into

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
top of every class we can just go into

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.970 
top of every class we can just go into
interface<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.780> click<00:00:36.960> Add<00:00:37.140> search<00:00:37.739> for

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
interface it's click Add search for

interface it's click Add search for
listener<00:00:38.250> hit<00:00:38.610> finish<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.149> nicely<00:00:39.360> imports<00:00:40.110> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
listener hit finish it nicely imports it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.130 
listener hit finish it nicely imports it
for<00:00:40.440> us<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:40.950> good<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.629> before<00:00:42.840> we

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
for us it's all good so like before we

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.770 
for us it's all good so like before we
need<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> type<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.620> event<00:00:44.010> handler<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.780> control

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
need to type at event handler a control

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
need to type at event handler a control
space<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> make<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.260> easier<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.680> us<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.850> then

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
space to make it easier for us and then

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.650 
space to make it easier for us and then
public<00:00:49.050> void<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.649> player<00:00:50.219> chat<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.270> name<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
public void on player chat the name of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.439 
public void on player chat the name of
the<00:00:51.809> method<00:00:52.140> does<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.449> doesn't

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the method does not it's not doesn't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.200 
the method does not it's not doesn't
have<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.780> anything<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.110> specific<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:56.210> it's

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
have to be anything in specific but it's

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.020 
have to be anything in specific but it's
good<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.469> make<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.620> organized<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.640> brackets

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
good to make it organized so in brackets

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.950 
good to make it organized so in brackets
the<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> little<00:01:00.870> bit

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the one for this is a little bit

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.600 
the one for this is a little bit
different<00:01:01.399> it's<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.960> sync<00:01:04.220> player<00:01:05.220> chat<00:01:05.909> event

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
different it's a sync player chat event

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.510 
different it's a sync player chat event
and<00:01:08.610> we're<00:01:08.760> gonna<00:01:08.880> nickname<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.510> event<00:01:10.520> now

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and we're gonna nickname this event now

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.130 
and we're gonna nickname this event now
if<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> hover<00:01:11.790> over<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.869> import

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
if you hover over that we can import

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.520 
if you hover over that we can import
that<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.090> does<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> fires<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that so what this does is it fires the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
that so what this does is it fires the
event<00:01:18.140> differently<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.470> other<00:01:19.740> events<00:01:20.610> it's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
event differently to other events it's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.749 
event differently to other events it's
asynchronous

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
asynchronous

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.620 
asynchronous
so<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:23.939> why<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.330> little<00:01:24.509> bit

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
so that's why it's a little bit

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.060 
so that's why it's a little bit
different<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.990> got<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.320> sink<00:01:25.619> at<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.799> start

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
different it's got a sink at the start

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.469 
different it's got a sink at the start
of<00:01:26.100> instead<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.759> being<00:01:26.939> play<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> chat

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
of instead of just being play a chat

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.020 
of instead of just being play a chat
event<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.040> look<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.460> more<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
event you can look at that more on the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.469 
event you can look at that more on the
the<00:01:30.170> documents<00:01:31.170> online<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.040> wish<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.479> but

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the documents online if you wish to but

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.340 
the documents online if you wish to but
I'm<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.750> go<00:01:33.869> into<00:01:33.990> too<00:01:34.049> much<00:01:34.110> detail

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
I'm not gonna go into too much detail

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.660 
I'm not gonna go into too much detail
now<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.439> what<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.340> method

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
now so what we can do with this method

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.819 
now so what we can do with this method
is<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.150> check<00:01:39.329> who's<00:01:40.020> chatted<00:01:40.680> what

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
is we can check who's chatted what

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.080 
is we can check who's chatted what
they've<00:01:40.979> chatted<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.640> set<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:41.970> they've

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
they've chatted we can set what they've

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.539 
they've chatted we can set what they've
chatted<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.780> set<00:01:42.990> certain<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:44.009> but

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
chatted we can set certain things but

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.590 
chatted we can set certain things but
all<00:01:44.640> we're<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.149> we're<00:01:45.270> gonna<00:01:45.360> make

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
all we're gonna do is we're gonna make

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.710 
all we're gonna do is we're gonna make
like<00:01:45.930> before<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.210> whitelist<00:01:48.210> thing

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
like before with the whitelist thing

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
type dot two lower case so this converts

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.640 
type dot two lower case so this converts
the<00:03:00.000> whole<00:03:00.120> message<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.750> lower<00:03:01.050> case<00:03:01.230> format

naughty<00:03:40.320> word<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.970> may<00:03:42.239> not<00:03:42.720> use<00:03:43.560> it

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180
