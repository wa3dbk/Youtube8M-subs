00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
in this pan of stock the minute you put

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.720

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
this in start mixing it so that the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.539 
this in start mixing it so that the

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
starch gets dissolved and eventually

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.580

that the soup is also thickening at the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.890 
that the soup is also thickening at the
same<00:03:21.630> time<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.190> corn<00:03:23.519> kernels<00:03:24.060> will<00:03:24.570> stay

same time so the corn kernels will stay

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.960 
same time so the corn kernels will stay
as<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.980> will<00:03:26.010> get<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.340> nice<00:03:26.549> good

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
as it is you will get a nice good

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.720 
as it is you will get a nice good
mouthfeel<00:03:27.209> while<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.989> have<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.440> soup<00:03:28.769> so

mouthfeel while you have this soup so

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.229 
mouthfeel while you have this soup so

am NOT going to do it because I like it
like<00:05:56.160> this<00:05:56.400> light<00:05:56.820> now<00:05:57.690> we<00:05:57.750> have<00:05:58.140> to<00:05:58.290> add<00:05:58.470> in

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
like this light now we have to add in

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.980 
like this light now we have to add in
the<00:05:58.680> eggs<00:05:59.250> to<00:05:59.610> this<00:05:59.760> when<00:06:00.240> it<00:06:00.360> comes<00:06:00.570> to<00:06:00.690> adding

the eggs to this when it comes to adding

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.330 
the eggs to this when it comes to adding
it<00:06:01.140> to<00:06:01.260> this<00:06:01.380> if<00:06:01.530> you<00:06:01.560> want<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.920> egg<00:06:02.040> to<00:06:02.250> be

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
it to this if you want the egg to be

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.100 
it to this if you want the egg to be
absolutely<00:06:02.880> white<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.360> take<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.660> egg<00:06:03.810> white

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
absolutely white just take the egg white

absolutely white just take the egg white
and<00:06:04.260> not<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.620> egg<00:06:04.680> yolks<00:06:05.030> so<00:06:06.030> we'll<00:06:06.540> separate

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
and not the egg yolks so we'll separate

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.340 
and not the egg yolks so we'll separate
it<00:06:09.320> you<00:06:10.320> just<00:06:10.530> lightly<00:06:11.160> beat<00:06:11.790> it<00:06:12.170> you<00:06:13.170> don't

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
it you just lightly beat it you don't

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.920 
it you just lightly beat it you don't
want<00:06:13.620> it<00:06:13.890> to<00:06:14.130> get<00:06:14.280> frothy<00:06:17.120> and<00:06:18.120> we<00:06:18.630> will<00:06:18.720> just

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
want it to get frothy and we will just

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:27.470 
want it to get frothy and we will just
add<00:06:19.140> it<00:06:19.350> to<00:06:19.530> the<00:06:19.650> soup<00:06:22.340> and<00:06:23.340> let<00:06:23.700> this<00:06:25.400> cook<00:06:26.480> you

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
add it to the soup and let this cook you

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.000 
add it to the soup and let this cook you
see<00:06:27.660> this<00:06:27.840> the<00:06:28.140> minute<00:06:28.380> you<00:06:28.500> add<00:06:28.650> in<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:28.860> egg

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
see this the minute you add in the egg

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.220 
see this the minute you add in the egg
whites<00:06:29.250> will<00:06:29.520> find<00:06:29.850> this<00:06:30.060> light<00:06:30.450> threads<00:06:30.990> of

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
whites will find this light threads of

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.650 
whites will find this light threads of
the<00:06:31.350> egg<00:06:31.500> to<00:06:32.400> this<00:06:32.580> will<00:06:32.880> now<00:06:33.090> add<00:06:33.330> in<00:06:33.510> the

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
the egg to this will now add in the

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.030 
the egg to this will now add in the
crabmeat

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.960 

give<00:06:37.040> it<00:06:37.160> a<00:06:37.250> light<00:06:37.460> mix<00:06:38.980> switch<00:06:39.980> off<00:06:40.160> the<00:06:40.340> heat

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.740 

maybe<00:06:43.970> some<00:06:44.330> pepper<00:06:46.300> vinegar<00:06:47.300> we<00:06:47.450> haven't

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
maybe some pepper vinegar we haven't

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.730 
maybe some pepper vinegar we haven't
added<00:06:47.900> because<00:06:48.110> that<00:06:48.350> is<00:06:48.440> something<00:06:48.680> that

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
added because that is something that

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
will add when we have the soup but as of

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.860 
will add when we have the soup but as of
now<00:06:51.860> the<00:06:51.920> soup<00:06:52.340> is<00:06:52.550> ready<00:06:52.760> do<00:06:53.030> not<00:06:53.210> over<00:06:53.630> boil

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
now the soup is ready do not over boil

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.990 
now the soup is ready do not over boil
it<00:06:54.020> after<00:06:54.470> you've<00:06:54.620> added<00:06:54.830> the<00:06:55.160> crab<00:06:55.700> and<00:06:55.910> the

it after you've added the crab and the

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.420 
it after you've added the crab and the
egg<00:06:56.270> if<00:06:56.630> you<00:06:57.170> do<00:06:57.290> not<00:06:57.410> want<00:06:57.710> to<00:06:57.860> raise<00:06:58.040> the<00:06:58.280> egg

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
egg if you do not want to raise the egg

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.580 
egg if you do not want to raise the egg
yolk<00:06:58.700> you<00:06:58.850> please<00:06:59.180> beat<00:06:59.570> the<00:06:59.810> entire<00:07:00.200> mixture

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
yolk you please beat the entire mixture

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.320 
yolk you please beat the entire mixture
well<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.070> then<00:07:01.250> add<00:07:01.460> it<00:07:01.640> you<00:07:01.730> can<00:07:01.880> also<00:07:02.060> use<00:07:02.180> a

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
well and then add it you can also use a

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.840 
well and then add it you can also use a
sieve<00:07:02.780> so<00:07:03.470> when<00:07:03.650> you<00:07:03.740> pour<00:07:04.100> the<00:07:04.130> egg<00:07:04.490> into<00:07:04.730> a

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
sieve so when you pour the egg into a

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.270 
sieve so when you pour the egg into a
sieve<00:07:05.150> you<00:07:05.510> have<00:07:05.690> nice<00:07:05.930> thin<00:07:06.380> strands<00:07:06.830> of<00:07:07.070> egg

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
sieve you have nice thin strands of egg

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.190 
sieve you have nice thin strands of egg
so<00:07:07.850> you<00:07:07.880> don't<00:07:08.120> have<00:07:08.300> to<00:07:08.420> really<00:07:08.570> take<00:07:08.780> efforts

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.200 
so you don't have to really take efforts

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.110 
so you don't have to really take efforts
to<00:07:09.440> make<00:07:09.590> sure<00:07:09.800> that<00:07:09.890> it<00:07:10.040> comes<00:07:10.550> out<00:07:10.730> like<00:07:10.970> this

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
to make sure that it comes out like this

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.390 
to make sure that it comes out like this
it<00:07:11.360> comes<00:07:11.660> out<00:07:11.840> nicely<00:07:12.170> evenly<00:07:13.010> even<00:07:13.220> if<00:07:13.310> you

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
it comes out nicely evenly even if you

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.180 
it comes out nicely evenly even if you
pour<00:07:13.640> it<00:07:13.790> through<00:07:13.820> a<00:07:14.080> sieve<00:07:15.080> so<00:07:15.620> this<00:07:15.800> soup<00:07:16.040> is

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
pour it through a sieve so this soup is

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.210 
pour it through a sieve so this soup is
done<00:07:16.370> let's<00:07:16.820> serve<00:07:17.300> this<00:07:17.540> now<00:07:17.720> so<00:07:18.410> let's<00:07:18.860> take

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
done let's serve this now so let's take

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.270 
done let's serve this now so let's take
a<00:07:19.250> serving<00:07:19.790> bowl

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280
