00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
me two options build the train or build

me two options build the train or build
a<00:00:28.420> bagel<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.920> was<00:00:30.039> a<00:00:30.070> pretty<00:00:30.189> tough<00:00:30.400> choice<00:00:30.670> I

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
a bagel that was a pretty tough choice I

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.159 
a bagel that was a pretty tough choice I
had<00:00:31.000> no<00:00:31.119> idea<00:00:31.150> i<00:00:31.420> just<00:00:31.630> went<00:00:31.750> back<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.019> forth

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
had no idea i just went back and forth

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.540 
had no idea i just went back and forth
but<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.619> know<00:00:32.739> I<00:00:32.769> thought<00:00:33.100> it'd<00:00:33.250> be<00:00:33.400> a<00:00:33.430> little

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
but you know I thought it'd be a little

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.460 
but you know I thought it'd be a little
more<00:00:33.699> interesting<00:00:34.030> to<00:00:34.390> build<00:00:34.600> a<00:00:34.720> train<00:00:35.019> so<00:00:35.440> I

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
more interesting to build a train so I

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.910 
more interesting to build a train so I
went<00:00:36.100> at<00:00:36.280> it<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:36.519> it<00:00:37.480> was<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.720> bit<00:00:37.989> of<00:00:38.199> a<00:00:38.500> tough

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
went at it and it was a bit of a tough

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.650 
went at it and it was a bit of a tough
challenge<00:00:39.190> I<00:00:39.489> will<00:00:39.670> admit<00:00:40.000> building<00:00:40.450> a<00:00:40.510> train

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
challenge I will admit building a train

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.590 
challenge I will admit building a train
was<00:00:40.899> not<00:00:41.050> easy<00:00:41.379> but<00:00:41.890> anyway<00:00:42.280> this<00:00:42.610> is<00:00:42.850> my<00:00:42.879> best

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.360 

well<00:02:40.910> there<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.989> steam<00:02:42.680> engine<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
well there it is the steam engine the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.130 
well there it is the steam engine the
front<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:44.000> train<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.660> what<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:44.989> at

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
front of the train this is what is at

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.780 
front of the train this is what is at
the<00:02:45.260> front<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.830> pulls<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.250> whole<00:02:46.489> train

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
the front that pulls the whole train

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.729 
the front that pulls the whole train
along<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.360> try<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.630> go<00:02:47.780> for<00:02:47.930> an<00:02:48.050> old-school<00:02:48.530> kind

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
along I try to go for an old-school kind

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.130 
along I try to go for an old-school kind
of<00:02:48.860> steam<00:02:49.099> train<00:02:49.430> look<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:50.450> was<00:02:50.569> pretty<00:02:50.900> hard

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
of steam train look it was pretty hard

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.660 
of steam train look it was pretty hard
to<00:02:51.290> actually<00:02:51.739> put<00:02:52.040> together<00:02:52.130> believe<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.610> or

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
to actually put together believe it or

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.030 
to actually put together believe it or
not<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.750> shapes<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.319> train<00:02:54.530> involved<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.950> lot

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
not the shapes of a train involved a lot

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.160 
not the shapes of a train involved a lot
of<00:02:55.099> cylinders<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.880> lot<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.599> intricate<00:02:57.019> little

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
of cylinders a lot of intricate little

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.140 
of cylinders a lot of intricate little
technology<00:02:57.950> pieces<00:02:58.400> all<00:02:58.730> sorts<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.030> little

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
technology pieces all sorts of little

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.990 
technology pieces all sorts of little
gears<00:02:59.599> and<00:02:59.930> metal<00:03:00.500> bars<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:01.340> even<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.730> front

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
gears and metal bars and even that front

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.240 
gears and metal bars and even that front
plow<00:03:02.269> thing<00:03:02.660> was<00:03:03.290> really<00:03:03.650> difficult<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.130> try

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
plow thing was really difficult to try

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.610 
plow thing was really difficult to try
to<00:03:04.310> figure<00:03:04.550> out<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:05.810> was<00:03:06.019> one<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.440> more

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
to figure out this was one of the more

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.250 
to figure out this was one of the more
challenging<00:03:06.680> builds<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:08.810> know<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.050> looks<00:03:09.140> a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
challenging builds and I know it looks a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.660 
challenging builds and I know it looks a
little<00:03:09.349> rough<00:03:09.590> hopefully<00:03:09.830> guys<00:03:10.220> still<00:03:10.459> think

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
little rough hopefully guys still think

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.800 
little rough hopefully guys still think
it<00:03:10.730> looks<00:03:10.880> pretty<00:03:10.940> cool<00:03:11.239> i'm<00:03:11.480> going<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.690> play

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
it looks pretty cool i'm going to play

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.330 
it looks pretty cool i'm going to play
around<00:03:12.019> with<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:12.290> design<00:03:12.650> some<00:03:12.950> more<00:03:13.160> i

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
around with this design some more i

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.009 
around with this design some more i
think<00:03:14.030> some<00:03:14.180> color<00:03:14.390> effects<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.900> some

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
think some color effects and some

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.840 
think some color effects and some
lighting<00:03:15.230> will<00:03:15.470> definitely<00:03:15.920> help<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.340> i

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
lighting will definitely help and i

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.400 
lighting will definitely help and i
think<00:03:17.150> i<00:03:17.269> can<00:03:17.510> actually<00:03:17.690> integrate<00:03:18.049> this<00:03:18.350> into

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
think i can actually integrate this into

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.530 
think i can actually integrate this into
another<00:03:18.950> map<00:03:19.489> just<00:03:19.670> like<00:03:19.850> i<00:03:19.940> did<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.360> other

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
another map just like i did to the other

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.420 
another map just like i did to the other
one<00:03:20.780> i<00:03:20.810> already<00:03:21.200> have<00:03:21.319> some<00:03:21.530> ideas<00:03:21.680> in<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.280> way

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
one i already have some ideas in the way

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.610 
one i already have some ideas in the way
i<00:03:22.459> could<00:03:23.120> use<00:03:23.330> this<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.780> i<00:03:24.230> think<00:03:24.290> would<00:03:24.470> be

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
i could use this and i think would be

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.070 
i could use this and i think would be
pretty<00:03:24.739> cool<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.400> remember<00:03:26.299> as<00:03:26.599> always<00:03:26.750> with

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
pretty cool so remember as always with

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.910 
pretty cool so remember as always with
the<00:03:27.140> series<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.530> guys<00:03:27.590> can<00:03:27.830> leave
