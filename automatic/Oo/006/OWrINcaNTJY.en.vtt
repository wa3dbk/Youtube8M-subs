extreme<00:01:41.040> racer<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.760> how<00:01:42.180> did<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.450> come

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
extreme racer like how did that come

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.050 
extreme racer like how did that come
about<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.190> it's<00:01:44.520> kind<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> funny

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
about you know it it's kind of funny

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.270 
about you know it it's kind of funny
like<00:01:45.300> I<00:01:45.930> think<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.440> happens<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.980> lot<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
like I think it happens with a lot of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.780 
like I think it happens with a lot of
competitive<00:01:48.210> sports<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.490> people<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.610> to

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
competitive sports that people like to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.090 
competitive sports that people like to
put<00:01:50.970> people<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.510> categories<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.800> that<00:01:53.010> they

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
put people in categories like that they

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.920 
put people in categories like that they
only<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.640> or<00:01:53.850> they<00:01:53.940> only<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.300> that<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:54.750> I

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
only do this or they only do that and I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.630 
only do this or they only do that and I
mean<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.560> along<00:01:55.860> I've<00:01:56.100> always<00:01:56.310> enjoyed

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
mean all along I've always enjoyed

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.340 
mean all along I've always enjoyed
racing<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.660> more<00:01:57.900> than<00:01:57.930> anything

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
racing and I think more than anything

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.040 
racing and I think more than anything
now<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.040> all<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.610> sudden<00:01:59.940> extreme<00:02:00.720> racing

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
now that all of a sudden extreme racing

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.870 
now that all of a sudden extreme racing
in<00:02:01.170> particular<00:02:01.470> has<00:02:01.860> become<00:02:02.190> much<00:02:02.400> more<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
in particular has become much more of a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.240 
in particular has become much more of a
forefront<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.660> people<00:02:04.470> are<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.590> noticing

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
forefront and people are just noticing

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.980 
forefront and people are just noticing
it<00:02:05.400> more<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.760> so<00:02:05.880> they're<00:02:06.000> noticing<00:02:06.330> results

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it more and so they're noticing results

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.899 
it more and so they're noticing results
and<00:02:07.230> you're<00:02:07.380> you're<00:02:07.830> hearing<00:02:08.250> about<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> lot

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
and you're you're hearing about it a lot

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.570 
and you're you're hearing about it a lot
more<00:02:09.409> and<00:02:10.409> in<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> past<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.459> like

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
more and in the past you know that like

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.830 
more and in the past you know that like
the<00:02:11.730> green<00:02:11.909> race<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.269> examples<00:02:12.569> been<00:02:12.659> going

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
the green race for examples been going

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.660 
the green race for examples been going
on<00:02:12.900> 15<00:02:13.290> years<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.860> people<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.190> been<00:02:14.310> racing

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
on 15 years and people have been racing

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.910 
on 15 years and people have been racing
it<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.819> lot<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.470> didn't<00:02:16.470> really<00:02:16.590> hear

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it a lot and you just didn't really hear

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.040 
it a lot and you just didn't really hear
of<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.160> outside<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.670> very<00:02:18.060> small<00:02:18.330> circles<00:02:18.840> and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
of it outside of very small circles and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.600 
of it outside of very small circles and
so<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.260> actually<00:02:19.530> think<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.250> more<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.550> a

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
so I actually think that it's more of a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.020 
so I actually think that it's more of a
function<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.569> racing

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
function of that that racing

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.390 
function of that that racing
has<00:02:22.180> gotten<00:02:23.020> on<00:02:23.230> more<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.620> national<00:02:24.190> level

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
has gotten on more of a national level

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.740 
has gotten on more of a national level
now<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:24.940> there's<00:02:25.120> just<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.390> little<00:02:25.630> more

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
now so there's just a little more

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.199 
now so there's just a little more
exposure<00:02:26.230> guy<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:26.890> met<00:02:27.280> yesterday<00:02:27.640> when<00:02:28.030> i<00:02:28.090> was

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
exposure guy I met yesterday when i was

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.300 
exposure guy I met yesterday when i was
walking<00:02:28.450> up<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.780> shore<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.050> he's<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.650> think

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
walking up on the shore and he's I think

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.680 
walking up on the shore and he's I think
for<00:02:30.490> all<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.970> mean<00:02:31.240> he<00:02:31.330> was<00:02:31.420> about<00:02:31.540> as

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
for all I mean he was about as

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.180 
for all I mean he was about as
intermediate<00:02:32.170> as<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.410> get<00:02:32.590> for<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.830> guy<00:02:32.980> around

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
intermediate as you get for a guy around

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.010 
intermediate as you get for a guy around
the<00:02:33.370> green<00:02:33.580> race<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:33.970> he's<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.600> yeah<00:02:34.750> it's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
the green race and I he's like yeah it's

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.710 
the green race and I he's like yeah it's
my<00:02:35.140> 50th<00:02:35.680> time<00:02:35.920> down<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.370> did<00:02:37.030> all<00:02:37.150> right<00:02:37.180> it's

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
my 50th time down I did all right it's

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.120 
my 50th time down I did all right it's
like<00:02:37.810> how<00:02:37.900> many<00:02:37.990> times<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.500> go<00:02:38.590> down<00:02:38.770> that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
like how many times you go down that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.630 
like how many times you go down that
River<00:02:39.940> in<00:02:40.630> preparation<00:02:41.410> for<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.739> race<00:02:41.950> you

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
River in preparation for the race you

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.660 
River in preparation for the race you
know<00:02:42.760> at<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.239> point<00:02:44.190> I've<00:02:45.190> been<00:02:45.430> paddling

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
know at this point I've been paddling

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.880 
know at this point I've been paddling
the<00:02:45.940> green<00:02:46.180> for<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> really<00:02:46.720> long<00:02:46.750> time<00:02:46.930> there

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
the green for a really long time there

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.530 
the green for a really long time there
definitely<00:02:48.100> are<00:02:48.340> some<00:02:48.459> new<00:02:48.880> lines<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.450> I

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
definitely are some new lines that I

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.060 
definitely are some new lines that I
figure<00:02:50.140> out<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.860> don't<00:02:51.610> know<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.730> probably<00:02:52.120> I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
figure out I don't know I probably I

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.610 
figure out I don't know I probably I
probably<00:02:54.070> get<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> pretty<00:02:55.450> easily<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:56.200> don't

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
probably get a pretty easily I don't

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.340 
probably get a pretty easily I don't
know<00:02:56.709> 80<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.519> 100<00:02:57.880> runs<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.239> year<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:59.110> green

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
know 80 to 100 runs a year on the green

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.660 
know 80 to 100 runs a year on the green
just<00:02:59.590> because<00:02:59.739> it's<00:02:59.890> my<00:02:59.980> own<00:03:00.130> river<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.610> it

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
just because it's my own river and it

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.780 
just because it's my own river and it
runs<00:03:00.850> all<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.120> time<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:02.260> know<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:03.370> kind<00:03:03.640> of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
runs all the time you know and I kind of

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.390 
runs all the time you know and I kind of
try<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.360> keep<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.750> pretty<00:03:04.900> even<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:06.100> know<00:03:06.220> in

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
try to keep it pretty even you know in

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.830 
try to keep it pretty even you know in
the<00:03:06.519> month<00:03:06.730> before<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.090> green<00:03:07.330> race<00:03:07.510> I'm<00:03:07.690> not

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the month before the green race I'm not

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.509 
the month before the green race I'm not
really<00:03:07.989> trying<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.380> spike<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:08.800> necessarily

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
really trying to spike it necessarily

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.370 
really trying to spike it necessarily
but<00:03:09.790> I'm<00:03:10.030> out<00:03:10.180> there<00:03:10.390> like<00:03:10.630> five<00:03:10.870> times<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.350> week

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
but I'm out there like five times a week

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.400 
but I'm out there like five times a week
so<00:03:11.890> yeah<00:03:12.760> that's<00:03:12.940> 20<00:03:13.390> 30<00:03:13.630> runs<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.230> month

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
so yeah that's 20 30 runs the month
