00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.770 
GPUs we don't have any support for SLI
and<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.920> particular<00:01:20.430> card<00:01:20.729> does<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.479> have

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and this particular card does not have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.899 
and this particular card does not have
support<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.439> single<00:01:22.860> card<00:01:23.070> NVIDIA<00:01:23.430> surround

so<00:01:24.299> only<00:01:24.479> two<00:01:24.780> displays<00:01:25.140> out<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> time

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
so only two displays out at a time

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
so only two displays out at a time
however<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:27.030> should<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.360> noted<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.689> once<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
however it should be noted that once you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.190 
however it should be noted that once you
get<00:01:28.320> into<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.680> cards<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.040> are<00:01:29.100> this

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
get into the cards that are this

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.740 
get into the cards that are this

wellthis oriented for single display
operation<00:01:34.350> not<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.770> powerful<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
operation not that powerful if you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
operation not that powerful if you
really<00:01:36.689> want<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.960> run<00:01:37.110> two<00:01:37.710> round<00:01:37.920> monitors

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
really want to run two round monitors

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.039 
really want to run two round monitors
you<00:01:38.850> probably<00:01:39.240> should<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.570> something<00:01:39.960> more

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you probably should get something more

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.950 
you probably should get something more
powerful<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:41.579> let's<00:01:41.939> talk<00:01:42.210> performance

that's not what we're gonna do at all we
are<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.969> make<00:02:06.420> graphs<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
are going to make graphs and and do this

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.460 
are going to make graphs and and do this
properly

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
properly

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.900 
properly
that<00:02:10.470> was<00:02:10.590> Diesel's<00:02:10.979> idea<00:02:11.280> by<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.459> way

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
that was Diesel's idea by the way

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.070 
that was Diesel's idea by the way
came<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> thought<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.960> was

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
came up with that I thought it was

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.690 
came up with that I thought it was
stupid<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:14.010> wanted<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> humor<00:02:14.610> him

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
stupid but I just I wanted to humor him

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.950 
stupid but I just I wanted to humor him
because<00:02:14.880> he's<00:02:15.000> still<00:02:15.180> sort<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.450> new<00:02:15.690> on<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
because he's still sort of new on the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.080 
because he's still sort of new on the
team<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.830> want<00:02:17.400> him<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.610> feel<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:17.940> we

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
team and so I want him to feel like we

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.320 
team and so I want him to feel like we
took<00:02:18.240> his<00:02:18.390> input<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.580> he's<00:02:20.580> thinking<00:02:20.910> about<00:02:21.000> me

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
took his input so he's thinking about me

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.150 
took his input so he's thinking about me
with<00:02:21.480> his<00:02:21.600> elastics<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.800> let's<00:02:23.010> talk

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
with his elastics so let's talk

Crysis 2 high settings is the lowest

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.330 
Crysis 2 high settings is the lowest
setting<00:03:15.780> because<00:03:16.410> they<00:03:16.560> subscribe<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.190> the

thought<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.740> mean<00:03:19.890> literally<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.400> settings

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
thought I mean literally the settings

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.230 
thought I mean literally the settings
are<00:03:20.820> high<00:03:21.000> very<00:03:21.660> high<00:03:21.750> extreme<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:23.130> ultra<00:03:24.120> or

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
are high very high extreme and ultra or

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.860 
are high very high extreme and ultra or
something<00:03:24.540> like<00:03:24.630> that

okay so performance wise we have to give
