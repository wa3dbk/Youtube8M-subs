we<00:02:12.200> have<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.410> design<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.250> cloak<00:02:13.550> for<00:02:13.580> infrared

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
we have a design of a cloak for infrared

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.640 
we have a design of a cloak for infrared
and<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.280> made<00:02:16.489> from<00:02:16.760> nano-sized

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and this is made from nano-sized

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.320 
and this is made from nano-sized
concatenate<00:02:18.650> glass<00:02:18.830> resonators<00:02:19.519> okay<00:02:20.060> and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
concatenate glass resonators okay and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.650 
concatenate glass resonators okay and
again<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.690> need<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.250> special<00:02:22.250> device<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:23.060> see

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
again you need a special device to see

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.720 
again you need a special device to see
this<00:02:23.720> specific<00:02:24.380> 10<00:02:24.769> years<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.130> haters<00:02:25.310> but

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
this specific 10 years and haters but

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.520 
this specific 10 years and haters but
the<00:02:25.850> properties<00:02:26.390> are<00:02:26.510> pretty<00:02:26.810> similar<00:02:27.230> to

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
the properties are pretty similar to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.890 
the properties are pretty similar to
this<00:02:27.769> one<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.580> valley<00:02:28.850> can<00:02:29.090> model<00:02:29.480> this

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
this one this valley can model this

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.199 
this one this valley can model this
properties<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.220> lab<00:02:31.430> because<00:02:31.910> they<00:02:32.090> have

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
properties in the lab because they have

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.770 
properties in the lab because they have
a<00:02:32.239> quick<00:02:32.540> meant<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:34.700> send<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.209> vests<00:02:35.420> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
a quick meant to to send the vests and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.780 
a quick meant to to send the vests and
to<00:02:36.019> receive<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.620> waves<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.250> other<00:02:37.489> side

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
to receive the waves and the other side

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.840 
to receive the waves and the other side
to<00:02:37.970> support<00:02:38.350> okay<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.890> if<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.340> were<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.459> cloak

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
to support okay so if you were to cloak

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.270 
to support okay so if you were to cloak
a<00:02:40.880> large<00:02:41.239> metal<00:02:41.540> object<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:42.319> that<00:02:43.010> type<00:02:43.250> of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
a large metal object in that type of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.009 
a large metal object in that type of
material<00:02:43.819> somehow<00:02:44.269> or<00:02:44.420> other<00:02:44.450> figure<00:02:44.870> out<00:02:44.989> a

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
material somehow or other figure out a

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.470 
material somehow or other figure out a
way<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> do<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.760> radar<00:02:46.760> might<00:02:47.000> not<00:02:47.150> be<00:02:47.299> able<00:02:47.360> to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
way to do it radar might not be able to

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.960 
way to do it radar might not be able to
see<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.660> right<00:02:48.560> right<00:02:48.709> actually<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.549> size<00:02:49.760> of

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
see it right right actually the size of

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.330 
see it right right actually the size of
the<00:02:50.090> object<00:02:50.480> doesn't<00:02:50.660> matter<00:02:51.049> okay<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.860> it's

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
the object doesn't matter okay it it's

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.460 
the object doesn't matter okay it it's
not<00:02:52.549> important<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.360> important<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.079> sheep

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470

going to show people your experiment

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.470 
going to show people your experiment
here<00:03:03.079> that<00:03:03.230> was<00:03:03.350> presented<00:03:03.620> last<00:03:04.340> year<00:03:04.519> the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
here that was presented last year the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.479 
here that was presented last year the
top<00:03:05.900> illustration<00:03:06.530> their<00:03:06.709> shows<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:06.950> cylinder

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
top illustration their shows a cylinder

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.550 
top illustration their shows a cylinder
with<00:03:08.120> waves<00:03:08.390> being<00:03:08.630> shown<00:03:08.930> at<00:03:09.110> it<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.380> can<00:03:09.410> see

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
with waves being shown at it you can see

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.120 
with waves being shown at it you can see
a<00:03:09.590> shadow<00:03:10.510> behind<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.720> object<00:03:12.109> but<00:03:12.890> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
a shadow behind the object but the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.030 
a shadow behind the object but the
bottom<00:03:14.049> illustration<00:03:15.049> shows<00:03:15.739> what<00:03:15.920> happens

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
bottom illustration shows what happens

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.830 
bottom illustration shows what happens
when<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.549> resonator<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.209> working<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.750> you

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
when the resonator is working and you

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.509 
when the resonator is working and you
can<00:03:17.989> see<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.290> waves<00:03:18.470> at<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.739> top<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.190> the

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
can see the waves at the top of the

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.009 
can see the waves at the top of the
chart<00:03:19.760> are<00:03:19.970> pretty<00:03:20.209> much<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.420> same<00:03:20.600> as<00:03:20.900> the

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
chart are pretty much the same as the

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.930 
chart are pretty much the same as the
waves<00:03:21.200> at<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.590> bottom<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.549> chart<00:03:22.700> which

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
waves at the bottom of the chart which

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.210 
waves at the bottom of the chart which
means<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.959> waves<00:03:24.140> didn't<00:03:24.500> see<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.739> abject<00:03:25.040> at

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
means the waves didn't see the abject at

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.890 
means the waves didn't see the abject at
all<00:03:25.340> right<00:03:25.700> yes<00:03:26.060> okay<00:03:26.829> okay<00:03:27.829> so<00:03:28.720> do<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.840> think

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
all right yes okay okay so do you think

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.660 
all right yes okay okay so do you think
there<00:03:30.260> might<00:03:30.380> be<00:03:30.440> some<00:03:30.829> commercialization

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
there might be some commercialization

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.890 
there might be some commercialization
potential<00:03:32.150> here<00:03:32.390> when<00:03:32.570> do<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.720> think<00:03:32.810> that

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
potential here when do you think that

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.479 
potential here when do you think that
might<00:03:33.140> happen<00:03:33.320> any<00:03:33.620> ideas<00:03:33.980> are<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.310> just

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
might happen any ideas are you just

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.729 
might happen any ideas are you just
doing<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.730> research<00:03:34.910> now<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:36.290> know<00:03:36.410> this<00:03:36.709> is

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
doing the research now you know this is

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.960 
doing the research now you know this is
in<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.670> stage<00:03:38.420> of<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:39.530> proof<00:03:40.190> of<00:03:40.370> concept

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
in the stage of just proof of concept

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.449 
in the stage of just proof of concept
right<00:03:41.390> now<00:03:41.840> yeah<00:03:42.320> we<00:03:42.739> can<00:03:42.920> think<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.280> many

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
right now yeah we can think of many

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.880 
right now yeah we can think of many
potential<00:03:43.970> application

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
potential application

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.070 
potential application
first<00:03:45.010> we<00:03:45.160> need<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.780> materials<00:03:46.780> ready

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
first we need to have materials ready

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.400 
first we need to have materials ready
for<00:03:47.380> every<00:03:47.770> frequency<00:03:48.010> range<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:49.290> there<00:03:50.290> is

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
for every frequency range and there is

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.190 
for every frequency range and there is
some<00:03:50.560> work<00:03:50.770> done<00:03:51.069> for<00:03:51.540> visible<00:03:52.540> ranges<00:03:52.959> well

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
some work done for visible ranges well

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.890 
some work done for visible ranges well
now<00:03:53.470> but<00:03:53.770> probably<00:03:54.130> we<00:03:54.310> can<00:03:54.850> use<00:03:55.480> some<00:03:55.720> other

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
now but probably we can use some other

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.040 
now but probably we can use some other
kind<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.380> resonances<00:03:57.420> material<00:03:58.420> resonances

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
kind of resonances material resonances

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.600 
kind of resonances material resonances
to<00:03:59.260> as<00:03:59.500> we<00:03:59.830> go<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.100> current<00:04:00.430> higher

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
to as we go to current higher

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.300 
to as we go to current higher
frequencies<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:02.140> type<00:04:02.350> of<00:04:02.380> resonances<00:04:03.040> can

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
frequencies the type of resonances can

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.090 
frequencies the type of resonances can
can<00:04:04.030> change<00:04:04.360> or<00:04:04.930> visible<00:04:05.290> range<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.680> course<00:04:05.950> we

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
can change or visible range of course we

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.979 
can change or visible range of course we
can<00:04:06.280> envision<00:04:07.060> some<00:04:07.650> applications<00:04:08.650> which

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
can envision some applications which

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.170 
can envision some applications which
could<00:04:10.989> be<00:04:11.080> used<00:04:11.110> by<00:04:11.440> our<00:04:11.470> where<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.340> right<00:04:12.820> so

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
could be used by our where I right so

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.270 
could be used by our where I right so
could<00:04:13.720> be<00:04:14.069> even<00:04:15.069> some<00:04:15.459> toys<00:04:16.230> maybe<00:04:17.230> maybe<00:04:17.890> it's

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
could be even some toys maybe maybe it's

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.320 
could be even some toys maybe maybe it's
very<00:04:18.700> expensive<00:04:18.880> at<00:04:19.269> this<00:04:19.480> point<00:04:19.870> but

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
very expensive at this point but

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.090 
very expensive at this point but
protection<00:04:22.330> what<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.600> can<00:04:22.900> tell<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.410> about<00:04:23.680> it

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
protection what I can tell you about it

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.920 
protection what I can tell you about it
could<00:04:24.430> be<00:04:24.520> a<00:04:24.550> protection<00:04:24.970> from<00:04:25.150> different

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
could be a protection from different

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.070 
could be a protection from different
electromagnetic<00:04:26.860> radiation<00:04:27.790> well<00:04:28.690> because

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
electromagnetic radiation well because

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.630 
electromagnetic radiation well because
it's<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.350> kind<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.590> shielding<00:04:30.040> yeah<00:04:30.370> all<00:04:30.520> right

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
it's a kind of shielding yeah all right

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.580 
it's a kind of shielding yeah all right
dates<00:04:30.880> so<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.210> can<00:04:31.480> ban<00:04:31.720> surveys<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.410> just

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
dates so you can ban surveys and just

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.409 
dates so you can ban surveys and just
and<00:04:32.860> this<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.520> important<00:04:33.940> problem<00:04:34.270> right

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
and this is the important problem right

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.560 
and this is the important problem right
no<00:04:34.690> right<00:04:35.290> so<00:04:35.530> as<00:04:35.950> just<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.910> few<00:04:37.060> move<00:04:37.240> past

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
no right so as just a few move past

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.110 
no right so as just a few move past
visible<00:04:38.140> light<00:04:38.290> you<00:04:38.440> get<00:04:38.620> into<00:04:38.919> x<00:04:39.640> rays<00:04:39.880> all

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
visible light you get into x rays all

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.640 
visible light you get into x rays all
the<00:04:40.210> way<00:04:40.300> up<00:04:40.390> those<00:04:40.750> are<00:04:40.900> damaging<00:04:41.350> right<00:04:41.500> you

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
the way up those are damaging right you

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.780 
the way up those are damaging right you
could<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:42.010> could<00:04:42.100> potentially<00:04:42.610> shield

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
could you could potentially shield

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.550 
could you could potentially shield
against<00:04:43.090> x-rays<00:04:43.419> with<00:04:43.570> this<00:04:43.690> stuff<00:04:43.900> right

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
against x-rays with this stuff right

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.900 
against x-rays with this stuff right
because<00:04:44.950> they're<00:04:45.160> all<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.490> electromagnetic

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
because they're all the electromagnetic

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.180 
because they're all the electromagnetic
phenomena<00:04:46.419> are<00:04:46.480> scalable<00:04:46.930> really<00:04:47.500> depends<00:04:48.040> on

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
phenomena are scalable really depends on

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.210 
phenomena are scalable really depends on
the<00:04:48.250> wavelengths<00:04:48.910> is<00:04:49.060> related<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.229> size

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
the wavelengths is related to the size

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.280 
the wavelengths is related to the size
of<00:04:51.550> these<00:04:51.790> resonators<00:04:52.450> of<00:04:52.810> course<00:04:53.169> the

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
of these resonators of course the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.110 
of these resonators of course the
resonances<00:04:53.860> could<00:04:54.100> be<00:04:54.190> different<00:04:54.580> as<00:04:54.669> I<00:04:54.790> told

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
resonances could be different as I told

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.840 
resonances could be different as I told
there<00:04:56.020> are<00:04:56.050> not<00:04:56.229> many<00:04:56.520> materials<00:04:57.520> which<00:04:57.669> can

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
there are not many materials which can

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.510 
there are not many materials which can
allow<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.570> produce<00:04:58.780> geometric<00:04:59.770> resonances<00:05:00.340> to

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
allow to produce geometric resonances to

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.520 
allow to produce geometric resonances to
create<00:05:00.760> some<00:05:00.970> tiny<00:05:01.330> such<00:05:01.630> tiny<00:05:01.840> resonators<00:05:02.380> at

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
create some tiny such tiny resonators at

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.620 
create some tiny such tiny resonators at
this<00:05:02.770> range<00:05:03.040> maybe<00:05:03.729> we<00:05:03.880> need<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.060> think<00:05:04.390> about

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
this range maybe we need to think about

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.040 
this range maybe we need to think about
some<00:05:05.200> material<00:05:05.919> related<00:05:06.370> resumes

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
some material related resumes

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.850 
some material related resumes
