00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
it was neat and I know that if I stay in

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.670 
it was neat and I know that if I stay in
school<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.690> one<00:01:46.960> day<00:01:47.110> I<00:01:47.140> could<00:01:47.320> do<00:01:47.530> what

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
school that one day I could do what

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.380 
school that one day I could do what
those<00:01:47.860> guys<00:01:48.040> did<00:01:48.369> looks<00:01:48.610> like<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:48.820> lot<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.180> fun

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
and I think that they see that there's a

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.010 
and I think that they see that there's a
need<00:01:51.130> for<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.940> air<00:01:52.210> is<00:01:52.390> being<00:01:52.509> pushed<00:01:52.869> down

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
forward on the cyclic which changes the

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.520 
forward on the cyclic which changes the
disc<00:02:03.490> rotor<00:02:03.759> ok<00:02:04.149> now<00:02:04.630> I'm<00:02:04.810> going<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:05.380> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
disc rotor ok now I'm going for the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.590 
disc rotor ok now I'm going for the
copter<00:02:06.100> will<00:02:06.250> go<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:06.430> lot<00:02:06.759> faster<00:02:07.090> than<00:02:07.450> what

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
copter will go a lot faster than what

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.419 
copter will go a lot faster than what
it's<00:02:07.720> supposed<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.080> but<00:02:08.860> if<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.070> starts<00:02:09.310> going

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
it's supposed to but if it starts going

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.490 
it's supposed to but if it starts going
too<00:02:09.670> fast<00:02:09.940> things<00:02:10.300> can<00:02:10.450> start<00:02:10.750> flying<00:02:11.080> off<00:02:11.290> of

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
too fast things can start flying off of
