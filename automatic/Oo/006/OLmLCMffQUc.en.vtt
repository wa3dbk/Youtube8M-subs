00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
as I mentioned this iPad Mini glass is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.590 
as I mentioned this iPad Mini glass is
pretty<00:01:26.860> brittle<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.700> it's<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.060> breaks<00:01:28.420> easily

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
pretty brittle so it's it breaks easily

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.130 
pretty brittle so it's it breaks easily
once<00:01:29.049> as<00:01:29.320> soon<00:01:29.469> as<00:01:29.619> it's<00:01:29.979> any<00:01:30.219> hard<00:01:30.850> surface<00:01:31.140> so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
once as soon as it's any hard surface so

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.109 
once as soon as it's any hard surface so
you<00:01:32.229> just<00:01:32.409> have<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.740> be<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.969> know<00:01:34.090> very

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
you just have to be you know very

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.539 
you just have to be you know very
careful<00:01:34.780> with<00:01:35.439> this<00:01:35.560> device<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.250> when<00:01:36.460> it

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
careful with this device and when it

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.889 
careful with this device and when it
breaks<00:01:36.789> it's<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:38.289> very<00:01:39.360> pretty<00:01:40.360> cheating<00:01:40.719> as<00:01:40.780> to

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
breaks it's a very pretty cheating as to

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.949 
breaks it's a very pretty cheating as to
take<00:01:41.319> it<00:01:41.409> apart<00:01:41.709> and<00:01:42.280> I<00:01:43.030> was<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.750> will

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
so you can break it in and take it apart

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.390 
so you can break it in and take it apart
because<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.430> already<00:03:09.580> need<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.030> be<00:03:10.090> replaced

00:03:31.690 --> 00:04:10.309 
the digitizer is underneath the LCD
words<00:03:32.110> need<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.380> be<00:03:32.560> connected

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:18.289 

so<00:04:11.319> this<00:04:11.530> is<00:04:11.680> how<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:13.450> LCD<00:04:14.079> is<00:04:16.889> taken<00:04:17.889> apart

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
so this is how the LCD is taken apart

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.200 
so this is how the LCD is taken apart
and<00:04:20.130> we're<00:04:21.130> going<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.370> show<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.820> two

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
and we're going to show you the two

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.210 
and we're going to show you the two
antennae<00:04:23.110> which<00:04:24.009> is<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:24.759> the<00:04:25.150> body<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.690> the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
antennae which is on the body of the

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.790 
antennae which is on the body of the
iPad<00:04:27.220> which<00:04:27.940> is<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.720> signal<00:04:29.199> antenna<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:29.710> the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
iPad which is the signal antenna and the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.189 
iPad which is the signal antenna and the
Wi-Fi<00:04:30.160> antenna<00:04:30.550> just<00:04:30.820> be<00:04:31.449> very<00:04:31.690> careful

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
Wi-Fi antenna just be very careful

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.850 
Wi-Fi antenna just be very careful
because<00:04:32.949> if<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.220> manage<00:04:33.699> to<00:04:33.880> damage<00:04:34.750> them<00:04:35.139> it

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
because if you manage to damage them it

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.860 
because if you manage to damage them it
will<00:04:36.099> be<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.280> pretty<00:04:36.550> difficult<00:04:37.389> job<00:04:37.840> to

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
will be a pretty difficult job to

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.249 
will be a pretty difficult job to
replace<00:04:38.800> them<00:04:39.009> and<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:40.870> don't<00:04:40.960> want<00:04:41.139> to<00:04:41.169> do

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
replace them and you don't want to do

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.300 
replace them and you don't want to do
that<00:04:41.789> okay

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310

that okay
now<00:04:45.310> he's<00:04:45.580> going<00:04:45.759> to<00:04:45.820> show<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.330> new<00:04:47.169> glass

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
now he's going to show you the new glass

now he's going to show you the new glass
the<00:04:48.370> new<00:04:48.550> base<00:04:48.970> hyzer<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:51.000> this<00:04:52.000> class<00:04:52.870> is

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
the new base hyzer and this class is

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.360 
the new base hyzer and this class is
need<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.710> be<00:04:53.740> connect<00:04:55.530> which<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.919> connector

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
need to be connect which the connector

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.730 
need to be connect which the connector
is<00:04:57.430> underneath<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:58.060> LCD<00:04:58.810> so<00:04:59.380> it's<00:04:59.500> going<00:04:59.650> to

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
is underneath the LCD so it's going to

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.189 
is underneath the LCD so it's going to
show<00:04:59.889> you<00:05:00.120> where<00:05:01.120> this<00:05:01.690> is<00:05:01.750> need<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.169> be

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
show you where this is need to be

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:12.520 
show you where this is need to be
connected
