you're<00:03:43.239> probably<00:03:43.390> thinking<00:03:43.660> well<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:43.989> can

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
you're probably thinking well I can

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.990 
you're probably thinking well I can
build<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.410> spawn<00:03:44.650> without<00:03:45.100> any<00:03:45.430> fancy<00:03:45.640> tools

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
build a spawn without any fancy tools

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.199 
build a spawn without any fancy tools
well<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.930> true<00:03:47.140> however<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:48.580> certainly

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
well this is true however it certainly

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.140 
well this is true however it certainly
is<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.600> big<00:03:49.870> help<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.560> also<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.730> leads

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
is a big help to that also it leads

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.880 
is a big help to that also it leads
directly<00:03:52.360> into<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:52.989> plugin<00:03:53.260> called<00:03:53.500> world

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
directly into a plugin called world

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.860

certain areas on the server so you're

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.530

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.580 
probably thinking well factions has a
safe<00:04:02.110> zone<00:04:03.090> we<00:04:04.090> can<00:04:04.269> do<00:04:04.420> slash<00:04:04.660> F<00:04:04.930> claim<00:04:05.290> safe

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
safe zone we can do slash F claim safe

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.310 
safe zone we can do slash F claim safe
zone<00:04:05.890> so<00:04:06.519> doesn't<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.120> protect<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.660> already

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
zone so doesn't that protect it already

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.770 
zone so doesn't that protect it already
wherever<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.070> want<00:04:09.280> well<00:04:09.760> yes<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.150> does<00:04:10.390> but

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
wherever you want well yes it does but

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.780 
wherever you want well yes it does but
there<00:04:11.350> are<00:04:11.560> some<00:04:11.709> limitations<00:04:12.340> with<00:04:12.459> that

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
there are some limitations with that

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.850 
there are some limitations with that
well<00:04:13.209> for<00:04:13.510> one<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:13.810> can<00:04:13.930> only<00:04:14.080> claim<00:04:14.350> large

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
well for one you can only claim large

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.280 
well for one you can only claim large
chunks<00:04:15.400> of<00:04:15.519> space<00:04:15.700> 16<00:04:16.510> by<00:04:16.660> 16

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
chunks of space 16 by 16

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.370 
chunks of space 16 by 16
whereas<00:04:18.250> with<00:04:18.549> world<00:04:19.510> guard<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.900> can<00:04:19.930> set<00:04:22.380> you

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
whereas with world guard you can set you

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.800 
whereas with world guard you can set you
can<00:04:23.620> make<00:04:23.919> it<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.280> way<00:04:24.310> any<00:04:24.700> area<00:04:25.510> is

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
can make it that way any area is

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.950 
can make it that way any area is
protected<00:04:26.050> with<00:04:26.590> any

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
protected with any

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.520 
protected with any

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
dimensions at all now another thing is

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.430 
dimensions at all now another thing is

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
that the with the factions plugin it's

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.230 
that the with the factions plugin it's
not<00:04:33.620> actually<00:04:34.100> completely<00:04:34.520> protected<00:04:35.060> with

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
your safe zones as although you can't

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.909 
your safe zones as although you can't
build<00:04:38.419> a<00:04:38.720> player<00:04:38.990> who's<00:04:39.259> not<00:04:39.470> opted<00:04:39.710> it

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
build a player who's not opted it

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.140 
build a player who's not opted it
doesn't<00:04:40.160> have<00:04:40.250> any<00:04:40.370> kind<00:04:40.880> of<00:04:40.940> special

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
doesn't have any kind of special

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.870 
doesn't have any kind of special
permissions<00:04:41.810> they<00:04:42.440> can<00:04:42.620> still<00:04:42.889> break<00:04:43.520> things

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
permissions they can still break things

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.430 
permissions they can still break things
inside<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.360> spawn<00:04:44.599> by<00:04:44.810> using<00:04:44.990> things<00:04:45.319> like

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
inside the spawn by using things like

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.589 
inside the spawn by using things like
TNT<00:04:45.830> cannons<00:04:46.490> launching<00:04:46.910> them<00:04:47.060> from<00:04:47.300> outside

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
TNT cannons launching them from outside

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.960 
TNT cannons launching them from outside
of<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.840> protected<00:04:48.289> area<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:48.830> yeah<00:04:49.699> it's<00:04:49.849> just

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
of the protected area and yeah it's just

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.719 
of the protected area and yeah it's just
overall<00:04:50.449> it's<00:04:50.720> kind<00:04:50.930> of<00:04:51.020> unreliable<00:04:51.410> so<00:04:52.280> you

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
overall it's kind of unreliable so you

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.820 
overall it's kind of unreliable so you
can<00:04:52.849> also<00:04:53.000> with<00:04:53.690> world<00:04:53.960> guard<00:04:54.259> you<00:04:54.530> can<00:04:54.560> make

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
can also with world guard you can make

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.290 
can also with world guard you can make
it<00:04:54.979> so<00:04:55.160> that<00:04:55.190> way<00:04:55.460> if<00:04:55.669> you're<00:04:55.819> trying<00:04:56.150> to

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
it so that way if you're trying to

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.480 
it so that way if you're trying to
create<00:04:56.630> a<00:04:56.720> place<00:04:56.960> where<00:04:56.990> let's<00:04:57.860> say<00:04:58.069> somebody

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
create a place where let's say somebody

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.879 
create a place where let's say somebody
who's<00:04:58.669> not<00:04:58.849> off<00:04:59.150> but<00:04:59.539> somebody<00:05:00.380> who<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.650> want

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
who's not off but somebody who you want

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.200 
who's not off but somebody who you want
to<00:05:01.009> be<00:05:01.070> able<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.310> build<00:05:01.520> in<00:05:01.729> a<00:05:01.789> certain<00:05:02.120> area

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
to be able to build in a certain area

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.029 
to be able to build in a certain area
that<00:05:02.570> no<00:05:02.690> one<00:05:02.810> else<00:05:02.960> can<00:05:03.229> you<00:05:03.500> can<00:05:03.650> still<00:05:03.889> do

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
that no one else can you can still do

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.760 
that no one else can you can still do
that<00:05:04.070> using<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.699> world<00:05:04.880> guard<00:05:05.120> plugin<00:05:05.479> and

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
that using the world guard plugin and

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.499 
that using the world guard plugin and
yeah<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.160> moving<00:05:07.729> on<00:05:07.910> we're<00:05:08.090> going<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.270> go<00:05:08.449> to

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
yeah so moving on we're going to go to

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.600 
yeah so moving on we're going to go to
the<00:05:08.780> group<00:05:09.020> manager<00:05:09.380> plugin<00:05:09.680> so<00:05:10.280> this<00:05:10.430> is

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
the group manager plugin so this is

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.060 
the group manager plugin so this is
probably<00:05:11.120> one<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.389> the<00:05:11.630> most<00:05:12.199> important<00:05:12.860> ones

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
probably one of the most important ones

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.150 
probably one of the most important ones
where<00:05:13.910> you<00:05:14.180> can<00:05:14.360> set<00:05:14.930> different<00:05:15.470> ranks<00:05:15.919> so

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
where you can set different ranks so

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.700 
where you can set different ranks so
you're<00:05:17.150> going<00:05:17.389> to<00:05:17.570> definitely<00:05:17.810> need<00:05:18.409> some

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
you're going to definitely need some

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.620 
you're going to definitely need some
different<00:05:19.009> ranks<00:05:19.280> on<00:05:19.400> your<00:05:19.550> server<00:05:19.820> because

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
different ranks on your server because

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.210 
different ranks on your server because
if<00:05:20.930> you<00:05:21.229> just<00:05:21.440> make<00:05:21.680> it<00:05:21.889> so<00:05:22.009> that<00:05:22.039> way

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
if you just make it so that way

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.070 
if you just make it so that way
everybody's<00:05:22.729> op<00:05:22.940> then<00:05:23.330> that<00:05:23.479> your<00:05:23.690> server<00:05:23.960> is

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
everybody's op then that your server is

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.290 
everybody's op then that your server is
just<00:05:24.229> going<00:05:24.409> to<00:05:24.530> go<00:05:24.620> crazy<00:05:25.060> everybody's<00:05:26.060> going

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
just going to go crazy everybody's going

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.790 
just going to go crazy everybody's going
to<00:05:26.330> have<00:05:26.479> tons<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:26.870> commands<00:05:27.229> if<00:05:27.409> you<00:05:27.530> make<00:05:27.680> it

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
to have tons of commands if you make it

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.219 
to have tons of commands if you make it
that<00:05:27.889> note<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:28.610> people<00:05:28.970> have<00:05:29.300> no<00:05:29.599> commands

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
that note that people have no commands

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.839 
that note that people have no commands
well<00:05:30.470> people<00:05:31.220> aren't<00:05:31.460> going<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.639> like<00:05:31.820> that

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
well people aren't going to like that

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.310 
well people aren't going to like that
either<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.419> they're<00:05:32.539> going<00:05:32.780> to<00:05:32.960> just<00:05:33.139> go<00:05:33.289> to

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
either and they're going to just go to

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.899 
either and they're going to just go to
another<00:05:33.470> server<00:05:34.009> where<00:05:34.250> they<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.490> have<00:05:34.669> some

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 
another server where they can have some

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.830 
another server where they can have some
more<00:05:35.000> freedom<00:05:36.400> so<00:05:37.400> with<00:05:37.849> group<00:05:38.090> manager<00:05:38.509> you

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
more freedom so with group manager you

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.990 
more freedom so with group manager you
can<00:05:39.050> basically<00:05:39.860> just<00:05:40.039> create<00:05:40.340> ranks<00:05:40.789> give

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
can basically just create ranks give

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.350 
can basically just create ranks give
people<00:05:41.240> certain<00:05:41.720> commands<00:05:42.849> and<00:05:43.849> yeah<00:05:44.060> so

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
people certain commands and yeah so

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.540 
people certain commands and yeah so
that's<00:05:44.479> the<00:05:44.719> general<00:05:45.050> idea<00:05:45.500> of<00:05:45.560> it<00:05:45.740> so<00:05:46.009> if<00:05:46.310> you

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
that's the general idea of it so if you

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.610 
that's the general idea of it so if you
want<00:05:46.820> a<00:05:47.030> moderator<00:05:47.599> to<00:05:47.840> be<00:05:47.930> able<00:05:48.020> to<00:05:48.199> kick<00:05:48.440> her

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
want a moderator to be able to kick her

have certain permissions but not all
like<00:05:55.070> the<00:05:55.250> OP<00:05:55.370> does<00:05:55.669> now<00:05:56.479> this<00:05:57.380> is<00:05:57.590> another

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
like the OP does now this is another

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.350 
like the OP does now this is another
plugin<00:05:58.400> which<00:05:58.759> really<00:05:59.690> allows<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:01.490> staff<00:06:02.120> on

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
plugin which really allows the staff on

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.050 
plugin which really allows the staff on
a<00:06:02.389> server<00:06:02.659> to<00:06:02.960> kind<00:06:03.289> of<00:06:03.469> after<00:06:04.280> you've<00:06:04.460> already

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
a server to kind of after you've already

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.899 
a server to kind of after you've already
kind<00:06:05.780> of<00:06:05.870> kicked<00:06:06.199> off<00:06:06.409> all<00:06:06.710> the<00:06:06.949> oblivious

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
kind of kicked off all the oblivious

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.930 
kind of kicked off all the oblivious
hackers<00:06:08.330> that<00:06:08.599> this<00:06:09.530> cannot<00:06:10.250> detect<00:06:10.610> you're

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
hackers that this cannot detect you're

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.339 
hackers that this cannot detect you're
kind<00:06:11.150> of<00:06:11.270> going<00:06:11.449> to<00:06:11.539> be<00:06:11.630> in<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.810> clear<00:06:12.020> for<00:06:12.110> a

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
kind of going to be in the clear for a

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.810 
kind of going to be in the clear for a
bit<00:06:12.620> so<00:06:13.310> what<00:06:13.669> this<00:06:13.820> is<00:06:14.120> is<00:06:14.330> no<00:06:14.479> cheat<00:06:14.750> plus<00:06:15.080> it

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
bit so what this is is no cheat plus it

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.570 
bit so what this is is no cheat plus it
is<00:06:16.820> automatic<00:06:17.810> kind<00:06:18.349> of<00:06:18.500> hacking<00:06:18.800> detection

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
is automatic kind of hacking detection

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.209 
is automatic kind of hacking detection
so<00:06:20.120> it<00:06:20.419> will<00:06:20.719> kick<00:06:21.380> off<00:06:21.590> players<00:06:21.979> on<00:06:22.190> your

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
so it will kick off players on your

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.700 
so it will kick off players on your
server<00:06:22.610> or<00:06:22.820> at<00:06:22.880> least<00:06:23.060> notify<00:06:23.570> you<00:06:23.780> if<00:06:24.139> they<00:06:24.469> if

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
server or at least notify you if they if

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.399 
server or at least notify you if they if
the<00:06:25.070> from<00:06:25.580> if<00:06:25.969> the<00:06:26.210> plug-in<00:06:26.810> the<00:06:26.990> text<00:06:27.259> that

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
the from if the plug-in the text that

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.279 
the from if the plug-in the text that
the<00:06:27.530> players<00:06:27.770> are<00:06:28.009> hacking<00:06:28.219> so<00:06:29.060> it's<00:06:29.870> not<00:06:29.990> only

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
the players are hacking so it's not only

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.959 
the players are hacking so it's not only
this<00:06:30.590> plug-in<00:06:31.009> does<00:06:31.190> that<00:06:31.430> but<00:06:31.639> there's<00:06:31.820> also

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 
this plug-in does that but there's also

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:34.749 
this plug-in does that but there's also
alternatives<00:06:32.719> such<00:06:32.870> as<00:06:32.900> anti<00:06:33.380> cheat<00:06:33.650> so<00:06:34.400> all

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
alternatives such as anti cheat so all

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.579 
alternatives such as anti cheat so all
these<00:06:35.000> are<00:06:35.270> great<00:06:35.449> plugins<00:06:36.020> you<00:06:36.260> can<00:06:36.409> just

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589 
these are great plugins you can just

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.320 
these are great plugins you can just
choose<00:06:36.800> which<00:06:37.010> one<00:06:37.190> that<00:06:37.430> you<00:06:37.610> like<00:06:38.000> or<00:06:38.300> the

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
choose which one that you like or the

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.909 
choose which one that you like or the
ones<00:06:38.599> that<00:06:38.779> your<00:06:39.050> player<00:06:39.289> like<00:06:39.529> that<00:06:39.800> your

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
ones that your player like that your

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:40.839 
ones that your player like that your
player<00:06:40.099> base<00:06:40.400> like

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
player base like

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.889 
player base like
the<00:06:40.939> most<00:06:41.149> so<00:06:42.399> yeah<00:06:43.399> these<00:06:43.759> are<00:06:43.969> the<00:06:43.999> basic

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:44.899 
the most so yeah these are the basic

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:46.589 
the most so yeah these are the basic
core<00:06:45.229> plugins<00:06:45.709> that<00:06:45.800> you're<00:06:45.949> going<00:06:46.159> to<00:06:46.279> need

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
core plugins that you're going to need

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.480 
core plugins that you're going to need
you<00:06:47.599> can<00:06:47.779> probably<00:06:48.139> get<00:06:48.649> this<00:06:49.039> is<00:06:49.219> like<00:06:49.339> the

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
you can probably get this is like the

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.609 
you can probably get this is like the
bare<00:06:49.789> minimum<00:06:50.330> for<00:06:50.360> a<00:06:50.569> faction<00:06:51.110> server<00:06:51.319> though

00:06:51.609 --> 00:06:51.619 
bare minimum for a faction server though

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.010 
bare minimum for a faction server though
you<00:06:52.369> I<00:06:52.699> wouldn't<00:06:53.209> say<00:06:53.360> that<00:06:53.509> you<00:06:53.599> can<00:06:53.749> get<00:06:53.899> away

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
you I wouldn't say that you can get away

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.019 
you I wouldn't say that you can get away
with<00:06:54.289> using<00:06:54.469> any<00:06:54.830> less<00:06:55.189> than<00:06:55.490> these<00:06:55.669> plugins

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:56.029 
with using any less than these plugins

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:00.309 
with using any less than these plugins
so<00:06:57.550> yeah<00:06:58.550> you<00:06:59.059> can<00:06:59.209> definitely<00:06:59.360> add<00:06:59.839> more<00:07:00.139> than

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 
so yeah you can definitely add more than

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.529 
so yeah you can definitely add more than
this<00:07:00.469> just<00:07:00.889> whatever<00:07:01.099> it<00:07:01.399> makes<00:07:01.639> whatever<00:07:02.330> you

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
this just whatever it makes whatever you

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:04.269 
this just whatever it makes whatever you
really<00:07:02.719> enjoy<00:07:03.139> with<00:07:03.649> your<00:07:03.770> server<00:07:04.009> wherever

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:04.279 
really enjoy with your server wherever

you<00:07:04.369> see<00:07:04.490> that<00:07:04.669> works<00:07:04.999> then<00:07:05.659> just<00:07:05.869> keep<00:07:06.050> using

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.289 
you see that works then just keep using
