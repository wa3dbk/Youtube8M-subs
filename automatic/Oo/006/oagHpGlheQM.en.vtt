see<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.120> my<00:00:51.270> hints<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> infrared<00:00:52.020> got<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
see we have my hints of infrared got the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.549 
see we have my hints of infrared got the
infrared<00:00:53.309> 23<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> hill<00:00:54.149> got<00:00:55.079> our<00:00:55.230> infrared

this is where I was just saying she
would<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.939> our<00:01:21.240> infrared<00:01:21.900> Jumpman<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
would have our infrared Jumpman on the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.780 
would have our infrared Jumpman on the
inside<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:24.830> take<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> look<00:01:26.009> back<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> front

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
inside so take a look back at the front

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.270 
inside so take a look back at the front
you<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.750> our<00:01:27.780> all-black<00:01:28.380> world

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you see we have our all-black world

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.450 
you see we have our all-black world
places<00:01:29.930> we<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.110> about<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.710> black<00:01:32.009> tent<00:01:32.280> pad
