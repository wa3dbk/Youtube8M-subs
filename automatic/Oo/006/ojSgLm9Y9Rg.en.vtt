00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.900 
studio and Mukilteo Washington well I
think<00:00:10.380> when<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.710> first<00:00:11.070> started<00:00:11.429> blowing<00:00:11.790> glass

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
think when I first started blowing glass

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.940 
think when I first started blowing glass
I<00:00:12.240> wasn't<00:00:12.540> really<00:00:12.929> interested<00:00:13.170> or<00:00:13.620> making

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
I wasn't really interested or making

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.230 
I wasn't really interested or making
goblets<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:15.509> was<00:00:15.630> just<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:17.240> how

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
goblets and it was just because of how

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.990 
goblets and it was just because of how
difficult<00:00:18.660> they<00:00:19.109> seemed<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.650> be<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.070> they<00:00:20.850> are

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
difficult they seemed to be and they are

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.460 
difficult they seemed to be and they are
and<00:00:22.279> trying<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:24.449> know<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:24.990> perfect

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and trying to you know get it as perfect

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.120 
and trying to you know get it as perfect
as<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.680> could<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:27.510> then<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:28.410> spent<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> lot<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
as I could and then I spent a lot of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.370 
as I could and then I spent a lot of
years<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.849> still<00:00:30.179> am<00:00:30.390> working<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.170> Dale

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
salviati's maybe mid 1800s and I tried

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.590 
salviati's maybe mid 1800s and I tried
the<00:01:45.490> best<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:45.790> could<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.119> recreate<00:01:46.479> them<00:01:48.600> after

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
the best I could to recreate them after

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.190 
the best I could to recreate them after
that<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:51.460> kind<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.789> sparked<00:01:52.149> an<00:01:52.360> interest<00:01:52.810> in

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
that it kind of sparked an interest in

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.100 
that it kind of sparked an interest in
making<00:01:53.649> some<00:01:54.369> of<00:01:54.460> these<00:01:54.550> pieces<00:01:54.840> more<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.960> my

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
making some of these pieces more of my

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.399 
making some of these pieces more of my
own<00:01:56.289> a<00:01:56.590> little<00:01:56.950> bit<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.630> would<00:01:58.960> go<00:01:59.140> through

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
own a little bit so I would go through

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.560 
own a little bit so I would go through
all<00:01:59.500> these<00:01:59.890> books<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.520> there's<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.970> handful<00:02:01.509> of

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
all these books and there's a handful of

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.130 
all these books and there's a handful of
grey<00:02:01.869> ones<00:02:02.170> dealing<00:02:03.100> with<00:02:03.399> old<00:02:04.140> Venetian

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
glass and it's always been an interest

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.259 
glass and it's always been an interest
and<00:02:07.929> using<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.769> lot<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.670> techniques<00:02:10.149> that

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269
