to<00:02:22.260> country<00:02:22.709> contradictory<00:02:23.370> things<00:02:23.610> like

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
to country contradictory things like

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.819 
to country contradictory things like
slower<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.569> quicker<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.049> less<00:02:25.079> is<00:02:25.409> more<00:02:25.620> and

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
slower is quicker and less is more and

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.199 
slower is quicker and less is more and
and<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:27.750> yards<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.349> this<00:02:28.819> don't<00:02:29.819> feel<00:02:30.030> this

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
and in yards like this don't feel this

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.960 
and in yards like this don't feel this
yard<00:02:30.480> ride<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.959> with<00:02:30.989> cattle<00:02:31.500> half<00:02:32.370> fill<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.760> so

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
yard ride up with cattle half fill it so

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
yard ride up with cattle half fill it so
that<00:02:33.750> you're<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:34.470> tying<00:02:34.769> is<00:02:34.980> talking<00:02:35.280> or<00:02:35.400> not

you like to work work through these
yards<00:02:55.769> our<00:02:56.220> safety<00:02:56.849> safety<00:02:57.629> is<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.989> big<00:02:58.019> thing

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
yards our safety safety is a big thing

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.399 
yards our safety safety is a big thing
because<00:02:58.650> not<00:02:59.310> everyone<00:02:59.849> that<00:03:00.629> goes<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:01.049> handle

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
because not everyone that goes to handle

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.539 
because not everyone that goes to handle
stock<00:03:01.790> uses<00:03:02.790> low<00:03:03.510> stress<00:03:03.810> methods<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.549> and

stock uses low stress methods and and

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.339 
stock uses low stress methods and and
people<00:03:06.269> will<00:03:06.389> tell<00:03:06.629> you<00:03:06.720> if<00:03:06.840> we<00:03:06.930> don't<00:03:07.139> get

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
people will tell you if we don't get

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.629 
people will tell you if we don't get
stressed<00:03:08.450> but<00:03:09.450> when<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.810> see<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.370> way<00:03:11.459> they

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
stressed but when you see the way they

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.449 
stressed but when you see the way they
treat<00:03:11.909> stock<00:03:12.680> they<00:03:13.680> don't<00:03:13.889> mean<00:03:14.129> to<00:03:14.280> stress

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
treat stock they don't mean to stress

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.160 
treat stock they don't mean to stress
them<00:03:14.790> because<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.510> think<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.870> lot<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.079> people

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
them because I think a lot of people

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.809 
them because I think a lot of people
don't<00:03:16.620> realize<00:03:16.709> where<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.370> stress<00:03:17.760> comes

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
don't realize where the stress comes

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.640 
don't realize where the stress comes
from<00:03:18.650> someone<00:03:19.650> will<00:03:19.769> say<00:03:19.919> oh<00:03:19.949> I<00:03:21.260> feed<00:03:22.260> my<00:03:22.290> stock

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
from someone will say oh I feed my stock

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.259 
from someone will say oh I feed my stock
or<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:22.859> blow<00:03:23.129> a<00:03:23.220> whistle<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.639> they<00:03:23.790> move<00:03:23.970> well

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
or I blow a whistle and they move well

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.479 
or I blow a whistle and they move well
that<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:25.139> part<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.709> stress<00:03:25.980> like<00:03:26.310> that

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
that is part of the stress like that

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.800 
that is part of the stress like that
they're<00:03:26.879> waiting<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.419> whistle<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.780> blow

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
they're waiting for that whistle to blow

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.890 
they're waiting for that whistle to blow
yeah<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.769> these<00:03:29.340> types<00:03:29.669> of<00:03:29.849> things<00:03:29.910> or<00:03:30.599> my

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
yeah and these types of things or my

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.619 
yeah and these types of things or my
stock<00:03:31.169> come<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.530> blow<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.859> horn<00:03:32.359> yeah<00:03:33.359> well

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
stock come and I blow the horn yeah well

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.400 
stock come and I blow the horn yeah well
I<00:03:33.870> think<00:03:34.079> that's<00:03:34.470> part<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:34.949> stress<00:03:35.209> so

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
I think that's part of the stress so

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.339 
I think that's part of the stress so
it's<00:03:37.410> just<00:03:38.030> but<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.150> yard<00:03:39.569> systems<00:03:40.109> great

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
it's just but the yard systems great

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.170 
it's just but the yard systems great
I've<00:03:40.560> been<00:03:41.250> with<00:03:41.400> Murray<00:03:41.609> ever<00:03:41.849> since<00:03:42.060> he

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
I've been with Murray ever since he

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.250 
I've been with Murray ever since he
started<00:03:42.389> and<00:03:44.419> the<00:03:45.419> odds<00:03:45.599> are<00:03:45.810> made<00:03:46.019> with

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
started and the odds are made with

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.659 
started and the odds are made with
safety<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.709> mind<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:49.560> design<00:03:49.949> so<00:03:50.639> that

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
safety in mind and the design so that

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.339 
safety in mind and the design so that
you<00:03:50.879> can<00:03:51.030> actually<00:03:51.180> use<00:03:51.599> your<00:03:51.870> low<00:03:52.019> stress

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
you can actually use your low stress

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.729 
you can actually use your low stress
methods<00:03:52.799> in<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.160> yards<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:54.620> keep<00:03:55.620> your

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
methods in the yards and keep your

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.449 
methods in the yards and keep your
movement<00:03:55.889> flowing<00:03:56.459> as<00:03:56.579> we<00:03:57.359> saw<00:03:57.569> earlier<00:03:58.459> stock

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
movement flowing as we saw earlier stock

an organic place we couldn't use

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.420 
an organic place we couldn't use
chemicals<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.140> we<00:05:07.920> injected<00:05:08.310> them<00:05:08.400> with

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430

chemicals so we injected them with
vitamin<00:05:08.910> C<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:11.010> next<00:05:11.520> day<00:05:11.640> they<00:05:11.760> got<00:05:11.880> up

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030

walked<00:05:12.180> away<00:05:12.360> now<00:05:13.020> so<00:05:13.460> there<00:05:14.460> again<00:05:14.700> it's<00:05:14.880> a

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
walked away now so there again it's a

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.940 
walked away now so there again it's a
holistic<00:05:15.690> thing<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.050> think<00:05:16.110> with<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.560> vitamin

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
C and the minerals are getting from the

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.820 
C and the minerals are getting from the
