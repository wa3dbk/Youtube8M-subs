00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello today I bring you another video of 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.869
 recycling let's make an organizer 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.690
 with a box of cookies as you see is very 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.670
 nice and we also help the planet that 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.650
 that's good what we want in this 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.449
 It is very important to recycle 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.670
 we know and good the materials that we are going 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.890
 to use are very simple notes 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.740
 we're going to need a box of cookies 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.900
 resistol or white glue wrapping paper 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.570
 to line the or any paper that 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.550
 you want to iure or good adhesive tape is 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.370
 the same but we will also need 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.440
 scissors and pen and good among all 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.020
 let's see how it's done let's start 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.000
 removing the clean mold from the mag 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.800
 good the mold of the cookies that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.050
 we have where we put the cookies what 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.260
 we are going to take out and that must be clean 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.629
 let's start by removing the lid from the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.760
 that is, we are going to cut it out and 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.949
 how was it that we are going to 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.360
 make is the lid splice it with the box 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.800
 and well let's apply only 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.620
 glue and we're going to paste them 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.110
 also so that there is a little more 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.120
 resistant we are going to put diurex at 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.500
 eyelashes that we left as you see 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.170
 we only had three tabs 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 but it does not matter with that is enough 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.480
 and our box was more reinforced 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.160
 once we already did this we are going to 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.440
 put the mold again where the 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.050
 cookies and we're going to cut to the height 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.300
 where we stayed about two 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.980
 centimeters above the mold that is 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.440
 that half-humorous plastic that 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.450
 Ages and well and then if it is 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.210
 necessary after having cut we're going 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.550
 to hit again hard after 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.590
 we take out the mold and start to cover 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.440
 let's form our box too 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.330
 inside and I'm going to use glue but 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.720
 we have to embargo the good so that 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.690
 we are like wrinkles in the paper 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.000
 Now put the mold back but before 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.470
 put a little bit of glue on the base 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.470
 and wait until you want 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.530
 and ready as you see now if you can already 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.959
 put everything you want to me 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.599
 He liked it a lot since the rooms of 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.879
 they fit perfectly in the squares 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.970
 of the cookies you can put what 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.739
 I want you to put foundation foundations 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.860
 round as you see they will be perfectly 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.170
 to size really is something that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.360
 only you want to put it in, I hope 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.269
 you liked it as you see it is very practical 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.910
 and it also helps us a lot to help the 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.799
 planet I hope you liked it I went 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.989
