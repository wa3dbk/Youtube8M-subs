00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and then you want to start up any random

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.290 
and then you want to start up any random
mission<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.310> recommend<00:00:29.730> using<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.119> mission

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
mission I recommend using the mission

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.049 
mission I recommend using the mission
messed<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:32.969> any

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
messed up because you can get it at any

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.180 
messed up because you can get it at any
level<00:00:33.360> okay<00:00:33.780> pretty<00:00:33.989> much<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.500> level<00:00:34.950> 5<00:00:35.160> I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
level okay pretty much like level 5 I

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.010 
level okay pretty much like level 5 I
think<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.670> opens<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.450> really<00:00:36.690> good<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
think it opens up so it's really good to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.139 
think it opens up so it's really good to
use<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.649> ok<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.399> once<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.910> into<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
use for this ok so once you get into the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.430 
use for this ok so once you get into the
mission<00:00:39.480> menu<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.809> want<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:40.110> ahead<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
mission menu you want to go ahead and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.170 
mission menu you want to go ahead and
invite<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.920> friend<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.820> don't<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
invite your friend and you don't have to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.000 
invite your friend and you don't have to
change<00:00:42.390> any<00:00:42.629> settings<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> mission<00:00:43.770> all<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
change any settings in the mission all I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.650 
change any settings in the mission all I
did<00:00:44.309> was<00:00:44.460> change<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.789> matchmaking<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.450> close

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
did was change the matchmaking to close

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.360 
did was change the matchmaking to close
so<00:00:45.930> while<00:00:46.079> my<00:00:46.200> friend<00:00:46.469> was<00:00:46.649> joining<00:00:47.070> no<00:00:47.219> one

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
so while my friend was joining no one

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.270 
so while my friend was joining no one

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
else joined in - ok so once that job

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.220 
else joined in - ok so once that job
loads<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.969> once<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.360> launch<00:00:51.600> into<00:00:52.110> the
