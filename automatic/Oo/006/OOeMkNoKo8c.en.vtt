alarm clock it had fairly limited
functionality<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.920> did<00:00:23.869> tell<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
functionality but it did tell you the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.810 
functionality but it did tell you the
time<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.680> could<00:00:25.830> actually<00:00:26.010> talk<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.430> it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820

actually take a look at the next

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.040 
actually take a look at the next
generation<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> device<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.660> comes<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
generation of device it comes from a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.799 
generation of device it comes from a
company<00:00:40.260> called<00:00:40.379> Ivy<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:42.360> device<00:00:42.629> is

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
company called Ivy and the device is

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.959 
company called Ivy and the device is
called<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> Ivy<00:00:43.469> personal<00:00:44.040> assistant<00:00:44.670> not

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
called the Ivy personal assistant not

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.910 
called the Ivy personal assistant not
just<00:00:45.180> an<00:00:45.300> alarm<00:00:45.570> clock<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.559> haven't<00:00:46.829> even

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
just an alarm clock and I haven't even

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.229 
just an alarm clock and I haven't even
turned<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.370> yet<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.640> thought<00:00:47.820> we'd<00:00:47.969> actually

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
turned it on yet I thought we'd actually

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
turned it on yet I thought we'd actually
walk<00:00:48.390> through<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.719> together<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.469> first<00:00:49.770> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
walk through that together but first I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.229 
walk through that together but first I
thought<00:00:50.070> we'd<00:00:50.250> take<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> look<00:00:50.640> at<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.090> device

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
thought we'd take a look at the device

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.889 
thought we'd take a look at the device
itself

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
itself

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.400 
itself

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you've got audio preset mode this is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.260 
you've got audio preset mode this is
actually<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> microphone<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.820> looks<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
actually the microphone it looks like a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.720 
actually the microphone it looks like a
small<00:00:58.020> headphone<00:00:58.649> jack<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.550> this

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
small headphone jack but it's not this

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
small headphone jack but it's not this
is<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> microphone<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:00.989> there

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
is the microphone so it's right there

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.740 
is the microphone so it's right there

you'll see there is an auxilary in Jack

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100 
you'll see there is an auxilary in Jack
right<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.270> an<00:01:15.479> antenna<00:01:15.780> here

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
right there there is an antenna here

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.840 
right there there is an antenna here
because<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.860> also<00:01:17.009> an<00:01:17.220> FM<00:01:17.400> radio

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
because it's also an FM radio

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.770 
because it's also an FM radio
you've<00:01:18.780> got<00:01:19.080> sync<00:01:19.710> on-and-off<00:01:20.310> voice<00:01:21.210> volume

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you've got sync on-and-off voice volume

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.300 
you've got sync on-and-off voice volume
high<00:01:22.619> medium<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.340> low<00:01:23.450> touch<00:01:24.450> control<00:01:24.900> here

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
high medium and low touch control here

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.710 
high medium and low touch control here
you've<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.520> auto<00:01:26.790> dimming<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.600> off

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you've got auto dimming on and off

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.560 
you've got auto dimming on and off
you've<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:29.070> choice<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.460> Fahrenheit<00:01:30.270> or

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you've got your choice of Fahrenheit or

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.190 
you've got your choice of Fahrenheit or
Celsius<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.860> you've<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:32.909> DST<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.110> off

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
Celsius here you've got DST on and off

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.929 
Celsius here you've got DST on and off
and<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.950> volume<00:01:35.670> alarm<00:01:36.150> high<00:01:36.570> medium<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.650> low

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
and the volume alarm high medium and low

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.190 
and the volume alarm high medium and low
so<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.090> are<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> lot<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> different<00:01:39.840> controls

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so there are a lot of different controls

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
so there are a lot of different controls
on<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.610> device<00:01:41.880> actually

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
on this and what the device actually

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.399 
on this and what the device actually
tells<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> box<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.700> that<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.409> connect

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
tells you on the box is that you connect

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.370 
tells you on the box is that you connect
the<00:01:46.740> USB<00:01:46.950> cable<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> back<00:01:48.350> take<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the USB cable to the back take the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.590 
the USB cable to the back take the
included<00:01:49.950> wall<00:01:50.430> charger<00:01:50.490> obviously<00:01:51.450> it's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
included wall charger obviously it's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.940 
included wall charger obviously it's
included<00:01:52.020> because<00:01:52.170> otherwise<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.740> won't<00:01:52.890> work

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
included because otherwise it won't work

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.490 
included because otherwise it won't work
and<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:54.540> turn<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.290> will<00:01:55.320> actually

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and you turn it on and it will actually

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.410 
and you turn it on and it will actually
start<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.340> setup<00:01:56.520> process<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.180> thought<00:01:57.329> we

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
start the setup process so I thought we

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.230 
start the setup process so I thought we
would<00:01:57.540> actually<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.170> together<00:01:59.240> Ivy's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
would actually do that together Ivy's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.940 
would actually do that together Ivy's
voice<00:02:00.540> recognition<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.229> powered<00:02:01.619> by<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
voice recognition is powered by a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.950 
voice recognition is powered by a
