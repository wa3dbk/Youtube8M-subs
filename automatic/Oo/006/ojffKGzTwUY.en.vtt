00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello in this video a little different from the 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.990
 I usually want to clarify a few things 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.030
 masses I think that up until two months ago I 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.469
 have an online store of raw materials 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 cosmetic 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.600
 as many of you will know and since 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.039
 this period many arrived 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.350
 me yours in which he asked me 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 rightly because you can no longer manage to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.830
 access the live shows that precisely 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.180
 you wanted to do it out of order 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.390
 much pleasure but now decided in short 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.450
 to explain in others but also because I have 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.730
 read everything on the internet then 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.430
 people who wrote about everything and more 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.489
 on why I closed this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 shop but no matter I leave out 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.370
 answer us to the people who 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.270
 love the people I am 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.520
 they follow and rightly ask me why 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.539
 I can no longer access tours 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.170
 exciting 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.720
 then i closed it because i 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 fortunately they play every day 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.600
 we work are a drug like many of 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.220
 you will know and therefore I am fortunate to 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.509
 just do all this work 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.590
 days 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.630
 in addition to the work of naturopath I also 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.490
 many other work commitments that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.759
 however, they always concern this 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.220
 commitments sector that I may not have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.780
 still spoken but that occupy you 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.780
 really a long time 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.040
 in short, if you like some knowledge 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.830
 he too and then I also have the good fortune of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.220
 participate in the wonderful program 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.770
 television bed made that for other 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.290
 lot 7 for which god katrina marine in 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.940
 all the other tutors are waiting for you 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.460
 and I hope you will follow me too 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.910
 this year as you did the year 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.759
 last thank you again so much e 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.780
 so in short I'm also preparing the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.420
 unfortunately new episodes therefore 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.959
 not being able to dedicate a little bit of 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.830
 a very demanding activity like a 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.459
 shop online because it looks like what not 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.120
 demanding face marra to avoid 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.000
 to make donkey mistakes to not take me 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.190
 correctly to you 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.720
 I rewrote close it in the sense that I have 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.570
 had to make a choice 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.410
 as there are many other sites of 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.959
 qualified cosmetic raw materials that 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.100
 however they work very well from me here 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:54.720
 I refuel too, I preferred to be my friend 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.690
 part and dedicate myself completely to that 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.440
 that I liked 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.480
 the possibility despite all the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.400
 orders still arrive I will 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.000
 thank you very much because not 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.590
 I thought I made sense like that 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.170
 since the opening of online stores since 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.680
 immediately so I thank you very much 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.410
 you were really cute then 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.910
 nothing this is the wanted to be a 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.540
 short video I think it's a little more 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.820
 long than what I had in mind 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.800
 if you have any questions, write the questions 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.400
 Comments below will answer the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.290
 as soon as possible and nothing I hope to have 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.740
 clarified some things I hope not 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.870
 having bored you and I send you a kiss 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.940
 see you in the next video I think 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.390
 that will be a video tutorial 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.390
