00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
the center like this and then you take

00:05:46.810 --> 00:06:05.040 
the center like this and then you take
your<00:05:46.950> heat<00:05:47.950> gun<00:05:47.980> and<00:05:50.850> you<00:05:58.410> dry<00:05:59.410> it

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
and I think you've ruined it but he

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.920 
and I think you've ruined it but he
swears<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:08.979> don't<00:06:09.250> so<00:06:09.759> I<00:06:09.789> believed<00:06:10.270> in<00:06:10.509> and<00:06:10.780> he

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
swears you don't so I believed in and he

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.490 
swears you don't so I believed in and he

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
here so that his face was a little bit

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.059
