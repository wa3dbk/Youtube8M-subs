00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:36.440 

I'm<00:00:05.960> just<00:00:06.939> rechecking<00:00:07.939> my<00:00:08.269> steps<00:00:08.750> now

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.780 

not<00:00:37.080> absolutely<00:00:37.770> sure<00:00:37.860> whether<00:00:38.280> I've<00:00:38.460> shown

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
not absolutely sure whether I've shown

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.350 
not absolutely sure whether I've shown
you<00:00:38.820> all<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.690> correct<00:00:40.080> things<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.310> this<00:00:42.150> is

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you all that correct things but this is

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.170 
you all that correct things but this is
the<00:00:42.510> idea<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.620> always<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:44.610> case<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the idea so it's always the case that

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.270 
the idea so it's always the case that
you<00:00:45.630> should<00:00:46.260> pull<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.250> nice<00:00:49.070> bit<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you should pull on the nice bit of the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.180 
you should pull on the nice bit of the
court<00:00:50.630> closest<00:00:51.630> to<00:00:51.810> you<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.650> want<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.950> pull

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
court closest to you you want to pull

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.320 
court closest to you you want to pull
that<00:00:53.400> that<00:00:54.150> bit<00:00:54.710> should<00:00:55.710> go<00:00:55.920> through<00:00:56.220> i'll<00:00:57.180> do

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
that that bit should go through i'll do

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.750 
that that bit should go through i'll do
that<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.630> with<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.080> second<00:00:58.620> okay<00:00:59.400> so<00:00:59.460> now

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
that with with a second okay so now

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.799 
that with with a second okay so now
we're<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.450> switch<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.470> loops<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:03.720> as

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
we're going to switch the loops and as

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.680 
we're going to switch the loops and as
you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.080> see

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.590 

you<00:01:09.200> can<00:01:09.350> see<00:01:09.590> it's<00:01:09.820> laced<00:01:10.820> under<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.420> blue

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
you can see it's laced under the blue

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.280 
you can see it's laced under the blue
part<00:01:11.900> here<00:01:12.170> right<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:12.740> now<00:01:12.890> we're<00:01:13.040> going<00:01:13.270> lace

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
part here right so now we're going lace

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.560 
part here right so now we're going lace
the<00:01:15.290> white<00:01:15.500> loop

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.540 

so<00:01:20.170> we<00:01:20.290> need<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.590> pull<00:01:20.830> that<00:01:21.040> part<00:01:21.370> through

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.030 

it's<00:01:27.000> facing<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.480> direction<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:28.050> now<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.800> end

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it's facing my direction now now you end

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.770 
it's facing my direction now now you end
up<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.300> is<00:01:30.360> where<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
up with this and this is where you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.640 
up with this and this is where you
should<00:01:30.810> end<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.430> because<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.260> pull

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
should end up because now I want to pull

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.450 
should end up because now I want to pull
the<00:01:35.430> white<00:01:35.700> loop<00:01:36.860> underneath<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.070> blue<00:01:38.280> one

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the white loop underneath the blue one

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.880 
the white loop underneath the blue one
this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.000> very<00:01:39.240> loose<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.410> tight<00:01:40.680> as

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
this is very loose it's not as tight as

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.230 
this is very loose it's not as tight as
all<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.160> other<00:01:41.280> ones

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.160 

then<00:01:44.900> I<00:01:45.200> end<00:01:46.159> up<00:01:46.399> I<00:01:46.700> would<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.570> would<00:01:47.750> see<00:01:47.930> this

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
then I end up I would you would see this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.139 
then I end up I would you would see this
and<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:50.270> important<00:01:50.810> thing<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.170> see<00:01:51.380> here<00:01:51.680> is

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
and the important thing to see here is

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.719 
and the important thing to see here is
again<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:55.040> part<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.520> loop

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
again that the part of the loop

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.910 
again that the part of the loop
clothes-stealing<00:01:56.479> is<00:01:57.909> laced<00:01:58.909> here<00:01:59.869> under<00:02:00.830> the

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
clothes-stealing is laced here under the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.210 
clothes-stealing is laced here under the
white<00:02:01.220> thing<00:02:01.450> so<00:02:02.450> even<00:02:03.320> if<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.710> use<00:02:03.950> two

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
white thing so even if you use two

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.690 
white thing so even if you use two
colors<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:04.880> not<00:02:05.149> always<00:02:05.740> blue<00:02:06.740> /<00:02:07.130> white<00:02:07.159> or

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
colors it's not always blue / white or

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.040 
colors it's not always blue / white or
whatever<00:02:08.090> colors<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.539> use<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:11.050> pull

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
whatever colors you use so I pull

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.140 
whatever colors you use so I pull
through<00:02:13.269> this<00:02:14.269> last<00:02:14.630> bit<00:02:14.989> of<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.230> loop<00:02:16.060> then<00:02:17.060> I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
through this last bit of the loop then I

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150 
through this last bit of the loop then I
end<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.690> with<00:02:18.230> something<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.709> looks<00:02:18.890> like

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
end up with something that looks like

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.539 
end up with something that looks like
this<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.560> prettiest<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.280> I've

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
this this is not the prettiest not I've

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.260 
this this is not the prettiest not I've
ever<00:02:22.730> made<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.080> should<00:02:24.380> work

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.110 

I<00:02:28.390> pull<00:02:28.870> these<00:02:29.050> things

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
I pull these things

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.180 
I pull these things
I<00:02:31.180> pull<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.840> two<00:02:32.019> strands<00:02:32.379> and<00:02:32.709> as<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.040> can

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
I pull the two strands and as you can

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.619 
I pull the two strands and as you can
see<00:02:33.220> both<00:02:34.000> loops<00:02:35.430> completely<00:02:36.430> disappear<00:02:37.120> and

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
see both loops completely disappear and

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.330 
see both loops completely disappear and
that<00:02:37.989> means<00:02:38.290> I've<00:02:38.650> done<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.700> correctly<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:42.250> as

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
that means I've done it correctly and as

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.990 
that means I've done it correctly and as
you<00:02:42.489> can<00:02:42.580> see<00:02:42.610> now<00:02:42.940> we<00:02:43.750> have<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:45.000> functional

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
you can see now we have a functional

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.910 
you can see now we have a functional
chop<00:02:46.330> King<00:02:46.569> loop<00:02:47.610> not<00:02:48.610> sorry<00:02:49.560> exactly<00:02:50.560> not

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
chop King loop not sorry exactly not

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.420 
chop King loop not sorry exactly not
now

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
now

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.260 
now
and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
and

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.930 
and
the<00:02:55.690> thing<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.370> just<00:02:57.580> rote

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
the thing is that this is just rote

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.120 
the thing is that this is just rote
learning<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.840> need<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.110> do<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.260> again<00:02:59.890> and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
learning you need to do this again and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.520 
learning you need to do this again and
again<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:00.730> again<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.600> then<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.170> will<00:03:02.320> find

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
again and again and then you will find

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.980 
again and again and then you will find
it<00:03:02.650> progressively<00:03:03.100> more<00:03:03.340> easier<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.870> to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
it progressively more easier just to

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.330 
it progressively more easier just to
show<00:03:05.230> you

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.690 

this<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:10.120> just<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.590> fast<00:03:11.590> version<00:03:11.739> I'm<00:03:12.280> going

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
this is just the fast version I'm going

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.650 
this is just the fast version I'm going
to<00:03:12.819> do<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.120> full<00:03:13.840> speed<00:03:13.989> now

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.090 

and<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:19.730> again<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.960> to<00:03:22.020> stress<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.620> this

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
and I again I like to stress that this

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.550 
and I again I like to stress that this
is<00:03:23.660> not<00:03:24.660> difficult<00:03:25.820> honestly<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:28.140> only<00:03:28.170> thing

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560

learned once you've made 30 or 40 knots
you<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.810> do<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.110> with<00:03:43.170> your<00:03:43.410> eyes<00:03:43.470> closed

you can do this with your eyes closed
which<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.550> what<00:03:44.730> I'm<00:03:44.820> demonstrating<00:03:45.030> now<00:03:45.720> this

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
which is what I'm demonstrating now this

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.420 
which is what I'm demonstrating now this
is<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:47.660> most<00:03:48.660> difficult<00:03:49.200> part<00:03:49.500> with<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
is the most difficult part with the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.210 
is the most difficult part with the
lacing<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.630> various<00:03:52.280> loops

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
lacing of the various loops

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.370 
lacing of the various loops
and<00:03:55.310> as<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.120> can<00:03:56.240> see<00:03:56.270> my<00:03:56.660> eyes<00:03:56.960> are<00:03:57.200> closed

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
and as you can see my eyes are closed

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.160 
and as you can see my eyes are closed
now<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:58.130> can't<00:03:58.550> see

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.479 

I<00:04:04.260> pull<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.190> one<00:04:05.400> under<00:04:05.640> there<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:07.310> then<00:04:08.310> it

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
I pull this one under there and then it

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.070 
I pull this one under there and then it
should<00:04:08.640> be<00:04:08.819> something<00:04:09.150> about<00:04:09.390> there

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
should be something about there

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.940 
should be something about there
now<00:04:11.650> comes<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.490> moment<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:13.090> truth
