 little problem not enough of the doctor's 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.009
 dream but finally the sound is very 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.689
 balanced which is rare for a 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.460

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.829

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.840
 sticks with the speaker that can 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.219

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.620
 why I have in hand because she 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.060
 has a small a small interesting system 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.829
 okay you have a speaker for a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.599
 pregnant that can put 2 after 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.400
 have twice as much power delay 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.959
 m 2 hit them one against the hotel towards 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.430
 one of the stereo speakers with left and 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.030
 right here you go it's the speaker 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.530
 beats xl by bit or dubai doctor drive 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.609
 a nice little thing for that will sell 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.780
 anyway and it's a little bit expensive 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.079
 still beats to a must say this 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.819
 who is 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.680
 the sound is very nice there are a lot of 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.730
 serious of course as always with city 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.340
 its meaning that it's really done for the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.109
 dr dre music and see fifty cent 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.280
 well, in short, I do not care much 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.620
 a lot and I really like the design the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.719
 side as its spatial capsule next 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.049
 big suppository fava the pill what the 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:26.799
 children 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:27.609
 the hatch not one step two but three 3 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.560
 movies that could be downright 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.939
 edition of pizza movie it's like the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.169
 integral happiness does what it's doing well 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.159
 I can not stand it will please them the 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.109
 sphere of the pisa movie so for 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.030
 start a movie that the meeting of two 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.709
 big is called escape so it's a 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.879
 scenario not possible with two monsters 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.989
 of cinema that could not be seen in 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.489
 painting so that they have a door 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.930
 now aging drought 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.879
 war and salom in a movie or stallone 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.889
 plays the role of a guy who is in charge of 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.060
 check the security of prisons 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.259
 who lets himself be locked up in a prison 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.829
 and maneuvering street is that allows 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.359
 to get out 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.859
 so of course there is a prison that goes 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.540
 resist him they go to lock him up 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.370
 expressing this evening of a machination and there 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.989
 of course a fellow prisoner played by 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.879
 schwarzenegger who is going to point who is going 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.799
 help stallone hurry out of the 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.509
 prison so this is an escape movie all 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.500
 and in the third degree that of the big delirium 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.489
 and make references to their career 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.229
 and cult dialogues 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.699
 they're sending vans to slaps it's 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.599
 this is great but I spend a 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.970
 great time watching this movie 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.349
 escape with stallone having a war 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.120
 I recommend it's almost a pizza 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.909
 moving face is called to move on a 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.320
 afraid of words all the same then 2 1 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.549
 that's where the kids are 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.810
 serious three seconds this is still the 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.910
 blow of heart of my favorites of 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.470
 favorites it's called it's the end 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.850
 so fast and only fnac so I 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.530
 not why the blu-ray the outputs that 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.460
 the fnac one asks me I do not know then 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.510
 that's the end it's called a 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.520
 choral film so what is a movie 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.230
 chorale it's a film made by a guy 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.130
 often a jar of compote with all the 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.170
 world by the way it's this time john 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.370
 that I absolutely adore that he said we are going 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.780
 make a movie with all my friends 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.370
 reread August at the fourth rank that there is 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.710
 lots of people like that ya'i rihanna who 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.820
 pass ya karim ben watson and the goal of 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.440
 the maneuver is a small evening a 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.400
 kind of evening a little enrgy and that is 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.900
 what happens at a given moment while 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.610
 it shook and it's the end of the world 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.840
 then the actors play squarely their 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.160
 role since it's called james and 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.870
 is called this is rihanna who is there 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.040
 its share literally in spin at 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.790
 incredible scenes special effects 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.900
 unbelievable 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.910
 I had never seen anything like this before 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.620
 his share from all sides we are fed up 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.880
 the dialogues are downright cult because 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.900
 that fresh dialogues refer to 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.010
 their own career 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.630
 so people start talking about 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.740
 harry potter of all so brief we pass 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.600
 a great time it's a shot of 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.270
 total heart I advise you to buy 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.890
 this blu ray or this dvd of his late because 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.930
 it's john with james franco and all 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.430
 the string of super actors superphone 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.510
 that we can find a relay where were 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.440
 the young wolves of Hollywood and believe 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.850
 me the film is worth its weight 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.780
 peanuts your soul to the waho not 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.890
 easy today to I hang on 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.150
 because it's the pizza 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.230
 movie I found I do not know where 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.970
 I do not know where it came from 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.260
 sami is called jack killer brooks 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.000
 monsters then the scenario just not 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.350
 be it a kid he was a kid 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.760
 all kind finds himself somewhere and 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.470
 his parents are blown up 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.970
 by a kind of medieval monster 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.500
 out of a depressive thing years because 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.419
 c is suddenly after themselves 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.100
 does he pass he is an adult he continues to 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.169
 to be very very vengeful and his teacher a 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.490
 super super nice teacher played by robert 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.570
 englund who was the gentleman who 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.340
 was making the claws of the night that was 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.050
 so frigui freddy krueger who have this 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.490
 movie he becomes own here the 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.020
 possessed by some kind of spirit is going 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.220
 start abut all his students 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.660
 parent by catching them big 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.740
 tentacles these cases to say I'm going to 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.050
 to do it is a film in which is done 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.310
 in tentacles and to death and it's funny 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.050
 it's great it's playing anywhere 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.060
 how the special effects are void 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.200
 what a grotesque it's funny 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.640
 have had a great time 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.330
 because dialogues are in addition very 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.220
 very well done 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.600
 finally we look at it saying old 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.169
 the old ringer the banal because 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.460
 it's funny 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.690
 there is stuff that's still very 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.530
 very foolish because references to 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.820
 lots of movies because she has the 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.260
 references to and especially villedaigne 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.100
 because the purpose of the maneuver knowing 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.600
 do evil dead 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.010
 with instead of all the monsters a 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.620
 only one who played by this teacher 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.120
 completely 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.510
 possessed by a demon who stumbles all 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.770
 world so jack brooks killer monsters 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.270

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.560
 you if you want to spend a super 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.330
 moment 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.660
 look at it for pity's sake 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.340

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.600
