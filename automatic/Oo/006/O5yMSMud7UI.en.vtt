the obsidian from these uh from this

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.050 
the obsidian from these uh from this
section<00:02:36.830> right<00:02:36.980> here<00:02:37.130> when<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.790> turns<00:02:37.970> into

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
section right here when it turns into

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.250 
section right here when it turns into
obsidian<00:02:39.220> anyways<00:02:40.510> what<00:02:41.510> we're<00:02:41.660> doing<00:02:41.870> now<00:02:42.020> is

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
obsidian anyways what we're doing now is

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.250 
obsidian anyways what we're doing now is
uh<00:02:42.350> we<00:02:42.980> need<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.130> put<00:02:43.370> down<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.970> novel<00:02:44.750> right<00:02:45.140> on

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.130 
right here by the back so that we can
hook<00:03:45.830> all<00:03:46.100> this<00:03:46.400> up<00:03:46.610> we're<00:03:47.540> almost<00:03:47.720> done<00:03:48.020> guys

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
hook all this up we're almost done guys

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.500 
hook all this up we're almost done guys
we're<00:03:48.410> almost<00:03:48.590> done<00:03:48.950> it's<00:03:49.130> super<00:03:49.490> simple<00:03:49.640> we

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
we're almost done it's super simple we

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.370 
we're almost done it's super simple we
pluck<00:03:51.080> down<00:03:51.290> some<00:03:52.450> redstone<00:03:53.450> that's<00:03:53.930> 45

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
pluck down some redstone that's 45

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.160 
pluck down some redstone that's 45
pieces<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.890> is<00:03:54.950> 67<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:55.970> since<00:03:56.960> this<00:03:57.050> is

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
pieces this is 67 and since this is

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.570 
pieces this is 67 and since this is
another<00:03:57.350> seven<00:03:57.740> it's<00:03:57.890> not<00:03:58.070> going<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.280> reach<00:03:58.400> it

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
another seven it's not going to reach it

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.370 
another seven it's not going to reach it
completely<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.330> we<00:03:59.600> might<00:03:59.750> as<00:03:59.780> well<00:04:00.020> just<00:04:00.200> use

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
completely so we might as well just use

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.650 
completely so we might as well just use
a<00:04:00.410> repeater<00:04:00.800> just<00:04:01.070> in<00:04:01.190> case<00:04:01.400> anyway<00:04:01.790> we<00:04:02.420> put

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
a repeater just in case anyway we put

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.750 
a repeater just in case anyway we put
some<00:04:02.930> more<00:04:03.500> redstone<00:04:03.740> there<00:04:04.190> we<00:04:04.370> connected

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
some more redstone there we connected

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.490 
some more redstone there we connected
all<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:05.090> all<00:04:05.540> this<00:04:05.840> redstone<00:04:06.140> is<00:04:06.260> going<00:04:06.440> to

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
all that all this redstone is going to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.470 
all that all this redstone is going to
power<00:04:06.710> the<00:04:06.980> piston<00:04:07.340> now<00:04:07.580> it's<00:04:07.910> ready<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.330> work

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
power the piston now it's ready to work

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.590 
power the piston now it's ready to work
now<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.620> piston<00:04:10.070> will<00:04:10.370> always<00:04:10.760> have<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.480> be

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
now the piston will always have to be

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.570 
now the piston will always have to be
extended<00:04:11.900> otherwise<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.130> lava<00:04:13.310> will<00:04:13.490> be

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
extended otherwise the lava will be

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.990 
extended otherwise the lava will be
coming<00:04:13.910> down<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:15.040> if<00:04:16.040> my<00:04:16.280> lovely<00:04:16.489> assistant

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
coming down so if my lovely assistant

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.750 
coming down so if my lovely assistant
would<00:04:17.260> flip<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.410> lever<00:04:18.530> then<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.370> shall<00:04:19.609> see

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
would flip the lever then you shall see

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.849 
would flip the lever then you shall see
how<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:19.940> works<00:04:20.320> whoops<00:04:21.320> flick<00:04:21.710> it<00:04:21.739> back

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
how it works whoops flick it back

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.060 
how it works whoops flick it back

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
like one level right here on the left

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.060 
like one level right here on the left
side<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:52.850> then<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.210> pours<00:04:53.690> down<00:04:53.900> over<00:04:54.290> all<00:04:54.500> the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
side and then it pours down over all the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.270 
side and then it pours down over all the
Redstone<00:04:55.490> thing<00:04:56.120> is<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.449> that<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:57.350> doesn't

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
Redstone thing is is that it doesn't

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.250 
Redstone thing is is that it doesn't
work<00:04:58.430> that<00:04:58.460> well<00:04:58.850> right<00:04:59.060> now<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.479> we<00:04:59.960> tried<00:05:00.229> it

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
work that well right now I we tried it

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.920 
work that well right now I we tried it
and<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:01.010> think<00:05:01.460> it<00:05:01.760> goes<00:05:01.880> up<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.120> two<00:05:02.300> only<00:05:02.479> does

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
and I think it goes up to two only does

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.879 
and I think it goes up to two only does
it<00:05:03.050> go<00:05:03.110> up<00:05:03.139> to<00:05:03.260> Tony<00:05:03.470> yeah<00:05:04.220> yeah<00:05:05.560> so<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.650> doesn't

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
it go up to Tony yeah yeah so it doesn't

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.189 
it go up to Tony yeah yeah so it doesn't
work<00:05:06.979> that<00:05:07.130> well<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.660> this<00:05:08.660> one<00:05:08.900> is<00:05:08.990> very
