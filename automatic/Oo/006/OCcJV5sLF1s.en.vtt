off<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.829> edges<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.579> create<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.000> circle<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
off the edges to create a circle it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.959 
off the edges to create a circle it
doesn't<00:00:36.809> need<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.110> perfect<00:00:37.640> unwind<00:00:38.640> some

of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> ribbon<00:00:39.540> from<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> spool<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.590> way

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
of the ribbon from the spool that way

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.920 
of the ribbon from the spool that way
you<00:00:40.829> don't<00:00:41.040> waste<00:00:41.280> any<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> ribbon<00:00:42.149> by

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
you don't waste any of the ribbon by

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.889 
you don't waste any of the ribbon by
working<00:00:43.290> from<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.590> fool<00:00:43.860> cut<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> off

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
working from this fool cut then and off

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.100 
working from this fool cut then and off
into<00:00:46.350> an<00:00:46.530> angle<00:00:47.000> press<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.660> flew<00:00:48.930> on

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
into an angle press it down the flew on

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
into an angle press it down the flew on
the<00:00:49.260> outer<00:00:49.500> edge<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.730> felt<00:00:50.940> circle<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the outer edge of the felt circle and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
the outer edge of the felt circle and
then<00:00:51.510> I'm<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> press<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.500> ribbon<00:00:52.800> onto

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
then I'm going to press the ribbon onto

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.869 
then I'm going to press the ribbon onto
the<00:00:53.789> felt<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:55.280> what<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> be

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the felt and what you're going to be

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.959 
the felt and what you're going to be
doing<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.590> essentially<00:00:58.590> creating<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> ruffle

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
doing is essentially creating the ruffle

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.420 
doing is essentially creating the ruffle
by<00:01:00.690> pulling<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> ribbon<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> folding<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
by pulling the ribbon up and folding it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.539 
by pulling the ribbon up and folding it
over<00:01:02.579> onto<00:01:03.210> itself<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:05.129> bit<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.400> an

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
over onto itself in a little bit of an

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.200 
over onto itself in a little bit of an
angle<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.439> I<00:01:07.439> use<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.100> put<00:01:08.700> down<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> little

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
angle so I use I put down just a little

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.560 
angle so I use I put down just a little
bit<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.659> glue<00:01:09.869> at<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.260> time<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.330> you're<00:01:12.330> going

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
bit of glue at a time and you're going

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.039 
bit of glue at a time and you're going
to

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
to

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.440 
to
the<00:01:14.560> ribbon<00:01:14.799> up<00:01:14.950> folded<00:01:15.399> over<00:01:15.549> onto<00:01:16.119> itself

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
the ribbon up folded over onto itself

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.060 
the ribbon up folded over onto itself
and<00:01:16.689> then<00:01:16.929> with<00:01:17.079> your<00:01:17.200> other<00:01:17.469> finger<00:01:17.859> just

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
and then with your other finger just

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.789 
and then with your other finger just
kind<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.310> hold<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.539> ribbon<00:01:19.689> down<00:01:20.109> so<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.619> holds

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
kind of hold the ribbon down so it holds

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.919 
kind of hold the ribbon down so it holds
in<00:01:21.009> place<00:01:21.039> and<00:01:22.200> sets<00:01:23.200> on<00:01:23.469> to<00:01:23.679> the<00:01:23.799> glue<00:01:24.929> let's

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
in place and sets on to the glue let's

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.069 
in place and sets on to the glue let's
again<00:01:26.170> we<00:01:26.439> will<00:01:26.799> get<00:01:26.920> one<00:01:27.100> down<00:01:27.630> folding<00:01:28.630> it<00:01:28.840> up

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
again we will get one down folding it up

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.730 
again we will get one down folding it up
and<00:01:29.469> over<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:30.009> create<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> matte<00:01:30.579> ruffled<00:01:31.179> look

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and over and create a matte ruffled look

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.789 
and over and create a matte ruffled look
without<00:01:32.740> actually<00:01:33.399> having<00:01:33.549> to<00:01:33.759> so<00:01:34.000> much

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
without actually having to so much

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.890 
without actually having to so much
impatient

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
impatient

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.810 
impatient
so<00:01:37.440> once<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.800> have<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> outer<00:01:38.250> edge<00:01:38.520> done

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so once we have the outer edge done

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.260 
so once we have the outer edge done
we're<00:01:39.060> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.510> do<00:01:39.750> another<00:01:39.930> row<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> more

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
we're going to do another row the more

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.720 
we're going to do another row the more
moves<00:01:42.570> start<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.520> inside

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
moves start you just on the the inside

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.810 
moves start you just on the the inside
edge<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.810> ribbon<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:47.160> we're<00:01:47.370> going<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
edge of the ribbon and we're going to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.940 
edge of the ribbon and we're going to
fold<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.270> around<00:01:48.480> into<00:01:48.870> a<00:01:49.050> circle<00:01:49.410> once<00:01:49.620> again

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
fold it around into a circle once again

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.840 
fold it around into a circle once again
just<00:01:50.250> holding<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.760> down<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.520> is<00:01:53.520> why<00:01:53.790> you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
just holding it down as we go is why you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.970 
just holding it down as we go is why you
like<00:01:54.480> using<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> lower<00:01:55.200> sitting<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.800> glue

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
like using the lower sitting on my glue

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.940 
like using the lower sitting on my glue
gun<00:01:56.010> because<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.930> don't<00:01:57.930> burn<00:01:58.230> myself<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.920> I

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
gun because I don't burn myself like I
