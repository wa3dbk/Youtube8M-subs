00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:11.490
 Yes Hello today attached to write the way of the amount written of this Shimesuhen would like to Ano talk 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:17.650
 think 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:21.880
 As we can go to sister of the other side of Shimesu, it may be called maye hen though 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:26.400
 Cityscape This is why the name this hint shows 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.400
 Company in the helmet It is a child that this show 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.670
 It is a voice child The angle of the company 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.780
 I'm inviting this 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.370
 that 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.300
 It is a very broken character 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.300
 And write 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 It looks like this 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.480
 If you look at this, I think that you can often understand what is often referred to as that. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.000
 I will 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.000
 When writing this symptom on a bed 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.790
 If you look only at that form, those who do not understand that standard well will only look at time 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:39.490
 Please keep a look at stroke order in the mass of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:42.509
 When you write the shape of this child, it's the same or late as it is warm, isn't it? 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.509
 Put the point of 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.830
 There Then, by pulling the diagonal line 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.520
 Maybe 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.520
 In a vertical bar 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.870
 Though we keep in store 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.910
 When you write in a line format is 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.910
 I will write this form in general 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.240
 It's just like this 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.000
 It'll be down the line 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.420
 We rebuild 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.420
 And 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:25.510
 And jump up 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:28.709
 Next here is followed, for example, if this is a girl called Iwao 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.709
 Get up and continue 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.160
 It becomes like this 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.150
 Well though this child shows that Ami Ami does not matter 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.150
 This part is 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.020
 Valley and in this kind of wind 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.020
 I think I can say this 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:17.610
 For example, if you write a social person, this is the line 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.610
 Traditional 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.800
 Get down to the flower 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.440
 Door Well I like this not 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.030
 Well that's right 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.830
 Because this is a symbol 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.490
 If only this form is seen 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.490
 Wintering 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.489
 Publicly 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.470
 Because I wrote this way 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:05.450
 Kouta bis's positive 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:07.760
 Whether you were he is like now with the little hard to understand the stroke order 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.290
 Though we came 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.930
 The above is one school 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.210
 Yes 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.530
 Tategasaki etc. 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.389
 It 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:25.300
 It is to say 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:27.749
 So , today was the story of how to write the peddler of the day . 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.749
 Please
