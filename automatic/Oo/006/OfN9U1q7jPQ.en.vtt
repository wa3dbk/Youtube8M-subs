 is the central character of the book feel 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.630
 quotation marks because the book has several 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.670

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.330
 what is the main difference between

 Jordan 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.630
 I have too much fun, he does not have to 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.430
 impression that it does not try to take 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.860
 Rock boys a little too seriously 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.530
 and ends up being disappointed with the lack 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.869
 of insulation in history and depth 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.759
 of the characters and the other side ends 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.400
 seeing the same books as a way 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.479
 ideal for reducing brain activity and 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.239
 a book she's going to have to stay 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.700
 Thinking too much and reading all the lines 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.340
 and do not say it's going to be normal so far 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.410
 I think it's great that it does for the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.910
 that makes up the age group that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.730
 eliminates is not yet prepared with 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.769

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.739
 loves raiana and a lot of children 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.380

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.390

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.360
 that allow you to rest 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.040
 They are players I liked the saga. 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.980
 Twilight because I had not thought 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.450
 others during printing and have not 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.070
 to talk about love that you already had 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.880
 explored in the other books of 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.710
 series 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.800

 We love to meet Danilo. 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.030
 I think the pair joke if the maximum and rituals 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.860
 and she leaves the other the defendant said that she is going 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.890
 start a series of books based on 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.050
 logical mythology or I want to and I will not 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.970
 Being able to talk about why you did not leave here 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.510

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.580

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.630
 You have to think things over here. 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.820
