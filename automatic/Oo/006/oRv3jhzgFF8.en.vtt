bit<00:01:45.479> big<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.740> true<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.979> size<00:01:47.070> or<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> half

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
bit big so go true to size or a half

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.080

size<00:01:48.180> down<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.979> no<00:01:49.979> need<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.280> go<00:01:50.369> half<00:01:50.579> size<00:01:50.820> up

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
