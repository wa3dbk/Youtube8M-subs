00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
like one big family and it was like that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
like one big family and it was like that
since<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> first<00:01:38.460> day<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.759> got<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
since the first day we got here and you

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.300 
since the first day we got here and you
know<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.079> our<00:01:40.290> characters<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.890> really

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
know all of our characters are really

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.740 
know all of our characters are really
close<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.880> they're<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.570> close

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
close to they're like a really close

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.690 
close to they're like a really close
family<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.259> think<00:01:43.380> being<00:01:43.740> close<00:01:44.130> off<00:01:44.399> set

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
family so I think being close off set

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550 
family so I think being close off set
definitely<00:01:45.299> helps<00:01:45.630> with<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> chemistry<00:01:46.380> on

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
definitely helps with the chemistry on

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.319 
definitely helps with the chemistry on
set<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.670> know<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.939> each<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.299> our

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
set and you know we each have our

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.789 
set and you know we each have our
individual<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.200> things<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.649> have

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
individual little things that we have

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.730 
individual little things that we have
with<00:01:49.950> our<00:01:50.329> characters<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
with our characters but you know in the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.300 
with our characters but you know in the
end<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> whole<00:01:53.790> we're<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.630> one

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
end as a whole we're all just one

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.179 
end as a whole we're all just one
family<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.540> aside<00:01:57.350> from<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.680> power<00:01:57.950> your

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
family so aside from the power your

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.620 
family so aside from the power your
characterize<00:01:58.610> in<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.880> show<00:01:59.060> what<00:01:59.390> power

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
characterize in the show what power

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.149 
characterize in the show what power
would<00:01:59.780> you<00:01:59.869> like<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.229> have<00:02:00.409> in<00:02:00.680> real<00:02:00.890> life<00:02:01.009> if

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
would you like to have in real life if

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.060 
would you like to have in real life if
you<00:02:01.280> could<00:02:01.460> if<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.450> could<00:02:02.479> have<00:02:02.780> one<00:02:03.229> power<00:02:03.680> in

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
you could if I could have one power in

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.830 
you could if I could have one power in
real<00:02:04.280> life<00:02:04.490> there's<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.149> many<00:02:05.270> I'd<00:02:05.450> love<00:02:05.689> to

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
real life there's so many I'd love to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.529 
real life there's so many I'd love to
have<00:02:06.250> probably<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:07.970> people<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.390> read

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
have probably it's people to read

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.660 
have probably it's people to read
people's<00:02:08.869> minds<00:02:09.289> mmm<00:02:09.890> I'd<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.369> chemically

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
people's minds mmm I'd be chemically

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.400 
people's minds mmm I'd be chemically
okay<00:02:11.209> that<00:02:11.390> would<00:02:11.450> be<00:02:11.510> gotta<00:02:11.720> quote<00:02:11.930> what

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
okay that would be gotta quote what

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.229 
okay that would be gotta quote what
power<00:02:12.650> would<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.010> not<00:02:13.310> like<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.030> real

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
power would you not like to have in real

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.140 
power would you not like to have in real
life<00:02:14.360> how<00:02:15.290> would<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.530> not<00:02:15.769> like<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.430> there

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
life how would I not like to have there

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.610 
life how would I not like to have there
a<00:02:17.180> bad<00:02:17.420> one<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.840> don't<00:02:17.900> know<00:02:18.050> there's<00:02:18.470> some

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
a bad one I don't know there's some

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.410 
a bad one I don't know there's some
pretty<00:02:18.830> bad<00:02:19.099> ones<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.489> mean<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> Hulk<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.209> not

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
pretty bad ones I mean the Hulk is not

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.100 
pretty bad ones I mean the Hulk is not
really<00:02:20.739> practical<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:23.450> know<00:02:23.540> having<00:02:23.840> super

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
really practical you know having super

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.350 
really practical you know having super
sting<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.590> super<00:02:25.099> strength<00:02:25.430> definitely<00:02:25.970> can<00:02:26.330> be

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
sting a super strength definitely can be

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.570 
sting a super strength definitely can be
beneficial<00:02:27.050> but<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.650> might<00:02:27.950> get<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.340> into

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
beneficial but it might get you into

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.370 
beneficial but it might get you into
some<00:02:28.730> trouble<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.299> probably<00:02:29.750> having<00:02:30.080> super

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
some trouble so probably having super

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.850 
some trouble so probably having super
strength

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
strength

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.750
