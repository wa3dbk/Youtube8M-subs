00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
little blocks out and met at the back so

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.500 
little blocks out and met at the back so
she<00:03:22.150> can<00:03:22.360> put<00:03:22.570> pictures<00:03:22.780> on<00:03:23.050> there<00:03:23.290> she<00:03:23.500> wants

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.560 
cute and needed to be somewhere and then
and<00:03:31.810> then<00:03:32.620> this<00:03:32.800> one<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.400> tried<00:03:34.270> to<00:03:34.330> make<00:03:34.450> this

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
and then this one I tried to make this

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.830 
and then this one I tried to make this
look<00:03:34.750> like<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.930> diaper<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.890> bib<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.690> this

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
look like a diaper and a bib and so this

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.740 
look like a diaper and a bib and so this
opens<00:03:38.200> up<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.620> she<00:03:38.830> can<00:03:39.060> put<00:03:40.060> pictures<00:03:40.330> there

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
opens up and she can put pictures there

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.900 
opens up and she can put pictures there
I<00:03:40.780> left<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.650> top<00:03:41.980> part<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.430> little<00:03:42.670> bit<00:03:42.760> open

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
I left this top part a little bit open

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.820 
I left this top part a little bit open
so<00:03:43.150> she<00:03:43.300> can<00:03:43.570> slide<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> picture<00:03:44.290> down<00:03:44.440> inside

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
so she can slide a picture down inside

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.900 
so she can slide a picture down inside
there<00:03:45.070> of<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:46.090> baby<00:03:46.330> or<00:03:47.320> whatever<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:48.070> and

there of the baby or whatever so and

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.940 
there of the baby or whatever so and
then<00:03:49.420> that's<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.959> back<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.380> that's<00:03:50.530> it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
then that's the back and that's it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.220 
then that's the back and that's it
so<00:03:51.180> that's<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.540> one<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.140> many<00:03:54.660> many<00:03:55.660> baby
