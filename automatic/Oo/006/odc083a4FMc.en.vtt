the angle of the foot it's very simple

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.370 
the angle of the foot it's very simple
just<00:00:44.220> match<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> angle<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> femurs<00:00:45.630> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
over the middle of the foot what you for

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.380 
over the middle of the foot what you for
sure<00:00:52.500> need<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.860> avoid<00:00:53.130> is<00:00:53.550> placing<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:54.120> feet

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
sure need to avoid is placing the feet

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.020 
sure need to avoid is placing the feet
too<00:00:54.690> wide<00:00:54.990> or<00:00:55.650> turning<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.220> out<00:00:56.370> too<00:00:56.670> far

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
too wide or turning them out too far

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.450 
too wide or turning them out too far
either<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.080> those<00:00:58.200> things<00:00:58.260> causes<00:00:59.130> the<00:00:59.250> knees

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
either of those things causes the knees

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.880 
either of those things causes the knees
to<00:00:59.700> move<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.240> even<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.320> you're<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> really

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to move in even if you're in a really

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.460 
to move in even if you're in a really
wide<00:01:02.190> stance<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.790> wide<00:01:03.120> knees<00:01:03.360> if<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> end

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
up with that plane through the hip knee

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080 
up with that plane through the hip knee
and<00:01:06.509> ankle<00:01:06.600> leaning<00:01:07.289> inwards<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.609> is<00:01:08.820> bad

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and ankle leaning inwards that is bad

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
and ankle leaning inwards that is bad
mechanics<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.229> allow<00:01:10.499> yourself<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> squat

mechanics do not allow yourself to squat

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.999 
mechanics do not allow yourself to squat
like<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:12.020> now<00:01:13.020> regardless<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.799> foot

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
like that now regardless of foot

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.950 
like that now regardless of foot
position<00:01:14.429> a<00:01:14.700> lot<00:01:15.149> of<00:01:15.270> people<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.749> have<00:01:15.899> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
position a lot of people do have a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.870 
position a lot of people do have a
tendency<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.530> let<00:01:16.859> their<00:01:17.009> knees<00:01:17.189> move<00:01:17.429> in<00:01:17.670> when

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
tendency to let their knees move in when

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.719 
tendency to let their knees move in when
they<00:01:17.999> squat<00:01:18.590> what<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.679> can<00:01:19.859> do<00:01:20.039> is<00:01:20.280> really

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
they squat what you can do is really

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.609 
they squat what you can do is really
emphasize<00:01:21.329> the<00:01:21.600> wide<00:01:21.780> knees<00:01:22.049> push<00:01:22.409> them<00:01:22.530> out

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
emphasize the wide knees push them out

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.919 
emphasize the wide knees push them out
even<00:01:22.890> wider<00:01:23.130> than<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.460> need<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.749> knees

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
even wider than you need to so the knees

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.080 
even wider than you need to so the knees
end<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.319> tracking<00:01:25.799> towards<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.399> outside<00:01:26.939> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
end up tracking towards the outside of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.969 
end up tracking towards the outside of
the<00:01:27.179> foot<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.840> plane<00:01:28.289> ends<00:01:28.679> up<00:01:28.770> leading

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the foot and that plane ends up leading

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.249 
the foot and that plane ends up leading
away<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.700> your<00:01:29.850> midline<00:01:30.179> that<00:01:30.840> way<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.139> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
away from your midline that way if the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.870 
away from your midline that way if the
knees<00:01:31.439> move<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.859> everything<00:01:32.429> ends<00:01:32.639> up<00:01:32.729> moving

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
knees move in everything ends up moving

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
knees move in everything ends up moving
right<00:01:33.179> into<00:01:33.420> line<00:01:33.600> where<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.960> need<00:01:34.109> it<00:01:34.289> okay

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
right into line where you need it okay

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.529 
right into line where you need it okay
so<00:01:35.249> you<00:01:35.429> can<00:01:35.639> be<00:01:35.789> here<00:01:36.329> or<00:01:37.219> here<00:01:38.219> but<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:39.299> don't

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
so you can be here or here but you don't

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.349 
so you can be here or here but you don't
want<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.030> finding<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.090> foot

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
want to be here so finding your foot

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.029 
want to be here so finding your foot
position<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.899> simple<00:01:43.229> first<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.889> just

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
position is simple first to just

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.789 
position is simple first to just
estimate<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> width<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.240> stance<00:01:45.799> then

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
estimate the width of your stance then

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.889 
estimate the width of your stance then
