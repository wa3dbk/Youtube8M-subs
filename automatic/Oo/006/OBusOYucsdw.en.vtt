on my channel for this puzzle anyway as

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.519 
on my channel for this puzzle anyway as
I<00:00:14.730> mentioned<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.210> my<00:00:15.240> unboxing<00:00:15.599> video<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
I mentioned in my unboxing video the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.830 
I mentioned in my unboxing video the
puzzle<00:00:16.740> feels<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.220> little<00:00:17.369> bit<00:00:17.609> cheap<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
puzzle feels a little bit cheap the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.500 
puzzle feels a little bit cheap the
plastic<00:00:19.380> isn't<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.859> most<00:00:20.039> highest<00:00:20.510> quality

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
plastic isn't the most highest quality

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.390 
plastic isn't the most highest quality
of<00:00:21.600> plastic<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.769> feels<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.130> little<00:00:23.250> cheap

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
of plastic and it feels a little cheap

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.599 
of plastic and it feels a little cheap
when<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.910> spin<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.390> your<00:00:24.539> hands<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.019> stuff

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
when you spin it in your hands and stuff

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.730 
when you spin it in your hands and stuff
in<00:00:26.609> case<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.970> don't<00:00:27.119> know<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.349> puzzle

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
in case you don't know what this puzzle

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.490 
in case you don't know what this puzzle
is<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.300> it's<00:00:30.300> very<00:00:30.480> similar<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:33.230> pier<00:00:34.230> weeks

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
is is it's very similar to a pier weeks

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.889 
is is it's very similar to a pier weeks
because<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.340> rotates<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
because it rotates kind of like this and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.139 
because it rotates kind of like this and
it's<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:37.800> similar<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.629> rainbow<00:00:39.629> cube<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
it's very similar to rainbow cube and

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.610 
it's very similar to rainbow cube and
other<00:00:42.149> puzzles<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
other puzzles like that just because the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.920 
other puzzles like that just because the
way<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.040> solve<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.660> but<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> has<00:00:45.899> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
way that you solve it but it has this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.310 
way that you solve it but it has this
interesting<00:00:46.590> flipping<00:00:47.539> mechanism<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.750> what

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
interesting flipping mechanism and what

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.500 
interesting flipping mechanism and what
that<00:00:49.500> does<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.250> you'll<00:00:50.850> notice<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.180> if

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
that does is is you'll notice that if

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
that does is is you'll notice that if
you<00:00:51.629> rotate<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.460> there's<00:00:53.460> no<00:00:53.550> way<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you rotate this there's no way for you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.540 
you rotate this there's no way for you
to<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.420> piece<00:00:54.660> down<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.890> what<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
to get this piece down here so what you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.260 
to get this piece down here so what you
do<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.449> flip<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.489> then<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.789> rotate

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
do is you flip it and then you rotate

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.789 
do is you flip it and then you rotate
and<00:01:00.539> that's<00:01:00.870> how<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.559> down<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.420> so

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
and that's how you get it down there so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.679 
and that's how you get it down there so
basically<00:01:04.799> use<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.159> rotation<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.119> orient<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
basically use the rotation to orient the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.679 
basically use the rotation to orient the
pieces<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.320> use<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.159> flip<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:09.150> permute<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
pieces and use the flip to permute the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
pieces and use the flip to permute the
pieces<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:10.979> makes<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.400> puzzle

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
pieces and that's makes a puzzle

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.630 
pieces and that's makes a puzzle
interesting<00:01:13.040> anyway<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.220> I've<00:01:14.430> said<00:01:14.580> before

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
interesting anyway as I've said before

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.179 
interesting anyway as I've said before
the<00:01:15.060> plastic<00:01:15.479> feels<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.810> little<00:01:15.960> bit<00:01:16.170> cheap<00:01:16.470> but

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the plastic feels a little bit cheap but

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.609 
the plastic feels a little bit cheap but
what's<00:01:18.119> some<00:01:18.299> silicone<00:01:18.750> spray<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> did<00:01:19.439> help

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
what's some silicone spray it did help

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.300 
what's some silicone spray it did help
how<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> lubricate<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.590> there's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
how to lubricate this is that there's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.060 
how to lubricate this is that there's
little<00:01:23.640> notches<00:01:24.299> right<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.500> take

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
little notches right there and you take

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.070 
little notches right there and you take
your<00:01:26.250> silicone<00:01:26.729> spray<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.659> spray<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
your silicone spray and you spray it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.710 
your silicone spray and you spray it
right<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:29.009> upside<00:01:29.790> down<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.570> am<00:01:30.689> right

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
right there upside down like I am right

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.649 
right there upside down like I am right
now<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> leaks<00:01:32.340> downward<00:01:33.000> into<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
now so that it leaks downward into the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.440 
now so that it leaks downward into the
puzzle<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.280> spray<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.909> then

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
puzzle and spray it like that and then

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.940 
puzzle and spray it like that and then
you<00:01:36.540> work<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.900> around<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.409> twisting

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you work it around the twisting

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.260 
you work it around the twisting
mechanism<00:01:42.409> it's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.490> smoother<00:01:44.939> after

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
mechanism it's a lot smoother after

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
mechanism it's a lot smoother after
lubricating<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.380> feels<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.799> still

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
lubricating it but it feels it still

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
lubricating it but it feels it still
feels<00:01:47.340> cheap<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.180> could<00:01:48.329> break<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:49.320> it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
feels cheap like it could break but it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
feels cheap like it could break but it
hasn't<00:01:50.040> broken<00:01:50.250> yet<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.270> haven't<00:01:51.299> had<00:01:51.570> any

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
hasn't broken yet and I haven't had any

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.330 
hasn't broken yet and I haven't had any
problems<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.619> mean<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.220> because

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
problems with it so I mean just because

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.209 
problems with it so I mean just because
it<00:01:53.610> feels<00:01:53.759> cheap<00:01:54.090> doesn't<00:01:54.479> mean<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.869> cheap

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
it feels cheap doesn't mean it is cheap

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.399 
it feels cheap doesn't mean it is cheap
the<00:01:56.219> flipping<00:01:56.670> works<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.140> well

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the flipping works really really well

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.330 
the flipping works really really well
the<00:01:59.219> flipping<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.790> really<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.420> smooth<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
the flipping is really really smooth and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
the flipping is really really smooth and
it<00:02:02.340> doesn't<00:02:02.729> stick<00:02:03.090> or<00:02:03.299> anything<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it doesn't stick or anything the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.160 
it doesn't stick or anything the
silicone<00:02:04.680> makes<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.130> slip<00:02:05.630> sorry<00:02:06.630> makes<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
silicone makes the slip sorry makes the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.460 
silicone makes the slip sorry makes the
flip<00:02:07.590> real<00:02:08.190> nice<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.390> only<00:02:09.569> thing<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
flip real nice the only thing about the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.960 
flip real nice the only thing about the
flip<00:02:10.679> though<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.580> piece<00:02:11.790> is

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
flip though is that if a piece is

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.340 
flip though is that if a piece is
misaligned<00:02:12.870> like

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
misaligned like

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.220 
misaligned like
that<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:14.040> puzzle<00:02:14.430> will<00:02:14.580> lock<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.600> if<00:02:16.080> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
that the puzzle will lock up and if you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.080 
that the puzzle will lock up and if you
try<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.500> if<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.070> piece<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.370> aligned<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:17.940> a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
try to if the piece is aligned just a

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.550 
try to if the piece is aligned just a
little<00:02:18.330> bit<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.690> try<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.020> flip<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
little bit and you try to flip it and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.140 
little bit and you try to flip it and
you<00:02:19.740> force<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.520> could<00:02:20.670> actually<00:02:20.790> break

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
you force it you could actually break

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.210 
you force it you could actually break
the<00:02:21.210> peace<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.170> when<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.530> flip<00:02:22.800> make<00:02:23.070> sure

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the peace so when you flip make sure

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
the peace so when you flip make sure
that<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.820> pieces<00:02:24.000> are<00:02:24.300> aligned<00:02:24.630> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
that all of the pieces are aligned and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.650 
that all of the pieces are aligned and
then<00:02:25.710> it'll<00:02:26.010> go<00:02:26.040> real<00:02:26.340> smooth<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.360> if<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
then it'll go real smooth so if it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.510 
then it'll go real smooth so if it
doesn't<00:02:27.990> go<00:02:28.110> smooth<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.890> than<00:02:29.010> likely<00:02:29.190> you

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
doesn't go smooth more than likely you

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.970 
doesn't go smooth more than likely you
have<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.670> piece<00:02:29.940> that's<00:02:30.350> not<00:02:31.350> aligned

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
have a piece that's not aligned

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.420 
have a piece that's not aligned
correctly<00:02:33.020> as<00:02:34.020> for<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.530> solvability<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
correctly as for the solvability the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.790 
correctly as for the solvability the
puzzle<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.240> puzzle<00:02:36.420> solves<00:02:37.230> really<00:02:37.590> really

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
puzzle the puzzle solves really really

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.040 
puzzle the puzzle solves really really
easily<00:02:38.190> however<00:02:39.030> some<00:02:39.330> people<00:02:39.360> tend<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.900> have

easily however some people tend to have

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.520 
easily however some people tend to have

come across and they try to solve this
puzzle<00:02:52.560> there's<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.610> parody<00:02:54.090> case<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.870> throws

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
puzzle there's a parody case that throws

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.320 
puzzle there's a parody case that throws
a<00:02:55.230> lot<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.710> people<00:02:55.920> off<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.370> they<00:02:56.460> just<00:02:56.670> can't

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
a lot of people off and they just can't

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.150 
a lot of people off and they just can't
figure<00:02:57.540> out<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.780> how<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.350> solve<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.800> parody

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
figure out just how to solve that parody

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.560 
figure out just how to solve that parody
case<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.820> I'll<00:02:59.910> explain<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.240> in<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
case and I'll explain that in the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.810 
case and I'll explain that in the
tutorial<00:03:00.930> but<00:03:01.710> if<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.160> don't<00:03:02.400> get<00:03:02.640> that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
tutorial but if you don't get that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.850 
tutorial but if you don't get that
parody<00:03:03.150> case<00:03:03.360> it's<00:03:03.960> actually<00:03:04.320> really<00:03:04.560> really

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
parody case it's actually really really

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.310 
parody case it's actually really really
easy<00:03:05.070> solved<00:03:05.580> like<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.660> said<00:03:06.930> it's<00:03:07.110> very

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
easy solved like I said it's very

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.530 
easy solved like I said it's very
similar<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.860> rainbow<00:03:08.190> cube<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.390> way

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
similar to a rainbow cube in the way

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.580 
similar to a rainbow cube in the way
that<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.900> solves<00:03:11.360> if<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:12.780> Japs<00:03:13.110> puzzle

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
that it solves if you go on Japs puzzle

rainbow<00:03:23.880> cube<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.810> anyway<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.670> quality

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
rainbow cube but anyway so the quality

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.810 
rainbow cube but anyway so the quality
of<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.180> puzzle<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.690> questionable<00:03:28.490> it<00:03:29.490> feels

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
of the puzzle is questionable it feels

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.930 
of the puzzle is questionable it feels
cheap<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.780> definitely<00:03:31.230> hasn't<00:03:32.130> broken<00:03:32.490> so

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
cheap but it definitely hasn't broken so

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.770 
cheap but it definitely hasn't broken so
I<00:03:33.410> can't<00:03:34.410> complain<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:35.340> flipping<00:03:36.270> is<00:03:36.450> really

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
I can't complain the flipping is really

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.410 
I can't complain the flipping is really
really<00:03:36.900> nice<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.530> with<00:03:38.370> some<00:03:38.520> silicon<00:03:39.000> it'll

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
really nice and with some silicon it'll

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.990 
really nice and with some silicon it'll
move<00:03:39.600> very<00:03:39.900> very<00:03:40.020> smoothly<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.310> pieces<00:03:41.730> lock

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
move very very smoothly the pieces lock

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.030 
move very very smoothly the pieces lock
into<00:03:42.240> place<00:03:42.450> very<00:03:42.660> nicely<00:03:43.080> some<00:03:43.620> puzzles<00:03:43.980> that

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
into place very nicely some puzzles that

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.910 
into place very nicely some puzzles that
have<00:03:44.190> locking<00:03:44.520> mechanisms<00:03:45.530> when<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.650> sprite

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
have locking mechanisms when you sprite

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.290 
have locking mechanisms when you sprite
with<00:03:47.040> silicon<00:03:47.400> sometimes<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.970> locking

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
with silicon sometimes the locking

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.260 
with silicon sometimes the locking
mechanism<00:03:49.370> messes<00:03:50.370> up<00:03:50.490> a<00:03:50.580> little<00:03:50.790> bit<00:03:50.910> but

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
mechanism messes up a little bit but

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.700 
mechanism messes up a little bit but
this<00:03:51.450> one's<00:03:51.660> real<00:03:51.900> nice<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:52.320> doesn't<00:03:52.590> matter

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
this one's real nice it doesn't matter

there's<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.240> solve<00:04:09.540> states<00:04:09.870> there's<00:04:10.500> the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
there's to solve states there's the

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.940 
there's to solve states there's the
state<00:04:10.980> I<00:04:11.010> have<00:04:11.310> right<00:04:11.520> now<00:04:11.550> where<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.180> entire

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
state I have right now where the entire

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.729 
state I have right now where the entire
face<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.250> one<00:04:14.490> color<00:04:14.730> like<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:16.260> then

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
face is one color like so and then

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.770 
face is one color like so and then
there's<00:04:16.920> a<00:04:16.980> state<00:04:17.280> where<00:04:17.549> each<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.450> tips

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
there's a state where each of the tips

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.140 
there's a state where each of the tips
is<00:04:19.080> a<00:04:19.140> solid<00:04:19.710> color<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.100> like<00:04:20.250> this<00:04:20.489> whole<00:04:20.910> tip

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
is a solid color so like this whole tip

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.710 
is a solid color so like this whole tip
right<00:04:21.330> here<00:04:21.660> would<00:04:21.870> be<00:04:21.930> like<00:04:22.410> solid<00:04:23.010> red<00:04:23.720> cut

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
right here would be like solid red cut

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.470 
right here would be like solid red cut
cut<00:04:24.960> kind<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.530> like

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
cut kind of like

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.460 
cut kind of like

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
anyway but those are the two soft states
