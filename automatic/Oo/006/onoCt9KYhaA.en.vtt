00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.930
 want- 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.980
 Plateaus are against 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.980
 It is the site 32 castle ruins 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.669
 It is the place where it was held against this open front mass 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.650
 Kushiro- 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.929
 As a lecturer 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.650
 Enter 3-3 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.460
 The point is 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.460
 You can have so many 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.949
 In this case you have trouble 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.289
 The question is which side to use 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:36.470
 but 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.090
 In this case 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.260
 this 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.730
 Flat 2 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.350
 Because there is a black one 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 It is to cherish the earlier intention 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
 It is normal if we hold from this 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.440
 When this happens 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.790
 For treatment 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.130
 various 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.160
 I have a hand 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.120
 The most common one is 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.120
 It is this 30% 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.370
 Keep it until the deadline 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.050
 If this happens 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.050
 It will be a paragraph 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.150
 here 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 There is a difference in the white wing selling attitude 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.490
 There is a garden that keeps going like this 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.760
 When I say it in small voice 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.470
 It also becomes a slightly complicated castle ruin 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.620
 If there is an Isa here 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.620
 If it becomes such a deployment 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.630
 it is normal 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.820
 here 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.210
 It is black turn 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 Transfer two 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 Here in gold in Tokyo 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.949
 Shirano 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.949
 If we prepare for putting out on the 9th 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.649
 Tiida Thai was late 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.939
 Again here 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.459
 Hold the western edge 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:25.839
 Previous business here 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:26.989
 Mom. 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.259
 And the way of thinking 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.259
 For each individual Mr. Haneda 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.229
 Fight stamp 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.229
 I saw this side 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.659
 There is also a way of hard work 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.719
 I was verbal 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.719
 It is quick 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.839
 The high school skirt gets a little sweeter though 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.839
 If other countries fly and receive without worrying too much 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:09.069
 This is one of the very tight tides
