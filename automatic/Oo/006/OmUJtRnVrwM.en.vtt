00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the guys in front of the hacking

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.679 
the guys in front of the hacking
machines<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.819> machines<00:02:24.329> were<00:02:24.420> currently

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
machines the machines were currently

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.520 
machines the machines were currently
hacking<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.230> at<00:02:25.859> 90<00:02:26.629> we<00:02:27.629> go<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.230> take<00:02:28.439> them

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
hacking and at 90 we go and we take them

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.520 
hacking and at 90 we go and we take them
all<00:02:28.680> out<00:02:28.730> yeah<00:02:29.730> when<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.299> reach<00:02:30.689> or<00:02:31.079> when<00:02:31.409> I'm

almost<00:02:32.159> done<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.700> he<00:02:33.269> reaches<00:02:33.780> 90<00:02:34.379> I<00:02:34.590> stick<00:02:35.310> I

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
almost done and he reaches 90 I stick I

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.979 
almost done and he reaches 90 I stick I
stick<00:02:35.700> around<00:02:35.879> here<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.239> think<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.719> think<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
stick around here and I think I think I

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.649 
stick around here and I think I think I
wait<00:02:37.170> I'm<00:02:37.590> pretty<00:02:37.799> sure<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.010> wait<00:02:38.659> because

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
wait I'm pretty sure I wait because

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.140 
wait I'm pretty sure I wait because
after<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:40.859> team<00:02:41.099> up<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.519> go<00:02:41.730> at<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
after this we team up and we go at the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.069 
after this we team up and we go at the
end<00:02:42.269> because<00:02:42.389> the<00:02:42.540> bottom<00:02:42.780> ones<00:02:42.900> are<00:02:43.019> the

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
end because the bottom ones are the

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.470 
end because the bottom ones are the
harder<00:02:43.290> ones<00:02:43.439> yeah<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:43.980> i'm<00:02:44.159> waiting<00:02:44.489> until<00:02:45.239> he

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
harder ones yeah so i'm waiting until he

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.050 
harder ones yeah so i'm waiting until he
reaches<00:02:45.900> 90<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.889> think<00:02:47.250> before<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.700> start<00:02:47.970> moving

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
reaches 90 I think before I start moving

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.699 
reaches 90 I think before I start moving
yeah<00:02:48.450> that's<00:02:48.930> when<00:02:49.049> we<00:02:49.169> go<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.409> kill<00:02:49.560> them

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
yeah that's when we go and kill them

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.190 
yeah that's when we go and kill them
yeah<00:02:50.129> here<00:02:50.310> we<00:02:50.370> go<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.389> we<00:02:51.510> both<00:02:51.689> take<00:02:51.900> out<00:02:52.019> ours

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
yeah here we go so we both take out ours

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.490 
yeah here we go so we both take out ours
with<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> duel<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.459> take<00:02:53.909> down<00:02:54.060> three<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:54.870> then

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
with a duel to take down three and then

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.309 
with a duel to take down three and then
you<00:02:55.590> take<00:02:55.709> out<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.980> bottom<00:02:56.780> anyways<00:02:57.780> with<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
you take out the bottom anyways with the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.440 
you take out the bottom anyways with the
darkness<00:02:58.769> here<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.159> are<00:02:59.340> free<00:02:59.849> to<00:03:00.000> drop<00:03:00.209> down

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
darkness here you are free to drop down

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.849 
darkness here you are free to drop down
here<00:03:00.689> anyway<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.290> want<00:03:02.540> now<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.930> he<00:03:04.200> attracted

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
here anyway you want now so he attracted

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.379 
here anyway you want now so he attracted
attention<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.549> blew<00:03:05.730> up<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.150> mind

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
attention so I blew up the mind

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.000 
attention so I blew up the mind
destroying<00:03:06.870> them<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.290> then<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> immediately

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
destroying them and then I immediately

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.580 
destroying them and then I immediately
start<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.609> hack<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.810> then<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.260> drop<00:03:10.560> down

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
start the hack and then you drop down

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.500 
start the hack and then you drop down
right<00:03:10.799> away<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.609> join<00:03:11.909> your<00:03:12.209> friend

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
right away and you join your friend

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.869 
right away and you join your friend
right<00:03:13.349> behind<00:03:13.680> here<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.189> then<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:14.489> take<00:03:14.669> cover

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
right behind here and then we take cover

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.610 
right behind here and then we take cover

badly once and then you're essentially
dead<00:03:57.269> yeah<00:03:58.759> now<00:03:59.759> he's<00:04:00.120> going<00:04:00.419> to<00:04:00.479> come<00:04:00.599> over

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
dead yeah now he's going to come over

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.649 
dead yeah now he's going to come over
here<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.319> Devin<00:04:01.829> is<00:04:02.099> going<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.489> stab<00:04:03.269> him<00:04:03.479> in

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
here and Devin is going to stab him in

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.229 
here and Devin is going to stab him in
the<00:04:03.750> face<00:04:04.409> there<00:04:04.949> he<00:04:05.040> goes<00:04:05.189> there<00:04:05.549> we<00:04:05.759> go<00:04:06.000> I

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
the face there he goes there we go I

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.420 
the face there he goes there we go I
guess<00:04:07.109> he<00:04:07.259> just<00:04:07.290> bashed<00:04:07.829> him<00:04:08.040> in<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.159> back<00:04:08.310> of

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
guess he just bashed him in the back of

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.129 
guess he just bashed him in the back of
the<00:04:08.489> head<00:04:08.639> I<00:04:08.669> guess<00:04:08.939> something<00:04:09.419> like<00:04:09.449> that<00:04:09.599> and

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
the head I guess something like that and

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.839 
the head I guess something like that and
once<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.680> hack<00:04:10.859> is<00:04:11.009> done<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.549> we're<00:04:11.729> gonna

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
once the hack is done so we're gonna

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.179 
once the hack is done so we're gonna
move<00:04:12.030> out<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.599> as<00:04:13.409> you<00:04:13.500> can<00:04:13.620> see<00:04:13.650> we<00:04:13.889> still<00:04:14.069> got

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
move out and as you can see we still got

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.129 
move out and as you can see we still got
three<00:04:14.459> minutes<00:04:14.729> left<00:04:15.060> we<00:04:15.239> got<00:04:15.389> plenty<00:04:15.689> of<00:04:15.930> time

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
three minutes left we got plenty of time

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.990 
three minutes left we got plenty of time
so<00:04:16.349> we<00:04:16.500> don't<00:04:16.889> take<00:04:17.099> our<00:04:17.250> time<00:04:17.459> here<00:04:17.699> from<00:04:17.849> now

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
so we don't take our time here from now

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.060

think if you just hit somewhere else you

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.570 
think if you just hit somewhere else you
we<00:05:27.930> would<00:05:28.080> have<00:05:28.110> been<00:05:28.260> fine<00:05:28.470> yeah<00:05:28.920> well<00:05:29.190> not

we would have been fine yeah well not

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.280 
we would have been fine yeah well not
sure<00:05:29.610> I'm<00:05:30.060> not<00:05:30.120> sure<00:05:32.030> it's<00:05:33.030> possible<00:05:33.290> it's

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290
