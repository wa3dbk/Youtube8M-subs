that<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.910> bring<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.480> actually<00:02:57.930> brings

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that you bring in and it actually brings

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.979

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
a big warmth and richness to this guitar

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.110 
a big warmth and richness to this guitar
and<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:02.160> even<00:03:02.489> adds<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:02.880> natural

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and and it even adds a little natural

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.210 
and and it even adds a little natural
compression<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.080> it'll<00:03:04.290> bring<00:03:04.440> up<00:03:04.620> nuances<00:03:05.190> of

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
compression so it'll bring up nuances of

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.490 
compression so it'll bring up nuances of
you're<00:03:05.430> playing<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:06.270> if<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.959> want<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.350> play

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
you're playing for if you want to play

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.910 
you're playing for if you want to play
real<00:03:07.739> soft<00:03:08.040> parts<00:03:08.430> or<00:03:08.580> real<00:03:09.320> loud<00:03:10.320> parts<00:03:10.770> it

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
real soft parts or real loud parts it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.720 
real soft parts or real loud parts it
actually<00:03:11.220> adds<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.430> little<00:03:11.610> natural

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
actually adds a little natural

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.550 
actually adds a little natural
compression<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:12.480> mostly<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:13.110> real<00:03:13.350> rich

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
compression but mostly just a real rich

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.520 
compression but mostly just a real rich
harmonic<00:03:14.130> content<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.350> great

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
harmonic content and this is just great

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.160 
harmonic content and this is just great
for<00:03:16.680> onstage<00:03:17.040> or<00:03:17.340> recording<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.270> I<00:03:18.480> guess

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
for onstage or recording so I guess

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.449 
for onstage or recording so I guess
that's<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:19.890> really<00:03:20.160> it's<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.880> nice<00:03:22.459> full

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
that's it it's really it's a nice full

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.390 
that's it it's really it's a nice full
sounding<00:03:23.940> guitar<00:03:24.739> another<00:03:25.739> feature<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.190> it's

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
sounding guitar another feature is it's

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.430 
sounding guitar another feature is it's
not<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.850> jungle<00:03:27.269> guitar<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.720> know<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.230> may

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
not a jungle guitar I know that it may

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.140 
not a jungle guitar I know that it may
look<00:03:28.709> like<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.549> video<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:30.030> may

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
look like that in the video you may

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150 
look like that in the video you may
think<00:03:30.360> it's<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.570> jumble<00:03:30.810> but<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.170> isn't<00:03:31.560> what<00:03:32.070> we

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
think it's a jumble but it isn't what we

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.850 
think it's a jumble but it isn't what we
call<00:03:32.370> NEX<00:03:33.030> body<00:03:33.390> guitar<00:03:34.290> which<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.500> our<00:03:34.739> own

style<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.549> similar<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.420> grand

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
style but it is similar to a grand
