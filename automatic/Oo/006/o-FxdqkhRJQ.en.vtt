00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
an issue and I don't see myself missing

an issue and I don't see myself missing
a<00:01:58.060> deadlift

a deadlift

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.929 
a deadlift

because my grid fails the hook group for

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
with a hook grip this is much less

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.250 
with a hook grip this is much less
likely<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.880> be<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.150> case<00:02:31.330> because<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.959> elbows

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
likely to be the case because the elbows

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.350 
likely to be the case because the elbows
aren't<00:02:32.470> going<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.709> flex<00:02:33.580> as<00:02:33.730> much<00:02:33.910> because

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
aren't going to flex as much because

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.720 
aren't going to flex as much because
both<00:02:34.660> hands<00:02:34.870> are<00:02:34.959> over<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.319> pronated<00:02:35.769> the

both hands are over and pronated the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.130 
both hands are over and pronated the
second<00:02:37.090> reason<00:02:37.209> why<00:02:37.359> I'm<00:02:37.540> such<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> big<00:02:37.930> fan<00:02:37.959> of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
second reason why I'm such a big fan of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.420 
second reason why I'm such a big fan of
the<00:02:38.290> hook<00:02:38.410> grip<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.739> because<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.130> better

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
the hook grip is because it better

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.430 
the hook grip is because it better
enables<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.000> lifter<00:02:40.359> to<00:02:40.540> engage<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.019> lats

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
enables the lifter to engage the lats

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440 
enables the lifter to engage the lats
now<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.220> engagement<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> very<00:02:43.090> big<00:02:43.269> topic

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
now that engagement is a very big topic

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.970 
now that engagement is a very big topic
and<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.780> might<00:02:43.900> talk<00:02:44.079> about<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.709> future

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
and I might talk about this in a future

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.300 
and I might talk about this in a future
video<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:46.180> some<00:02:46.329> sort<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.630> did<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> tutorial

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
video it's some sort of did the tutorial

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.710 
video it's some sort of did the tutorial
for<00:02:48.310> now<00:02:48.430> just<00:02:48.640> know<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.090> having<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.450> hook

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
for now just know that having a hook

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.870 
for now just know that having a hook
grip<00:02:49.750> or<00:02:50.109> double<00:02:50.440> overhand<00:02:50.799> allows<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.489> lift<00:02:51.760> of

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
grip or double overhand allows a lift of

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.240 
grip or double overhand allows a lift of
better<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.500> externally<00:02:53.500> rotate<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.890> shoulder

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
better to externally rotate the shoulder

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.060 
better to externally rotate the shoulder
and<00:02:54.430> depress<00:02:55.320> engaging<00:02:56.320> lats<00:02:56.650> much<00:02:56.859> more

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
and depress engaging lats much more

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.300 
and depress engaging lats much more
effectively<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:58.739> hence<00:02:59.739> making<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.130> lift

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
effectively and hence making the lift

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.099 
effectively and hence making the lift
much<00:03:00.549> more<00:03:00.730> efficient<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.420> third<00:03:01.630> reason<00:03:01.870> why

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
much more efficient the third reason why

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.830 
much more efficient the third reason why
I'm<00:03:02.200> such<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.410> big<00:03:02.620> fan<00:03:02.859> of<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.160> hook<00:03:03.370> grip<00:03:03.549> is

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
I'm such a big fan of the hook grip is

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.319 
I'm such a big fan of the hook grip is
more<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.079> for<00:03:05.440> swimmer<00:03:05.829> lifters<00:03:06.220> when<00:03:06.790> using<00:03:07.209> a

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
more so for swimmer lifters when using a

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.050 
more so for swimmer lifters when using a
mixed<00:03:07.930> grip<00:03:08.170> during<00:03:08.410> its<00:03:08.650> sumer<00:03:08.890> lift<00:03:09.250> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
mixed grip during its sumer lift the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.440 
mixed grip during its sumer lift the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
palm in the underhand tends to rub

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.120 
palm in the underhand tends to rub
against<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.810> thighs<00:03:14.079> and<00:03:14.500> this<00:03:14.739> can<00:03:14.920> cause

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
against the thighs and this can cause

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.770 
against the thighs and this can cause
friction<00:03:15.519> forces<00:03:16.000> which<00:03:16.209> makes<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.510> hard<00:03:16.690> to

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
friction forces which makes it hard to

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.470 
friction forces which makes it hard to
lock<00:03:16.900> out<00:03:17.140> or<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:18.310> can<00:03:18.430> knock<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.790> bar<00:03:18.970> forward

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
the thickness of your palm this keeps

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.270 
the thickness of your palm this keeps
the<00:03:28.540> bar<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.720> lot<00:03:28.840> close<00:03:29.139> up<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.620> enables<00:03:30.220> the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
the bar a lot close up and enables the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.879 
the bar a lot close up and enables the
live<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.639> be<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.760> lot<00:03:30.940> more<00:03:31.049> efficient<00:03:32.049> okay<00:03:32.829> so

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
live to be a lot more efficient okay so

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
questions that I often get asked is how

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.689 
questions that I often get asked is how
do<00:05:12.509> I<00:05:12.659> slowly<00:05:13.110> build<00:05:13.620> up<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:14.070> being<00:05:14.310> able<00:05:14.490> to

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
do I slowly build up to being able to

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.159 
do I slowly build up to being able to
handle<00:05:15.150> all<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.449> humphreys<00:05:15.840> with<00:05:16.020> heavy

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
handle all the humphreys with heavy

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.370 
handle all the humphreys with heavy
weights<00:05:16.409> and<00:05:16.979> here<00:05:17.130> is<00:05:17.220> my<00:05:17.370> suggested

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
weights and here is my suggested

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.710 
weights and here is my suggested
progression<00:05:19.460> first<00:05:20.460> off<00:05:20.729> stick<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.389> obviously

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
progression first off stick to obviously

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.499 
progression first off stick to obviously
using<00:05:22.050> light<00:05:22.320> weights<00:05:22.349> and<00:05:22.800> do<00:05:23.610> multiple<00:05:24.210> sets

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
using light weights and do multiple sets

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.149 
using light weights and do multiple sets
of<00:05:24.690> your<00:05:24.900> light<00:05:25.139> weights<00:05:25.440> in<00:05:25.650> your<00:05:25.680> warm-ups

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
of your light weights in your warm-ups

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.920 
of your light weights in your warm-ups
using<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.490> hook<00:05:26.610> group<00:05:26.849> for<00:05:27.479> example<00:05:27.570> if

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
using the hook group for example if

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.779 
using the hook group for example if
usually<00:05:28.320> your<00:05:28.440> first<00:05:28.680> warm-up<00:05:29.070> is<00:05:29.219> 60<00:05:29.490> kilos

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
usually your first warm-up is 60 kilos

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.879 
usually your first warm-up is 60 kilos
for<00:05:29.909> five<00:05:30.090> reps<00:05:30.360> then<00:05:30.990> I<00:05:31.080> suggest<00:05:31.259> doing<00:05:31.650> three

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
for five reps then I suggest doing three

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.909 
for five reps then I suggest doing three
or<00:05:32.039> four<00:05:32.310> sets<00:05:32.580> with<00:05:33.180> 60<00:05:33.570> kilos<00:05:33.900> using<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.710> hook

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
or four sets with 60 kilos using a hook

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.920 
or four sets with 60 kilos using a hook
grip<00:05:35.099> as<00:05:35.310> part<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.669> your<00:05:35.820> warm<00:05:36.030> up<00:05:36.180> routine<00:05:36.300> in

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
order to increase the tolerance to that

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.540 
order to increase the tolerance to that
