advantage of the cables as you can see

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.990 
advantage of the cables as you can see
here<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.019> myself<00:02:26.590> can<00:02:26.980> stretch<00:02:27.280> himself<00:02:27.489> much

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
here is myself can stretch himself much

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.940 
here is myself can stretch himself much
further<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:29.050> he<00:02:29.230> would<00:02:29.380> do<00:02:29.500> this<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
further that he would do this in the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.580 
further that he would do this in the
bandolier<00:02:30.370> position<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.780> stimulates

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
bandolier position so that stimulates

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.490 
bandolier position so that stimulates
that<00:02:32.950> stretch<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.239> way<00:02:34.360> there<00:02:34.660> stimulates

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
that stretch on the way there stimulates

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.820 
that stretch on the way there stimulates
extra<00:02:36.070> muscle<00:02:36.489> fiber<00:02:36.670> recruitment<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.830> if

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
extra muscle fiber recruitment and if

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.420 
extra muscle fiber recruitment and if
you<00:02:38.980> focus<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:39.700> by<00:02:40.570> pulling<00:02:41.019> low<00:02:41.950> he<00:02:42.370> is

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
you focus here by pulling low he is

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.460 
you focus here by pulling low he is
working<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.940> lower<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.690> middle<00:02:43.989> lats

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
working a lower and the middle lats

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.690 
working a lower and the middle lats
so<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:45.940> tremendous<00:02:46.810> exercise<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:48.519> can

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
so it's tremendous exercise you can

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.060 
so it's tremendous exercise you can
really<00:02:49.030> use<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.209> heavy<00:02:49.540> weight<00:02:49.810> much<00:02:50.350> safer<00:02:50.890> you

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
really use a heavy weight much safer you

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.130 
really use a heavy weight much safer you
can<00:02:51.220> be<00:02:51.340> in<00:02:51.400> bend<00:02:51.640> over<00:02:51.880> position<00:02:52.180> as<00:02:52.540> even

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
can be in bend over position as even

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.320 
can be in bend over position as even
doctors<00:02:53.500> would<00:02:53.680> agree<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.640> much

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
doctors would agree that this is much

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.539 
doctors would agree that this is much
safer<00:02:55.540> physiologically<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:57.010> doesn't<00:02:57.310> affect

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
safer physiologically it doesn't affect
