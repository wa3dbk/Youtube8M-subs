00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
so I'm yeah that's how you basically

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.039 
so I'm yeah that's how you basically
duplicate<00:01:48.119> stuff<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
duplicate stuff you can do that

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.889 
duplicate stuff you can do that
continuously<00:01:49.700> until<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:50.970> 64<00:01:51.509> stack<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
continuously until you get 64 stack of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.950 
continuously until you get 64 stack of
diamonds<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:53.119> that's<00:01:54.119> pretty<00:01:54.329> much<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
diamonds and that's pretty much it so
