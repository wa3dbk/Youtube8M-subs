here<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:19.710> Windows<00:01:20.070> machine

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
here this is my Windows machine

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
here this is my Windows machine
serving<00:01:21.659> up<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.990> view<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.650> my<00:01:22.829> server<00:01:23.130> box

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
serving up a view of my server box
downstairs<00:01:23.579> because<00:01:24.210> sometimes<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.720> get

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
downstairs because sometimes I get

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.450 
downstairs because sometimes I get
lonely<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.350> want<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> shake<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.369> my

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
lonely and just want to shake it on my

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.649 
lonely and just want to shake it on my
routers<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> make<00:01:27.210> sure<00:01:27.329> all<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> little

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

lights<00:01:27.930> are<00:01:28.110> blinking

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
lights are blinking

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.700 
lights are blinking
so<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.549> surfing<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.450> downstairs<00:01:31.049> view<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
so that's surfing my downstairs view and

you're going to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.009 
you're going to
the<00:02:17.220> sensitivity<00:02:17.819> here<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.239> even<00:02:18.659> record

motion<00:02:21.390> which<00:02:22.049> is<00:02:22.200> kind<00:02:22.409> of<00:02:22.439> a<00:02:22.560> pretty<00:02:22.799> cool

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
motion which is kind of a pretty cool

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.220 
motion which is kind of a pretty cool
little<00:02:23.400> security<00:02:23.700> system<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.900> then<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.110> we

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
little security system and then if we

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.960 
little security system and then if we
hit<00:02:25.409> start<00:02:25.799> at<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> bottom<00:02:26.129> it'll<00:02:26.700> fire<00:02:26.939> up

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
hit start at the bottom it'll fire up

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.800 
hit start at the bottom it'll fire up
the<00:02:27.299> server<00:02:27.540> let's<00:02:28.349> go<00:02:28.470> ahead<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.799> test<00:02:29.040> that

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
the server let's go ahead and test that

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.050 
the server let's go ahead and test that
motion<00:02:30.810> sensing<00:02:31.230> right<00:02:31.379> now<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.950> let<00:02:32.189> me<00:02:32.310> give

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
motion sensing right now so let me give

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.589 
motion sensing right now so let me give
it<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.209> little<00:02:33.420> wave<00:02:34.170> there<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.390> you'll<00:02:36.390> notice

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
it a little wave there and you'll notice

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.170 
it a little wave there and you'll notice
that<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:37.590> got<00:02:37.799> our<00:02:37.980> little<00:02:38.180> push

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
that we got our little push

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.270 
that we got our little push
notifications<00:02:39.900> here<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> devices

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
notifications here on the I devices

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.000 
notifications here on the I devices
which<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:41.970> nice<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.349> just<00:02:43.379> tap

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
which is nice so then you can just tap

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.479 
which is nice so then you can just tap
view<00:02:44.629> will<00:02:45.629> launch<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.530> cam<00:02:46.859> application

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
view will launch the I cam application

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.210 
view will launch the I cam application
and<00:02:47.700> we'll<00:02:48.390> get<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.659> same<00:02:48.840> view<00:02:49.200> as<00:02:49.379> we're

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and we'll get the same view as we're

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.460 
and we'll get the same view as we're
getting<00:02:50.459> here<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.390> we'll<00:02:51.959> get<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.079> nice<00:02:52.230> little

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
getting here and we'll get a nice little

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.470 
getting here and we'll get a nice little
audio<00:02:53.280> doubling<00:02:53.730> because<00:02:54.000> right<00:02:54.180> now<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.359> have

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
audio doubling because right now I have

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.759 
audio doubling because right now I have
it<00:02:54.750> set<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:55.019> record<00:02:55.139> audio<00:02:57.500> you'll<00:02:58.500> notice

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
it set to record audio you'll notice

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.349 
it set to record audio you'll notice
there's<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.010> slight<00:02:59.250> delay<00:02:59.430> in<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:03.150> let's

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
there's a slight delay in that so let's

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.720 
there's a slight delay in that so let's
stop<00:03:03.659> that<00:03:03.930> really<00:03:04.319> quick<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.829> I'm<00:03:05.489> just

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
stop that really quick and I'm just

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.729 
stop that really quick and I'm just
gonna<00:03:05.819> go<00:03:06.060> ahead<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.329> do<00:03:06.750> no<00:03:06.930> audio<00:03:07.319> here

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
gonna go ahead and do no audio here

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.430 
gonna go ahead and do no audio here
let's<00:03:08.700> start<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.180> again<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:10.230> don't<00:03:10.319> really

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
let's start that again you don't really

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.050 
let's start that again you don't really
need<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.920> audio<00:03:11.159> but<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.609> could<00:03:11.849> if<00:03:11.970> you

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
need the audio but you could if you

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.849 
need the audio but you could if you
wanted<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.620> once<00:03:13.620> I've<00:03:13.769> started<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:15.709> excuse<00:03:16.709> me

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
wanted to once I've started it excuse me

so and it'll enlarge it double tap and
we'll<00:03:38.370> bring<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.669> back<00:03:38.699> down<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.980> goes

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
we'll bring it back down and that goes

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.819 
we'll bring it back down and that goes
for<00:03:41.519> any<00:03:41.849> of<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.870> cameras<00:03:44.269> just<00:03:45.269> like<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:45.829> so

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
for any of the cameras just like so so

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.589 
for any of the cameras just like so so
that's<00:03:46.949> it<00:03:47.190> now<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.459> have<00:03:47.609> a<00:03:47.790> remote<00:03:48.239> viewing

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
that's it now you have a remote viewing

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.750 
that's it now you have a remote viewing
monitoring<00:03:49.470> system<00:03:49.859> I'm<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.519> gonna<00:03:50.609> go

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
monitoring system I'm just gonna go

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.670 
monitoring system I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:03:50.849> and<00:03:51.060> jump<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.900> area<00:03:52.109> out<00:03:52.139> all<00:03:52.470> right

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
ahead and jump that area out all right

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.220 
ahead and jump that area out all right
so<00:03:52.919> let's<00:03:53.609> go<00:03:53.790> over<00:03:54.060> here<00:03:54.480> back<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.139> the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
so let's go over here back to the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.420 
so let's go over here back to the
machine<00:03:55.560> there's<00:03:56.459> one<00:03:56.790> last<00:03:57.150> setup<00:03:58.040> step<00:03:59.040> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
machine there's one last setup step that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.899 
machine there's one last setup step that
you<00:03:59.519> should<00:03:59.819> check<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:01.680> server<00:04:02.400> will<00:04:02.669> work

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
you should check the server will work

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.939 
you should check the server will work
just<00:04:02.940> fine<00:04:03.419> on<00:04:03.870> your<00:04:04.049> Wi-Fi<00:04:04.440> but<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.739> course

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
just fine on your Wi-Fi but of course

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.920 
just fine on your Wi-Fi but of course
you<00:04:05.069> want<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.310> view<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.489> remotely<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.780> last

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
you want to view it remotely so the last

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.089 
you want to view it remotely so the last
thing<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.260> need<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.409> do<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.680> make<00:04:07.859> sure<00:04:07.889> that

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
thing you need to do is make sure that

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.740 
thing you need to do is make sure that
the<00:04:08.430> server<00:04:08.639> is<00:04:08.760> accessible<00:04:09.419> to<00:04:09.599> your<00:04:09.690> eye

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
the server is accessible to your eye

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.589 
the server is accessible to your eye
devices<00:04:10.349> from<00:04:10.949> elsewhere<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:12.060> let's<00:04:12.299> go<00:04:12.480> ahead

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
one port range forwarding so you don't

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.440
