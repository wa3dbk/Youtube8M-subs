00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.409 
that unless maybe they weren't wanting
to<00:05:34.410> test<00:05:34.620> here<00:05:35.010> or<00:05:35.250> maybe<00:05:35.849> they<00:05:36.060> are<00:05:36.180> gonna

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
to test here or maybe they are gonna

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.390 
to test here or maybe they are gonna
give<00:05:36.630> us<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.930> taste<00:05:37.139> of<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.620> later<00:05:37.800> levels<00:05:38.070> I

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
give us a taste of the later levels I

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.659 
give us a taste of the later levels I
for<00:05:38.940> one<00:05:39.120> have<00:05:39.449> no<00:05:40.050> idea<00:05:40.560> but<00:05:40.919> it<00:05:41.039> does<00:05:41.310> feel

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
for one have no idea but it does feel

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.129 
for one have no idea but it does feel
like<00:05:41.699> that<00:05:42.000> but<00:05:42.389> don't<00:05:42.599> hold<00:05:42.810> me<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:42.960> it

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
like that but don't hold me to it

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.439 
like that but don't hold me to it
because<00:05:43.440> they<00:05:43.590> might<00:05:43.710> not<00:05:43.949> I<00:05:44.430> feel<00:05:44.940> like<00:05:44.970> going

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
because they might not I feel like going

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.029 
because they might not I feel like going
forward<00:05:45.960> they<00:05:46.050> might<00:05:46.260> make<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.680> level<00:05:46.860> cap

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
forward they might make the level cap

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.399 
forward they might make the level cap
higher<00:05:47.340> across<00:05:48.120> all<00:05:48.419> platforms<00:05:48.599> no<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.199> don't

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
higher across all platforms no I don't

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.629 
higher across all platforms no I don't
think<00:05:49.470> PlayStation<00:05:50.130> will<00:05:50.250> have<00:05:50.400> a<00:05:50.430> higher

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
think PlayStation will have a higher

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.240 
think PlayStation will have a higher
level<00:05:50.909> cap<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.479> Xbox<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.320> talked<00:05:52.590> about<00:05:52.800> Xbox

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
level cap the Xbox and talked about Xbox

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.110 
level cap the Xbox and talked about Xbox
