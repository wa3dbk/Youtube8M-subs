00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
land that is awesome that is really

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.870 
land that is awesome that is really
awesome<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.140> surface<00:04:02.380> pro<00:04:02.799> 3<00:04:02.829> is<00:04:03.220> really

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
awesome so the surface pro 3 is really

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.729 
awesome so the surface pro 3 is really
awesome<00:04:04.030> as<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.420> tablet<00:04:04.750> but<00:04:05.260> where<00:04:05.410> it<00:04:05.560> also

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
awesome as a tablet but where it also

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.280 
awesome as a tablet but where it also
shines<00:04:06.250> is<00:04:06.519> when<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.850> use<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.239> as<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.690> PC

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
shines is when you use it as a PC

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.979 
shines is when you use it as a PC
because<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.190> has<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.400> desktop<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:10.570> fully

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
because it has a desktop that is fully

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.410 
because it has a desktop that is fully
capable<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:12.190> snap<00:04:12.519> in<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.850> keyboard<00:04:13.239> you've

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
capable you snap in the keyboard you've

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.360 
capable you snap in the keyboard you've
got<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.750> trackpad<00:04:14.049> you've<00:04:14.560> got<00:04:14.769> all<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.100> keys

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
got the trackpad you've got all the keys

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.250 
got the trackpad you've got all the keys
and<00:04:15.670> because<00:04:16.030> it's<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.269> surface<00:04:16.510> pro<00:04:16.810> 3<00:04:16.870> you

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
and because it's a surface pro 3 you

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.469 
and because it's a surface pro 3 you
have<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> lot<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.709> flexibility<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.789> for<00:04:19.030> example

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
have a lot of flexibility so for example

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.950 
have a lot of flexibility so for example
I<00:04:19.660> went<00:04:19.840> ahead<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.380> installed<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.979> start<00:04:21.880> 8<00:04:22.120> ok

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
I went ahead and installed a start 8 ok

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.610 
I went ahead and installed a start 8 ok
so<00:04:23.020> now<00:04:23.380> on<00:04:23.710> my<00:04:23.770> surface<00:04:24.550> pro<00:04:24.940> 3

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
so now on my surface pro 3

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.710 
so now on my surface pro 3
I<00:04:25.650> can<00:04:26.040> have<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.220> start<00:04:26.520> menu<00:04:26.730> that<00:04:27.000> looks<00:04:27.360> and

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
I can have a start menu that looks and

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.720 
I can have a start menu that looks and
feels<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.230> little<00:04:28.320> bit<00:04:28.530> more<00:04:28.740> traditional<00:04:28.950> I'm

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
feels a little bit more traditional I'm

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.670 
feels a little bit more traditional I'm
not<00:04:30.150> really<00:04:30.300> sacrificing<00:04:30.960> much<00:04:31.260> because<00:04:31.650> I

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
not really sacrificing much because I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.409 
not really sacrificing much because I
