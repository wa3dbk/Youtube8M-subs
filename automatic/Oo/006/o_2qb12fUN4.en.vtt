00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.900
 a few months ago, he declared I was with Red Bull 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.949
 very 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.189
 you would have how many 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.619
 Welcome to the changed Equality r Eugene on Wall Street like 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.869
 cool the tempo came eh 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.560
 at the beginning a question 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 to have something 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.650
 That kind and the purse of Triers on land together could simply be the ones 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.160
 both do not grow anymore 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.860
 Hera 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.460
 yes, I want from experience 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.950
 lately I get a lot of mail bills and reminders 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.950
 separation-notices 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.290
 but this one laughs even 1 yet Baidu com is not so important this fashion needs 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.350
 pay the bill that the police chief personally bring 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.580
 a field about also one time we know about that is always 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.410
 Too bad to be so cool Melzer I do not know it does not have to be money 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.460
 should be plump 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.130
 further changes 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.170
 Aldi Zeger I was there today it goes to red 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.170
 on the planet 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370
 rer 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.980
 Berry Gordy 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.150
 white comes to the market 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.980
 and she may contact advertised 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.640
 in almost every brochure that the company has spent Keller 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.110
 what they represent 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.460
 for example, give a little insight 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 that the kids could take with their game officials clearly 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 we have another appetizer 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.899
 Swarowski Impalas Kreuzberg benefits from the newest product 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.940
 and become very clear here 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.940
 the Impera ADTECH b-segment 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 Also in England where he applied for Marco make the telly 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.510
 which one can recognize very well here 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.600
 this serving 1 Ploch has from my childhood also shows the Imperia 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.550
 high-tech device 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.240
 but unfortunately she did not seem to stay here in Germany 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.649
 the place and the Christmas tree empty 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.779
 Bayer Ganske not really 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.409
 I got a replacement for it 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.299
 this paralyzes ears 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.299
 in extreme cases can 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.460
 the Imperia ECB has appeared a blood sample USA 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.260
 and I think I have iaea information there was also one 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
 Version and Ali cure in England 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:42.629
 also the box 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.379
 were included some game scenes 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.309
 This recipe has loads of options 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.309
 playfully 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.249
 front and back became light 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.769
 Here you see who is in the Billerbecker 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.090
 because you do not distinguish most of the co2 pro from the white background so well 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.790
 can 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.790
 I have her ado if the base occupied 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:38.939
 Here we see a small choir bow in the side of the building 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.569
 Bars can go down to him 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.419
 Let's make a small flight so that the first impression 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.419
 to damage the Imperia FDP 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:13.589
 that offers a lot of action function 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.199
 for example, my part was at the touch of a button 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.629
 blow up the scoring 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.149
 a figure could be attached to those heavy machine gun and 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800
 to the other and what is allowed 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.250
 they then those who already 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.639
 a nice trip should 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.639
 which leads under the archway 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.630
 in the back of the quake was the so-called come 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.650
 The space for up to 2 action figures is good 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.000
 the special attraction at the bow or 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.530
 that you could blow it up with the help of a push of a button 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.449
 Throughout the entire IT to Bambi novel, the figures could have stuck pressure 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.490
 if you did not want to take such a picture 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.870
 pay special attention to the two punk fold 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.870
 which are very often lost 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.969
 and very difficult to get a child 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.149
 Baumann especially pay attention to the lower part of the piece 

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.879
 Not 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.400
 Grisham's so-called Golden Globe get well 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.990
 Here we see the snow because the children's bunker is attached 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.169
 and those who have an archway 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.169
 with the stairs 

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:25.559
 and he gave me my look on the back 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.039
 here you can see 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.039
 1980 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.979
 still very well preserved 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.259
 the individual functions 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.439
 to pay attention to that as well 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:48.439
 the office has not been canceled since then 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.189
 Last but not least a little remark 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:00.399
 the battle is raging 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.680
 and also sitting 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.680
 and now say cards 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.539
 and if he heard a good flight 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:18.539
 Prof 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.820
 the DC still exists 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.839
 Data passing through all assets 

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:26.839
 yes he has the detail 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:33.050
 Some said now also really cold 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.419
 I also mean Gotha to the average 70 degrees minus 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:39.659
 In this sense, I started to check back with you, I wanted 

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:42.389
 you fit Cameron if you are already at the FDP 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.199
 in the end one more question 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:47.669
 my friends said to me that there is a certain similarity with this one 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:48.969
 Person would have 

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.969
 I do not have or 

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:02.020
 before we let it rip again in the end 

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.499
 a little remark about Princess Lea 

00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:06.729
 the battle is raging 

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:07.620
 the cultures are
