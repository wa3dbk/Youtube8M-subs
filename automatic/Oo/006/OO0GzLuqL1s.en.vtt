00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430

much I think it'll be overkill the
celery<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.760> like<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.540> leaving<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.870> nice<00:02:54.200> and

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
celery I like like leaving it nice and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.130 
celery I like like leaving it nice and
simple<00:02:54.500> just<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.840> there<00:02:57.020> you<00:02:57.110> are
