okay so we have a dell d610 with the
connector<00:00:06.150> broken<00:00:06.600> off<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.350> power<00:00:07.830> and

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.459 

it's<00:00:11.309> right<00:00:11.490> here<00:00:11.670> was<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> clean<00:00:12.269> break<00:00:12.509> so

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
it's right here was a clean break so

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.550 
it's right here was a clean break so
what<00:00:13.679> we're<00:00:13.830> going<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.009> do<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.340> put<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:14.910> our

what we're going to do is put it on our

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.840 
what we're going to do is put it on our
rework<00:00:16.560> station<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:18.710> use<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:22.430> well<00:00:23.430> pretty

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
rework station and use it to well pretty

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.839 
rework station and use it to well pretty
much<00:00:24.000> reattach<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.199> part<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.710> there<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.250> what

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
much reattach this part on there so what

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.910 
much reattach this part on there so what
we're<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.390> prep<00:00:27.689> everything<00:00:27.990> get

we're going to do is prep everything get

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.720 
we're going to do is prep everything get
turned<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:30.359> if<00:00:31.160> we<00:00:32.160> can't<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.520> this

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
turned on and see if we can't get this

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.959 
turned on and see if we can't get this
part<00:00:33.510> put<00:00:33.719> back<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.079> there<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.550> how<00:00:35.550> well<00:00:35.820> we

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
part put back on there and how well we

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.380 
part put back on there and how well we
can<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.390> done<00:00:37.790> okay<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.210> we've<00:00:39.360> done

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
can get it done okay so what we've done

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.030 
can get it done okay so what we've done
is<00:00:39.930> taken<00:00:40.920> our<00:00:41.750> component<00:00:42.750> lined<00:00:43.620> everything

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
is taken our component lined everything

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.420 
is taken our component lined everything
up<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.670> way<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.890> flexed<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
up the way it was and flexed it out and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.270 
up the way it was and flexed it out and
put<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.270> board<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.980> then<00:00:49.980> we're<00:00:50.190> going

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
put it on the board and then we're going

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.270 
put it on the board and then we're going
to<00:00:50.340> take<00:00:50.550> our<00:00:50.730> top<00:00:51.030> heater<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:53.690> put<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
to take our top heater and put that in

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.779 
to take our top heater and put that in
to<00:00:56.280> check<00:00:56.910> everything<00:00:58.039> to<00:00:59.039> heat<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.489> make

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to check everything to heat it up make

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.840 
to check everything to heat it up make
sure<00:00:59.820> everything<00:01:00.449> gets<00:01:00.690> hot<00:01:01.320> enough<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.850> go

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
sure everything gets hot enough to go

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.450 
sure everything gets hot enough to go
through<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.949> our<00:01:05.010> pins

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
through it so we can see that our pins

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.649 
through it so we can see that our pins
are<00:01:05.729> actually<00:01:06.530> lined<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.950> everything's

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
are actually lined up and everything's

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.090 
are actually lined up and everything's
perfectly<00:01:09.659> fine<00:01:09.990> there's<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> little<00:01:10.770> bit<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
perfectly fine there's a little bit of a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.870 
perfectly fine there's a little bit of a
glare<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:12.470> flex<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.010> everything

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
glare on the flex there but everything

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
glare on the flex there but everything
looks<00:01:14.909> good<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.439> we're<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> position

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
looks good so we're going to position

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.840 
looks good so we're going to position
our<00:01:17.280> top<00:01:17.549> heater<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:19.070> like<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.170> then<00:01:22.850> what

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
our top heater in like so and then what

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.630 
our top heater in like so and then what
we're<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.860> turn<00:01:25.860> our<00:01:26.040> program<00:01:26.460> on

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
we're going to do is turn our program on

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.760 
we're going to do is turn our program on
we<00:01:27.570> need<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:28.100> set<00:01:29.100> our<00:01:29.130> lower<00:01:29.939> control<00:01:30.329> 20<00:01:31.939> and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
we need to set our lower control 20 and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.740 
we need to set our lower control 20 and
um

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
um

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.170 
um
only<00:01:36.530> run<00:01:36.740> our<00:01:36.920> top<00:01:37.580> heater<00:01:39.580> so<00:01:40.580> what<00:01:41.030> we're

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
only run our top heater so what we're

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.820 
only run our top heater so what we're
going<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.360> do<00:01:41.540> is<00:01:41.780> position<00:01:42.550> everything<00:01:43.550> to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
going to do is position everything to

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.350 
going to do is position everything to
run<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.979> way<00:01:46.100> it's<00:01:46.310> supposed<00:01:46.400> to<00:01:46.670> I'm<00:01:47.150> going

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
run the way it's supposed to I'm going

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.910 
run the way it's supposed to I'm going
to<00:01:47.450> get<00:01:47.600> our<00:01:47.720> program<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.380> there<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.740> make

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
to get our program in there and make

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.940 
to get our program in there and make
sure<00:01:48.950> everything's<00:01:50.740> set<00:01:51.740> correctly

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.700

so I need to pick our
on<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.159> program<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.390> see<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.900> everything

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
on the program and see that everything

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
on the program and see that everything
is<00:02:03.320> good<00:02:03.650> with<00:02:03.680> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.490

so
need<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.280> take<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> probe<00:02:13.110> put<00:02:14.110> our<00:02:14.230> probe<00:02:14.500> in

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
need to take a probe put our probe in

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.560 
need to take a probe put our probe in
there<00:02:14.860> it's<00:02:15.610> kind<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.850> shooting<00:02:16.120> at<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.390> wall

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
there it's kind of shooting at the wall

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.740 
there it's kind of shooting at the wall
for<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.840> second<00:02:17.230> there<00:02:17.380> then<00:02:17.890> they<00:02:18.010> realized<00:02:18.490> I

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
for a second there then they realized I

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.620 
for a second there then they realized I
was<00:02:19.750> send<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.080> program<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:22.240> we're<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
was send the program so we're going to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.470 
was send the program so we're going to
take<00:02:22.810> our<00:02:23.160> probe<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:25.320> place<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.650> there

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
take our probe and place it in there

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.770 
take our probe and place it in there
kind<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.540> hard<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.780> do<00:02:29.020> with<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:30.100> hand<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.510> what

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
kind of hard to do with one hand so what

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.960 
kind of hard to do with one hand so what
we're<00:02:31.900> going<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.110> do<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.590> stop<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.459> be<00:02:33.580> upwards

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
we're going to do is stop to be upwards

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.610 
we're going to do is stop to be upwards
I<00:02:34.120> can<00:02:34.270> get<00:02:34.480> everything<00:02:34.690> set<00:02:35.080> up<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.320> then<00:02:35.440> go

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
I can get everything set up and then go

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.860 
I can get everything set up and then go
from<00:02:35.770> there<00:02:35.860> ok<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:36.850> we<00:02:37.120> have<00:02:37.240> our<00:02:37.390> temperature

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
from there ok so we have our temperature

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.490 
from there ok so we have our temperature
probe<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:39.010> we're<00:02:39.160> going<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.340> start<00:02:39.730> our

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
probe and we're going to start our

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.760 
probe and we're going to start our
system<00:02:41.500> right<00:02:41.800> now<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.420> get<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.260> heat

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
system right now and get it to heat

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.590 
system right now and get it to heat
everything<00:02:45.070> up<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:46.560> will<00:02:47.560> notice<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.220> the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
everything up and will notice that the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.190 
everything up and will notice that the
upper<00:02:49.600> heater<00:02:50.580> actually<00:02:51.660> heats<00:02:52.660> everything

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
upper heater actually heats everything

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.410 
upper heater actually heats everything
perfectly<00:02:54.630> does<00:02:55.630> what<00:02:55.810> he<00:02:55.900> needs<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.260> do<00:02:57.420> will

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
perfectly does what he needs to do will

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.210 
perfectly does what he needs to do will
slowly<00:02:58.720> start<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.260> see<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.739> solder<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.720> flux

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
slowly start to see the solder the flux

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.580 
slowly start to see the solder the flux
boil<00:03:03.220> out<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:03.880> then<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.900> solder<00:03:05.140> should

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
boil out and then the solder should

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.930 
boil out and then the solder should
start<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.340> adhere<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.930> we'll<00:03:08.680> let<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:09.190> run

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
start to adhere so we'll let this run

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.510 
start to adhere so we'll let this run
like<00:03:10.660> it's<00:03:10.870> supposed<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.590> then<00:03:12.250> come<00:03:12.489> back

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
like it's supposed to and then come back

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.170 
like it's supposed to and then come back
to<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:13.030> at<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.300> ended<00:03:13.540> program<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.230> see<00:03:14.709> what

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
to it at the ended program and see what

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.660 
to it at the ended program and see what
what<00:03:16.180> we've<00:03:16.360> done<00:03:16.830> ok<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:17.890> as<00:03:18.280> we<00:03:18.459> can<00:03:18.610> see

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
what we've done ok so as we can see

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.630 
what we've done ok so as we can see
we've<00:03:19.120> ran<00:03:19.450> our<00:03:19.630> program<00:03:20.080> we're<00:03:20.650> at<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.040> final

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
we've ran our program we're at the final

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.270 
we've ran our program we're at the final
stage<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.750> it's<00:03:23.260> actually<00:03:23.530> complete

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
stage of it and it's actually complete

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.750 
stage of it and it's actually complete
and<00:03:24.610> we<00:03:25.540> see<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.440> terminals<00:03:27.340> look<00:03:27.549> like

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
and we see that the terminals look like

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.930 
and we see that the terminals look like
they've<00:03:28.000> been<00:03:28.209> Reese<00:03:28.570> odder<00:03:28.870> Don<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:30.760> what

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
they've been Reese odder Don so what

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.370 
they've been Reese odder Don so what
we're<00:03:31.090> going<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.269> do<00:03:31.420> is<00:03:31.570> let<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.900> cool<00:03:32.110> down

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
we're going to do is let this cool down

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.680 
we're going to do is let this cool down
and<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:32.730> after<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.820> cools<00:03:34.030> down<00:03:34.269> we're<00:03:34.570> going

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
and then after it cools down we're going

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.949 
and then after it cools down we're going
to<00:03:34.780> plug<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.260> power<00:03:35.950> connector<00:03:36.549> in<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.000> see

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
to plug the power connector in and see

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.120 
to plug the power connector in and see
if<00:03:38.080> we<00:03:38.230> can't<00:03:38.500> get<00:03:38.709> a<00:03:40.470> see<00:03:41.470> if<00:03:41.530> we<00:03:41.680> can't<00:03:41.890> get<00:03:42.070> a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
if we can't get a see if we can't get a

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.850 
if we can't get a see if we can't get a
power<00:03:42.730> on<00:03:42.880> cycle<00:03:43.510> from<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.170> that'll<00:03:44.560> be<00:03:44.709> the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
power on cycle from it so that'll be the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.300 
power on cycle from it so that'll be the
next<00:03:45.130> thing<00:03:45.250> we<00:03:45.400> test<00:03:45.640> after<00:03:46.090> cool<00:03:46.480> stuff<00:03:47.310> ok

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
next thing we test after cool stuff ok

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.490 
next thing we test after cool stuff ok
so<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.670> only<00:03:48.820> thing<00:03:48.940> left<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.450> do<00:03:49.600> now<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:50.019> to

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
so the only thing left to do now is to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.460 
so the only thing left to do now is to
check<00:03:50.980> our<00:03:51.900> system<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.079> we're<00:03:53.200> going<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.380> plug

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
check our system so we're going to plug

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.920 
check our system so we're going to plug
our<00:03:53.620> power<00:03:53.829> adapter<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:55.120> we<00:03:55.420> see<00:03:55.630> that<00:03:55.660> it

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
our power adapter in and we see that it

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.880 
our power adapter in and we see that it
gets<00:03:56.049> lights<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.600> we'll<00:03:59.049> push<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.560> power

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
gets lights and we'll push the power

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.460 
gets lights and we'll push the power
button<00:04:00.010> here<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.730> we<00:04:01.480> see<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:02.019> turns<00:04:02.260> on

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
button here and we see that it turns on

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.000 
button here and we see that it turns on
so<00:04:02.739> we<00:04:02.860> know<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.040> our<00:04:03.900> Sutter<00:04:04.900> work<00:04:05.170> on<00:04:05.440> the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
so we know that our Sutter work on the

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.240 
so we know that our Sutter work on the
power<00:04:06.940> button<00:04:07.180> here<00:04:07.600> was<00:04:07.900> exacting<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.829> did

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
power button here was exacting and did

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.729 
power button here was exacting and did
what<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.519> need<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.730> do<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.390> we'll<00:04:11.350> call<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.560> a

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
what it need to do so we'll call this a

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.099 
what it need to do so we'll call this a
complete<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.400> fitness<00:04:12.700> system<00:04:13.769> with<00:04:14.769> our<00:04:14.950> new

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.550 
hot air systems the dark I our system
will<00:04:27.729> allow<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:29.220> replace<00:04:31.169> molex<00:04:32.169> and

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
will allow you to replace molex and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.390 
will allow you to replace molex and
plastic<00:04:33.310> component<00:04:33.820> pieces<00:04:34.770> over<00:04:35.770> time<00:04:36.009> and
