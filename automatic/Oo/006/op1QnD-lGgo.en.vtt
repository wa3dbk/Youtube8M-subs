00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Mr. FlÃ¡vio as one of the founders 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.919
 How did this story come about? 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.380
 so interesting that one day I went 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.980
 invited to rap and by a group 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.170
 luxury bathrooms and in the background 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 I remarked to my surprise that the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.199
 group was dissatisfied with the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.779
 from the club 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.109
 We 're really having a year. 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.390
 disastrous and basically said that the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.090
 Flemish needs a person with my 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.619
 profile and here is what I thought of launching 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.660
 president of flamingo 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.680
 I was flattered by the invitation but 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.899
 He said unfortunately it was not a partner is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.879
 since the time of my title split 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.640
 stayed with the ex-wife but that 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.379
 story was in my head and so 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 how do I think all the red-blacks 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.860
 wondering what between 40 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.260
 millions of Brazilians can not 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 set up a framework for governance 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.940
 which the Flemish deserves 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.359
 I got the phone and called the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.390
 old acquaintance of funding 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.869
 after I turned pro carlos Langoni the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.500
 suggested the name of the valley in the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.000
 sense was that the valinho was in a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.590
 of his life that he already had 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.170
 conquered everything comes to conquer 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.409
 in professional life would have time 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.470
 give dedication that the Flemish deserves us 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.829
 there as a result of this conversation 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.000
 we agreed to form a management group 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.560
 to effectively assist in 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.470
 Flemish administration 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 later we were introduced to the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.320
 boat president of the sky who in turn 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.100
 also brought a very strong group 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.970
 you played well like the rhombus of the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.820
 heaven 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.540
 This is our hard core, let's call it. 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.140
 like this 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.030
 nowadays consists of 12 executives 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.060
 I dare say that few 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.000
 these companies have the two executives 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.740
 executive of this carat in his squad 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.630
 either at the board level at the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.180
 executive itself 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.899
 and this class is nothing more than we were 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.940
 so supporters are that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.240
 they decided to descend from the stands to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.250
 try to help improve 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.770
 helped the club to modernize the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.100
 management because I spoke effectively 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.800
 needs a management shock and the most 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.620
 important are you successful people 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.210
 accomplished in the fall of Flemish she wants 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.800
 give everything for flemish 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.990
 lend a little of your success 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.090
 professional experience to his 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.420
 improve club management and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.100
 movement was gaining strength is such 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.950
 lucky that we just wrote a 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.160
 plate that has the vale vasconcelos as 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.470
 president rodolfo landim as vice 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.110
 this whole group is behind help 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.020
 in the management of the club and we have received 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.780
 so a hundred number is support whether it is 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.880
 very confident you can say milk 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.940
 because we are actually offering 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.010
 not only associated with Flemish and 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.920
 flamenco twist itself 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.070
 an alternative of professionalization of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.610
 management is for us to prepare the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.110
 flamengo for the next century and 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.520
 effectively one of the five 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.310
 biggest clubs in the world 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.460
 Flemish has everything to do this is with 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.160
 40 million fans here are 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.930
 receiving world cup and olympics 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.390
 the Flemish have to be modernized and has 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.270
 that take advantage of this wave this cycle 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.700
 virtuous is to consolidate his position 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:38.910
 leader in the Brazilian sports scene 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.910
 only football area also
