00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.360
 Fat may be a short notice 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.360

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.870

 divorced son but he likes to have like 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.600
 a kind of cybersex I do not know if with 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.090
 young or something like that that's how like that to 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.230
 grosso mode the story then 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.810
 and as soon as I got back I knew that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.810
 I had been very sick joan rivers and 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.430
 this woman that look at me 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.990
 I have always been very beautiful 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.460
 true whenever I saw her it was like 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.549
 of the type or it was true that he already died of 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.799
 how do you see silvia pinal right now 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.970
 although although with all due respect because to 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.970
 I love it if the final too 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.920
 very ingenious as he said things that 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.900
 he let go of the table he had thanks for 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.869
 this spark of criticism of all this 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.600
 good this reality show that he did not 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.680
 from his family where they fought in 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.790
 All this 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.920
 very very very this one 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.920
 very risky true 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.090
 I do not know how real and real 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.119
 been or has been by rating that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.750
 drugged her at home and they took her to 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.479
 the jail in a on this axis in a center 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.410
 commercial but go talk loud 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.170
 she came to speak loudly about this 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.930
 michelle and barack obama and he was very strong 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.880
 especially since this fashion was what 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.370
 that she was given to them I will be 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.080
 sincere I liked her style 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.580
 I noticed a lot 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.160
 I will not seal the names of any 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.860
 of any Mexican actress because I 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.540
 They deserve respect but boy is 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.180
 this thing that already looks like that the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.410
 Old man's neck and very legal face 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.690
 I think there comes a time when already 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.830
 is no longer to stretch more as the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.540
 face because 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.610
 already then then there is a very contrast 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.640
 Strong between the neck and the box I do not know 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.790
 How many nose surgeries did you have? 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.340
 but good rest in peace cute I think 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.340
 I think that 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.170
 You have lived until until 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.330
 you enjoy life rocked 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.890
 I liked how it was said I liked it 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.870
 she came to kill I liked it 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.360
 I loved 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.019
 There will be people who do not respect it 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.430
 very much but if in the end I tell you this 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.860
 part of the surgeries and already like that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.989
 leave a little bit like that eyebrows and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.430
 all this but they are always a woman with 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.730
 much style always a woman with a lot 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.290
 style with a lot 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.290
 beautiful a beautiful woman 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.550
 I repeat, I do not know, I find a 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.550
 tremendous resemblance thus refine 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.780
 as they are of the style and therefore 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.459
 rest in peace linda rest in peace me 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.459
 I knew since she had been hospitalized 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.340
 and of course if I got to thinking 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:58.630
 that something like this was going to happen 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.450
 the deaths are always regrettable 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.080
 I do not always comment on trust in this case 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.710
