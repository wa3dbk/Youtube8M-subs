reason<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:23.820> besides<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> fact<00:01:24.960> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
reason I think besides the fact that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.810 
reason I think besides the fact that
they're<00:01:25.500> obviously<00:01:26.130> can't<00:01:26.400> get<00:01:26.490> credibility

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
they're obviously can't get credibility

does<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> living<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.900> like<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
does this for a living but I like the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.990 
does this for a living but I like the
fact<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.590> only<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.979> quarter<00:01:32.490> ounce<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
fact that it was only a quarter ounce of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.469 
fact that it was only a quarter ounce of
the<00:01:33.420> relevance<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:34.799> tells<00:01:35.100> me<00:01:35.270> it's<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the relevance which tells me it's got a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.850 
the relevance which tells me it's got a
good<00:01:36.630> balance<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:37.110> rumplemintz<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
good balance because rumplemintz and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.950 
good balance because rumplemintz and
these<00:01:37.979> type<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> things<00:01:38.369> could<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.960> pretty

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
these type of things could be pretty

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.560 
these type of things could be pretty
probably<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> bartender<00:01:41.570> until
