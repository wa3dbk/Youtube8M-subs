we're doing and if you don't have up to
the<00:00:34.520> speed<00:00:34.850> go<00:00:35.510> back<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:35.930> get<00:00:36.050> it<00:00:36.170> down<00:00:36.320> where

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
the speed go back and get it down where

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:49.680 
the speed go back and get it down where
you<00:00:36.590> need<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.890> before<00:00:36.949> you<00:00:37.190> go<00:00:37.280> on

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:02:11.770 

that's<00:00:50.690> heard

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.210 

yeah<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.959> sounds<00:02:13.230> kind<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.440> odd<00:02:13.620> stopping

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
yeah that sounds kind of odd stopping

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.610 
yeah that sounds kind of odd stopping
there<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.640> fifth<00:02:15.480> string<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.049> we're<00:02:16.530> gonna

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
there that fifth string but we're gonna

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.710 
there that fifth string but we're gonna
go<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.159> a<00:02:17.250> second<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.450> where<00:02:18.599> we

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
go on in a second and this is where we

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.770 
go on in a second and this is where we
did<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.980> hammer<00:02:20.340> before<00:02:20.580> we're<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.569> going

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
did that hammer before we're not going

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.180 
did that hammer before we're not going
to<00:02:21.810> do<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.110> because<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.709> were<00:02:22.799> gonna<00:02:22.890> want<00:02:23.099> to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
to do that because we were gonna want to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.250 
to do that because we were gonna want to
get<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.489> no<00:02:23.670> quickly<00:02:23.909> and<00:02:24.840> don't<00:02:25.049> worry

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
get to this no quickly and don't worry

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.390 
get to this no quickly and don't worry
we're<00:02:25.409> going<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.680> back<00:02:25.829> over<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
we're going to go back over this in a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.250 
we're going to go back over this in a
second

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.250 

so<00:02:35.260> that's<00:02:35.440> what's<00:02:35.710> next<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.940> let's<00:02:37.930> take<00:02:38.170> this

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
so that's what's next so let's take this

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.050 
so that's what's next so let's take this
again<00:02:39.000> five<00:02:40.000> two<00:02:40.360> one<00:02:40.390> five<00:02:40.960> one<00:02:41.200> five<00:02:43.920> one

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
again five two one five one five one

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.920 
again five two one five one five one
three<00:02:46.060> one<00:02:46.780> slide<00:02:47.350> three<00:02:47.830> one<00:02:48.220> five<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> you

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
three one slide three one five so you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:58.320 
three one slide three one five so you
remember<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:55.650> that's<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.860> forward<00:02:57.340> roll<00:02:57.550> with

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
remember that that's a forward roll with

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.630 
remember that that's a forward roll with
a<00:02:58.360> hammer<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.390> that's<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.660> double<00:03:04.990> Ford<00:03:05.410> roll

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
a hammer so that's a double Ford roll

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
a hammer so that's a double Ford roll
first<00:03:06.640> one's<00:03:06.790> hammer<00:03:07.090> on

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.790 

so<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.680> pull<00:03:16.890> off<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:18.480> tug<00:03:18.750> on<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.590> third

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
so this is pull off the tug on the third

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.210 
so this is pull off the tug on the third
string<00:03:20.100> third<00:03:20.130> fret<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:21.530> then<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.590> second

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
string third fret and then the second

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:32.809 
string third fret and then the second
string

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.339 

and<00:03:33.030> then<00:03:33.180> after<00:03:35.299> comes<00:03:36.299> five<00:03:36.599> again<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.200> it's

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
and then after comes five again so it's

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:52.330 
and then after comes five again so it's
Bob

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.850 

that's<00:03:53.340> one<00:03:53.730> tree<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:54.660> slide<00:03:55.260> from<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.620> third

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
that's one tree and slide from the third

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.150 
that's one tree and slide from the third
fret

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.070 

third<00:03:58.850> string<00:03:59.210> up<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.570> fifth<00:03:59.780> fret<00:03:59.840> this

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
third string up to the fifth fret this

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
third string up to the fifth fret this
middle

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.250 

let's<00:04:13.100> pull<00:04:13.430> off<00:04:14.110> five<00:04:15.110> two<00:04:15.650> five<00:04:16.630> one<00:04:17.630> three

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
let's pull off five two five one three

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:35.400 
let's pull off five two five one three
see<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.220> told<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.549> be<00:04:19.640> slowed<00:04:19.880> down

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.540 

this<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:36.560> where<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.800> gets<00:04:36.860> tricky<00:04:37.010> cuz<00:04:37.460> we're

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
this is where it gets tricky cuz we're

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.340 
this is where it gets tricky cuz we're
gonna<00:04:37.640> take<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.090> forward<00:04:38.330> roll<00:04:38.600> put<00:04:39.230> the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
gonna take that forward roll put the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:58.060 
gonna take that forward roll put the
brakes<00:04:39.560> out<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:39.890> back<00:04:39.980> it<00:04:40.160> up<00:04:56.740> after<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.770> slide

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
brakes out and back it up after a slide

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.840 
brakes out and back it up after a slide
one<00:04:58.460> 5<00:04:58.880> and<00:05:01.090> then<00:05:02.090> 3<00:05:02.120> 1<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.200> then<00:05:03.700> that's<00:05:04.700> where

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
one 5 and then 3 1 and then that's where

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:16.320 
one 5 and then 3 1 and then that's where
we<00:05:04.940> step<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:07.490> 2<00:05:08.450> 1<00:05:08.690> 5<00:05:09.320> 1<00:05:09.830> 5<00:05:10.220> 3<00:05:10.730> 1<00:05:11.200> let<00:05:12.200> me<00:05:12.320> go<00:05:12.560> 3<00:05:13.130> 5

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:34.270 

tickets<00:05:17.330> lowly<00:05:18.460> fly<00:05:19.460> one

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:43.689 

that's<00:05:35.280> where<00:05:35.460> we<00:05:35.550> stop<00:05:35.790> for<00:05:35.970> now

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.890 

and<00:05:44.699> that's<00:05:44.909> where<00:05:45.150> really<00:05:45.300> go<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:45.599> this
