witness<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.479> assume<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.049> was<00:01:46.170> Pudge<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
witness it but I assume it was Pudge and
dodo<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.369> Pudge<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.210> Jojo<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.659> always

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
dodo because Pudge and Jojo have always

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600 
dodo because Pudge and Jojo have always
kind<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.200> had<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.590> bit<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.860> problems<00:01:50.430> as

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
kind of had a little bit of problems as

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.219 
kind of had a little bit of problems as
you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.659> they've<00:01:51.810> been<00:01:52.079> getting

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you can see but they've been getting

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.770 
you can see but they've been getting
along<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> lot<00:01:52.770> better<00:01:53.119> Pudge<00:01:54.119> was<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.600> boss

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.249 
give him medicine and disinfect it uh
every<00:02:07.560> day<00:02:07.649> for<00:02:07.829> about<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.039> week<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.580> then

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
every day for about a week and then

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.430 
every day for about a week and then

Tyler

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.080 
Tyler
and<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:11.330> if<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:13.320> scab<00:02:13.650> would<00:02:13.950> form<00:02:14.310> over<00:02:14.850> his

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and then if a scab would form over his

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.590 
and then if a scab would form over his
wound<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.630> had<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.080> pick<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.590> all<00:02:16.940> um<00:02:17.940> only

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
wound I had to pick it all um only

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.710 
wound I had to pick it all um only
because<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.470> would<00:02:19.680> create<00:02:20.250> germs<00:02:20.970> would

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
because that would create germs would

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.060 
because that would create germs would
get<00:02:21.900> stuck<00:02:22.140> under<00:02:22.470> there<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.680> something

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
get stuck under there or something

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.040 
get stuck under there or something
that's<00:02:23.280> what<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.490> vet<00:02:23.640> told<00:02:23.790> me<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.150> every

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
that's what the vet told me so every

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.500 
that's what the vet told me so every
time<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.290> scab<00:02:25.740> would<00:02:25.980> form<00:02:26.370> i<00:02:26.610> had<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.480> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
time a scab would form i had to get it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.460 
time a scab would form i had to get it
off<00:02:27.780> which<00:02:28.260> was<00:02:28.440> horrible<00:02:29.100> but<00:02:30.030> i<00:02:30.270> did<00:02:31.020> section

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
off which was horrible but i did section

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.160 
off which was horrible but i did section
off<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.310> two<00:02:32.580> by<00:02:32.610> four<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:33.420> over<00:02:34.020> there

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
off that a two by four like over there

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.010 
off that a two by four like over there
and<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.530> side<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.040> cage<00:02:35.250> um<00:02:35.550> while<00:02:36.450> he

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
and that side of the cage um while he

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.500 
and that side of the cage um while he
was<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.590> healing<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.760> was<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.210> horrible

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
was in healing and it was so horrible

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.990 
was in healing and it was so horrible
though<00:02:39.960> because<00:02:40.140> he<00:02:40.440> was<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.740> lonely<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.430> he

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
though because he was so lonely and he

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.640 
though because he was so lonely and he
would<00:02:42.180> all<00:02:42.420> day<00:02:42.690> he<00:02:42.870> would<00:02:42.960> just<00:02:43.140> try<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> get

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
would all day he would just try to get

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.230 
would all day he would just try to get
through<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.980> divide<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.550> he<00:02:44.640> even<00:02:45.030> did<00:02:45.210> a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
through the divide and he even did a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.810 
through the divide and he even did a
couple<00:02:45.450> times<00:02:45.620> but<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.680> put<00:02:47.130> them<00:02:47.250> back<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.640> like

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
couple times but I put them back in like

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.890 
couple times but I put them back in like
would<00:02:48.090> build<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> divide<00:02:48.990> up<00:02:49.290> stronger<00:02:50.070> again

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
would build the divide up stronger again

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.960 
would build the divide up stronger again
so<00:02:52.040> everything<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.160> all<00:02:53.280> good<00:02:53.310> now<00:02:53.730> though

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
so everything is all good now though

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.930 
so everything is all good now though
