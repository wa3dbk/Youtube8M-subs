00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.170
 decision

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.110
 comics was published in 2011 more 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.320
 morales was created by brian matusz

 betis and by sara pichelli the creation of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.800
 this character was influenced 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.199
 totally because of the social situation that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.550
 you live in the USA for all this roll of 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.629
 Barack Obama's choice as 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.820
 President 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.830
 mike bonales is of Latin descent 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.939
 African-American was born and raised in 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.339
 brooklyn new york 

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:04.530
 his parents are called jefferson and he laughed his 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.140
 uncle is called aaron and his best friend is 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.750
 llama dan click mais morals came with 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.490
 the world most needed it later 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.650
 of the death of Peter Parker in the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.470
 moral comics came and took its place 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.049
 as the spiderman moral eyes are is 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.820
 in spider-man of the ultimate universe in 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.610
 the other universes peter parker is 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.079
 basically moral spider-man possesses 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.299
 the same powers as Peter Parker 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.549
 they also share their taste for 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.360
 science and even its history is very 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.220
 Similary 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 because morals also acquired its super 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.710
 skills for a bite of a 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.720
 Spider 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.730
 unlike peter parker himself the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 can become invisible become 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.870
 electric and to enlist your enemies 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.520
 by means of a bite or that is 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.680
 anyone can become invisible but 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.570
 in my opinion this is unnecessary 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.940
 I think they expect that very complete union 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.830
 without these new skills and although not 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.479
 they create moral evils at the beginning not 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.180
 he was very comfortable with his new 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.520
 skills he does not want to do different 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.560
 he wants to do a normal guy and it was his 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.970
 friend gangli who suggested him to the fullest 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.860
 the time you take the place of peter 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.140
 parker the uncle of may is also 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.840
 important the story since he what 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.280
 helped train he taught him to fight and what 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.860
 helped to become the new 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.660
 spider-man later it turned out that his uncle 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.030
 I had other intentions and because this 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.160
 distanced more moral his uncle was a 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.650
 damn exploiter something that to me 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.220
 fascinates others morals is your super suit 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.470
 from spider-man 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.500
 and well the world now had a new 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.780
 spider-man and if he did not take long to find out 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.820
 little time they looked for more morals 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.520
 who helped another for so many 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.320
 super villains is a great character has 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.330
 been informed by 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.820
 fans as well as in all some criticisms 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.260
 negative but in general to people 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.810
 they liked this turn that they gave 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.550
 spider-man I hope that when watching this video 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.800
 you can now base better 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.950
 your position when asked what 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.380
 side are if tim morals or team parker 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.690
 I still find very interesting more 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.880
 moral forever will be team parker 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.950
