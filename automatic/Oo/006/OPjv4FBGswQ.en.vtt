00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
lighting as I do with gradual shading

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.760 
lighting as I do with gradual shading
just<00:04:14.790> because<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.420> makes<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.380> process<00:04:16.590> a

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
just because it makes the process a

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.550 
just because it makes the process a
little<00:04:16.980> bit<00:04:17.100> quicker<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:18.780> can<00:04:18.930> get<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.320> bit

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
little bit quicker and you can get a bit

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.180 
little bit quicker and you can get a bit
more<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.859> drastic<00:04:20.370> change<00:04:20.959> okay<00:04:21.959> so

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
the fact that it all if you persevere it

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.379 
the fact that it all if you persevere it
will<00:04:52.860> look<00:04:53.040> a<00:04:53.220> lot<00:04:53.729> better<00:04:53.940> than<00:04:54.150> if<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.360> just

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
will look a lot better than if you just

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:06.890 
will look a lot better than if you just
start<00:04:54.840> over<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.260> repaint<00:04:55.680> your<00:04:55.740> miniature<00:05:05.900> so

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
start over and repaint your miniature so

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.570 
start over and repaint your miniature so
you've<00:05:07.020> got<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.199> bit<00:05:07.380> more<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.740> lighter<00:05:08.220> tone

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
you've got a bit more of a lighter tone

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.830 
you've got a bit more of a lighter tone
now<00:05:10.639> so<00:05:11.639> again<00:05:13.610> light<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.910> on<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.150> areas<00:05:15.600> that

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.550 
now so again light it on the areas that
are<00:05:16.440> closer<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.150> backpack<00:05:18.630> or<00:05:19.080> not<00:05:19.380> the

to show you just for the sake of time

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.050 
to show you just for the sake of time
and<00:05:47.990> because<00:05:48.800> of<00:05:48.830> YouTube's<00:05:49.340> a<00:05:49.580> 10<00:05:49.850> minute

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
and because of YouTube's a 10 minute

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.750 
and because of YouTube's a 10 minute
time<00:05:50.330> limit<00:05:50.360> so<00:05:50.870> you<00:05:51.830> have<00:05:52.070> to<00:05:52.190> excuse<00:05:52.490> me<00:05:52.640> this

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
time limit so you have to excuse me this

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.270 
time limit so you have to excuse me this
isn't<00:05:53.240> too<00:05:53.930> dumb<00:05:54.170> to<00:05:54.200> the<00:05:54.380> best<00:05:54.560> of<00:05:54.710> my<00:05:54.770> ability

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
isn't too dumb to the best of my ability

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.130 
isn't too dumb to the best of my ability
number<00:05:56.090> what<00:05:56.300> well<00:05:56.480> number<00:05:56.780> one<00:05:56.900> because<00:05:56.990> I'm

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
number what well number one because I'm

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.750 
number what well number one because I'm
doing<00:05:57.320> it<00:05:57.410> really<00:05:57.500> fast<00:05:57.590> number<00:05:58.400> two<00:05:58.610> because

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
doing it really fast number two because

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.730 
doing it really fast number two because
I'm<00:05:58.940> holding<00:05:59.210> it<00:05:59.450> at<00:05:59.540> a<00:05:59.630> really<00:05:59.900> awkward<00:06:00.140> angle

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
I'm holding it at a really awkward angle

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.400 
I'm holding it at a really awkward angle
and<00:06:01.550> it's<00:06:01.730> not<00:06:01.970> natural<00:06:02.180> for<00:06:02.720> me<00:06:02.840> so<00:06:03.140> it<00:06:03.260> might

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
and it's not natural for me so it might

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.370 
and it's not natural for me so it might
not<00:06:03.590> look<00:06:03.800> too<00:06:04.160> good
