00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.140
 2nd round also due to the ribs 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.050
 turn I take a super course 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.730
 interesting super committed it suited me 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.010
 well and I left also in the good 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.360
 moment go a little thinning the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.100
 snow a little bit transformed I had 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.239
 the mountain was starting from the blow that's me 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.489
 allowed to gain seconds on everything 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.899
 the world so I'm two years old she 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.920
 wins the general so that's cool I'm 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.920
 super happy for that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.720
 super slim 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.780
 you have a fairly wide track and who 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.170
 will be really preached to a skier butt 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.150
 at boardercross 6 and it allowed me 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.920
 really to really show the best 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.800
 the best aspect of this at the elbows in 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.320
 this discipline and I believe that it has 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.910
 was pretty participants still 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.730
 appreciated at the track even though then done 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.780
 share at the beginning the races were tight 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.660
 it is true that it was interesting 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.430
 fast is tight and in the end I got the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.730
 chance to win at home in my 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.730
 station 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.270
 we're happy it's a nice event 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.380
 ends up went super fast 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.330
 a lot to manage but 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.980
 thankfully headed by the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.390
 was skiing used to this kind 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.250
 of event I think everyone 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.940
 broke out we had for the moment that 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.980
 good feedback 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.230
 I especially want to thank my 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.880
 volunteers in front of the association thanks to 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.180
 smooth them it would never have been 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.180
 possible
