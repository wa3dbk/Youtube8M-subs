00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.120 
it is good or it is cheap or whatever
but<00:02:12.209> I'm<00:02:12.450> hoping

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
but I'm hoping

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.820

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
even though it was inexpensive I don't

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.490 
even though it was inexpensive I don't
