00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
hybrid loop as a designer I'm thinking

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.640 
hybrid loop as a designer I'm thinking
recording<00:01:38.530> studio<00:01:38.860> applications<00:01:39.730> and<00:01:40.030> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
recording studio applications and and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.230 
recording studio applications and and
the<00:01:41.650> way<00:01:41.800> I'm<00:01:41.950> mixing<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.430> channels<00:01:42.910> on<00:01:43.060> this

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
the way I'm mixing the channels on this

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.000 
the way I'm mixing the channels on this
there's<00:01:43.480> kind<00:01:43.690> of<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:43.870> mix<00:01:44.170> bus<00:01:44.440> there<00:01:44.770> and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
there's kind of a mix bus there and

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.550 
there's kind of a mix bus there and
there's<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.490> driver<00:01:45.910> stage<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.960> drives<00:01:47.290> the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
there's a driver stage that drives the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.980 
there's a driver stage that drives the
loop<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:48.130> there's<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.490> recovery<00:01:48.850> stage<00:01:49.330> and

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
loop and there's a recovery stage and

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.110 
loop and there's a recovery stage and
about<00:01:50.650> five<00:01:50.890> years<00:01:51.130> ago<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.340> designed<00:01:51.760> a<00:01:51.909> power

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
about five years ago I designed a power

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.600 
about five years ago I designed a power
amp<00:01:52.480> and<00:01:52.690> so<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.650> that<00:01:53.860> experience<00:01:54.370> kind<00:01:54.490> of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
amp and so that that experience kind of

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.540 
amp and so that that experience kind of
ties<00:01:54.850> in<00:01:55.090> here<00:01:55.510> so<00:01:56.110> then<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.920> experience<00:01:57.430> is

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
ties in here so then the experience is

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.970 
ties in here so then the experience is
anything<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.180> goes<00:01:58.300> in<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.600> loop<00:01:58.810> it's<00:01:59.770> not

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
anything that goes in the loop it's not

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.550 
anything that goes in the loop it's not
just<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.310> loop<00:02:00.460> we<00:02:00.670> put<00:02:00.880> an<00:02:01.030> mxr<00:02:01.720> Dyna<00:02:02.020> comp<00:02:02.380> in

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
just a loop we put an mxr Dyna comp in

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.590 
just a loop we put an mxr Dyna comp in
that<00:02:02.770> loop<00:02:03.010> it<00:02:03.430> immediately<00:02:04.060> sounded<00:02:04.540> like

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
that loop it immediately sounded like

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.080 
that loop it immediately sounded like
$1000<00:02:05.380> compressor<00:02:06.070> because<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.880> way

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
$1000 compressor because of the way

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.990 
$1000 compressor because of the way
we've<00:02:07.659> staged<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.379> thing<00:02:08.679> we're<00:02:09.369> driving

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
we've staged this thing we're driving

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.029 
we've staged this thing we're driving
the<00:02:10.119> loop<00:02:10.330> at

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the loop at

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.759 
the loop at
300<00:02:11.610> millivolt<00:02:12.060> signal<00:02:12.329> which<00:02:13.019> is<00:02:13.200> what<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
300 millivolt signal which is what a

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.209 
300 millivolt signal which is what a
pickup<00:02:14.610> puts<00:02:15.299> out<00:02:15.540> your<00:02:16.349> effects<00:02:16.680> pedals<00:02:17.069> are

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
pickup puts out your effects pedals are

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.789 
pickup puts out your effects pedals are
designed<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.909> take<00:02:18.120> about<00:02:18.659> a<00:02:18.719> tube<00:02:19.230> 200

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
designed to take about a tube 200

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.280 
designed to take about a tube 200
millivolt<00:02:20.189> to<00:02:20.579> 1<00:02:20.879> volt<00:02:21.180> peak-to-peak<00:02:21.480> signal

millivolt to 1 volt peak-to-peak signal

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.789 
millivolt to 1 volt peak-to-peak signal
so<00:02:22.739> we're<00:02:23.069> making<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.609> delicious<00:02:24.120> tone

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
so we're making this delicious tone

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.550 
so we're making this delicious tone
compatible<00:02:25.799> 100%<00:02:26.640> with<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.180> pedal<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.930> then

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
compatible 100% with the pedal and then

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.099 
compatible 100% with the pedal and then
we're<00:02:29.129> recovering<00:02:29.549> that<00:02:29.909> and<00:02:30.299> putting<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.019> out

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
we're recovering that and putting it out

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.110 
we're recovering that and putting it out
to<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.409> power<00:02:31.590> tubes<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.519> couldn't<00:02:32.970> be

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to the power tubes and I couldn't be

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.550 
to the power tubes and I couldn't be
happier<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.689> you<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:34.019> experience<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
happier and you just experience the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.509 
happier and you just experience the
sound<00:02:34.829> it's<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.430> out<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.000> world<00:02:37.519> it

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
sound it's it's out of this world it

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.039 
sound it's it's out of this world it
seems<00:02:38.819> like<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.329> seems<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:39.629> you've<00:02:39.870> thought

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
seems like it seems like you've thought

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.869 
seems like it seems like you've thought
of<00:02:40.230> everything<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.889> crammed<00:02:41.219> it<00:02:41.400> all<00:02:41.579> into

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
of everything and crammed it all into

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.849 
of everything and crammed it all into
this<00:02:41.969> bus<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.599> obviously<00:02:42.959> like<00:02:43.049> sometimes

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
this bus and obviously like sometimes

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.410 
this bus and obviously like sometimes
you<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.189> amps<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:44.700> there's<00:02:44.879> like<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.329> know

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
you see amps and there's like you know

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.690 
you see amps and there's like you know
50<00:02:45.989> knobs<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.159> bunch<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.549> switches

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
50 knobs on it like a bunch of switches

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.879 
50 knobs on it like a bunch of switches
this<00:02:48.239> one<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.659> looks<00:02:48.959> clean<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:49.769> the

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
this one like looks clean it's the

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.949 
this one like looks clean it's the
cleanest<00:02:50.340> damp<00:02:50.549> I've<00:02:50.730> seen<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.299> has<00:02:51.540> this

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
cleanest damp I've seen that has this

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.440 
cleanest damp I've seen that has this
amount<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.470> facility<00:02:53.310> thank<00:02:53.549> you<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.879> create

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
we have fogs and we have plexi I've been

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.980 
we have fogs and we have plexi I've been
asked<00:03:03.100> for<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.340> for<00:03:03.670> years<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.540> first<00:03:04.840> I

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
asked for this for years and first I

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.710 
asked for this for years and first I
used<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.710> think<00:03:05.860> if<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.160> wanted<00:03:06.490> this<00:03:06.730> by<00:03:07.660> the

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
used to think if you wanted this by the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.420 
used to think if you wanted this by the
black<00:03:08.500> by<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.400> American<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.150> by<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:11.080> AC<00:03:11.430> you

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
black by the American and by the AC you

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.830 
black by the American and by the AC you
know<00:03:12.550> that's<00:03:12.880> that's<00:03:13.120> great<00:03:13.360> because<00:03:13.540> why<00:03:13.810> not

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
know that's that's great because why not

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.750 
know that's that's great because why not
just<00:03:14.170> shove<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.590> all<00:03:14.710> into<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> same<00:03:15.130> box<00:03:15.580> know

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
what it took me five years and we shoved

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.300 
what it took me five years and we shoved
it<00:03:17.650> all<00:03:17.740> into<00:03:18.040> one<00:03:18.070> box<00:03:18.430> now<00:03:19.860> you're<00:03:20.860> flexing
