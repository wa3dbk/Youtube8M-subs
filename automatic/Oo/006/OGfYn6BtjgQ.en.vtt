00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:10.180
 Today we are talking to Vyacheslav Kroto 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.500
 would be a player of the Moscow Spartak 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.869
 youth tournament winner 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.270
 teams and top scorer Spartak in 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:20.150
 youth team well now 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.800
 Vyacheslav inferior to the words of victory 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.039
 you scheme of course 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.779
 left top scorer and as far as 1 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.039
 only this season moved to Spartak 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.660
 before 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.020
 what was it like to be here after 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:38.210
 Astrakhan Spartak 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:42.380
 I was very glad to this I was very sick for 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:47.840
 Spartak before always wanted to be 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.900
 in this team and seek good 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 results words compression internship yes 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:58.760
 there thanks say even legends was 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.010
 harry became the best barrier of astrakhan 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.990
 Astrakhan region 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.210
 Here I scored one hundred with something swords 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.530
 captain of the team that is from what 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.970
 seeks well yes they want to beat his record 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.090
 we get the answer only Spartak 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.030
 you dispute have any anything 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.500
 argue so not 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.400
 Well, I scorched burn now do not let 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.400
 the season 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.530
 how did this season you often you 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.440
 had to start at the base quite often 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.730
 go on to replace as generally better 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.050
 start from the first minute or 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.240
 nozomi i think any player is better 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.810
 I start with the first because the indicator 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.420
 your games like to reach on from the first 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.460
 minutes on his sister they trust you to believe 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.370
 pit here how to learn in good shape 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.270
 if you go for a replacement means not 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.420
 justify their results of their 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.990
 effort 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.860
 but as far as I understand you 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.080
 I had to play at the 2nd position put forward 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.570
 attacking and serving extremely where you 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.970
 more convenient game most likely attack 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.500
 central you fall green form i 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.230
 made the top scorer of the youth 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.240
 sports to which of the swords we fill 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.240
 most likely career advice 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.240
 last for junior it when left 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.480
 foot worked the ball right valley for 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.910
 start-up by the billions of transfer I accepted everyone 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.770
 but I did not jump often succeeds such 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:46.880
 scored 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:50.360
 Ignorance of someone classic for forms 40 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.770
 for you to turn out to be applications for the game 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.450
 replace you only then in this 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.670
 scriabin match at halftime and you 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.050
 were given in the application for the game basics and even 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.170
 took to the field in the second half 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.920
 what is it like to play Spartacus even 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.459
 mezina for this indescribable emotions i 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.989
 was very happy very happy about it 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.310
 because it was a childhood dream, as it were 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:20.010
 seven years ago I served mee 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.680
 and now I play for them as it is very 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.599
 worth it 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.730
 Vyacheslav look you worked with 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.470
 coaches in Astrakhan us then we 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.190
 came here worked with dmitry 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.010
 well 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.280
 then Vasily Kulkov now Valeri 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:39.720
 Karpin some experts as far as 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.569
 they are different how similar 3 we are 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.790
 in grief and here under the ocean well let's 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:50.489
 March only themselves are all different in 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.049
 little differently something someone one 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.180
 requires something else so usually in 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.609
 principle, as each training in its own way 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.489
 think so and 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:04.290
 delivers to the players with what on starts 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.810
 out on the field boy rails what 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.829
 but what 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:16.889
 day off who had the task of working there 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:20.489
 ahead to strain the attacker leading 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:25.560
 for dates and he said come on this is yours 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.870
 a chance using well so frisky enough 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.330
 connected then 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.440
 right and left there tried something 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.389
 pressure defender on co2 installation 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.130
 such a migron and further we perform 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:42.800
 tried to wanted to show your in 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.020
 resulting in Krasnodar you have already gone with 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.210
 sleep and yes that is not going with youth 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.380
 by team 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.090
 what was he like when you found out that 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.949
 youth team became the winner 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:58.550
 tournament is still in such a dramatic need 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.199
 it was a playout that's it and in 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.039
 the bus told me that the player 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:07.780
 but also very surprised at first did not believe 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:12.080
 only then came to the room was 42 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.270
 I'm very upset at home guys are not 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.930
 play in such a heavy mother plus 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:23.210
 deletion I do not know you have found strength somewhere 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:26.320
 not only dedication they had a mad 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.750
 there looked last there not 20 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.750
 rejoiced very much shouted high and we 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.910
 screamed there nadralis were very 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.729
 happy with the worlds 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.120
 but now you have a match with 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:44.599
 Krasnodar you have clearly been applications for 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.660
 the game is now training with the main 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.220
 composition which further further 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.289
 Steps 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.330
 fixed in the main part 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.950
 becomes the best elagin main 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.080
 composition 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.460
 what 's great is competition 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.000
 replace with any any garnish will 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.120
 we will try 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.449
 that is, they don't scare them, but what are they 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.900
 here these guys are football players 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.850
 Spartak 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.370
 what would you have not watched it before 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.650
 so from the bottom up as now with 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.520
 they do not train very much 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:22.070
 professional guys are very up to them 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:28.280
 come on just want to be yes 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:31.940
 there if you still have a lot of matches 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.300
 held for the youth team yes how are you 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.669
 think who was the best this season 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.750
 highly 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.930
 Well, it's hard to say the whole team 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:46.010
 good we all guys are very cool 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.050
 I play so I can not distinguish so to 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.090
 can you explain why here are some 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.820
 their rivals Spartak away 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:56.960
 chops under the nut there with space 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.150
 shields for and return to Moscow here 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.310
 in his field as it is very hard in one 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:07.130
 the ball is with the removal 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:13.820
 in the minority explain at least 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:18.380
 maybe 8 pages is extremely house 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:21.710
 it seems like we will beat getting what 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.020
 are you guys already seen leaving 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.510
 Spartak fans yes that is in 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.320
 Krasnodar saw how much and there was more 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:32.330
 3000 what do you want spartax qatar cidoc 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.470
 what is the attitude of Spartak fan 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.900
 in a team 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:41.580
 always spartan sores for me were 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:44.840
 This is an indicator of how they would be very good. 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.190
 supporting the team with a mountain for the team 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.100
 very nice to have such politicians 

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.800
 but let's hope that soon 

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.180
 Vyacheslav's T-shirt is cool will be one of 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.520
 most popular in Poltava 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.560
 fans thanks we talked 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.350
 today with a numerical mole you are the winner 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.330
 youth championship of Russia and now not 

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.330
 footballer of the main part of Spartak
