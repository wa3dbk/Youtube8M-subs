00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.590

these<00:05:49.500> because<00:05:49.950> I<00:05:50.310> didn't<00:05:51.210> get<00:05:51.270> my<00:05:51.390> order

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
these because I didn't get my order

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.570 
these because I didn't get my order
right<00:05:52.020> away<00:05:52.080> obviously<00:05:52.410> it<00:05:52.800> took<00:05:52.950> a<00:05:52.980> while<00:05:53.220> and

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
right away obviously it took a while and

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.850 
right away obviously it took a while and
then<00:05:54.390> I<00:05:54.420> thought<00:05:54.810> well<00:05:55.140> these<00:05:55.320> went<00:05:55.560> out<00:05:55.710> of
