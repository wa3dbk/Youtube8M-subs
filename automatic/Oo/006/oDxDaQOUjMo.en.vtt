00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.610
 the little ones know it curling I you 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.710
 found today for a guide for 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.759
 the ransacker of iron which is the second 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.830
 bones of the citadel the flames 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.300
 infernal and that presents a fight that 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.009
 still relatively simplistic in 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.290
 two phases that will simply alternate 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.639
 over time across a beauty that is 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.110
 the one and a half who is present then 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.610
 it is absolutely no longer attackable 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.350
 in front of them since it's a phase of 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.330
 survival and focus dad 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.620
 as usual the guide is prepared in 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.300
 Heroic mode function mainly 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.000
 but things apply also to the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.080
 most normal mode mechanics 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.340
 during phase 1 the boss will use 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.600
 a handful of skills that will 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.460
 almost all generated flames 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.470
 green on the ground or on the ground 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.610
 players or both and flames on the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.140
 ground will pose a buzz when we 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.850
 walk on it and the oxen on the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.860
 players will do damage on the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.270
 duration and can be stored and become 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.680
 quickly very very problematic if we 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.040
 accumulates too much by doing too much 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.840
 bullshit 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.250
 the raid will be placed in an arc 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.660
 around the boss taking a lot of 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.460
 place to manage two skills that 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.500
 will forbid you to package everything 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.760
 first when a stable or roughly the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.230
 buzz is just going to be one of the buzz of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.790
 flames on some random players 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.560
 and especially the players who are close 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.940
 of them so obviously if you go all 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.710
 you pack it's the barbecue 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.970
 the second skill that requires 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.710
 take some space is the dam 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.909
 ok ok the boss is going to turn on 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.800
 time indices prepare an attack in 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.760
 cone that's pretty classic and that's going 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.620
 leave behind a lot of small 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.909
 flames to avoid attention the boss must 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.260
 take a few steps back when he 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.030
 prepare his fate what goes a little bit 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.470
 disrupted placement at the level of 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.240
 tanks and cac 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.380
 but obviously it would be simple if 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.060
 the boss did not have a bonus 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.400
 skill daou super easy to manage 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.470
 with a pack group but infernal with 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.299
 people in every corner and that's 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.710
 obviously the principle of the woc the boss 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.420
 will launch that's called pounding 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.220
 who has a six-second 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.869
 launch three times during each phase 1 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.400
 because of these three skills to no avail 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.810
 so placed the boss facing the red with the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.100
 bedroom behind as I said earlier 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.320
 raid is positioned in an arc 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.670
 around the boss the art of placement at 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.590
 final on this boss is to have a raid 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.000
 sufficiently wide apart so that the least 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.220
 possible players and to move and to 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.659
 react for the dam while having a 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.700
 maximum of players they are worn 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.680
 of a maximum of city ​​during the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.790
 pounding then you will tell me yes but 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.560
 we could fuck around the boss in 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.759
 does that mean a way green circle 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.350
 in an arc because the boss is going 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.580
 use to remove on the pond that has 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.439
 exclusively on the times he 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.820
 use this is one of the buzz that explodes 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.619
 after a few seconds on the position 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.270
 the tank and that will slay any 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.560
 pilgrims who find themselves at 40 meters 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.909
 the point of impact 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.379
 the best way to handle this 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.239
 competence and assign dead zones 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.260
 towards the back of the room where each tank 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.120
 will drop 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.349
 brothel there you can see that on the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.489
 diagram with the other reds that are 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.750
 placed behind the cac 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.159
 the damage of the art terrisson 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.409
 proportional to the distance between 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.819
 affected players is the time that explodes 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.230
 so it's unlikely that you 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.010
 kill if you're kind at 30 meters a 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.599
 mischief blunder anyway 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.480
 especially at the level of the caques 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.409
 because it's really hard 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.519
 finally twice in the phase the 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.170
 boss will charge towards a 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.549
 remote then from another player taking away 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.650
 with him anybody on his way 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.590
 like this jerk of media on the video 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.930
 the finger we do it turns 45 and 95 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.060
 of energy so he does it at half of 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.319
 the phase is just before flying off the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.400
 most boring point handle in the end on 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.140
 this phase is clearly removing it 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.519
 at the tank level because we're in camera 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.500
 clos had to chain tunes drawn on 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.730
 a tank and then drop artillery on 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.379
 the other as long as before 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.769
 first be back so it's a sacred 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.359
 whorehouse 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.519
 so you'll have to snap your 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.420
 defensive cd for explosions since 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.799
 the boss does not make me enough 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.200
 damage to justify CDs 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.480
 defensive and that you are able 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.549
 behind snapping the cds to come back 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.950
 quickly on the boss so decided to 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.389
 sprint obviously since otherwise the boss 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.769
 will go in all directions and if a 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.900
 time than to fart are to be removed 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.010
 before you came back and that 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.660
 you can not take back the boss 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.720
 great cases to see get away 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.220
 it's a bit complicated so yeah 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.540
 practice in all cases well 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.220
 keep up the pace because that's 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.299
 exactly the same throughout 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.160
 fight for example at the hens 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.959
 he will ask one to withdraw on the so much 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.760
 that number 1 and before the temple 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.290
 number and exploded he will put the telly on 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.549
 as number 2 so it has to be the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.109
 as number 2 wait a little bit 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.250
 before leaving with the time that 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.769
 numbers 1 come back the fastest 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.260
 possible for the boss bush little or 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.579
 ideally not ride a tank by 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.680
 example we can simply slammed his 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.090
 bubble on artillery be insensitive 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.230
 to damage and not do damage on 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.069
 the others that's what I do me and 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.840
 it does not help 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.970
 once the boss arrives in front 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.709
 of them so after he made his 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.590
 second set of game charge in all 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.329
 meaning it will become downright insensitive 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.500
 to the damage these people 99% of the cases in less 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.079
 so do not even try to attack it 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.549
 used for nothing and regularly since the 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.260
 heavens he will swing a line of 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.389
 tar on a player then he will fuck the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.620
 fire is summoned from the mines that will have to 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.090
 pesos faster because at the end 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.709
 some time explodes them on the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.199
 raid in whole it is very bad 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.370
 in addition to that he will ask 3 removed on 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.019
 Random players from time to time 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.070
 that's remove the make it significantly less of 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.539
 damage so you do not need to 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.920
 someone defensive even if it can 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.150
 be a good idea to do it 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.380
 but the three players who is sensitive 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.940
 and will have to go to the corners 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.260
 from the room to avoid killing their 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.990
 comrades so that will have to do when 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.280
 even enough attention also avoid that 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.990
 people who have their series this bar the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.340
 two or three at the same place if not 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.660
 they will fart the puck 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.590
 mutually and it's not necessarily very 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.000
 very good 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.200
 in my opinion the best way to avoid 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.630
 problems during phase 2 it's from 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.860
 make two balanced groups with the 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.380
 same number of time pjak cities 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.670
 in the es2 with each group 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.990
 positioned to a different taste from the 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.490
 room at the very beginning of the phase 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.080
 to write a line of tar that happens 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.910
 the group that is targeted by the line 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.710
 advance towards the other group 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.600
 and in the end once the boss 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.710
 transition and returns to phase 1 the 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.000
 two groups are more or less the same 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.130
 place it's a lot easier to get 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.660
 reposition a strategy like that 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.650
 especially allows me to avoid having 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.700
 players who get stuck 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.110
 by the flames of having for example 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.670
 always the same players who are 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.990
 targeted by always the same flame 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.520
 to have bombs that appear at 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.390
 places where there are no players 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.220
 etc., etc 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.870
 it's still better if you have 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.520
 people at each end of the room who are 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.690
 are gradually joining 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.330
 blow you have full coverage 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.800
 at the level of the bombs and a balanced dps 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.000
 because yes the trend candy when 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.200
 even appear a little bit where they 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.880
 want we had tried to do a single 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.930
 group at a time and there are banks 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.160
 who are too far away of whom there are people 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.630
 who have to move and after that is 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.190
 a little bit of a mess we do not have everything 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.930
 the world within reach of it so it's not 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.490
 obvious once yours comes back into 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.810
 phase 1 we leave as before there will be 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.500
 flames everywhere so you will need 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.060
 do goof 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.710
 however, you will definitely have seen 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.140
 that the boss's skills need to act 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.610
 on these flames and will repel them 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.930
 mostly the two times when 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.310
 it's the most important it stays by 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.780
 example the return to phase 1 or when 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.190
 you see the impact area where the boss 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.960
 happens we are obviously not fake you 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.280
 hold the boss down on this area a 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.140
 and all the flames releases what wants 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.490
 to say that the area directly below 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.410
 of the boss is completely clean for the 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.580
 cafes for the tanks and there is also the 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.810
 hammering or there by cons it's a 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.430
 little annoying because often during 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.810
 the pounding the flames are going to be 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.220
 pushed back on the distant ones that are going 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.730
 so have to try to dodge them this 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.470
 that they can 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.660
 because otherwise he stayed who take 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.950
 oxen in all directions and that 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.170
 in addition to pounding it can often 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.040
 to be very very dangerous here it is to 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.020
 just about anything I can tell you 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.820
 me on the ransacker whether in mode 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.260
 normal or heroic like 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.240
 usually do not hesitate to serve you 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.520
 annotations to see the video 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.110
 the boss's suede or other guides or 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.760
 others of weapons in the citadel of 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.390
 infernal flames and me I you 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.390
 find a next time
