00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.870
 salve salve good people here who is 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.429
 Eduardo and I'm making a video 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.340
 Classy and fast, right? 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.109
 It's to make up for those days there that I stayed 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 without doing viola is this class is dedicated 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.779
 users who are having problems 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.949
 Access refers to one's account 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.980
 user right 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.619
 I realized that some machines that I 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.420
 I checked so much here at work. 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.710
 as in the home of friends etc. who 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.340
 some user accounts that have a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.559
 certain limitation and even you trying 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.450
 create a new account you can not 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.370
 resolve put it here I give an example 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.770
 I already noticed that some user accounts 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.600
 you do not have access to the button 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.760
 properties that is on my computer 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.699
 and there are also some that even you 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.480
 trying to open this 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.140
 here you do not have access to them 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.720
 device manager is the protection 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.110
 system etc. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.479
 this is because the following are some accounts 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.840
 has certain limitations, right? 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.880
 because the user does not modify options 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 operating system I 've seen up to 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.570
 machines that block access to the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.340
 control panel 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 so it's kind of impossible, you me 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.930
 so far in the case to the menu Account 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.220
 for you to try to do this. 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.400
 modification 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 at least I have not yet found 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.290
 a way to wine and to account 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.310
 user without going through the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.110
 control right? 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.049
 if I'm wrong you can post 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.020
 a comment to correct 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.460
 we are there the hint is how I do it 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.670
 to solve this 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.850
 Good, can we solve more? 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.829
 Partly, no, how can I? 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.310
 to teach you how to activate the account 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.440
 super administrator on windows 7 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.890
 first you 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.110
 press windows r flag for you 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:26.220
 to the execute command and type 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:31.430
 cmd and here you will do the following 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:37.950
 you are going to put the command net oz 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:41.550

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:47.390
 English you put administrator's in the

 People, I can not show them to 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.690
 I 'm recording you, but when you 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.360
 click on start log off goes 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.790
 appear another user is not as 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.090
 administrator writing 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.800
 You will click on it and it will play. 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.640
 automatically and it 's as if you have 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.080
 finished formatting windows is the one that is in 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.050
 time you click it it will configure 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.510
 internet explorer will do goes 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.610
 appear a type a dialog box 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.010
 which looks more or less here 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.110
 in this part here in this region that 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.489
 usually appears when you format the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.650
 windows 7 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.590
 After it's finished, the 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.510
 default windows theme nÃ© 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.550
 he can do the right thing 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.620
 modifications, you can not even try 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.650
 come here to the control panel , right? 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.540
 super administrator and create a 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.580
 new account, with the privilege of 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.489
 administrator privileges 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.419
 this case does not solve you can use 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.490
 properly the administrator account is 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.289
 that you will have full access to the machine 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.670
 the problem you can not 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.040
 to rename 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.880
 It's the name, he always has a 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.000
 administrator is that so people are 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.990
 this account is not widely used in the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.080
 Windows 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.000
 it is only used in extreme cases it is 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.040
 When do you have any problem concerning 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.650
 to the user profile or any other 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.580
 another item that gives you access denied in the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.760
 higher 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.430
 then the people after you use this 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.640
 account they deactivate that in the case it is only 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.250
 you write here and digital not even 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.040
 netware command manage and 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.150
 administrator active new 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.780
 it will vanish, huh? 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.520
 After we log off 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.310
 again he will disappear 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.890
 the right administrator is only appear in the case 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.920
 your right username 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:20.760
 Good folks this was a very good viola. 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.490
 very basic but it's just to teach 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.860
 You're there like trying, huh? 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.750
 let's say solve these 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.320
 problems related to accounts 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.500
 users 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.280
 Good, I hope you enjoyed it.
