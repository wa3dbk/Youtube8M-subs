you know once it's dried up it's not

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.220 
you know once it's dried up it's not
going<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.980> take<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.370> long<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:36.090> we<00:04:36.810> can<00:04:37.020> cut

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
going to take that long and we can cut

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.790 
going to take that long and we can cut
it<00:04:37.380> into<00:04:37.530> pieces<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.490> that's<00:04:39.240> about<00:04:39.480> 10<00:04:40.290> or<00:04:40.560> 15

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
it into pieces and that's about 10 or 15

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.620 
it into pieces and that's about 10 or 15
minutes<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.490> let<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:41.970> rest

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
minutes you let it rest

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.130 
minutes you let it rest
it's<00:04:43.320> cools<00:04:43.710> down<00:04:44.000> there<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.150> another<00:04:45.450> trick<00:04:45.840> I

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
it's cools down there is another trick I

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.170 
it's cools down there is another trick I
can<00:04:46.200> share<00:04:46.650> with<00:04:46.890> you<00:04:47.100> that<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.640> can<00:04:47.850> do<00:04:48.030> it

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
can share with you that you can do it

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.280 
can share with you that you can do it
more<00:04:48.480> faster

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
more faster
