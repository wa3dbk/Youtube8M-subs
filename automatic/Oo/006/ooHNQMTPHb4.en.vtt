we<00:02:14.040> will<00:02:14.250> see<00:02:14.459> some<00:02:14.670> clouds<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.540> far<00:02:15.780> north

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
we will see some clouds to the far north

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.930 
we will see some clouds to the far north
of<00:02:16.290> us<00:02:16.410> from<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.650> system<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.640> we're<00:02:17.790> also

of us from that system but we're also
going<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.720> clouds<00:02:18.959> venturing<00:02:19.560> from

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
this system along the Gulf Coast so this

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.229 
this system along the Gulf Coast so this

is going to ride eastward as well

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.300 
is going to ride eastward as well
affecting<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> deep<00:02:25.440> south<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.250> will

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
affecting the deep south and that will

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.089 
affecting the deep south and that will
bring<00:02:26.870> rain<00:02:27.870> as<00:02:28.140> well<00:02:28.319> as<00:02:28.500> freezing<00:02:28.920> rain

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
bring rain as well as freezing rain
