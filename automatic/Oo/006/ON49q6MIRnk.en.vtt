00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.290
 minutes but naturally youtube it 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.540
 too long video so i decided 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.880

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.340
 I understand this type of income and also 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.110
 it is necessary to start with 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.760
 monetization since this is the main view 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.520
 earnings on youtube probably 98 percent 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.740
 users who make money 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.680
 youtube and use exactly monetization 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.550
 my videos so I will start with her 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.350
 Iâ€™ll tell you about my next videos

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.680
 similarly 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.900
 e-mail marketing duct earning with 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.530
 using advertising on their 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.140
 video 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.970
 individually work as a customer but about 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.140
 that's all in the following videos so if 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.120
 not yet subscribed to the channel 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.330
 subscribe not to miss them 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.090
 so what is monetization 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.369
 In general, the video is actually all very 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.100
 just monetize the video to find 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:05.040
 is that youtube is paying you 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.270
 for displaying your ads on your videos 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.810
 featured on your channel meaning you 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.849
 upload videos to your channel and when 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.140
 viewing your video to user 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.170

 bye pays you money what are the pros 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.150
 this type of earnings but naturally 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.520
 this is what this earnings can be like 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.040
 still major that is 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.490
 if you have already spun the channel you 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.070
 you can just either you promote your 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.370
 products your business through youtube 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.890
 you can enable monetization and you 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.200
 will be paid extra money for 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.600
 display ads on your videos that is 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.640
 channel performs the function of developing your 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.270
 business and beyond that still getting and 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.670
 earnings 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.740
 also if you have some kind of hobby you 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.770
 can do this favorite thing 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.620
 make pro video tutorial useful 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.650
 lead the channel upload them on youtube and order 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.140
 the most you will do what you love 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.180
 while youtube will also pay you 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.310
 money that is you will be on it 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.090
 earns the second plus is 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.840
 stability 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.990
 i.e. monthly adsense makes you 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.170
 money transfers and no delay all 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.290
 strictly according to plan so you don't need 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.959
 worry about getting it in 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.950
 this month salary as they say or 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.070
 the next plus will not work 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.190
 the growth of the channel increases your income that is 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.050
 the more views you have than 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.340
 the more you dial the subscriber 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.230
 accordingly, the more you get 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.590
 clicks and viewing ads goes to do 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.739
 payments to you larger 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.959
 accordingly, you know that the channel is on 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.690
 youtube to a certain peak for example 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.269
 one and a half two or three thousand subscribers 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.660
 develop quite hard but then 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.510
 much accelerated in deed and therefore 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.060
 The next advantage is that with 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.220
 increasing the channel you need to spend less 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.930
 efforts on its development the more you 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.130
 you will earn that is very 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.350
 good perspective 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.890
 but this method also has its own 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.680
 cons first is what you need 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.530
 regularly upload new videos if you 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.760
 won't do it especially on 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.320
 the initial stage of development of the channel 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.630
 you will not succeed in you 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.680
 it will develop it and you will not succeed 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.710
 earn on 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.830
 monetization next plus what you need 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.500
 constantly develop the channel after all even 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.419
 if you have a developed channel well at least once 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.150
 per week one video you need to upload 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.180
 the next minus is possible if 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.190
 you have a running theme gift on youtube 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.810
 you can spin any channel with any 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.729
 topics as there will always be 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.660
 users who are interested in whether 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.270
 another topic 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.430
 but the problem lies in the fact that already 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.610
 There is for example the promoted niches such 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.620
 like fitness and health 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.050
 humor which already has its million 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.810
 million channels and along the way hard 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.550
 very much to get through this competition 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.190
 at the same time if you choose no shug 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.949
 very narrow aimed at a narrow circle 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.070
 people will also be hard to develop 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:22.190
 channel since you will be at first very 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.870
 few followers and views 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.410
 so you need to decide on a niche 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.520
 which will be more voluminous but at the same 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.979
 the time is not yet busy though I'll tell you 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.080
 that at the moment such niches are very 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.889
 a lot so if you have some sort 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.949
 already subject 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.520
 either desire to develop their 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.330
 channel 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.520
 Faster hurry for now there is no such 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.050
 strong competition another year 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.300
 approximately you have 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.099
 because abroad for example 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.220
 requests for which we have competition 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:59.430
 there are two three thousand videos in america already 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.210
 23 million that is, you know yes 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.430
 difference and the next minus of course 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.099
 so significant is that you 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.620
 you need to follow the rules of adsense youtube 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:14.250
 this is especially true of copyright 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.380
 when you enter into an agreement with estimates 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.570
 be sure to read the rules do not 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.699
 be lazy there pretty big 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.669
 quantity but you need to spend time and 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.930
 all study and read because 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.820
 ignorance of the rules does not exempt from 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.270
 responsibility if you will them 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.970
 disobey you 99 percent of the time 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.949
 will turn off monetization about the best you 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.889
 You can even lose the channel like this 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.960
 here are the pros and cons of monetizing videos on 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.540
 youtube but summing up I will say that 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.580
 youtube monetization video 1 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.740
 of the easiest ways to earn on 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.230
 youtube do not use for millions 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.570
 users around the world therefore have 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:55.050
 you have a chance to earn these 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.390
 the rest is the main thing to want and the most 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.760
 the main course is the initial phase of the 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.820
 have when you have no followers no 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.560
 views here the most important thing 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.290
 psychologically don't give up and go ahead 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.630
 if this video was helpful to you 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.850
 know what to do put your finger up 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.200
 subscribe to 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.050
 channel not to miss the following 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.240
 series of videos that will be pretty 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.020
 interesting youtube users and 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.350
 earnings 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.890
 well, until the next video was with you 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.890
