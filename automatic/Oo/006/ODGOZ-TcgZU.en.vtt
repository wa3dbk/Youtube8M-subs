 welcome today we go 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.429
 learn to make a campfire in a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.830
 first time realize a ball of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.599
 crumpled paper enough newspaper 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.529
 big to lock up air to 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.650
 Inside not compact balls 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.650
 simply makes many awards there 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:37.100
 threaded the paper a ball on a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:42.930
 ball a newspaper is sufficient realize 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:46.620
 the pile of papers afterwards we 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.600
 let's add the wood start with 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.600
 twigs of rather dry wood 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.190
 the surrounding branches will be there 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:10.500
 do then gradually add wood that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:13.830
 will be a little bigger do not hesitate to in 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 put a lot is the fuel that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.090
 will burn first and be essential 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.090
 for the vitality of fire 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:38.230
 then add dubois means that 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.240
 will burn and make the fuel 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:45.240
 intermediate between the big logs 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 of wood and twigs 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.770
 in the end you will add big ones 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.380
 logs of wood that will maintain 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:03.760
 together and will eventually burn in 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:06.400
 last it is these logs of wood that 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.750
 will allow the fires to resist from 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:14.190
 burn slowly let's turn on now 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.190
 fire 8.7 you from matches 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.220
 and fire the paper at different 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.220
 places 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.140
 the fire will gradually take this is 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.140
 normal 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:19.490
 this is our fire flying little by little 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.860
 the twigs ignite and warm 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.210
 the whole fire 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.840
 you can see here the twigs that 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.990
 have already started to flambÃ© and the wood 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.230
 intermediaries who start to burn the 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.830
 buses are in turn warming up and the
