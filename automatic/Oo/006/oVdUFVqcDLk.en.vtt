 those of metro it if you want to know everything about this shape-shifting game 2b 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.780
 old school of those very difficult long and composed with a thousand things to 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.209
 discover to do beware of our video review 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.600
 donky with camper a taranto takes the series cauntri dire 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.870
 that from 1994 to 1997 with three chapters on super nintendo 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.660
 16-bit era elections 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.490
 reaching exceptional technical peaks supported by a game play off 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.480
 once the rem phase is done, home made microsoft nintendo is decided to pass 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.680
 the witness to the Texan retro studios quellidellelica.it of a historic brand 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.980
 with the metro 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.950
 no revolution 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.880
 but rather a continuation of what had been interrupted at the gates of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 new millennium 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.010
 to don t with countdown 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.080
 a two-dimensional platformer. 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.670
 a ride through jungle caves beaches volcanoes factories and much more 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.009
 with settings tell me if you don't sell 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.689
 to compose a robust full-bodied adventure on the day 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.220
 in single player you can also bet on bb with me 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.110
 which thus provides a dual aid that resolves the doubling of energy 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.890
 overall 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.589
 if the possibility of using his jet 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.589
 to return with more delicate status. 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.909
 two-dimensional platformer 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.479
 vul say to have for hands 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.989
 the need to have good coordination sufficient mastery with 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.239
 the basic tor and sewing genres given the difficulty and complexity of some 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.479
 sections in this perspective accounts with causes we dance is a game made clearly 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:52.399
 I made the map not so difficult to become frustrating even though we often did 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.159
 makes you go very close 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.440
 very demanding 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.640
 which requires reflexes and great readiness especially with the moment in 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.640
 which one decides to go beyond the superficial level and aim at objectives 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.279
 secondary like letters forming with glass 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:10.809
 en various pieces of a father to then reach 100% completion 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.669
 then speaking of the so-called wickedness of the game the mode 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.279
 multiplayer is certainly weaker than the experience 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.619
 single file 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:25.349
 too cognitive and demanding it simply fits into something more 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.449
 within a package, those born and raised for a single player 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.819
 an applause banks made to the control system which is practically perfect 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.190
 so much coiromonte contested laughter so much 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.830
 so much the one with many hearts nunzia in this sense sorry not to see 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.040
 implemented in the game offer the classic ultimately controls 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.040
 however, a whim of purists and does not affect any playability 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.040
 of the title of records

 ads 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.619
 as for the game play also the technical component deserves a big one 

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:24.309
 applause 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:28.839
 going to quietly positioned among the best games ever appeared on which 

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:33.379
 practically the amount of detail polygons is simply excellent 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.719
 but in general the style that amazes for quality and touches of class as in the 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.159
 case of the wonderful sections with the hey soleross silhouette on the sport 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:46.169
 the only note that you can move your legs brings effects applied in such 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.860
 sense with protagonists so speed without any sign quite obvious 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.650
