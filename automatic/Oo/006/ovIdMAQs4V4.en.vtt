00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.560
 garden furniture even here 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.290
 Hello and welcome like you 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.920
 I did not paint one today 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.870
 For this we need a plane 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.830
 Cover film small screwdriver 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.160
 brush the wood glaze sand paper 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:32.969
 schleif klotz kreppband and possibly 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:36.270
 a grinder and a rag yes 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.730
 to the brush there should possibly 12 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.040
 spend more then you have one 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 nice sensible sturdy brush where 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.550
 the biggest ones can not fail either 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.350
 because it's pretty annoying if you 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.780
 then painted and beautiful I have you 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 then the bristles on the wood have those 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.100
 I now between 4 to we need 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.449
 So paid the worth the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.410
 investment then the glaze wood trial 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.449
 the liter now costs around 10 10 here 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.110
 and that would be paid me there 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.409
 different wood tones margoni guarantee 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.540
 tig would have to choose to look at the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.430
 to create your wood color wood is like that 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.189
 Next, we beat the table 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.689
 I use an excellent one for that 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.340
 Grinder with a 120 paper sheet 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.850
 you have to touch 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.680
 what she uses a leaf for that 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.740
 120 space is already a bit too 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.070
 strong because I have a bit too much wood 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.070
 lose weight 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.409
 but I have to later have a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.410
 grind as always the phase in 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.410
 lank we can see 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.090
 if dirk an excellent blow 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.460
 exercise you could borrow you can 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.710
 her the whole thing synonymous with 1live klotz 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.140
 and sand off some sandpaper 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.900
 the most important thing is that here always 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.500
 along the phase writes pwc see 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.890
 can because of this fulfilled blow with 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.750
 I would write about that 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.250
 Now drag across the phase and me 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.580
 There would not be nice so in ugly 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.870
 ring in wood surface in it and that 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.880
 you will see afterwards that's it 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.560
 not meaningful the pages 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.070
 respectively, and now you can then 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.260
 just whistling with the musician 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.540
 I recommend you then with 80 assen 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.810
 to start paper or 120 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.910
 and then you can easily reach the surface 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.320
 rough you do not have to complete the table 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.370
 beat off as I did 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.020
 main thing coarse paint particles are with 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.090
 the fabric paper has been sanded off 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.410
 then you clean the table I have it 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.030
 here temporarily with the rag the 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.040
 done their course, can also table 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.450
 clean with a brush and a brush 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.310
 or with an increase in his cancellation yes 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.190
 then we also start to take off 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.680
 very important all things that are not from 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.840
 the nature should be painted 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.840
 the tapestry here at this table music 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.550
 6 then give maybe a slide 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.170
 and select the table and the 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.600
 garden furniture so we nothing else 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.709
 bekleckert 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.260
 then we can change the color 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.880
 to open 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.510
 we is very important that the orderly 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.510
 carry out 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.129
 then it can start with the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.280
 paint 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.530
 if you apply the glaze you have to 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.540
 take care that we have the glaze again 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.560
 so apply with the grain back 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.540
 can see here 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.549
 only siemens on the right side that 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.170
 i painted a bit over if 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.659
 it would have been nice to dry it 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.569
 called in there because that again 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.340
 thus has such an extent transversely and 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.970
 Like to do the same now 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.949
 here again 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.370
 see this with the brush again 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.930
 to delete the grain 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.090
 Because the table trends has many slats 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.919
 Of course it's a bit 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:32.520
 Fummelarbeit but the result can be 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:35.729
 then let me see what else I can 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.220
 It can be said that this is natural 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.130
 different tones shades of glaze 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.810
 that means I've got it here now 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.150
 agony that is pretty dark 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.590
 but it does not cover that either 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.110
 one hundred percent because it is one 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.270
 Of course , there is also glaze 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.460
 bright glazes and you should do it 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.889
 maybe right photo of that 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.699
 make furniture and the garden 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.520
 table chairs and furniture pieces that your 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.380
 Compare Baumarkt 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.389
 At the top of the color change are mostly 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.050
 then wood pattern on it and then you can 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:12.599
 you compare that to whether that of 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.870
 the color is identical to yours 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.870
 table 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.970
 so after we layer the first one 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.389
 We applied lightweight 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.060
 see color differences as I said that 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.889
 Complete knowledge too much material 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.410
 decreased but is still 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.120
 bad because we repeat that then 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.270
 Here is the second story looks 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.100
 better again in between 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.800
 between individual layers we should 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.500
 Let it dry for 12 hours 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.660
 Here is the third layer and me 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.000
 I left it at that 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.030
 yes that's it from me again I 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.410
 I'll go all the way 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.539
 I want to have a lot of fun imitating 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.080
 gives the whole thing a craftsman 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.080
 thumbs up
