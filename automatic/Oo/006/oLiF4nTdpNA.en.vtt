00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello everyone I'm at 1,074 1,124 here they 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.210
 I bring a new video to talk about the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.599
 the one that produces the sims 3 adventure the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.000
 island good first of all I'm going to 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.379
 explain to them that it is a lac 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.660
 because there are people who do not know what a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.939
 lac but well I explain it because 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.269
 does not have much to explain either 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.609
 they give a lot of click 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.670
 good in which is this as a few 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.169
 jerks that the game gives us that then the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.960
 game works perfectly 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.969
 but it is not like a leisurely us 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 pause the game and suddenly another 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:44.910
 time to work 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.300
 and this is very annoying or because there 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.300
 many since it has happened to them they see now 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.800
 myself just dallas just me 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.949
 being just paused and has returned me to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.600
 work and it is the problem that gives us the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.050
 game 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.800
 for this resolution they barely have with 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.800
 three solution 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.390
 I do not know if maybe there will be some 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.620
 solution out there to wait for a 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.530
 patch again for 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.950
 to be able to say something 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.770
 to be able to draw conclusions already this way from 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.619
 by sight because I already tell you is a great 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.360
 problem the truth there are no people who 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.430
 It gives very strong where they are 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.820
 constantly stopping the game and I 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.340
 Well, this medium with nothing a few hours ago 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.490
 it may be thinking about the google to do 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.369
 some things and nothing started to give me that 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.619
 the one I'm telling you so annoying and 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.780
 It is what bothers me most about the lac 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.360
 because it would not have to happen 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.220
 exactly the truth I do not understand 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.220
 a lot but but good 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.750
 there are some modes that allow us 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.280
 improve it a bit but people who 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.679
 they say that they have given him more blights 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.259
 then those three modes I'm going to 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.319
 leave in the description of the video 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.459
 one is called no over watch it seems to me that 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:15.629
 it's not seeing that I have it as it's called 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:19.970
 make you ricky be is not Uruguay and do not 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:25.400
 the cap ok these this serve to give 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.900
 to give it then this one as as more 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.230
 as to make it go more fluid 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.319
 game and do not have us so much there to be 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.750
 constantly we are influenced more the 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.450
 game and perhaps solve them problem 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.060
 from here but there are people that even 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.200
 installing these bikes gives you a lot 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.340
 more lacquer 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.650
 so I recommend that they go 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.670
 testing with one and then with another and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.989
 go see it like that because good every 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.209
 computer is a world and it may be that 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.209
 does not fit well with the projects 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.230
 processor and a good processor but 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.510
 I was reading and there are very common mistakes 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.760
 one of them is that this world has 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.940
 created has been created with errors is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.639
 say no to no more to departures and is left 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.079
 everything for more that it is problem of the 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.940
 computer because everyone 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.820
 almost everyone passes 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.410
 the problem that this world is 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.690
 let's be nothing else 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.230
 what was called paradiso island has been 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.940
 created with defects and they are 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.780
 waiting for a new patch 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.920
 to be able to solve it I really do not 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.040
 I can solve it but hopefully what 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.210
 Take out soon to be able then go 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.430
 seeing or not what we can do and then 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.380
 this good see you in the next video 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.960
 and I'll leave your mods there to see if 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.120
 you can improve a bit if you do not 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.890
 uninstall it works once 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.340
 will install or delete the folder 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.350
 pacajes and for this it was good for 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.360
 talk a little about the mods this 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.990
 we see in the next video of the sims 3 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.990
 bye
