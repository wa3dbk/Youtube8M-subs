00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.770
 On the other hand, the stock market 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.780
 for what is the closing of the day 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.240
 On the one hand, the actions of the index 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.340
 merval closed with an average increase in 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.279
 16 percent do you remember that the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.650
 merval is the portfolio that contains what 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.560
 are the most negotiated shares of the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.680
 argentina square in 80% of the wheels 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.260
 of the last 3 months and this in the 80 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.910
 percent of what is represented to 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.380
 through what is the total volume 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.510
 negotiated these are the two conditions 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.480
 that they have to fulfill an option to 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.030
 be part of the merval those actions 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.250
 today they grew on average 1.6 percent 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.629
 the engines were on the one hand what 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.129
 actions are linked to the sector 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.870
 electric power the case of edenor that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.000
 went up more than 5 percent and that has 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 to see obviously with speculation 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.260
 that at some point in government 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.730
 withdraw what are the subsidies to the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.100
 energy and therefore these companies 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.629
 start doing it a little better in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.520
 what it has to do with profitability 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.649
 on the other side we talk about banks 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.840
 also strong rises for the bank 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.620
 macro the french bank this increase 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.540
 of more than 4 percent 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.430
 and it should be noted first that the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.100
 banks have a very good 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.990
 quarter the first quarter what they have 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.720
 closed in what we are were his 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.970
 results in the bag presented 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.040
 have really had a boom on the part 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.690
 of investors by positioning themselves in 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.300
 these assets but after 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.640
 immediately in this what would be the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.100
 next cycle that will close in June 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.110
 of this year well there are some doubts 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.000
 still but for investors without 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.860
 no doubt the balance also goes to 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 come very well and that's why there are those who 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.750
 are positioning in these papers 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.090
 talking about the dollar if there is a closure in 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.830
 10 pesos with 51 cents approximately 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.780
 for what is the blue dollar still 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.850
 practically fixed the official dollar in 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.340
 eight pesos another peso with five cents 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.870
 this for sale and there opens a 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.460
 question about which one can reach 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.500
 be the bank's reaction focused on the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.300
 medium term to the extent that this 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.370
 exchange rate has not been mobilized since 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.160
 January and if the prices of the economy 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.870
 have evolved or have advanced in 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
 function of what inertia is 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.290
 inflationary the central bank today 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.250
 bought 90 million dollars remember 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.720
 you who are in full 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.800
 of liquidation of exports and that 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.170
 therefore in this in this cycle where 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.430
 the liquid agro-export sector 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.070
 a lot of dollars from the central bank 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.570
 you can get to retain a part of 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.840
 they have added more than one billion 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.270
 dollars in April this year and this one there 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.950
 then it opens without any doubt a 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.230
 panorama a little bit more encouraging for 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.730
 the short term but with a question 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.180
 as I just said for what is the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.180
 medium
