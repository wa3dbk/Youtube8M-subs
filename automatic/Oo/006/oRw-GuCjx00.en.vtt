of the Queen I mean I understand what
she<00:02:39.450> did<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.690> mean<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.020> was<00:02:40.140> very<00:02:40.350> basic<00:02:40.709> I've

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
she did I mean it was very basic I've

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.100 
she did I mean it was very basic I've
seen<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.430> before<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.450> mean<00:02:42.750> she<00:02:42.959> was

being manipulated by metalia in the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.000 
being manipulated by metalia in the
background<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.959> she<00:02:46.019> wasn't<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
background so she wasn't really the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.400 
background so she wasn't really the
final<00:02:47.400> boss<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.760> felt<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.180> very<00:02:48.209> funny<00:02:48.810> exactly
