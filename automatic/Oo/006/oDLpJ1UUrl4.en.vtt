00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
never understood any reason why the oya

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.019 
never understood any reason why the oya
ever<00:00:15.660> existed<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.890> I'm<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> backer<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:17.940> I

love the idea of oya but the fact that
it<00:00:21.390> cuts<00:00:21.630> us<00:00:21.779> off<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.380> much<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
me I like what it's trying to do but

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.110 
me I like what it's trying to do but
it's<00:00:31.590> lacking<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.489> two<00:00:32.640> things<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
it's lacking the two things that I

it's lacking the two things that I
really<00:00:33.600> wanted<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.380> which<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.680> more

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
really wanted to have which is more

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.670 
really wanted to have which is more
powerful<00:00:35.399> hardware<00:00:36.270> than<00:00:36.989> other<00:00:37.200> Android

powerful hardware than other Android

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.220 
powerful hardware than other Android
devices<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:40.730> more<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.270> same<00:00:42.480> access<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
devices have and if anyone could

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.380

possibly<00:00:50.719> fix<00:00:51.719> those<00:00:52.620> two<00:00:53.219> problems<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
possibly fix those two problems that I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.060 
possibly fix those two problems that I
happened<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.050> dog<00:00:55.260> growling<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
happened that's my dog growling in the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.229 
happened that's my dog growling in the
background<00:00:56.489> um<00:00:57.079> I<00:00:58.079> think<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.500> would<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.620> Google

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
background um I think it would be Google

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.619 
background um I think it would be Google
especially<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.559> there<00:01:01.559> seems<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> move

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
especially with there seems to be a move

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.750 
especially with there seems to be a move
for<00:01:03.629> Android<00:01:04.080> armful<00:01:04.739> laptops<00:01:05.189> coming<00:01:05.430> with

for Android armful laptops coming with

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
Intel pushing that like there could

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.969 
Intel pushing that like there could
possibly<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.000> console<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.290> c-type

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
possibly be a console with a c-type

possibly be a console with a c-type
specs<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.700> believe<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> Kickstarter<00:01:13.049> like

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320

with<00:02:19.620> an<00:02:20.510> external<00:02:21.510> power<00:02:21.690> supply<00:02:23.960> which

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
with an external power supply which

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.810 
with an external power supply which
sounds<00:02:25.410> strange<00:02:25.770> because<00:02:25.920> most<00:02:26.370> media

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
sounds strange because most media

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.090 
sounds strange because most media
players<00:02:27.150> don't<00:02:27.720> require<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.680> much<00:02:28.740> power

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
players don't require that much power

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.300 
players don't require that much power
but<00:02:29.490> there<00:02:30.480> are<00:02:30.540> also<00:02:30.660> some<00:02:31.170> rumors<00:02:31.710> going

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
but there are also some rumors going

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.980 
but there are also some rumors going
around<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:34.200> an<00:02:34.500> android<00:02:34.950> console<00:02:35.990> so

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
around now of an android console so

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.630 
around now of an android console so
these<00:02:37.200> two<00:02:37.380> devices<00:02:37.590> could<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.190> separate

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
these two devices could be separate

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.130 
these two devices could be separate
devices<00:02:38.880> but<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.390> much<00:02:39.540> more<00:02:39.750> likely<00:02:39.810> that

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
devices but it's much more likely that

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.670 
devices but it's much more likely that
this<00:02:40.530> could<00:02:40.800> be<00:02:40.920> one<00:02:41.190> device<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:42.500> it's<00:02:43.500> a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
this could be one device and it's a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.360 
this could be one device and it's a
media<00:02:44.030> player<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.930> also<00:02:46.440> comes<00:02:46.710> with<00:02:46.920> a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
media player that also comes with a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.430 
media player that also comes with a
controller<00:02:47.730> maybe<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.080> just<00:02:49.110> my<00:02:49.380> guess

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
controller maybe this is just my guess

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.620 
controller maybe this is just my guess
and<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.810> would<00:02:51.930> be<00:02:51.960> like<00:02:52.170> Google<00:02:52.590> TV<00:02:53.630> plus

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
and it would be like Google TV plus

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.550 
and it would be like Google TV plus
gaming<00:02:56.660> that's<00:02:57.660> all<00:02:57.810> exciting<00:02:58.200> me<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.440> I

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
gaming that's all exciting me like I

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.840 
gaming that's all exciting me like I
think<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.100> something<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.610> they

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
think that this is something that they

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.910 
think that this is something that they
always<00:03:00.300> should<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.720> been<00:03:00.840> looking<00:03:01.440> at<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.860> I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
always should have been looking at and I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.560 
always should have been looking at and I
always<00:03:02.160> hope<00:03:02.490> they<00:03:02.760> were<00:03:02.820> looking<00:03:03.000> at<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.420> but

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
always hope they were looking at it but

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.650 
always hope they were looking at it but
at<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.200> same<00:03:04.410> time<00:03:05.300> google<00:03:06.300> has<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.570> many

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
at the same time google has so many

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.150 
at the same time google has so many
projects<00:03:07.110> going<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.710> don't<00:03:07.950> really

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
projects going that you don't really

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.330 
projects going that you don't really
know<00:03:08.550> what's<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> works<00:03:10.710> for<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.070> future

physical markets in the future you know
outside<00:03:19.200> software<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:20.010> search<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:22.770> CEO

outside software in search and the CEO

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.460 
outside software in search and the CEO
of<00:03:23.220> Google<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.640> completely<00:03:24.330> completely<00:03:25.080> gave

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
of Google is completely completely gave

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.110 
of Google is completely completely gave
him<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.740> political<00:03:26.220> answer<00:03:26.550> like<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.790> politician

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
him a political answer like a politician

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.600 
him a political answer like a politician
ignored<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.410> completely<00:03:29.100> um<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.400> think

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
ignored that completely um but I think

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.340 
ignored that completely um but I think
this<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:32.880> something<00:03:33.210> where<00:03:33.750> they<00:03:33.900> definitely

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
this is something where they definitely

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.050 
this is something where they definitely
need<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.710> enter<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.190> place<00:03:35.490> where<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.760> always

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
need to enter a place where I always

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.210 
need to enter a place where I always
thought<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.420> Apple<00:03:36.810> would<00:03:36.930> enter<00:03:37.230> but<00:03:38.070> they

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
thought the Apple would enter but they

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.890 
thought the Apple would enter but they
kind<00:03:38.490> of<00:03:38.550> did<00:03:38.730> enter<00:03:39.060> with<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.330> iPad<00:03:39.720> like

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
kind of did enter with the iPad like

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.900 
kind of did enter with the iPad like
they've<00:03:40.110> just<00:03:40.380> tried<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:41.010> take<00:03:41.220> over<00:03:41.370> gaming

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
they've just tried to take over gaming

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.220 
they've just tried to take over gaming
with<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.120> devices<00:03:42.630> they<00:03:42.810> already<00:03:42.960> having

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
with the devices they already having

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.620 
with the devices they already having
they're<00:03:43.260> doing<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.680> great<00:03:43.950> job<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.640> maybe<00:03:45.390> they

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
they're doing a great job so maybe they

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.360 
they're doing a great job so maybe they
don't<00:03:45.780> need<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.320> enter<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.800> council<00:03:47.130> space

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
don't need to enter the council space

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.550 
don't need to enter the council space
but<00:03:48.150> what's<00:03:48.300> really<00:03:48.480> interesting<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.990> me<00:03:49.170> kind

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
but what's really interesting to me kind

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.550 
but what's really interesting to me kind
of<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:50.040> if<00:03:50.520> Google<00:03:51.060> does<00:03:51.390> enter<00:03:51.840> will<00:03:52.050> Apple

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
of is if Google does enter will Apple

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.230 
of is if Google does enter will Apple
feel<00:03:52.770> forced<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.250> enter<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.790> what<00:03:54.000> would<00:03:54.210> that

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
feel forced to enter and what would that

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.710 
feel forced to enter and what would that
mean<00:03:54.660> because<00:03:55.700> Apple<00:03:56.700> could<00:03:56.790> build<00:03:57.240> a<00:03:57.450> really

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
mean because Apple could build a really

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.110 
mean because Apple could build a really
amazing<00:03:58.260> console<00:03:58.920> get<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.160> lot<00:03:59.460> of<00:03:59.490> customers

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
amazing console get a lot of customers

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.110 
amazing console get a lot of customers
and<00:04:00.480> bring<00:04:01.260> gaming<00:04:01.680> back<00:04:01.920> at<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.700> same<00:04:02.910> time

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
and bring gaming back at the same time

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.930 
and bring gaming back at the same time
that<00:04:03.300> kind<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.600> feels<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.990> step<00:04:04.200> backwards

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
that kind of feels like a step backwards

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.470 
that kind of feels like a step backwards
so<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:08.010> yeah<00:04:08.160> I've<00:04:08.340> always<00:04:08.490> always<00:04:08.790> discussed

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
so so yeah I've always always discussed

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.780 
so so yeah I've always always discussed

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
and people always shoot it down

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.800 
and people always shoot it down
immediately<00:04:17.370> say<00:04:18.239> it's<00:04:18.420> never<00:04:18.570> gonna<00:04:18.720> happen

don't<00:04:23.100> know<00:04:23.250> why<00:04:23.430> that's<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:24.060> ridiculous<00:04:24.270> but

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
don't know why that's a ridiculous but

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.080

what do you guys think like do you guys
because<00:04:27.090> one

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
because one

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.230 
because one
council<00:04:27.830> from<00:04:27.980> google<00:04:28.280> would<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.060> buy<00:04:29.210> a

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
council from google would you buy a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.000 
council from google would you buy a
console<00:04:29.690> from<00:04:29.840> google<00:04:30.170> are<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.710> excited

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
console from google are you excited

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.980 
console from google are you excited
about<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.580> console<00:04:32.030> from<00:04:32.150> google<00:04:32.450> do<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:32.750> think

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
about a console from google do you think

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.750 
about a console from google do you think
it's<00:04:33.139> probable<00:04:33.680> possible<00:04:34.550> um<00:04:36.250> because<00:04:37.250> I

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
it's probable possible um because I

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.960 
it's probable possible um because I
don't<00:04:38.510> tend<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.380> think<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:40.250> same<00:04:40.280> way<00:04:40.520> that

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
don't tend to think the same way that

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.220 
don't tend to think the same way that
most<00:04:41.150> consumers<00:04:41.540> think<00:04:42.169> but<00:04:43.780> when<00:04:44.780> i<00:04:44.810> see<00:04:45.200> a

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
most consumers think but when i see a

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.060 
most consumers think but when i see a
market<00:04:45.740> like<00:04:46.300> like<00:04:47.300> mobile<00:04:47.630> wireless<00:04:48.350> service

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
market like like mobile wireless service

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.909 
market like like mobile wireless service
and<00:04:49.720> cable<00:04:50.720> like<00:04:50.900> those<00:04:51.139> were<00:04:51.320> markets<00:04:51.740> that

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
and cable like those were markets that

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.040 
and cable like those were markets that
I've<00:04:52.160> always<00:04:52.490> always<00:04:53.000> wanted<00:04:53.690> Google<00:04:53.960> to

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
I've always always wanted Google to

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.379 
I've always always wanted Google to
enter<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:55.610> always<00:04:55.820> said<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.180> eventually

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
enter and I always said that eventually

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.240 
enter and I always said that eventually
they<00:04:56.900> would<00:04:57.080> enter<00:04:57.380> those<00:04:57.500> markets<00:04:58.040> and

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
they would enter those markets and

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.820 
they would enter those markets and
everybody<00:04:58.790> said<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.030> was<00:04:59.210> crazy<00:04:59.389> and<00:04:59.930> they

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
everybody said I was crazy and they

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.550 
everybody said I was crazy and they
haven't<00:05:01.190> entered<00:05:01.490> wireless<00:05:02.030> obviously<00:05:02.630> but

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
haven't entered wireless obviously but

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.230 
haven't entered wireless obviously but
they're<00:05:03.710> definitely<00:05:03.830> getting<00:05:04.310> into<00:05:04.669> cable

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
they're definitely getting into cable

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.130 
they're definitely getting into cable
and<00:05:05.540> television<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:07.810> people<00:05:08.810> seem<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.050> think

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
and television and people seem to think

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.020 
and television and people seem to think
that<00:05:09.350> just<00:05:09.470> because<00:05:09.890> Google<00:05:10.370> is<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.580> software

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
that just because Google is a software

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.580 
that just because Google is a software
giant<00:05:11.540> that<00:05:11.660> they're<00:05:11.930> never<00:05:12.200> going<00:05:12.500> to

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
giant that they're never going to

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.630 
giant that they're never going to
introduce<00:05:12.830> these<00:05:13.370> physical<00:05:13.940> spaces<00:05:15.130> but<00:05:16.130> they

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
introduce these physical spaces but they

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.280 
introduce these physical spaces but they
can't<00:05:16.910> be<00:05:17.120> searched<00:05:17.390> forever<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:19.690> I<00:05:20.690> don't<00:05:21.050> I

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
can't be searched forever and I don't I

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.360 
can't be searched forever and I don't I
don't<00:05:21.830> see<00:05:22.220> any<00:05:22.430> market<00:05:23.090> where<00:05:23.960> Google<00:05:24.410> can't

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
don't see any market where Google can't

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.760 
don't see any market where Google can't
potentially<00:05:25.910> be<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.030> player<00:05:26.560> because<00:05:27.560> of<00:05:27.680> the

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
potentially be a player because of the

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.050 
potentially be a player because of the
power<00:05:27.950> behind<00:05:28.220> them<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:31.580> think<00:05:31.850> that<00:05:31.970> if

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
power behind them and I think that if

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.760 
power behind them and I think that if
you<00:05:32.150> look<00:05:32.330> around<00:05:32.479> you<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:33.229> find<00:05:33.500> any

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
you look around you and you find any

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.370 
you look around you and you find any
really<00:05:34.340> large<00:05:34.640> monopolies<00:05:35.360> like<00:05:36.020> that's<00:05:36.260> a

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
really large monopolies like that's a

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.690 
really large monopolies like that's a
place<00:05:36.590> where<00:05:36.770> Google<00:05:37.100> maybe<00:05:37.490> in<00:05:37.669> 10<00:05:37.850> years

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
place where Google maybe in 10 years

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.190 
place where Google maybe in 10 years
minus<00:05:40.700> probably<00:05:41.570> like<00:05:42.160> beer<00:05:43.160> production<00:05:44.200> but

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
minus probably like beer production but

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.409 
minus probably like beer production but
