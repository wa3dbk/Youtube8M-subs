the<00:01:45.440> object<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:45.920> want<00:01:46.130> for<00:01:46.550> each<00:01:46.580> hand

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.120 

let's<00:01:55.420> see<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.750> multiple<00:01:56.170> possibilities<00:01:56.650> you

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
let's see the multiple possibilities you

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.510 
let's see the multiple possibilities you
can<00:01:57.159> do<00:01:57.460> with<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.700> single<00:01:58.119> object<00:01:59.430> with<00:02:00.430> the

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
can do with a single object with the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:10.010 
can do with a single object with the
bottle<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:00.970> fuel<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.509> can<00:02:01.869> create<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.170> trail

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.940 

then<00:02:10.650> with<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> lighter<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.910> set<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.450> fire

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.910 

I<00:02:24.269> can<00:02:25.269> also<00:02:25.450> use<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.959> same<00:02:26.230> bottle<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:26.890> a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
I can also use the same bottle with a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.670 
I can also use the same bottle with a
gun

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.030 

I<00:02:32.739> can<00:02:33.430> aim<00:02:33.670> launch<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.900> shoot<00:02:35.409> it<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.739> create

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
I can aim launch and shoot it to create

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.800 
I can aim launch and shoot it to create
a<00:02:36.069> bomb<00:02:41.159> let's<00:02:42.159> now<00:02:42.370> see<00:02:42.640> how<00:02:42.879> this<00:02:43.060> applies<00:02:43.420> to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
a bomb let's now see how this applies to

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.500 
a bomb let's now see how this applies to
situations<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.769> basic<00:02:45.129> enemies<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.760> see<00:02:46.299> how

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
situations and basic enemies and see how

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.110 
situations and basic enemies and see how
the<00:02:46.569> AI<00:02:46.840> reacts<00:02:47.469> to<00:02:47.709> your<00:02:47.799> actions<00:02:50.939> since<00:02:51.939> I'm

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
the AI reacts to your actions since I'm

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.910 
the AI reacts to your actions since I'm
in<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.329> dark<00:02:52.540> corridor<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.260> can<00:02:53.500> use<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> light

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
in a dark corridor I can use a light

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.979 
in a dark corridor I can use a light
stick<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.459> light<00:02:54.609> my<00:02:54.760> way<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.780> light<00:03:01.959> has

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
stick to light my way the light has

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.410 
stick to light my way the light has
attracted<00:03:02.739> some<00:03:02.889> enemies<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.969> I'll<00:03:04.090> shoot<00:03:04.329> a

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
attracted some enemies so I'll shoot a

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.750 
attracted some enemies so I'll shoot a
dead<00:03:04.629> body<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.169> create<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.500> pool<00:03:05.739> of<00:03:05.769> blood<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
dead body to create a pool of blood to

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.970 
dead body to create a pool of blood to
divert<00:03:07.180> their<00:03:07.389> attention<00:03:07.419> from<00:03:08.139> me<00:03:10.799> if<00:03:11.799> you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
divert their attention from me if you

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.979 
divert their attention from me if you
need<00:03:12.129> more<00:03:12.280> light<00:03:12.579> in<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:12.939> area<00:03:13.329> you<00:03:13.599> can<00:03:13.810> put

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
need more light in the area you can put

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.870 
need more light in the area you can put
some<00:03:14.169> sticky<00:03:14.439> tape<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.010> light<00:03:15.280> stick

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.220 

and<00:03:21.720> then<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.560> can<00:03:22.740> aim<00:03:22.950> for<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.310> ceiling

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.390 

let's<00:03:28.230> now<00:03:28.380> play<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> bit<00:03:28.860> with<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.070> enemies

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
let's now play a bit with the enemies

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.310 
let's now play a bit with the enemies
let's<00:03:29.700> say<00:03:29.880> we<00:03:30.060> take<00:03:30.240> some<00:03:30.450> sticky<00:03:30.780> tape<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.260> a

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
let's say we take some sticky tape and a

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:41.570 
let's say we take some sticky tape and a
flare<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.920> aim<00:03:32.670> at<00:03:32.820> one<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> creatures<00:03:40.580> it

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
flare and aim at one of the creatures it
