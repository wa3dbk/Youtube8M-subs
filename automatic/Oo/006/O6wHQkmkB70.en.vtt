00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.530
 A) Yes 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.270
 or small or small very good at all 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.280
 vaquitas and welcome to the construction 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.440
 of a new aquatic troll house for 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.570
 sky war or before you start with the video 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.680
 ok I want you to try to leave a 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.020
 hand up because it's going to be very 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.720
 complicated to make a house and apart 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 with water and break the ground and good 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.160
 a person is going to detach for 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.330
 down and it's going to sting, that's the issue 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.590
 from the trap of today, well, you're going to 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.150
 need wool too, that's why I 've 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.280
 stuck on the map of asia because it looks is 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.559
 full of wool and you have to make carpets 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.030
 because they are the most troll I've seen in 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.949
 my life is going slow I'm going to catch it already 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.690
 here and good we are going to try that for 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.120
 that the challenge is met a person 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.310
 It must be chopped yes or yes, it is worth it if I win 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.930
 I do not win because that already in principle gives me 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.390
 same because what I'm focused here 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.000
 is that someone in the trap 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.830
 ok let's go island because it 's me 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 it's disgusting and literally let's go we 're not going 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.580
 go to that one there that is furthest away 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.020
 it's more isolated so I can do the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.580
 trap completely and good you have to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.409
 build a house will not take long 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.420
 neither because I can not take long 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.930
 but I'm going to try to get everything right 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.370
 ok and that the one who bites I send him a 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.140
 I greet your mom 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.150
 and tonight he stayed with her as I do 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.100
 with all moms or no names 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.690
 Poor little moms, let's go for 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.120
 that first thing is that it is as it does 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.160
 here to see if I can give you a little bit of 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.100
 milk is worth only a little bit of an udder 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.480
 I have four, one is for the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.510
 small that is a bit breaded that 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.990
 you're doing with the chest is that I'm going to 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.910
 a little like that or without scholarships nothing happens 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 everything will be fine, small vouchers come 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.680
 see you in heaven 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.060
 oh yeah okay I'll take what I can and 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.920
 we 're going to go to the island I'm going to 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.470
 do everything a bit fast because it's that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.970
 if they are not going to attack me, it is worth 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.550
 intention is to make the house troll and that 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.430
 one pique I want to go home to see if the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.180
 Uncle elongates to see valera to take this 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.650
 they have not given me keys or I would swear that 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.540
 They have to give me a key to the uncle 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.120
 I understand it is worth going to there now 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.940
 that are for worth when it arrives what 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.640
 I do is make some posters that go to 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.610
 hold the carpets 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.950
 and build the house around is going to be 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.900
 a little house not too big 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.280
 because it does not give us time look at let's 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.410
 throw it we throw it we throw it small 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.130
 what happens to you with the water the little one does not 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.860
 I shit in the milk good it does not matter 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.690
 to see if it goes and what I'm going to do is 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.670
 let's go let's build the house let's 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.650
 to focus on the troll house because yes 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.480
 no then we do not have time and they are left 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.650
 five people only or it's just 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.489
 start the game and nothing left to see not 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.350
 there has to be something around here not me 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.120
 Say good, it does not matter, I have everything 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.920
 I need water is water is super 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.930
 important that's why I've chosen the kit 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.560
 troll because only one cube comes 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.209
 of water and it is very important we are going to 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.459
 build the base vale we go 2 for the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.540
 right 2 for the left and we roll 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.980
 all this so that it stays 3 x 2 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.370
 because now we're going to place the 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.769
 posters then let's make a table 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.810
 what a milk to see the uncle I know I do not 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.910
 bother let's make the table we're going to 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.370
 build some posters with six we have 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.480
 enough vale 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.150
 then we make a few sticks and with 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.819
 six you can create this trap because a 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.099
 floor of six is ​​perfect is worth more 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.620
 big is not going to break all the ground and 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.659
 it's worse to have three here and three times 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.170
 here it's worth it with this we have 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:53.020
 enough let's put them 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.050
 and they are going to go because it would be one here and another 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.670
 here good here I will place the wool 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.790
 pink because what I want is a little 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.200
 disguise the trap let's throw it 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.400
 let's throw the ones that will come to me and what 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.690
 I'm seeing that it's going to burst 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.450
 little little 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.850
 u and there's no way here what I'm going to 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.410
 place is a pink block to disguise 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.990
 a little the trap with the carpet to 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.820
 which merges then I'll catch here 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.130
 a couple of blocks with two or three I'm worth 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.740
 more than anything because they do not smell it 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.420
 is to be camouflaged with the carpet and 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.849
 nothing happens then it's worth to see 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.129
 place a small path here 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.770
 and now we can put wood or 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.089
 from here already so that they enter with 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.520
 what is wood there is no problem 

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:41.860
 we are going to place three posters here that 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.729
 they are going to hold the carpet and three others 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.789
 posters here shit okay I lost a 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.209
 poster voucher see do not happen to have everything 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.699
 are the clubs worth I'm going to make another 

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:56.439
 poster because it is that if I do not I can not 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.479
 put here worth it worth so let's go to 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:02.020
 place the carpet on top of 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.509
 posters so they stay floating 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.129
 It's worth it this way because nobody is going 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.809
 to know you will not see it because you barely 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.849
 go then you can now go through 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:12.459
 here over there is no problem but when 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.559
 you loose water on the carpets 

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:15.849
 what happens is that this one here 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:18.879
 flooded that's why it's called the house 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.240
 aquatic care carefully that in the end the 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.009
 silly that throws me down 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.360
 Now what we have left is to build 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.979
 the house you can do the one of any 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.960
 type how much you wool and better also you 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.650
 I say it is worth it but that it is in house plan 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.020
 so that he sees that you are in your house and 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.759
 what do you want to be attacked then 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.400
 let's make stone that I've never 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.810
 I actually think it is nice hear it 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.340
 let's place that a couple of windows and 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.449
 everything is for you to see that happen to me 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:49.139
 things are worth ah yes or yes or yes and what 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:51.930
 houses worth 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.300
 perfect or if it's worth it's perfect 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.400
 it's good and now we're going to make a 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.220
 bridge to the other side will come by 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.290
 here obviously there is a ceiling 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.470
 because now I'm going to explain a trick 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:09.040
 so they do not go inside your house 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.170
 your island it is put here as a 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.080
 see the table here we are going to make slabs of 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.030
 stone for example 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.639
 so that it is still more effective 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.680
 troll house we do like this then you 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.390
 when you come here, the only thing 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.100
 we are going to have to do 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.080
 well let's make the bridge when 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.180
 come here, it's going to come like 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.530
 crazy to kill you the only thing you're going to 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.430
 have to do is put up a 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.740
 block and ready ok we already do well hop 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.060
 I put it on and let the water down 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.530
 to take care that comes that comes 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.060
 it comes that it comes so small small 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.340
 quiet wait wait because this 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.170
 it's not ready yet it 's good if it's ready 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.630
 ok let's hope it comes alone 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.580
 wait it's worth when it comes up 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.040
 on the roof we throw the water and it is that 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.270
 the water will move the entire carpet to 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.070
 see small see here that this is not a 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.040
 trolley house nothing small do not be 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:58.050
 subscribers of the types well look at that 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.330

 the down a greeting to your mom or yes 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.650
 It's worth as you can see, this is 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.860
 awesome I'm a subscriber 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.330
 it's quite simple and to restart it is 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.620
 super simple also because it is to place 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.810
 here again the carpet to the yes 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.520
 and they have it ready again 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.860
 any sky wear map that you have 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.630

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:29.600
 because it 's that the uncle is going 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.520
 with full diamond and does not want to attack me 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.810
 I went for him and he attacks or I left 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.160
 running but I know this guy is not going to 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.979
