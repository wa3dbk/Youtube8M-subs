00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.230 
about 15 miles up and it switchbacks a
lot<00:01:44.290> of<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.470> time<00:01:44.650> it's<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.550> little<00:01:45.790> technical

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
lot of the time it's a little technical

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.000 
lot of the time it's a little technical
but<00:01:46.360> it's<00:01:46.480> not<00:01:46.630> fast<00:01:46.930> i<00:01:47.140> mean<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.320> speed<00:01:47.770> limit

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
but it's not fast i mean the speed limit

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.980 
but it's not fast i mean the speed limit
is<00:01:48.100> no<00:01:48.670> more<00:01:48.910> than<00:01:49.030> 20<00:01:49.390> miles<00:01:49.540> an<00:01:49.720> hour<00:01:49.780> at<00:01:49.960> most

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
is no more than 20 miles an hour at most

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.630 
is no more than 20 miles an hour at most
places<00:01:50.260> so<00:01:50.650> so<00:01:51.160> you're<00:01:51.310> not<00:01:51.370> going<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.580> be

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
places so so you're not going to be

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.740 
places so so you're not going to be
burning<00:01:51.910> through<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.120> turns<00:01:52.450> but<00:01:52.630> this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
burning through the turns but this

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.270 
burning through the turns but this
really<00:01:52.900> isn't<00:01:53.080> about<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.500> it's<00:01:53.620> it's<00:01:54.070> more

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
really isn't about that it's it's more

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.620 
really isn't about that it's it's more
about<00:01:54.370> just<00:01:54.460> getting<00:01:54.700> out<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.060> exploring<00:01:55.270> the

when<00:02:06.100> we<00:02:06.220> were<00:02:06.369> coming<00:02:07.090> out<00:02:07.299> of<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.450> four

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
when we were coming out of the four

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
corners monument probably about halfway

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.100 
corners monument probably about halfway
between<00:02:09.640> there<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.090> Mesa<00:02:10.300> Verde<00:02:10.750> where<00:02:10.869> I

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
between there and Mesa Verde where I

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.410 
between there and Mesa Verde where I

finally just like yeah I found myself in

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.000 
finally just like yeah I found myself in
that<00:02:13.510> zone<00:02:13.810> where<00:02:14.110> you're<00:02:14.530> not<00:02:14.709> aware<00:02:14.950> of
