00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.160
 no 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.540
 we will make the dough always base let's go 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.110
 to see how you can use the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.110
 brewer's yeast 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.400
 usually the universal formula for 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.550
 preparing a biga is definitely a must 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.629
 spend 18 24 hours of fermentation of 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.610
 leavened 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.100
 so if it is usually calculated on 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.200
 flour amount one percent of 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.059
 brewer's yeast then on 500 grams 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.090
 I will go to put 5 grams of yeast of 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.150
 beer like you wrote there and 50 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.280
 percent of water dough 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.020
 preferably here I recommend it if 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.880
 that is, of the car because it is very hard 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.460
 the dough is therefore very good 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.990
 compromise to get a good bread myself 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.360
 today I made baguettes 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.590
 but if this house gave him a more form 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.090
 gross 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.399
 you can make us a strand ok so a 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.410
 this matured ready chariot I have to 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.850
 add other ingredients and then 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.009
 I'm going to add more flour 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.780
 I'm always going to add a 50 for 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.119
 one hundred of the weight of the biga's flour 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.280
 initial in new flour so if I have 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.759
 made from 500 grams as you see on the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.880
 his pantry goes to add 250 grams 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.509
 the next day ok and I get a good one 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.119
 result 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.610
 the classic crunchy baguette effect 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.789
 outside and soft inside crumbly 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.670
 this is a pasta that has limited 24 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.800
 at 18 24 and therefore it is more digestible and 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.520
 i get this mass here you see how it is 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.920
 beautiful smooth light now I go to 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.920
 form the baguette 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.130
 I always advise you to take advantage of it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.040
 the smooth part of the dough as 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:19.500
 so starting to smooth result ok le 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.840
 couples who have butter cream at 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.730
 softened butter they go to do with the various 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.540
 country reliefs you sweet that recipe 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.950
 that you have 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.270
 I'm going to put sugar in the flour 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.270
 now dissolve the yeast in the water 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.600
 then the water with the yeast inside 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.300
 flour is a very soft dough 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.010
 because then it helps me to soften 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.140
 the dough is butter which is a good one 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.990
 presence is 100 grams those that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.120
 you have ok here you have to knead you don't have 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.980
 fear 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.980
 I'm going to make this move 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.700
 dulcis in fundo the bread is faster for 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.310
 excellence let's use yeast 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.980
 chemist you have to take that for 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.590
 for wraps or pizzas or in any case dough 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.170
 salty not the vanilla one I can 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.150
 quietly knead everything together 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.260
 all ingredients together because this 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.660
 is a yeast that develops volume a 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.150
 close contact with heat or a 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.130
 Once all the ingredients have been mixed 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.840
 I put it in the fridge because 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.580
 the dough, however, must rest 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.610
 there is a good quantity of fat 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.050
 of grease that will harden will always last 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.269
 this cold helps me to stretch out 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.269
 the dough without using too much flour 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.310
 what we feel is
