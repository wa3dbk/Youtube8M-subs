00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.950
 just as you are I get along and well 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.480
 Here I am going to teach you a bit to use the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.099
 drill because I know so many of you 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.780
 that you do not know how to use that you have 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.240
 said by twitter I did not know until 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 that I realized how good it was with the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.839
 left joystick goes with the one of the l 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.850
 with the one that puts you and uses it worth you have 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.640
 that keeping it just a little is only worth a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.340
 twitch forward alone and while 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.470
 you keep the r2 to get it worth as 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.380
 you see if we keep it little by little 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.029
 it's going to be getting worth and when it's when 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 you listen and it's worth the hammer 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.440
 is drilling, you are going to see that 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.480
 It's the little circle that goes around there, good 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.760
 That is the stick that turns there that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.530
 is advancing on the yellow then 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.629
 you will see that it is getting closer and closer and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
 approaching above is worth and as you can see 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.219
 it will go little by little when 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.960
 You see that when you stop listening to the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.719
 sound of the drill in the game then 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.690
 you will see that it does not advance, and as you can see 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.510
 you give very very strong what will happen 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.250
 it will be that 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.019
 that will overheat and you will have to 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.640
 stop is also a very easy way 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.019
 to know if you are advancing is if you see 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.489
 spark is worth if you see sparks is that 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.860
 as you are to see here drilling 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.540
 we are advancing little by little so nothing 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.009
 guys basically this if you have any 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.899
 doubt leave it down here because 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.520
 basically is this keep with the 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.409
 joystick that asks you and a tad towards 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.670
 go ahead at the beginning and then you go 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.920
 putting a little bit and a little bit more 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.240
 always keeping the r2 and as you see 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.640
 when it goes on heating up the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.380
 hammer you just release r2 and you're 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.509
 will put black instead of red that 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 it's like it gets so nothing kids you 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.530
 I leave the rest of the video the truth 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.920
 which is a fairly easy way it's worth and 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.950
 simple to explain so nothing guys 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.069
 this is achieved worth this is in the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.530
 second robbery is worth and he will ask you to use 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.810
 this is worth the second heist and good 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.549
 in case you do not know how to use it and that then 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.289
 you have the video explaining the vouchers and 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.149
 you know if you pass it on to you 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.850
 friends and there's help if you equal 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.350
 it also helps and if you comment if you give it 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.179
