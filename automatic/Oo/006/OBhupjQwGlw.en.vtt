click icon big symbol in this piece you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.160 
click icon big symbol in this piece you
have<00:03:07.730> that<00:03:08.000> balanced<00:03:08.480> out<00:03:08.569> with<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.840> skulls

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
have that balanced out with the skulls

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.920 
have that balanced out with the skulls
and<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.770> death<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.510> striving<00:03:11.510> for<00:03:11.750> money

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
and all that and I think that makes it a

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.949 
and all that and I think that makes it a
nice<00:03:13.580> when<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.150> look<00:03:14.330> at<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.510> entire<00:03:14.690> piece

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
nice when you look at the entire piece

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.040 
nice when you look at the entire piece
that<00:03:15.739> makes<00:03:15.770> it<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.099> nice<00:03:16.250> balance<00:03:16.870> doing<00:03:17.870> drag

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
that makes it a nice balance doing drag

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.570 
that makes it a nice balance doing drag
is<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.650> little<00:03:18.920> bit<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.130> bitch<00:03:19.280> because<00:03:19.400> you

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
is a little bit of a bitch because you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.860 
is a little bit of a bitch because you
guys<00:03:19.670> sit<00:03:19.910> down<00:03:20.060> do<00:03:20.180> these<00:03:20.300> scales<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.810> all

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
guys sit down do these scales and all

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.050 
guys sit down do these scales and all
this<00:03:20.959> nonsense<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.650> we<00:03:22.010> try<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.580> was<00:03:22.819> pressed

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
this nonsense and we try I was pressed

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.309 
this nonsense and we try I was pressed
for<00:03:23.209> time<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.660> was<00:03:23.720> like<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:23.959> know<00:03:24.080> I<00:03:24.110> don't

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
for time and I was like you know I don't

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.199 
for time and I was like you know I don't
know<00:03:24.500> how<00:03:24.620> we're<00:03:24.680> gonna<00:03:24.800> do<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.090> was

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
know how we're gonna do this so it was

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.180 
know how we're gonna do this so it was
difficult<00:03:26.390> we<00:03:27.110> did<00:03:27.290> enough<00:03:27.530> detail<00:03:27.950> to

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
difficult we did enough detail to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.430 
difficult we did enough detail to
represent<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.090> dragons<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:29.959> we<00:03:30.050> kept<00:03:30.290> it

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
represent the dragons but we kept it

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.350 
represent the dragons but we kept it
loose<00:03:30.620> enough<00:03:30.920> where<00:03:31.400> we<00:03:31.430> didn't<00:03:31.760> tie

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
loose enough where we didn't tie

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.300 
loose enough where we didn't tie
ourselves<00:03:32.510> down<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.709> know<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:33.860> like<00:03:34.130> one

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
ourselves down you know to like one

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.759 
ourselves down you know to like one
specific<00:03:34.790> part<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.360> i<00:03:35.660> think<00:03:35.900> that's<00:03:36.290> that's

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
specific part and i think that's that's

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.309 
specific part and i think that's that's
a<00:03:36.950> nice<00:03:37.130> way<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.400> kind<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.880> like<00:03:38.030> giving<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.810> a

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
a nice way of kind of like giving the a

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.559 
a nice way of kind of like giving the a
little<00:03:40.220> bit<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.400> like<00:03:40.580> an<00:03:40.730> indication<00:03:41.209> of<00:03:41.390> like

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
little bit of like an indication of like

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.770 
little bit of like an indication of like
the<00:03:41.690> subways<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:42.319> feel<00:03:42.500> like<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:43.190> Dragons<00:03:43.780> you

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
the subways I feel like the Dragons you

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.720 
the subways I feel like the Dragons you
know<00:03:44.900> running<00:03:45.260> through<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:46.010> bottom<00:03:46.400> that

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
know running through the bottom that

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.979 
know running through the bottom that
kind<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.030> like<00:03:47.120> going<00:03:47.390> through<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.630> bottom<00:03:47.870> of

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
kind of like going through the bottom of

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.390 
kind of like going through the bottom of
the<00:03:48.049> mural<00:03:48.350> kind<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.860> way<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.010> subways

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
the mural kind of the way the subways

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.550 
the mural kind of the way the subways
run<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.790> bottom<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.299> city<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.930> think

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
run to the bottom of the city I think

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.900 
run to the bottom of the city I think
that<00:03:51.709> was<00:03:51.860> like<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> pretty<00:03:52.250> big<00:03:52.430> piece<00:03:52.640> there

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
that was like a pretty big piece there

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.160 
that was like a pretty big piece there
in<00:03:53.540> our<00:03:53.720> nice<00:03:53.900> element<00:03:54.410> this<00:03:55.130> is<00:03:55.280> crazy
