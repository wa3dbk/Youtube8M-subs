00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
is one more magic tree all the way back

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.130 
is one more magic tree all the way back
here<00:06:08.400> now<00:06:09.400> there<00:06:09.850> are<00:06:10.030> probably<00:06:10.480> other<00:06:10.780> trees

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
here now there are probably other trees

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.890 
here now there are probably other trees
around<00:06:11.170> here<00:06:11.530> so<00:06:12.040> let<00:06:12.250> me<00:06:12.280> just<00:06:12.520> see<00:06:12.880> if<00:06:13.150> I<00:06:13.660> got

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
around here so let me just see if I got

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.390 
around here so let me just see if I got
them<00:06:14.140> all<00:06:14.320> going<00:06:14.800> on<00:06:15.900> walk<00:06:16.900> it<00:06:17.080> around<00:06:17.400> trying

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
them all going on walk it around trying

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.760 
them all going on walk it around trying
to<00:06:18.460> find<00:06:18.730> more<00:06:19.000> trees

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.869 

let's<00:06:23.370> see<00:06:23.669> here<00:06:24.259> then<00:06:25.259> I<00:06:25.289> got<00:06:25.650> them<00:06:25.740> all<00:06:25.949> I'm

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:26.879 
let's see here then I got them all I'm

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.260 
let's see here then I got them all I'm
pretty<00:06:27.240> sure<00:06:27.919> yeah<00:06:28.919> there<00:06:29.370> is<00:06:29.550> a<00:06:29.580> tree<00:06:30.000> over

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
pretty sure yeah there is a tree over

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.540 
pretty sure yeah there is a tree over
there<00:06:30.300> so<00:06:30.960> let's<00:06:31.259> go<00:06:31.530> over<00:06:31.830> there<00:06:32.039> i'll<00:06:32.310> see

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
there so let's go over there i'll see

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.240 
there so let's go over there i'll see
you<00:06:32.639> guys<00:06:32.669> in<00:06:32.819> a<00:06:33.030> couple<00:06:33.060> seconds<00:06:34.069> ok<00:06:35.069> the<00:06:35.220> last

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
you guys in a couple seconds ok the last

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.330 
you guys in a couple seconds ok the last
magic<00:06:35.789> tree<00:06:36.270> is<00:06:36.509> right<00:06:37.020> around<00:06:37.349> here<00:06:38.039> let<00:06:38.250> me

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
magic tree is right around here let me

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.240 
magic tree is right around here let me
show<00:06:38.370> you<00:06:38.550> guys<00:06:38.879> on<00:06:39.150> the<00:06:39.270> map<00:06:39.620> alright<00:06:40.620> so<00:06:40.979> it

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
show you guys on the map alright so it

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.520 
show you guys on the map alright so it
is<00:06:41.430> right<00:06:41.699> across<00:06:41.849> this<00:06:42.270> bridge<00:06:42.509> is<00:06:42.990> pretty

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
is right across this bridge is pretty

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.369 
is right across this bridge is pretty
much<00:06:44.250> where<00:06:44.550> the<00:06:44.789> farm<00:06:45.090> patulous<00:06:45.690> but<00:06:46.050> you<00:06:46.139> got

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:46.379 
much where the farm patulous but you got

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:49.730 
much where the farm patulous but you got
to<00:06:46.409> go<00:06:46.650> a<00:06:47.009> lot<00:06:47.879> more<00:06:48.240> west<00:06:48.810> so<00:06:49.289> let<00:06:49.530> me<00:06:49.620> just

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
to go a lot more west so let me just

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.619 
to go a lot more west so let me just
show<00:06:49.889> you<00:06:49.919> the<00:06:50.099> tree<00:06:50.400> it<00:06:50.639> is<00:06:51.210> right<00:06:51.449> around

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:51.629 
show you the tree it is right around

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.619 
show you the tree it is right around
here<00:06:52.169> so<00:06:53.039> usually<00:06:53.520> nobody<00:06:53.669> comes<00:06:54.090> by<00:06:54.360> these

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:54.629 
here so usually nobody comes by these

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:57.680 
here so usually nobody comes by these
trees<00:06:55.020> around<00:06:55.199> here<00:06:55.470> it<00:06:55.949> kind<00:06:56.310> of<00:06:56.370> spawns<00:06:56.819> it's

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
trees around here it kind of spawns it's

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.029 
trees around here it kind of spawns it's
kind<00:06:57.900> of<00:06:57.930> like<00:06:58.020> a<00:06:58.110> root<00:06:58.349> do<00:06:58.500> you<00:06:58.560> have<00:06:58.680> to<00:06:58.830> take

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 
kind of like a root do you have to take

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:00.830 
kind of like a root do you have to take
and<00:06:59.550> by<00:06:59.909> the<00:07:00.000> time<00:07:00.090> you<00:07:00.389> get<00:07:00.479> to<00:07:00.539> the<00:07:00.720> other

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
and by the time you get to the other

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.439 
and by the time you get to the other
tree<00:07:01.199> it<00:07:01.409> should<00:07:01.620> have<00:07:01.740> spawned<00:07:02.009> by<00:07:02.250> then<00:07:02.490> so

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449 
tree it should have spawned by then so

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.499 
tree it should have spawned by then so
guys<00:07:03.930> I<00:07:04.380> am<00:07:04.440> going<00:07:04.860> to<00:07:05.069> show<00:07:05.340> you<00:07:05.370> the<00:07:06.240> bank

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:06.509 
guys I am going to show you the bank

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.480 
guys I am going to show you the bank
right<00:07:06.780> now<00:07:06.840> it<00:07:07.229> is<00:07:07.349> kind<00:07:07.710> of<00:07:07.770> tricky<00:07:07.979> to<00:07:08.220> find

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
right now it is kind of tricky to find

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.540 
right now it is kind of tricky to find
but<00:07:09.389> I<00:07:09.569> will<00:07:09.979> see<00:07:10.979> you<00:07:11.009> guys<00:07:11.130> in<00:07:11.460> a<00:07:11.520> couple

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
but I will see you guys in a couple

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:13.949 
seconds and kind of low on run so I

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:15.649 
seconds and kind of low on run so I
don't<00:07:14.159> want<00:07:14.310> to<00:07:14.370> keep<00:07:14.520> you<00:07:14.550> waiting<00:07:14.789> so<00:07:15.300> I'll

don't want to keep you waiting so I'll
see<00:07:15.900> you<00:07:15.930> guys<00:07:16.050> in<00:07:16.229> five<00:07:17.069> seconds<00:07:17.580> maybe<00:07:17.780> ok

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
see you guys in five seconds maybe ok

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.330 
see you guys in five seconds maybe ok
guys<00:07:19.020> when<00:07:19.319> you<00:07:19.440> have<00:07:19.560> finished<00:07:19.740> what<00:07:20.099> cutting

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
guys when you have finished what cutting

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.550 
guys when you have finished what cutting
it's<00:07:20.669> time<00:07:20.849> to<00:07:21.030> find<00:07:21.270> the<00:07:21.360> bank<00:07:21.629> so<00:07:22.050> the<00:07:22.289> bank

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
it's time to find the bank so the bank

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.879 
it's time to find the bank so the bank
is<00:07:22.800> right<00:07:23.659> it's<00:07:24.659> like<00:07:24.900> East<00:07:25.169> it's<00:07:25.500> like<00:07:25.680> right

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:25.889 
is right it's like East it's like right

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:27.110 
is right it's like East it's like right

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.059 
too hard to find but if you are looking
for<00:07:29.699> the<00:07:30.000> bank<00:07:30.210> and<00:07:30.599> you're<00:07:30.930> pretty<00:07:31.770> much<00:07:31.889> a

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:32.069 
for the bank and you're pretty much a

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:34.879 
for the bank and you're pretty much a
newcomer<00:07:32.610> to<00:07:32.729> this<00:07:32.969> it<00:07:33.270> is<00:07:33.479> right<00:07:33.810> up<00:07:34.319> the
