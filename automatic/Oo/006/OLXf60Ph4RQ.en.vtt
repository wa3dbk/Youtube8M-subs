yarn<00:00:34.340> in<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.520> levels<00:00:34.879> like<00:00:35.270> this<00:00:35.449> little<00:00:35.720> ball

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
yarn in the levels like this little ball

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.329 
yarn in the levels like this little ball
here<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.320> you<00:00:36.770> see<00:00:36.920> to<00:00:37.040> get<00:00:37.190> further

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
here and you see to get further

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.890 
here and you see to get further
sometimes<00:00:40.339> that<00:00:40.699> extra<00:00:41.089> yarn<00:00:41.300> can<00:00:41.540> be<00:00:41.660> hidden

or hard to reach without yarn you can't

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.229 
or hard to reach without yarn you can't
move<00:00:45.199> on<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:45.769> you<00:00:45.829> have<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.430> think<00:00:46.730> about<00:00:46.909> how

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
move on so you have to think about how

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.970 
move on so you have to think about how
you<00:00:47.300> use<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:52.329> here<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.900> can<00:00:53.930> tie<00:00:54.260> two<00:00:54.320> knots<00:00:54.530> to

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
you use it here you can tie two knots to

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.189 
you use it here you can tie two knots to
create<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.280> bridge<00:00:55.550> which<00:00:56.059> also<00:00:56.300> doubles<00:00:56.840> up<00:00:57.109> as

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
create a bridge which also doubles up as

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.560 
create a bridge which also doubles up as
a<00:00:57.260> slingshot<00:00:58.059> you<00:00:59.059> have<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.300> be<00:00:59.420> careful

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
a slingshot you have to be careful

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.880 
a slingshot you have to be careful
though<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.050> you're<00:01:00.140> on<00:01:00.260> doesn't<00:01:00.559> get<00:01:00.680> washed

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
though so you're on doesn't get washed

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.800 
though so you're on doesn't get washed
away<00:01:03.519> you<00:01:04.519> need<00:01:04.670> something<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.089> protect<00:01:05.239> yarny

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
away you need something to protect yarny

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.810 
away you need something to protect yarny
from<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.080> waves<00:01:06.289> and<00:01:06.470> that<00:01:07.220> boat<00:01:07.430> fender

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
from the waves and that boat fender

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.570 
from the waves and that boat fender
floats<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.140> can<00:01:09.289> use<00:01:09.410> it<00:01:09.590> as<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.770> raft<00:01:10.100> and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
floats so you can use it as a raft and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.260 
floats so you can use it as a raft and
stay<00:01:10.820> safe

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.990 

but<00:01:17.229> it's<00:01:17.350> got<00:01:17.500> more<00:01:17.680> uses<00:01:18.070> too<00:01:18.310> because<00:01:18.850> it's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
but it's got more uses too because it's

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.970 
but it's got more uses too because it's
so<00:01:19.119> buoyant

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.970 

the<00:01:22.880> gameplay<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.360> all<00:01:23.480> physics-based<00:01:24.020> it's

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
the gameplay is all physics-based it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.620 
the gameplay is all physics-based it's
got<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.160> few<00:01:25.430> touches<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.940> magic<00:01:26.270> but<00:01:26.510> it's

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
got a few touches of magic but it's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.530 
got a few touches of magic but it's
rounded<00:01:27.260> in<00:01:27.380> realism<00:01:27.740> what<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.790> do<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.150> how

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
rounded in realism what you do and how

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.270 
rounded in realism what you do and how
you<00:01:29.570> tackle<00:01:29.900> problems<00:01:30.260> is<00:01:30.680> really<00:01:30.920> up<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.130> you

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
you tackle problems is really up to you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.960 
you tackle problems is really up to you
and<00:01:31.430> your<00:01:31.580> creativity<00:01:33.310> when<00:01:34.310> things<00:01:34.490> get<00:01:34.700> more

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
and your creativity when things get more

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.700 
and your creativity when things get more
difficult<00:01:35.480> you'll<00:01:35.960> have<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.290> think<00:01:36.530> of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
difficult you'll have to think of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.260 
difficult you'll have to think of
different<00:01:36.740> ways<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.340> combine<00:01:37.760> your<00:01:38.120> knees

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
different ways to combine your knees

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.850 
different ways to combine your knees
abilities<00:01:38.720> or<00:01:39.080> use<00:01:39.350> things<00:01:39.650> in<00:01:39.800> the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
abilities or use things in the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.030 
abilities or use things in the
environment<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.490> find<00:01:40.730> a<00:01:40.880> way<00:01:41.000> forward<00:01:42.040> this

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
environment to find a way forward this

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.740 
environment to find a way forward this
looks<00:01:43.280> like<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.460> dead<00:01:43.670> end<00:01:43.850> that's<00:01:44.480> way<00:01:44.690> too

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
looks like a dead end that's way too

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.620 
looks like a dead end that's way too
high<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.140> jump<00:01:45.940> it's<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:46.970> good<00:01:47.150> thing<00:01:47.300> you<00:01:47.450> can

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
high to jump it's a good thing you can

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.510 
high to jump it's a good thing you can
use<00:01:47.780> your<00:01:47.930> yarn<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.380> climb<00:01:48.620> out<00:01:51.160> okay<00:01:52.160> let's

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
use your yarn to climb out okay let's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.130 
use your yarn to climb out okay let's
think<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:52.880> through<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.420> try<00:01:53.960> another

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
think this through and try another

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.620 
think this through and try another
approach<00:01:54.700> your<00:01:55.700> knee<00:01:55.820> needs<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:56.150> raft<00:01:56.390> again

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
approach your knee needs that raft again

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.750 
approach your knee needs that raft again
but<00:01:57.470> getting<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.800> over<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.190> other<00:01:58.280> side<00:01:58.580> is

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
but getting it over to the other side is

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.510 
but getting it over to the other side is
going<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.030> be<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.180> little<00:01:59.420> bit<00:01:59.540> tricky<00:02:03.520> you're

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
going to be a little bit tricky you're

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.710 
going to be a little bit tricky you're
gonna<00:02:04.610> have<00:02:04.760> to<00:02:04.910> build<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.240> couple<00:02:05.480> of<00:02:05.540> yarn

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
gonna have to build a couple of yarn

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.729 
gonna have to build a couple of yarn
bridges

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.259 

see<00:02:09.739> those<00:02:09.979> yarn<00:02:10.280> bridges<00:02:10.670> they<00:02:10.969> can<00:02:11.120> carry

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
see those yarn bridges they can carry

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.809 
see those yarn bridges they can carry
objects<00:02:11.780> too<00:02:12.019> so<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.739> can<00:02:12.890> make<00:02:13.010> one<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.670> get

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
objects too so you can make one to get

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:27.580 
objects too so you can make one to get
the<00:02:13.939> fender<00:02:14.269> out<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:14.750> water

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.410
