00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.200
 woman us as perhaps can 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.000
 read thoughtless father we should alfred 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.060
 I can start searching immediately 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.790
 I am not ill 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:24.590
 So here we go, behind 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.300
 Section in the note was the speech of 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.940
 the back of the holy place could 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.690
 behind the monastery means i can 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.680
 but nothing extraordinary here 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.210
 discover 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.940
 You see, this stone is here 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.470
 much bigger than the others that is 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.920
 but strange why is one like that 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.329
 big stone between the others 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.300
 so we just jump on it 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.300
 ok trade 23 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.320
 it seems like a kind of secret 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.450
 but there is nothing to see in it 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.950
 he seems to have an exciting mission too 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.450
 we will take the tunnel under the 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.160
 lupe what you want but not there 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.610
 just do not be afraid I am 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.410
 Here soon here minister we are coming 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.850
 immediately back and after what I 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.290
 I do not call it rescue I've got that 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.290
 Can ruin my dress 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.220
 when the tide comes down this tunnel 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.729
 safely flooded by water 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.409
 do not panic me further we still have it 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.409
 solve time that is just apple 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.760
 ah, you are terrified, we are in one 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.680
 dead end 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.670
 This flagstone should only be curious 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.070
 discourage I keep pushing there 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.100
 she does not move, I'm afraid to come 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.000
 We do not go further , we prefer to go back 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.260
 There is certainly a hidden one 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.900
 mechanism in this wall maybe 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.960
 not oh well we know each other so 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.020
 to pick something 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.969
 a key 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.090
 who alfred on me is that maybe 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.500
 the key to the secret you 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.500
 but stay long in there 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.250
 I really hope you will fall 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.250
 advised and did not come outside 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.629
 The stone is broken off in the fans 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.060
 have you done anything to father 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.760

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.550

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.250

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.380
 The court said that was very 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.330
 Cleverly close the key up there 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:02.230
 I would never have sought to fix it 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.730
 but now we have to get out of here 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.680
 comes from the many languages is 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:13.070
 settles on the excuse that you 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.900

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.710
 small but the world is one meets 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.240
 again and again loud serum 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.070

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.070

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.930
 after 50 meters was over 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.970
 but no spontaneous course we have 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.010
 what did this key find her world 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.040

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.020

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.260

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.160

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.239
 talk she will accompany me you 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.239
 be more devious 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.610
 because of a feeling 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.280
 many buttons the wind 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.390

 Finally, for you once and for all 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.070

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.050
 The tide will come soon I hope you 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.040

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.090
 you will drown here on the spot 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.770
 The rising tide can not even be 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.020
 Escaping a horse means it's so fast 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.280
 the water and only one remains we 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.280
