knife<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:49.649> sure<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> lot<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> you've<00:00:50.489> heard

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
knife I'm sure a lot of you've heard

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.180 
knife I'm sure a lot of you've heard
that<00:00:50.850> before<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.140> reason<00:00:52.530> behind<00:00:52.710> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that before but the reason behind that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
that before but the reason behind that
is<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> dull<00:00:54.570> knife<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
is is because it with a dull knife you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.350 
is is because it with a dull knife you
have<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.170> exert<00:00:55.410> much<00:00:55.620> more<00:00:55.890> force<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
have to exert much more force and if you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.349 
have to exert much more force and if you
do<00:00:57.539> slip<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.440> make<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> bad<00:00:59.309> move<00:00:59.609> you're<00:01:00.210> going

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
do slip or make a bad move you're going

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.439 
do slip or make a bad move you're going
to<00:01:00.420> send<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.809> blade<00:01:01.260> deep<00:01:01.829> into<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.699> into

to send that blade deep into you or into
someone<00:01:03.809> else<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> always<00:01:05.790> keep<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.270> sharp

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
yourself make sure they always have a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.720 
yourself make sure they always have a
brace<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:50.070> if<00:02:50.160> I'm<00:02:50.250> cutting<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.220> my<00:02:53.370> arms

one's within arm's reach of you because

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.770 
one's within arm's reach of you because
while<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.130> are<00:03:14.280> cutting<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:15.330> could<00:03:15.570> send

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
while you are cutting you could send

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.840 
while you are cutting you could send
that<00:03:15.840> blade<00:03:16.140> into<00:03:16.350> someone<00:03:16.740> else<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.520> always

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
that blade into someone else so always

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.699 
that blade into someone else so always
make<00:03:17.970> sure<00:03:18.150> someone's<00:03:18.660> no<00:03:19.080> one's<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.440> an<00:03:19.560> arm

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
make sure someone's no one's with an arm

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.130 
make sure someone's no one's with an arm
reach<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.760> rule<00:03:21.300> number<00:03:21.420> five<00:03:21.750> is

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
reach of you so rule number five is

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.560 
reach of you so rule number five is
whenever<00:03:23.070> you're<00:03:23.280> making<00:03:23.400> deep<00:03:23.790> cuts<00:03:24.150> always

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
whenever you're making deep cuts always

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.250 
whenever you're making deep cuts always
use<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> lever<00:03:24.989> cut<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:26.400> deep<00:03:27.120> cuts<00:03:27.480> require<00:03:28.200> a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
use a lever cut so deep cuts require a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.100 
use a lever cut so deep cuts require a
lot<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.440> force<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.730> two<00:03:29.790> cuts<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.570> can<00:03:30.720> use<00:03:30.930> as

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
lot of force so two cuts you can use as

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.260 
lot of force so two cuts you can use as
one<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.530> chest<00:03:31.800> lever<00:03:32.070> where<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.910> sink

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
one is the chest lever where you sink

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.750 
one is the chest lever where you sink
that<00:03:33.420> blade<00:03:33.810> into<00:03:34.140> your<00:03:34.620> ribs<00:03:34.890> facing<00:03:35.670> away

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
that blade into your ribs facing away

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.960 
that blade into your ribs facing away
from<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.800> basically<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:38.040> knife<00:03:38.250> remains

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
from you and basically the knife remains

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.590 
from you and basically the knife remains
pretty<00:03:39.480> much<00:03:39.570> static<00:03:41.209> while<00:03:42.209> you're<00:03:42.420> making

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
pretty much static while you're making

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.160 
pretty much static while you're making
those<00:03:42.870> cuts<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:45.540> basically<00:03:45.870> you're<00:03:46.050> only

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
those cuts so basically you're only

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.140 
those cuts so basically you're only
manipulating<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:47.070> piece<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.790> woods<00:03:48.030> you're

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
manipulating a piece of woods you're

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.740 
manipulating a piece of woods you're
cutting<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:51.690> like<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.320> next<00:03:52.500> cut<00:03:53.310> is

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
cutting just like that the next cut is

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.720 
cutting just like that the next cut is
the<00:03:54.750> knee<00:03:54.900> lever<00:03:55.200> where<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.530> brace<00:03:55.890> your

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
the knee lever where you brace your

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.800 
the knee lever where you brace your
wrist<00:03:57.030> against<00:03:57.420> your<00:03:57.630> knee<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.940> bring

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
wrist against your knee and just bring

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.830 
wrist against your knee and just bring
and<00:04:01.250> manipulate<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.430> wood<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.030> not<00:04:03.630> the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
and manipulate the wood and not the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.780 
and manipulate the wood and not the
knife

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.580 

instead<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.910> forcing<00:04:09.240> large<00:04:10.140> amounts<00:04:10.530> of

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
instead of forcing large amounts of

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.350 
instead of forcing large amounts of
force<00:04:10.890> like<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:13.430> rule<00:04:14.430> number<00:04:14.610> six<00:04:15.030> we'll<00:04:15.240> go

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
force like that rule number six we'll go

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.080 
force like that rule number six we'll go
ahead<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.690> go<00:04:15.810> straight<00:04:16.020> into<00:04:16.430> its<00:04:17.430> avoid<00:04:17.850> the
