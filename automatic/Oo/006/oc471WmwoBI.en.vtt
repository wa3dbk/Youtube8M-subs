iron stuff like the tools and the armor

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.330 
iron stuff like the tools and the armor
that<00:02:51.840> looked<00:02:52.200> really<00:02:52.470> cool<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.980> definitely

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340

that looked really cool you definitely
got<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.460> medieval<00:02:53.760> feel<00:02:54.120> when<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.390> look<00:02:54.540> to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
got that medieval feel when you look to

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.050 
got that medieval feel when you look to
it<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:56.010> overall<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.310> texture<00:02:56.700> packs<00:02:56.880> got

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
it the overall the texture packs got

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.660 
it the overall the texture packs got
this<00:02:57.180> really<00:02:57.360> nice<00:02:57.540> depth<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.490> its

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
this really nice depth to it I like its

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.700 
this really nice depth to it I like its
attention<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.570> detail<00:03:01.020> but<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.320> doesn't<00:03:01.620> go

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
attention to detail but it doesn't go

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.260 
attention to detail but it doesn't go
like<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:02.100> realism<00:03:02.520> like<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.790> said<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.090> kind<00:03:03.240> of

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
like to realism like I said it's kind of

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.870 
like to realism like I said it's kind of
got<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.450> drawee<00:03:04.220> cartoony<00:03:05.220> effect<00:03:05.520> the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
got that drawee cartoony effect the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.250 
got that drawee cartoony effect the
music<00:03:06.210> discs<00:03:06.420> look<00:03:06.510> really<00:03:06.750> weird<00:03:06.870> they<00:03:07.050> look

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
music discs look really weird they look

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.580 
music discs look really weird they look
like<00:03:07.770> they're<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.100> one<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.370> those<00:03:08.490> old<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.590> can't

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
like they're on one of those old I can't

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.530 
like they're on one of those old I can't
think<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.240> instrument<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:12.330> they<00:03:12.420> could

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
think of the instrument that they could

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.790 
think of the instrument that they could
play<00:03:12.660> down<00:03:12.840> with<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.020> little<00:03:13.200> horn<00:03:13.470> right<00:03:13.620> there

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
play down with a little horn right there

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.490 
play down with a little horn right there
but<00:03:13.920> they<00:03:13.980> look<00:03:14.130> good<00:03:14.250> really<00:03:14.400> cool<00:03:14.700> um<00:03:15.380> as<00:03:16.380> you

showing<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.600> hostile<00:03:30.960> mobs<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.680> kind<00:03:31.890> of

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
showing the hostile mobs and you kind of

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.410 
showing the hostile mobs and you kind of
see<00:03:32.070> like<00:03:32.100> these<00:03:32.370> hostile<00:03:32.790> mobs<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.150> gave<00:03:33.300> them

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
see like these hostile mobs it gave them

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.150 
see like these hostile mobs it gave them
kind<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.690> like<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:34.050> blue<00:03:34.500> theme<00:03:34.920> they

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
kind of like this blue theme they

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.310 
kind of like this blue theme they
started<00:03:35.520> putting<00:03:35.640> blue<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.270> slime<00:03:36.630> isn't

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
started putting blue the slime isn't

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.620 
started putting blue the slime isn't
even<00:03:37.470> green<00:03:37.680> adult<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.130> pure<00:03:38.670> blue<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.600> I

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
even green adult it is pure blue and I

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.350 
even green adult it is pure blue and I
think<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.530> looks<00:03:40.680> pretty<00:03:40.890> cool<00:03:41.070> but<00:03:41.520> it's<00:03:42.120> kind

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
think it looks pretty cool but it's kind

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.699 
think it looks pretty cool but it's kind
of<00:03:42.420> what<00:03:42.570> they<00:03:42.720> thought<00:03:42.959> into<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.380> like<00:03:43.500> all

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
of what they thought into it like all

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.670 
of what they thought into it like all
the<00:03:43.890> mobs<00:03:44.130> kind<00:03:44.490> of<00:03:44.580> have<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.990> blue<00:03:45.990> worked

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
the mobs kind of have this blue worked

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.470 
the mobs kind of have this blue worked
in<00:03:46.890> normal<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.250> believe<00:03:47.550> like<00:03:47.730> almost<00:03:47.970> all<00:03:48.270> the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
in normal I believe like almost all the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.480 
in normal I believe like almost all the
all<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.050> hostile<00:03:49.410> mobs<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.770> like<00:03:50.010> blue<00:03:50.310> eyes

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
all the hostile mobs have like blue eyes

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.860 
all the hostile mobs have like blue eyes
or<00:03:50.520> something<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.330> obviously<00:03:51.600> you

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
or something like that you obviously you

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.960 
or something like that you obviously you
see<00:03:52.050> here<00:03:52.290> on<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.500> spider<00:03:52.740> is<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.310> great<00:03:53.610> aspect

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
see here on the spider is a great aspect

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.550 
see here on the spider is a great aspect
even<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.390> skeletons<00:03:54.900> they<00:03:55.110> have<00:03:55.320> blue<00:03:55.530> eyes

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
even the skeletons they have blue eyes

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.080 
even the skeletons they have blue eyes
even<00:03:56.310> though<00:03:56.400> they're<00:03:56.550> on<00:03:56.700> fire<00:03:56.850> right<00:03:57.030> now

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
even though they're on fire right now

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.449 
even though they're on fire right now
but<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.350> creepers<00:03:58.740> obviously<00:03:59.190> they<00:03:59.310> look

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
but in the creepers obviously they look

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.220 
but in the creepers obviously they look
like<00:03:59.580> creepers<00:03:59.910> but<00:04:00.180> although<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:00.870> think<00:04:00.990> it's

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
like creepers but although I think it's

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.420 
like creepers but although I think it's
a<00:04:01.290> pretty<00:04:01.440> good<00:04:01.530> texture<00:04:01.920> pack<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.160> love<00:04:02.340> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
a pretty good texture pack I love the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.100 
a pretty good texture pack I love the
way<00:04:02.520> glass<00:04:02.760> looks<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.300> one<00:04:03.510> glass<00:04:03.720> kind<00:04:03.959> of

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
way glass looks I like one glass kind of

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.480 
way glass looks I like one glass kind of
has<00:04:04.230> those<00:04:04.440> like<00:04:04.620> type<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.980> borders<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.400> one

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
has those like type of borders and one

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.870 
has those like type of borders and one
not<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.800> passive<00:04:07.800> mobs<00:04:08.010> weren't<00:04:08.610> something

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
not the passive mobs weren't something

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.060 
not the passive mobs weren't something
to<00:04:09.240> shout<00:04:09.570> about<00:04:09.630> they're<00:04:10.200> pretty<00:04:10.500> basic

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
to shout about they're pretty basic

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.070 
to shout about they're pretty basic
they<00:04:11.790> even<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.270> would<00:04:12.450> say<00:04:12.480> they<00:04:12.690> even<00:04:12.930> look

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
they even I would say they even look

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.470
