think<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.590> gift<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.400> he<00:01:20.520> hasn't<00:01:20.939> at

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
think it's just a gift but he hasn't at

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
think it's just a gift but he hasn't at
the<00:01:21.180> same<00:01:21.420> time<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.049> seven<00:01:22.619> three<00:01:22.860> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the same time you have a seven three and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.130 
the same time you have a seven three and
a<00:01:22.979> half<00:01:23.009> inch<00:01:23.400> wingspan<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> really

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
a half inch wingspan I think it really

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.910 
a half inch wingspan I think it really
helps<00:01:25.619> him<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.100> Des<00:01:26.369> quite<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> athlete<00:01:27.479> he's

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
helps him in Des quite the athlete he's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.330 
helps him in Des quite the athlete he's
quick<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> floor<00:01:29.610> they're<00:01:30.060> bouncy<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
quick off the floor they're bouncy and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
quick off the floor they're bouncy and
great<00:01:32.340> lift<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.140> when<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.409> have

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
great lift and I think when you have

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.819 
great lift and I think when you have
that<00:01:34.740> combination<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:36.270> he<00:01:36.390> has<00:01:36.829> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that combination that he has it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
that combination that he has it
certainly<00:01:38.250> lends<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.939> him<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
certainly lends for him to be a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.810 
certainly lends for him to be a
excellent<00:01:39.930> shot<00:01:40.500> blocker<00:01:40.530> inside<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> some

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
excellent shot blocker inside and some

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.999 
excellent shot blocker inside and some
time<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.420> most<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> time<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.799> catch

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
time you can most of the time you catch

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.530 
time you can most of the time you catch
people<00:01:44.460> from<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> weak<00:01:44.909> side<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.450> it's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
people from the weak side and it's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.170 
people from the weak side and it's
generally<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.079> his<00:01:46.409> man<00:01:46.680> people<00:01:47.579> driving<00:01:48.060> in

generally not his man people driving in

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.420 
generally not his man people driving in
think<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> running<00:01:49.229> start<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.950> try

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
think they have a running start and try

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.950 
think they have a running start and try

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
to get to the rim but he's just had a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.569 
to get to the rim but he's just had a
great<00:01:52.170> knack<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.740> finding<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.159> ball<00:01:53.399> before

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
to be challenged with for Jordan he's

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.670 
to be challenged with for Jordan he's
going<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.090> continue<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.720> get<00:03:57.870> bigger<00:03:58.380> and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
going to continue to get bigger and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.890 
going to continue to get bigger and
stronger<00:03:59.030> to<00:04:00.030> be<00:04:00.180> able<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.450> play<00:04:00.600> at<00:04:00.750> that

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.470 
stronger to be able to play at that
level<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.290> probably<00:04:01.530> have<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:02.010> defend<00:04:02.480> the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
level and probably have to defend the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.460

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
something that he will be able to do

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.330 
something that he will be able to do
because<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.269> his<00:04:09.510> lamp<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.049> size<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.920> as

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
because of his lamp and the size and as

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.460 
because of his lamp and the size and as
he<00:04:11.519> continues<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.420> get<00:04:12.660> bigger<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.170> stronger

he continues to get bigger and stronger

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.470 
he continues to get bigger and stronger
that's<00:04:14.160> going<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.430> become<00:04:14.549> easier<00:04:15.060> for<00:04:15.390> him

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
that's going to become easier for him

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.300 
that's going to become easier for him
