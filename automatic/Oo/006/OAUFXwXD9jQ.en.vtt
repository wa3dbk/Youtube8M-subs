00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.369
 hello to all the boys who have come 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.859
 no I am that today to introduce you to the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 volvo fh16 forest one of titti 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.189
 mobbing 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.739
 I had seen him some time ago 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.019
 I saw he really did a bang 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.649
 download and I decided to do the 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.909
 presentation where after various various tests 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.530
 evidence 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.100
 looking at reading a little about 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.970
 description of the world if everything is me 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.070
 I'm aware of the problems we say of the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.019
 fix that I hope will be made in 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.500
 next version however tt modding 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:01.680
 written that this is the example 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.860
 a temporary stuff that will be made one 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.299
 different thing will be fixed and everything is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.520
 then I tell you now for those who will not see 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.579
 video until the end that will be in 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.579
 many I think you absolutely don't leave 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:20.430
 logs attached to the crane is the crane 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.310
 attached to the truck because some 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.820
 rescue site returned you disappear 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.790
 the trunks that were on the box and vi 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.380
 the truck blows up so when 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.790
 unplug remember to take it all off 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.450
 share the logs Jun 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.990
 and otherwise it happens we say the patatrac 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.090
 then like truck functions 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.940
 let's go see them right away, then go out 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.979
 I'll explain the other things to you with the rate 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.600
 5 I do n't pay we have the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.799
 possibility to put the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.439
 the chains here it is very nice with the 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:01.810
 key 5 6 we have to do work 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:04.780
 front and back shore and then inside 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.990
 it is unfortunately not illuminated, however, already the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.780
 animated speedometer then there is the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.090
 lancet that goes up with the 6 key of the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.850
 I don't talk to you, you are normal we have 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.200
 the toghe the additional waves is 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:24.040
 practically serves to add 35 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.870
 quintals in front that serve to give you 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.540
 stability and when you use the crane 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.440
 obviously the back one because vi 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.110
 unbalances a little understood wolf 0 the a.d not 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.260
 I still understand what it can be 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.849
 why not 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.720
 does not give anything I do not know what it is 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:48.709
 ah yes here it is practically lol 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.930
 This is this thing here 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:58.610
 what the fuck and cacchiano please enough 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.909
 for nothing there is nothing of them and 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.239
 flashing very nice money together 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:08.000
 the truck also gives you the flick it is 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.890
 this one this other trailer a lot 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.310
 cute also nice for tractors e 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.829
 really really well done then there 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.560
 I explain to you I dwell on an atom 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:22.129
 problems that there are that you will encounter 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.889
 who has less met me then if 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.200
 put in frame mode where you see 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.019
 let's say the collisions there you direct body 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.970
 it's all we say that breaks the 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.790
 boxes most of all when using the 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.129
 crane is practically this rigid body that 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.319
 I'm saying rectangle behind it 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.840
 which is pretty much what stops me 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.750
 logs because they don't go we say for 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.690
 air when you are on the road the problem 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.049
 of this rigid body here is that it is 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.230
 practically close to the arm 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.690
 of the crane you see that it touches its own 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.650
 so you command to maneuver it now 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.959
 let's see when you go to maneuver it there 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.889
 net just pretty much the rest 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.079
 up down the trunk ok when you go to 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.329
 you have to maneuver in addition to real 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.269
 plant half the boxes if you are 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:18.620
 laterally he went down with the 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.539
 here it is crane you see that you are already in 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.690
 collision with this we say ridges 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.580
 so this is what it means 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.360
 it means that with the crane you must 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.650
 practically work posteriorly or 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.880
 so or right laterally get up 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:40.020
 raise your trunk completely 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.140
 and stretch your arm and stay right 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.840
 outside of that of that manager 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.080
 rigid furniture otherwise truly 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.670
 are cabbage when you get here 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.730
 shortened second arm and let go in June 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.010
 it's a bit is a good arturi of boxes 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.130
 because you have to do the right maneuvers 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:03.060
 you basically had to have the 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.480
 measures because it really is a little bit 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.100
 a complication store touched or here eh 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.780
 ok of course there must be 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.680
 otherwise vallo logs do not go where 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.250
 they want and therefore it is a moment to be 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.370
 to the eye another thing you can do 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:23.700
 echo the m key orc troyer collision 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:28.670
 room mn button you can practically 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.670
 raise and lower your group 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:38.460
 here it is the territory the frames and so 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:42.150
 here it is with the key mn dyego st porca 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:46.020
 slut lower you raise this here does yes 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.450
 of course to make you a little easier with 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.750
 the maneuvers as I said before vary 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:54.120
 when chosen laterally so if al 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.720
 place to play with the arm 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.810
 you are so maybe you lower the crane 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.780
 completely facilitates you a little 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:07.670
 the hooking of the logs then for you 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:12.480
 to unhook it obviously you put it down 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:14.700
 one turn your your latex arm 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.650
 and I am still still a newbie 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.870
 with these arcana here 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.220
 I don't know when I will get it 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:26.389
 but I don't know if you did it 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:30.240
 then go if you want 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.380
 hang up there go behind the maremma 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.139
 maiala stop 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:40.410
 the menu is enough when you are like this you can 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:42.479
 obviously to launch it the trailer though 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:48.330
 here true honor of the trunks remain 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:51.300
 locked without problems and there is no 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.610
 no other thing we say now 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.270
 it seems to me that i don't remember you should 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:01.260
 be that same thing here it is here 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.270
 the same is always the same arcane 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.460
 to keep the logs still so you are 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.400
 also a little constrained also by 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.889
 this other part you see when 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.380
 lower the crane you have to stay a lot 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:20.930
 to the eye because it really approaches 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:24.330
 a lot of that piece there, here it is nothing and nothing 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:28.020
 just other things we say there are none 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.699
 I have not found to be all that 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.310
 of course always remember to 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.590
 release to release everything 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.389
 when you finish 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.800
 let's say the game and everything 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.120
 other moments really happens 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.590
 casino 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.020
 now we'll be here to see if there 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.479
 will be the next ones will settle down 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.120
 something i should model however is 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:50.930
 good fashion 

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:54.530
 very good and it really is you too 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:56.060
 nice to see from those who maybe are more 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.490
 good at using it and everything 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.680
 anyway I leave you, of course, lingen 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.199
 description keep an eye on it we'll see if 

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.300
 there will be other versions I will update you 

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:06.919
 wrote on the page in Italy I hope 

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.930
 both liked the presentation and the way 

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:11.090
 and I hope I was clear of having you 

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:14.110
 explained everything and we got it 

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.110
 the video post hi
