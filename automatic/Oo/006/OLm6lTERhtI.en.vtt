original Schwinn tires and I really

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.280 
original Schwinn tires and I really
could<00:02:43.890> kick<00:02:44.700> myself<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.330> butt<00:02:45.420> because<00:02:45.840> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
could kick myself in the butt because I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.390 
could kick myself in the butt because I
rode<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.280> bike<00:02:47.870> just<00:02:48.870> last<00:02:49.110> week<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.650> got<00:02:50.370> a

rode the bike just last week and got a
flat<00:02:50.700> tire<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.350> if<00:02:52.350> anyone<00:02:52.680> has<00:02:52.710> some<00:02:53.160> ideas

about<00:02:54.170> whether<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.260> repair<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.160> tire<00:02:56.400> or<00:02:56.670> just

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
about whether to repair the tire or just

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.370 
about whether to repair the tire or just
replace<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.480> with<00:02:57.600> something<00:02:57.959> more<00:02:58.110> modern

pressure problem it looks like when I
add<00:03:43.050> my<00:03:43.200> mechanic<00:03:43.650> check<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.400> out<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.790> because

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
add my mechanic check it out is because

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.790 
add my mechanic check it out is because
there's<00:03:45.209> some<00:03:45.390> kind<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.600> hydraulic<00:03:46.080> system<00:03:46.500> so

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
there's some kind of hydraulic system so

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.360 
there's some kind of hydraulic system so
as<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.760> hub<00:03:47.970> spins<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.930> pressure<00:03:49.709> builds<00:03:50.250> in

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
as the hub spins that pressure builds in

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.890 
as the hub spins that pressure builds in
this<00:03:50.550> little<00:03:50.790> tube<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.390> goes<00:03:51.570> up<00:03:51.810> this<00:03:52.680> tubing

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
this little tube and goes up this tubing

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.130 
this little tube and goes up this tubing
makes<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.349> needle<00:03:54.680> turn<00:03:55.120> but<00:03:56.120> again<00:03:56.450> right

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
makes the needle turn but again right

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.559 
makes the needle turn but again right
now<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:58.340> kind<00:03:58.549> of<00:03:58.610> hovers<00:03:58.909> at<00:03:59.090> 10<00:03:59.269> miles<00:03:59.450> per

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
now it kind of hovers at 10 miles per

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.660 
now it kind of hovers at 10 miles per
hour<00:03:59.720> no<00:03:59.959> matter<00:04:00.110> how<00:04:00.290> fast<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.709> go<00:04:00.829> so<00:04:01.579> I'd

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
hour no matter how fast you go so I'd

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.429 
hour no matter how fast you go so I'd
like<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.819> get<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.180> fixed<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:03.170> odometer

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
like to get that fixed the odometer

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.679 
like to get that fixed the odometer
reading<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.159> don't<00:04:04.250> think<00:04:04.610> that<00:04:04.790> will<00:04:04.939> show<00:04:05.180> on

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
reading I don't think that will show on

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.319 
reading I don't think that will show on
video<00:04:06.049> but<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.409> odometer<00:04:06.650> is<00:04:06.890> just<00:04:07.519> under<00:04:07.819> 900

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
video but the odometer is just under 900

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:14.319 
video but the odometer is just under 900
miles<00:04:09.129> the<00:04:10.420> headlamp<00:04:11.420> is<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:12.730> Miller<00:04:13.730> headlamp

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
miles the headlamp is a Miller headlamp

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.229 
miles the headlamp is a Miller headlamp
and<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:16.250> rear<00:04:16.519> brake<00:04:17.120> lamp<00:04:17.329> also<00:04:18.229> Miller

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
and the rear brake lamp also Miller

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.729 
and the rear brake lamp also Miller
they're<00:04:20.239> optional<00:04:20.509> and<00:04:20.930> they<00:04:21.229> are<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.500> working

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
they're optional and they are in working

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.650 
they're optional and they are in working
order<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.460> was<00:04:22.789> very<00:04:22.970> surprised

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
order I was very surprised

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.270 
order I was very surprised
this<00:04:23.840> just<00:04:24.139> kicks<00:04:24.410> into<00:04:24.650> place<00:04:24.949> with<00:04:25.160> this

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
this just kicks into place with this

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.990 
this just kicks into place with this
little<00:04:25.550> tab<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.900> it's<00:04:27.110> an<00:04:27.260> electric<00:04:27.650> generator

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
little tab so it's an electric generator

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.689 
little tab so it's an electric generator
it<00:04:29.000> presses<00:04:29.630> against<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.139> tire<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.889> as<00:04:31.460> you

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
it presses against the tire and as you

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.390 
it presses against the tire and as you
pedal<00:04:31.970> then<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.870> generates<00:04:33.050> electricity<00:04:33.500> and

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
pedal then it generates electricity and

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.500 
pedal then it generates electricity and
light<00:04:35.360> see<00:04:35.780> rear<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.320> front<00:04:36.760> lights<00:04:37.760> again

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
light see rear and front lights again

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.950 
light see rear and front lights again
those<00:04:38.900> are<00:04:39.080> in<00:04:39.139> working<00:04:39.380> order<00:04:40.419> so<00:04:41.419> there<00:04:41.870> you

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
those are in working order so there you

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.070 
those are in working order so there you
have<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.169> it's<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.740> 10<00:04:43.280> speed<00:04:43.610> road<00:04:44.570> bike<00:04:44.600> from

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
have it it's a 10 speed road bike from

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.490 
have it it's a 10 speed road bike from
back<00:04:45.260> in<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.500> day<00:04:46.630> what's<00:04:47.630> nice<00:04:47.900> about<00:04:47.930> these

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
back in the day what's nice about these

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.310 
back in the day what's nice about these
10<00:04:49.070> speeds<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:49.729> that<00:04:50.060> every<00:04:50.720> gear<00:04:51.710> is<00:04:51.940> usable

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
10 speeds is that every gear is usable

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.379
