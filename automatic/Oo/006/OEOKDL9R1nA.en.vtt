00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
twisting stitches into the back to place

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.420 
twisting stitches into the back to place
them<00:03:08.020> back<00:03:08.700> on<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.910> Left<00:03:10.150> needle<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:15.100> knit

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.190 
them back on the Left needle and knit
them<00:03:15.730> normally<00:03:18.420> all<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:19.570> twisting<00:03:20.080> around

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
them normally all this twisting around

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.970 
them normally all this twisting around
does<00:03:20.709> tend<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.220> make<00:03:21.400> them<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.610> little<00:03:21.790> tight

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
does tend to make them a little tight

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.650 
does tend to make them a little tight
but<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.220> is<00:03:24.400> really<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.850> easiest<00:03:24.880> way<00:03:25.630> to

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
but this is really the easiest way to

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.960 
but this is really the easiest way to
understand<00:03:26.470> cabling<00:03:27.100> without<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.550> needle

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.259 
understand cabling without a needle
because<00:03:28.150> all<00:03:28.600> you're<00:03:28.870> doing<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.920> just

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269
