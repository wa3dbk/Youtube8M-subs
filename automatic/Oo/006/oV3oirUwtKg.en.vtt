outside of the map that is a pile of

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.270

get<00:03:35.280> into<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.549> glitch<00:03:35.730> originally<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.419> I<00:03:36.540> go

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
get into the glitch originally and I go

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.680 
get into the glitch originally and I go
to<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.930> safe<00:03:37.169> spot<00:03:37.470> I'm<00:03:38.010> just<00:03:38.310> gonna<00:03:38.400> jump<00:03:38.849> to

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
to jump and continue jumping and bypass

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.599 
to jump and continue jumping and bypass
it<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:50.910> jump<00:03:51.269> down<00:03:51.419> to<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.629> lower<00:03:51.840> barrier
