00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.700
 reconcile motorcycle and passion without 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.660
 forget the versatility and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.730
 accessibility 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 this is the philosophy of the new 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.400
 yamaha mt with klein 0.7 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.550
 nyama wants to offer a powerful engine 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 an exciting chassis and a design 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.830
 hitting the MT 0 7 board a new 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.480
 twin 689 line 110 meters 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.130
 cubes stalled at 270 Â° why to deliver 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.030
 a maximum of power so 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.410
 instant 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.750
 the power precisely 75 horses and 68 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.600
 newtons-meters of torque at 6500 rpm 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.399
 minute for the engine of the mt 07 yamaha 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.070
 use cylinders of 7 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.600
 as for that of the MT 09 in order to 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.949
 reduce friction for a 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.140
 transmission of power more 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.510
 effective and to reduce consumption 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.000
 otherwise the staging of the reports of 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.160
 box and injection have been calibrated 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.290
 to provide comparable flexibility to 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.729
 that of a 4 cylinder in line by 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.040
 elsewhere this engine takes place in a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.500
 frame beam whose tubes are 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.290
 different thicknesses in order to lighten the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.509
 both do mt 0 this displays a 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.490
 weight of only 179 kg all full 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.909
 facts among the details of the part 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.430
 cycle 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.070
 there is a classic 41 mm fork 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.000
 of diameter a mono-shock 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.540
 horizontal and a swingarm 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 asymmetrical on the heroes 7 a saddle 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.520
 low to 805 mm very thin in its part 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.259
 before it facilitates access to all 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.240
 jigs a fully dashboard 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.979
 digital with report indicator 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.740
 engaged and a led taillight 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.860
 complete the panoply of the mt 0 7 we have 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.680
 says that mt 0 7 and is accessible and 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.939
 because its rate will be displayed at 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.740
 less than 6000 euros 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.130
 she will be available at the first 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.290
 quarter 2014 and a 47 horsepower version 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.950
 for them to 2 will also be
