00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.490
 We want victory for a group third place 4 setting breakthrough 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.629
 Omiya Ardijaan 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:19.350
 We have a reunion series S-Pulse with no victory yet 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:25.440
 Can you show the momentum that set a new record of 18 league undefeated 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.289
 The match Omiya-kun not earn a ball that competed is Shintaro Shimizu says 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.360
 In the early stages, the sound and pace hold 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.560
 Takumi Station is also 26 minutes in a series that was pressed 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.260
 There is no off-side, there is one side less if Nakane got out of the first part 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.730
 And brought I shoot over 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.989
 It is a goal kick that did not go to the frame 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:50.500
 I therefore think that it is barely to whether not to apply or according to the Whoa side 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.940
 The other party's line will be lowered next time by trying more and more such challenges 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.039
 Ne 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:01.650
 In addition the series is 30 minutes from now put picross 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:07.650
 If you went along with the center head the country did not go 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:14.680
 Muramatsu head does not become a goal, but Shimizu pushes back the flow 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:19.680
 Butt end is head match in the Omiya 33 minutes Ueda corner kick to increase this a severity 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 If Omiya gets offensive again, another 35 minutes 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.820
 I went to remember and light Asked 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.330
 Middle East intensely 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:37.460
 There was punch power but it was out of the frame 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:38.240
 Naa was a black number in that contains and the world are again series 3 right Oshidama' in 41 minutes 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.030
 When saying 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.710
 Perot is a shooter block Ape Olympics Well shoot Takagi'm Now the day has come 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.950
 It was decisive but not a goal 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.840
 Ishii one attack and defense to the second half in the scoreless 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.500
 And after that, the series which has not been changed to the seiba from the second half start and launch the valley 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.500
 I come out to play 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.270
 However Omiya took first 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.610
 Urakami I cut back from here without hitting 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.610
 Shimizu 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.190
 Lacie heart was a 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.420
 King-like sounds off-the-shelf 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:26.360
 I could see the body in my ear, but I missed my speed every hour 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.380
 It was the first control of the matching utilization 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.840
 Omiya takes the lead in the series's first goal of the season for 52 minutes 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.840
 However, only 3 minutes after that, Shimizu counter 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.510
 Nail principle 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.849
 I am a guest 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.849
 Or say autumn or winter by yourself 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:56.950
 Tying goal late thrown-in Valley respond to the appointment 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:59.780
 Series catches up with 55 minutes of official game 2 games consecutive goal of valley 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.180
 Then Omiya Zuratandu in 60 minutes 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:09.490
 In the 66th minute, I put on the top 2 of the edge plan that I had saved with Novacovich 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.490
 But the flow is 79 minutes Shimizu 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.159
 Interesting from the softer because it is a beautiful you 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.760
 Hiraoka's first season this season 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.760
 Series succeeds in reversal with the first multiple points of the tournament 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.860
 My heart was one minute behind 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.780
 the back is good 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.280
 Here standing 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.240
 So borsa dog 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.240
 Enter 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:49.440
 I did it in 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.440
 Omiya will catch up with the combination of 8 people for two yen on the way 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.120
 But 83 minutes 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.900
 Yes etc. Try to earnings Italy but bring dribbles to the vertical on their own 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.900
 If Bring 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:15.549
 It is a valley from hitting the contraction to the connection of intense points 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:15.549
 The finalist of the series last tournament which beat Omiya 3 to 2 is the first victory of this tournament finally
