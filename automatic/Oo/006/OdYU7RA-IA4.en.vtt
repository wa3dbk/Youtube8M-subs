isn't done by bringing cymbals far apart

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
isn't done by bringing cymbals far apart
and<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.400> crashing<00:01:29.790> them<00:01:29.909> together<00:01:30.259> most<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and then crashing them together most of

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.109 
and then crashing them together most of
the<00:01:31.500> sound<00:01:31.740> comes<00:01:31.829> from<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.310> how<00:01:32.460> fast<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the sound comes from just how fast the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.679 
the sound comes from just how fast the
cymbals<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:33.960> coming<00:01:34.470> together

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.429 

when<00:01:41.689> you're<00:01:41.810> crashing<00:01:42.109> the<00:01:42.170> cymbals

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
when you're crashing the cymbals

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.560 
when you're crashing the cymbals
together<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:43.070> want<00:01:43.219> to<00:01:43.310> avoid<00:01:43.579> bringing<00:01:44.179> all

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
together you want to avoid bringing all

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.480 
together you want to avoid bringing all
of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.079> edges<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.859> cymbal<00:01:46.130> together<00:01:46.369> at

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
of the edges of the cymbal together at

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.639 
of the edges of the cymbal together at
the<00:01:46.579> same<00:01:46.789> time<00:01:47.119> this<00:01:47.750> will<00:01:47.929> create<00:01:48.109> an<00:01:48.289> air

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
the same time this will create an air

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.830 
the same time this will create an air
pocket<00:01:52.000> which<00:01:53.000> is<00:01:53.090> not<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.539> sound<00:01:53.750> that

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
pocket which is not the sound that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.289 
pocket which is not the sound that
you're<00:01:53.990> looking<00:01:54.259> for<00:01:54.610> also<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.819> really

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
you're looking for also a really

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.059 
you're looking for also a really
important<00:01:56.750> part<00:01:56.959> of<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.110> cymbal<00:01:57.530> crash<00:01:57.770> is

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
important part of the cymbal crash is

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.059 
important part of the cymbal crash is
the<00:01:58.429> follow-through<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.780> after<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.740> cymbals

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
the follow-through so after the cymbals

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.190 
the follow-through so after the cymbals
have<00:02:01.159> come<00:02:01.340> together<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:02.299> sound<00:02:02.509> isn't<00:02:02.840> done

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
have come together the sound isn't done

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.529 
have come together the sound isn't done
yet<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.890> ringing<00:02:04.219> of<00:02:04.429> the<00:02:04.490> cymbals<00:02:04.909> after<00:02:05.450> the

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
yet the ringing of the cymbals after the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.330 
yet the ringing of the cymbals after the
actual<00:02:05.810> crash<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.409> just<00:02:06.679> as<00:02:06.799> important<00:02:07.159> as<00:02:07.250> the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
actual crash is just as important as the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.660 
actual crash is just as important as the
crash<00:02:07.579> cell<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:08.750> make<00:02:09.410> sure<00:02:09.440> that<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:10.099> keep

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
crash cell so make sure that you keep

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.160 
crash cell so make sure that you keep
your<00:02:10.819> hands<00:02:11.030> off<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.390> cymbals<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:11.930> that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
your hands off the cymbals and that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.210 
your hands off the cymbals and that
you're<00:02:12.290> not<00:02:12.380> setting<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.709> cymbals<00:02:13.040> down

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
you're not setting the cymbals down

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.130 
you're not setting the cymbals down
until<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.239> sound<00:02:14.510> should<00:02:14.989> be<00:02:15.049> finished<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
until the sound should be finished the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.330 
until the sound should be finished the
important<00:02:21.500> thing<00:02:21.620> with<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.799> follow-through

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
important thing with the follow-through

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.130 
important thing with the follow-through
is<00:02:22.489> that<00:02:22.879> you're<00:02:23.030> allowing<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.599> cymbals<00:02:23.989> to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
is that you're allowing the cymbals to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.470 
is that you're allowing the cymbals to
ring<00:02:24.379> after<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.069> crash<00:02:25.340> there's<00:02:26.120> no<00:02:26.209> extra

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
ring after the crash there's no extra

ring after the crash there's no extra
points<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:26.870> showing<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:27.440> cymbals<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.890> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
points for showing the cymbals to the

sound after the crash to muffle you

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.700 
sound after the crash to muffle you
simply<00:03:40.660> bring<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.960> cymbals<00:03:41.260> into<00:03:41.440> your<00:03:41.560> body

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
to stop them from vibrating you can

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.270 
to stop them from vibrating you can
muffle<00:03:48.880> very<00:03:49.510> gradually<00:03:50.200> over<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.650> long<00:03:50.890> period
