00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.730
 hello friends happy to be once 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.620
 more with you notice that here we have 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.719
 had many summer storms and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.000
 between the water and the sun our plants 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.330
 have grown more than normal what 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.740
 It would be usual in this month of August 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.080
 look what we have here in our 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.109
 orange tree and here if so much that has 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.839
 disheveled completely as always 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.820
 I mention the fruit trees and especially the 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.400
 citrus we have to treat them in a 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.970
 compact to try to make your cup be 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.770
 always compensated and that does not exceed 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.690
 for example the volume let's say that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.030
 would have to root we will compensate the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.910
 aerial part that are the leaves with the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.190
 part of the root as we have to try to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.289
 keep this good is some form of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.600
 our orange tree what we have to do 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.539
 it's pruning, it's a pity 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.130
 all these beautiful new branches and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.230
 young people who have come to our lake 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.870
 this day what we call may 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.310
 I commented training in another chapter 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.740
 since we talked about citrus 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.350
 when we buy an orange tree, it usually comes 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.780
 well with some more grown branch of 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.930
 normal with very tender leaves and that 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.240
 these branches had to be pruned so that 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.520
 the plant takes strength will be a little 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.860
 the same case on another occasion we will talk 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.860
 of pruning and more severe that there is 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.240
 give it to take force fijaros 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.190
 what we have to do is catch by 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.200
 example this branch same as you see 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.510
 we also did not give him treatment two 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.240
 copper circles you can clearly see the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.450
 old branches are more mature and the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.729
 branches more lands we would take this that 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.920
 you see we get completely out of the 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.920
 cup and lacort we would do 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.829
 with this remember that we can make a 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.200
 organic fertilizer and we would continue 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.659
 taking care trying to maintain the shape 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.189
 orange lemon tree although forgiveness 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.289
 in my case the lemon tree could also 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.450
 do anything equally for example this 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.850
 second branch that we have here does not 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.709
 It is necessary that we cut completely 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.160
 that if we want it to grow that 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.650
 go acquiring more volume we would cut 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.049
 half 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.200
 of the new branch in this case then for 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.840
 here and we would leave you some of these 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.200
 tender leaves that have been coming out for 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.840
 that acquires volume 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.430
 but that this advice has been useful to you 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.099
 because I know that many of you have 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.019
 and lemon and orange trees in pots that I 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.090
 send many messages on Facebook 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.330
 and you leave very clear what you are already 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.000
 investigating with fruit trees in a pot 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.190
 so you already know how to put it into practice and 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.019
 see you on facebook and in the next the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.019
 Orchard at home almost all
