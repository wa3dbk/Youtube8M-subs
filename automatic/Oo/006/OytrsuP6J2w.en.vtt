well<00:00:09.850> I'm<00:00:10.090> trying<00:00:10.270> to<00:00:10.510> learn<00:00:10.630> how<00:00:10.690> to<00:00:10.900> use

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
well I'm trying to learn how to use

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.720 
well I'm trying to learn how to use

design CAD version 22 in 3d animation
mode<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:16.840> particularly<00:00:17.619> I'm<00:00:17.710> trying<00:00:17.980> to<00:00:18.070> do<00:00:18.189> a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
mode and particularly I'm trying to do a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.260 
mode and particularly I'm trying to do a
an<00:00:18.700> animation<00:00:19.330> of<00:00:19.810> a<00:00:20.110> steam<00:00:20.650> piston<00:00:21.220> and<00:00:22.090> I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
an animation of a steam piston and I

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.150 
an animation of a steam piston and I
wanted<00:00:22.540> to<00:00:22.630> actually<00:00:22.810> enemy<00:00:23.500> what<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:23.890> steam

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
wanted to actually enemy what the steam

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.420 
wanted to actually enemy what the steam
was<00:00:24.460> doing<00:00:24.790> I<00:00:25.020> started<00:00:26.020> out<00:00:26.140> with<00:00:26.380> an<00:00:26.860> older

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
was doing I started out with an older

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.650 
was doing I started out with an older
version<00:00:27.579> of<00:00:27.880> design<00:00:28.240> CAD<00:00:28.540> version<00:00:29.380> 17<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.730> it

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
version of design CAD version 17 and it

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.510 
version of design CAD version 17 and it
was<00:00:31.810> capable<00:00:32.020> of<00:00:32.290> doing<00:00:32.439> animations<00:00:33.160> but<00:00:33.370> it

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
was capable of doing animations but it

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.310 
was capable of doing animations but it
really<00:00:33.820> couldn't<00:00:34.060> do<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.420> steam<00:00:34.780> effect<00:00:35.170> that

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
really couldn't do the steam effect that

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.200 
really couldn't do the steam effect that
I<00:00:35.410> wanted<00:00:35.680> then<00:00:36.280> I<00:00:36.400> discovered<00:00:36.940> I<00:00:37.030> had

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
I wanted then I discovered I had

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.930 
I wanted then I discovered I had
purchased<00:00:37.510> version<00:00:38.290> 21<00:00:38.800> I<00:00:39.100> could<00:00:39.550> get<00:00:39.700> it<00:00:39.820> to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
purchased version 21 I could get it to

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.910 
purchased version 21 I could get it to
do<00:00:40.060> the<00:00:40.300> color<00:00:40.570> change<00:00:40.900> animation<00:00:41.500> I<00:00:41.620> wanted

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
do the color change animation I wanted

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.630 
do the color change animation I wanted
to<00:00:42.010> do<00:00:42.160> but<00:00:42.370> couldn't<00:00:43.120> get<00:00:43.450> it<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.980> save<00:00:44.980> avi

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
to do but couldn't get it to save avi

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.700 
to do but couldn't get it to save avi
files<00:00:46.060> properly<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:46.720> I<00:00:46.750> just<00:00:47.020> downloaded

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
files properly so I just downloaded

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.800 
files properly so I just downloaded
version<00:00:48.040> 22<00:00:48.700> and<00:00:48.940> it's<00:00:49.060> making<00:00:49.300> pretty<00:00:49.690> good

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
version 22 and it's making pretty good

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.710 
version 22 and it's making pretty good
AVI<00:00:50.230> files<00:00:50.700> I'm<00:00:51.700> still<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.030> little<00:00:52.330> rough<00:00:52.570> on

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
AVI files I'm still a little rough on

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.570 
AVI files I'm still a little rough on
using<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.200> 3d<00:00:53.590> features<00:00:54.040> I've<00:00:54.220> been<00:00:54.370> using

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
using the 3d features I've been using

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.390 
using the 3d features I've been using
design<00:00:55.060> CAD<00:00:55.360> since<00:00:55.750> back<00:00:56.110> in<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.380> 80s<00:00:56.740> but

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
design CAD since back in the 80s but

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.360 
design CAD since back in the 80s but
I've<00:00:57.580> almost<00:00:57.940> always<00:00:58.150> done<00:00:58.570> worked<00:00:58.810> in<00:00:59.020> 2d<00:00:59.470> so

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
I've almost always done worked in 2d so

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.860 
I've almost always done worked in 2d so
I'm<00:01:00.610> still<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.850> little<00:01:01.060> rough<00:01:01.270> on<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.480> 3d

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
I'm still a little rough on the 3d

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.460 
I'm still a little rough on the 3d
processes<00:01:02.590> but<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.730> 3d<00:01:04.390> animation<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.350> the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
processes but the 3d animation of the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.010 
processes but the 3d animation of the
piston<00:01:05.890> itself<00:01:06.070> is<00:01:06.610> fairly<00:01:07.180> easy<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:07.810> is

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
piston itself is fairly easy and is

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.300 
piston itself is fairly easy and is
covered<00:01:08.380> in<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.590> manual<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.600> steam

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
covered in the manual but the steam

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
covered in the manual but the steam
volume<00:01:12.310> I<00:01:12.430> wanted<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.850> transparent<00:01:14.250> steam

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
volume I wanted to transparent steam

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.110 
volume I wanted to transparent steam
volume<00:01:17.290> inside<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.950> cylinder<00:01:18.370> that<00:01:18.550> changed

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
volume inside the cylinder that changed

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.840 
volume inside the cylinder that changed
size<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.930> changed<00:01:20.560> color<00:01:20.830> going<00:01:21.490> from<00:01:21.670> red

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
size and changed color going from red

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.899 
size and changed color going from red
indicating<00:01:22.420> hot<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.990> white<00:01:23.200> indicating

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
indicating hot to white indicating

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.140 
indicating hot to white indicating
condensing<00:01:24.909> steam<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.450> forming<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.970> those

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
condensing steam is forming so those

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.810 
condensing steam is forming so those
effects<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.780> turns<00:01:29.020> out<00:01:29.260> are<00:01:29.830> possible<00:01:30.550> in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
effects that turns out are possible in

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.120 
effects that turns out are possible in
version<00:01:31.270> 22<00:01:31.810> takes<00:01:32.470> a<00:01:32.650> little<00:01:32.890> bit<00:01:33.070> of

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
version 22 takes a little bit of

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.670 
version 22 takes a little bit of
trickery<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:33.790> do<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.120> but<00:01:34.659> I<00:01:34.690> managed<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.080> get<00:01:35.350> a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
trickery to do it but I managed to get a

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.740 
trickery to do it but I managed to get a
volume<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.490> steam<00:01:36.729> expanding<00:01:37.570> in<00:01:37.720> the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
volume of steam expanding in the

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.860 
volume of steam expanding in the
cylinder<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.970> cylinder<00:01:40.390> moves<00:01:40.420> and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
cylinder as the cylinder moves and

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.770 
cylinder as the cylinder moves and
changing<00:01:41.620> color<00:01:41.830> so<00:01:42.520> I'm<00:01:42.729> starting<00:01:43.240> out<00:01:43.360> with

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
changing color so I'm starting out with

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.820 
changing color so I'm starting out with
the<00:01:44.520> piston<00:01:45.520> screen<00:01:46.260> showing<00:01:47.260> all<00:01:47.620> three

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
the piston screen showing all three

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.690 
the piston screen showing all three
views<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:49.560> three-dimensional<00:01:50.560> view<00:01:51.159> on

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
views and the three-dimensional view on

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.609 
views and the three-dimensional view on
a<00:01:51.729> white<00:01:52.330> background<00:01:52.570> which<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.290> how<00:01:53.380> you'll

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
a white background which is how you'll

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
a white background which is how you'll
normally<00:01:53.770> work<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.290> go<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.530> using<00:01:57.190> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
normally work then I go to using the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.390 
normally work then I go to using the
screen<00:01:58.479> layer<00:01:58.810> tool<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.500> in<00:01:59.799> this<00:01:59.979> case<00:02:00.190> I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
screen layer tool and in this case I

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.810 
screen layer tool and in this case I
have<00:02:00.640> switched<00:02:01.000> on<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:02.340> layer<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.549> I've<00:02:03.670> got

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
have switched on the layer that I've got

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.280 
have switched on the layer that I've got
with<00:02:04.030> some<00:02:04.210> dimension<00:02:04.689> scales<00:02:04.990> and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
with some dimension scales and

with some dimension scales and
guidelines<00:02:05.470> on<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.220> can<00:02:06.430> turn<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.880> off<00:02:06.939> I

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
guidelines on it I can turn that off I

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.619 
guidelines on it I can turn that off I
can<00:02:08.379> also<00:02:08.560> turn<00:02:09.009> off<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.819> cylinder<00:02:10.420> itself

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
can also turn off the cylinder itself

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.229 
can also turn off the cylinder itself
which<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:12.250> just<00:02:12.519> in<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.760> way<00:02:12.879> of<00:02:13.090> my
