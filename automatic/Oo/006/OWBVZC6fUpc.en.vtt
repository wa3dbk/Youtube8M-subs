 of a third celpe action game 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.380
 person 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 with the plot focusing on spying I 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 I particularly like games and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.080
 yes with this espionage theme 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.280
 example rhythm also a game well 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.200
 similar to this 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.670
 but this season to the extreme in the hotel 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.990
 finder is the kind of game you can 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.090
 do exactly what you want does not have 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.679
 as much freedom as the rhythm but I 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.929
 particularly very fond of all the 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.700
 franchise even those I could play of course and 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.560
 This is one of the ones I like too. 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.720
 Of course not the best of the franchise was a 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.429
 of the first in her second game but is 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.289
 It's a really cool game and it 's worth it. 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.390
 who does not know this splinter franchise 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.099
 cell check out this game there or else 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.630
 which are very good franchises too. 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.660
 the story of the game is more or less like this 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.550
 you play it is a spy 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.800
 that was sent by the American government 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.050
 to face and achieve 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.360
 information of a mental retardant there 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.880
 Where he meets to get the guy is 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.220
 because the unfortunate put a 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.979
 virus on American soil and it exploded 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.480
 these bombs get caught then the work 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.489
 Inland Revenue is to find this guy without him 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.599
 team then I do not know when I will be I went 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.069

 playstation 2 version in the PC version 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.040
 Can you put a translation but not at the time? 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.360
 had then anyone who has pc version can 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.739
 put a translation that will understand the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.890
 story, I can not talk because I do not 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.170
 I know even playing in a cool place. 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.450
 I do not expect much action from kicking it's a 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.190
 game well stopped even though focused on 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.080
 SÃ©lvio Tranquilo has to be a spy 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.250
 this bag will drive a crazy send a 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.410
 goal shot at goal 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.940
 beauty, this is it, it is very well 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.860
 video rate was pretty short here 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.020
 but the tip is good and I hope you guys 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.330
 like shorten game if you do not know 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.790
 the channel 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.890
 I have a seri with 50 games videos 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.450
 neps you need more games beyond 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.550
 Silva it's just you look in my play 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.250
 list where you will find several 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.850
 fps rpg and mirÃ³ games 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.100
 among other car adventure action for 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.170
 the games there then you only have to click on the 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.330
 my channel that will apply lightweight games 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.610
 will have multiple games sitting on a video 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.470
 There's only so much people asking me about 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.480
 you put games should only be shows 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.200
 a game that's why I split it into a video 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.910
 only 150 games okay this but I separate in 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.980
 video only then each game has a video 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.960
 for each game and do not think that's 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.970

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.160
