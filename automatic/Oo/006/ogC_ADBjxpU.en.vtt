00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.650 
sturdy and then it's got the double
spinning<00:04:24.150> action<00:04:24.539> here<00:04:25.039> with<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.570> like<00:04:27.570> you

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
this figure is that if you see the

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.089 
this figure is that if you see the
lightsaber<00:05:56.190> here<00:05:57.590> it's<00:05:58.590> not<00:05:58.770> it's<00:05:59.699> not<00:05:59.880> really

lightsaber here it's not it's not really
you<00:06:02.099> can<00:06:02.220> get<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:02.490> in<00:06:02.669> there

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
you can get that in there

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.709 
you can get that in there
this<00:06:05.220> looks<00:06:05.400> like<00:06:05.490> a<00:06:05.580> little<00:06:05.669> tab<00:06:06.000> here<00:06:06.030> if<00:06:06.360> you

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
this looks like a little tab here if you

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.560 
this looks like a little tab here if you
look<00:06:06.870> at<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.110> hand<00:06:07.700> or<00:06:08.700> either<00:06:08.969> hand<00:06:09.360> actually

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.790 
look at the hand or either hand actually
it's<00:06:12.570> really<00:06:12.780> hard<00:06:13.020> to<00:06:13.110> get<00:06:13.260> him<00:06:13.350> to<00:06:13.380> hold<00:06:13.620> it

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
it's really hard to get him to hold it

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.410 
it's really hard to get him to hold it
unless<00:06:14.070> you<00:06:14.190> kind<00:06:14.370> of<00:06:14.400> just<00:06:14.550> angle<00:06:15.120> it<00:06:15.210> right

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
unless you kind of just angle it right

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.390 
unless you kind of just angle it right
they<00:06:15.690> didn't<00:06:15.960> think<00:06:16.560> ahead<00:06:16.710> on<00:06:16.950> that<00:06:16.980> one<00:06:17.280> so

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
they didn't think ahead on that one so

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.580 
they didn't think ahead on that one so
you<00:06:17.520> kind<00:06:17.730> of<00:06:17.790> just<00:06:17.970> kind<00:06:18.750> of<00:06:18.840> prop<00:06:19.320> it<00:06:19.500> in

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
you kind of just kind of prop it in

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.900 
you kind of just kind of prop it in
there<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.770> little<00:06:19.890> bit<00:06:20.100> get<00:06:20.490> him<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.640> hold<00:06:20.730> it

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
there a little bit get him to hold it

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.200 
there a little bit get him to hold it
just<00:06:21.150> right

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
just right

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.910 
just right
see<00:06:24.210> like<00:06:24.960> if<00:06:25.080> you<00:06:25.200> just<00:06:25.350> move<00:06:25.560> them<00:06:25.710> a<00:06:25.740> little

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
see like if you just move them a little

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.450 
see like if you just move them a little
bit<00:06:26.100> I<00:06:26.600> think<00:06:27.600> I<00:06:27.660> want<00:06:27.870> to<00:06:27.930> slide<00:06:28.200> around<00:06:28.460> yeah

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
bit I think I want to slide around yeah

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.420 
bit I think I want to slide around yeah
so<00:06:29.640> that's<00:06:29.820> the<00:06:29.940> only<00:06:30.030> downside<00:06:30.300> there<00:06:31.190> as<00:06:32.190> far

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
so that's the only downside there as far

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.510 
so that's the only downside there as far
as<00:06:32.490> that's<00:06:32.670> concerned<00:06:33.980> so<00:06:34.980> if<00:06:35.070> you<00:06:35.160> just<00:06:35.310> play

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
as that's concerned so if you just play

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.000 
as that's concerned so if you just play
with<00:06:35.640> it<00:06:35.730> a<00:06:35.790> little<00:06:35.880> bit<00:06:36.680> and<00:06:37.680> then<00:06:37.800> you<00:06:37.890> get

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
with it a little bit and then you get

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:46.250 
with it a little bit and then you get
him<00:06:38.130> on<00:06:38.510> the<00:06:39.510> stand<00:06:44.690> then<00:06:45.690> he<00:06:45.780> stands<00:06:46.050> quite

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
him on the stand then he stands quite

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.310 
him on the stand then he stands quite
well<00:06:46.530> and<00:06:47.490> then<00:06:47.640> he<00:06:47.730> makes<00:06:47.880> for<00:06:48.120> a<00:06:48.150> good<00:06:48.360> good

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
well and then he makes for a good good

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.020 
well and then he makes for a good good
display<00:06:49.740> piece<00:06:51.170> so<00:06:52.170> there<00:06:52.320> you<00:06:52.380> go
