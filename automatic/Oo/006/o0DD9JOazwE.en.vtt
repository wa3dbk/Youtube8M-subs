00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
sammy i managed to get really really

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.040 
sammy i managed to get really really
lucky<00:00:50.969> actually<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> gob<00:00:52.020> of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
lucky actually and get a gob of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.639 
lucky actually and get a gob of
subjugation<00:00:52.920> which<00:00:53.280> kind<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.870> really

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
subjugation which kind of and was really

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.799 
subjugation which kind of and was really
surprising<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.579> honest<00:00:56.789> whenever<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
surprising to be honest whenever I go to

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
surprising to be honest whenever I go to
zamorak<00:00:58.230> I'm<00:00:58.469> always<00:00:58.620> really<00:00:59.010> unlucky<00:00:59.399> there

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
zamorak I'm always really unlucky there

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
zamorak I'm always really unlucky there
so<00:01:00.120> my<00:01:00.329> luck<00:01:00.480> must<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.870> been<00:01:00.989> balanced<00:01:01.410> out

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
so my luck must have been balanced out

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.490 
so my luck must have been balanced out
for<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.640> hour<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.090> say<00:01:03.930> let's<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.350> take<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
for this hour and say let's just take a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
for this hour and say let's just take a
look<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> standard<00:01:05.460> loop<00:01:05.670> battle<00:01:06.210> managed

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
look at the standard loop battle managed

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.800 
look at the standard loop battle managed
to<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.840> I've<00:01:06.900> got<00:01:07.020> 275<00:01:07.380> k<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.040> coins<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
to get so I've got 275 k in coins and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
to get so I've got 275 k in coins and
1.2<00:01:09.810> mil<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> whole<00:01:10.439> hour<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.860> then<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
1.2 mil for the whole hour and then the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
1.2 mil for the whole hour and then the
garbage<00:01:12.090> subjugation<00:01:12.450> brings<00:01:12.840> up<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> 9

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
garbage subjugation brings up to 9

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.109 
garbage subjugation brings up to 9
million<00:01:13.619> hour<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> want<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> look<00:01:15.060> for

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
million hour so if you want to look for

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.929 
million hour so if you want to look for
thanh<00:01:15.600> average<00:01:16.140> rate<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.189> zamorak<00:01:17.640> you'll<00:01:17.880> be

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
thanh average rate at zamorak you'll be

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.060 
thanh average rate at zamorak you'll be
looking<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.450> point<00:01:18.600> two<00:01:19.110> depends<00:01:20.009> how

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
looking at one point two depends how

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.469 
looking at one point two depends how
lucky<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> herbs<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.390> that
