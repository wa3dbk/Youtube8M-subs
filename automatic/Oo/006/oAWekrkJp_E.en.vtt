00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190 

I<00:00:00.260> made<00:00:01.260> YouTube<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:02.570> want<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.659> show<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:03.899> guys

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
I made YouTube I want to show you guys

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.900 
I made YouTube I want to show you guys
said<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.500> overclocked<00:00:05.490> my<00:00:06.089> CPU<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:08.599> 4.0<00:00:09.599> -<00:00:10.880> so<00:00:11.880> I

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
said I overclocked my CPU to 4.0 - so I

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.279 
said I overclocked my CPU to 4.0 - so I
overclocked<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:14.089> this<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.330> 10<00:00:15.870> -<00:00:15.929> 55

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
overclocked it and this is the 10 - 55

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.429 
overclocked it and this is the 10 - 55
is<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:17.039> see<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:18.570> was<00:00:18.960> damn<00:00:19.470> easy<00:00:21.140> it<00:00:22.140> was

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
is I can see and it was damn easy it was

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.259 
is I can see and it was damn easy it was
there<00:00:22.650> means<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.070> got<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.310> tell<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.970> that's

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
there means I got to tell you and that's

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.800 
there means I got to tell you and that's
all<00:00:24.570> things<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:26.779> disability<00:00:27.779> right<00:00:27.990> here<00:00:29.810> now

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
all things to disability right here now

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.069 
all things to disability right here now
what<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.170> did<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.560> -<00:00:31.980> arista<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.570> increase

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
what I did is - arista is to increase

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.540 
what I did is - arista is to increase
the<00:00:34.440> CPU<00:00:35.100> voltage<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.950> point

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the CPU voltage to this to one point

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.470 
the CPU voltage to this to one point
four<00:00:39.059> seventy-five<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.969> increase<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.210> drain

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
four seventy-five and increase the drain

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.979 
four seventy-five and increase the drain
voltage<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.469> point<00:00:43.860> seven<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.340> five<00:00:44.550> and

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
voltage to one point seven and five and

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.510 
voltage to one point seven and five and
this<00:00:47.270> did<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> automatically<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.410> me<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
this did it automatically for me so I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.189 
this did it automatically for me so I
don't<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> mess<00:00:51.239> around<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.930> too

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
don't have to mess around with this too

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.700 
don't have to mess around with this too
much<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.550> idea<00:00:53.910> means<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.079> all

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
much and the idea means this and all

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.490 
much and the idea means this and all
cores<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.789> course<00:00:57.420> running<00:00:57.780> and<00:01:00.289> this<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
cores of course running and this is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.820 
cores of course running and this is
running<00:01:02.100> automatically<00:01:03.229> saddle<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.409> don't

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
running automatically saddle I don't

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.679 
running automatically saddle I don't
matter

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:17.300 

so<00:01:09.689> yeah<00:01:10.820> damn<00:01:11.820> easy<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:15.200> it's<00:01:16.200> stable<00:01:16.560> trust

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
so yeah damn easy and it's stable trust

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.090 
so yeah damn easy and it's stable trust
mistake<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.450> once<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.170> hit<00:01:19.439> how

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
mistake it was because once you hit how

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.520 
mistake it was because once you hit how
to<00:01:20.159> tune<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.670> start<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.630> will<00:01:21.930> make<00:01:22.200> some

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
to tune and start it will make some

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.740 
to tune and start it will make some
instability<00:01:22.920> test<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> back<00:01:24.330> went<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
instability test and the back went to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.399 
instability test and the back went to
check<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.350> everything<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.890> okay<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:27.409> yeah

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
check if everything is okay and yeah

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.200 
check if everything is okay and yeah
it's<00:01:28.650> okay<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.460> running<00:01:29.729> good<00:01:29.850> I'd<00:01:30.090> be

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's okay so it's running good I'd be

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.910 
it's okay so it's running good I'd be
running<00:01:30.390> games<00:01:32.960> no<00:01:33.960> sign<00:01:34.259> everything's<00:01:34.799> good

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
running games no sign everything's good

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.270 
running games no sign everything's good
so<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> show<00:01:39.329> you

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
so I'm going to show you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.880 
so I'm going to show you
so<00:01:41.090> if<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:41.390> pinch<00:01:41.720> more<00:01:45.640> CPU

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.990 

motherboard<00:01:50.140> so<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.200> can<00:01:51.410> see<00:01:51.700> when<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.820> can

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
motherboard so I can see when you can

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.340 
motherboard so I can see when you can
pout<00:01:53.300> some<00:01:53.690> read<00:01:54.250> memory

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.130 

a<00:02:01.409> speedy

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.990 

so<00:02:07.740> I'm<00:02:08.009> running<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.490> firm<00:02:08.790> modulars<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:11.000> yep

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so I'm running a firm modulars and yep

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.160 
so I'm running a firm modulars and yep
and<00:02:12.330> video<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:14.120> thank<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.210> for<00:02:15.360> watching<00:02:15.600> and
