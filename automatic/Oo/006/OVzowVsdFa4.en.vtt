 And their mode gets a clone of humans 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.760
 There was animal alienation or alien case 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.779
 In the end they do not change the fact that they are human clones 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.840
 All characters are driven by human beings 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:35.340
 After all, they can see human shells as robots or dolls. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:41.219
 Whether they are at some situations that you why they should be any action 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.460
 The story of the explaining game is, in most cases, 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.789
 It has only worked as a tool. 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.180
 This is due to the nature of the genre of games 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:56.840
 And the characteristics in that genre are heavily influenced by technology 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.030
 After a certain period of time has passed since the genre of games began 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.860
 Now we are not perfect, but the development of the human race 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:10.010

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.060
 The game 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:32.229
 It begins with a stunning intro as soon as you start the game the player decorations 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:37.270
 I feel emotion to the character to be manipulated . 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.009
 One very clever way that he can see a very dangerous way pipe progression of the story 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.930
 I was there. 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:48.640
 You can focus on gameplay, but on the other hand, 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:53.370
 It's because of the burden of having to give a bigger impact. 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:58.470
 This game has perfectly adjusted those parts. 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:03.690
 Rather calmly naemeurosseo released the strong feelings of that doctor game intro 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.910
 Presenting persuasiveness in the events happening within and the psychological state of the character and the characters 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.320
 I will. 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.780
 The pain of losing a daughter and the fall of three more Let's go in the autumn of a great incident 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:19.140
 The second case 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:23.490
 So the destruction of the world is not so important. 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.350
 I can tell by looking at his lung cancer has suffered a lot, but adapt 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.780
 He's living. 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:35.190
 In a word , Joel is a crucifix. 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:39.870
 Yucca Menu Bar After all the other machines of the characters , 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.310
 You can create or make an organization to steal loot or keep it under control of the army. 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.840
 Compared to something 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:51.020
 He alone is the way to survive relatively freely across multiple places 23 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:55.730
 Visa I feel I have been living a successful life . 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:00.470
 But each in his heart that sleek disrepair and thus fall colors 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:05.930
 A plain and affectionate fool without any speciality , some of his looks are gone. 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.630
 You can feel that you have become very violent. 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:13.730
 1 I bought this one for the first time. 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.010
 Her daughter's death was a far more important event to him than to the destruction of the world 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.819
 It's very much here. 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.420
 I'm feeling lost. 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.359
 Eli is the screw for him . 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.239
 It's a girl who can change the future of humanity . 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.239
 And the time for his choice comes to him 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.200
 This game has a linear structure 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.320
 Not many players can choose 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:47.470
 I will avoid or kill the enemy 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:52.360
 There are no other choices. Games can only be played in one way. 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:56.650
 Just follow the story and move along. 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.120
 And that's exactly what makes this game's creations 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.000
 Will 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.530
 Understand the story. 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.750
 The game succeeds in passing the story of all the gameplay 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:15.330
 Lots of games that could not understand what the story was after 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:20.489
 The point is that the game is a success. 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:25.980
 Until now , we have been discussing this game differently than the review , 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:30.240
 Why did not you talk about the part ? It's the roof . 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:34.170
 The goal of the game to deliver the story was written the story in the game 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:41.190
 I have to give up without giving up part of this game 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:45.990
 To give the story changed everything ok end graphics words sound produced smoke 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:51.990
 Everything from gameplay to play does not interfere with delivering stories. 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.700
 I would rather have helped you perfectly rather than Kai Man Story 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.110
 For games that matter 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.460
 If you can not make it into a movie or a novel, you might be criticized. 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.260
 There is 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.010
 US games are a way of delivering stories in ways that only individuals can 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.010
 You have 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:16.599
 I used to go through the desperate things I had to survive. 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:23.199
 Feelings of fear of humans trying to kill me 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:27.770
 It is maximized by the player's situation in the game than in the dialogue or cut scenes 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:33.349
 It's an area that has not done any movies or novels in the meantime. 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:37.099
 The presence of Ely, the most powerful woman in the history of the game , 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:40.550
 Gives players a fear of loss 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:43.759
 It 's scary because it's precious. 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.349
 And that's when you play Ellie . 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.879
 Anxiety and fears that the absence of Joel is horrible ceremony that some genealogy 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:55.009
 Will 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:56.030
 It is the s1 iran effect from the beginning to be afraid of each other's absence of each other 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.659
 Tenya 2 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.159
 I bring a sense of loss of existence is the most feared foreign m 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:05.690

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.340
 Deliver emotion through story

 That is, Eli and Joel 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:25.620
 And in this game, many characters are not human characters but game characters 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:29.600
 Possible because agarose to anyone 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.660
