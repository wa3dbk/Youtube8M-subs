00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.020
 three- day diet 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.969
 when gazar 5 kilos is perhaps the dream of 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.830
 many of us 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.990
 there are many benefits in the loss 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.580
 of weight if a moderate rhythm is made to 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.750
 through healthy eating and 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.580
 of exercise 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.920
 but today I'm going to tell you a very 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.560
 fast almost miraculous if it were not because 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.599
 you must put a little bit of your part the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.180
 enormous advantage of this diet is that only 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.890
 lasts three days this type of diet is 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.320
 they do when they take excess weight and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.470
 you need to download them quickly though 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.970
 we must comply with it literally 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.080
 that its success lies in the mixture of 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.489
 food and it can be easily done 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.040
 because as we indicated earlier 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.140
 it only lasts three days and it is very important 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.920
 respect the intake times of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.660
 foods 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.810
 right as is breakfast 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.340
 lunch and dinner 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.960
 just as I 'm going to indicate 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.490
 but before you start and pass 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.710
 fully to the development of this 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.780
 powerful and effective diet I want you 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.070
 know and keep in mind that this 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 type of diets has given very good 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.570
 results in thousands of people who 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.710
 have followed literally but without 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.930
 However, it is also recommended 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.610
 consult with a specialist before 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.590
 start any kind of regime 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.630
 food 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.649
 [Music] 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.090
 first day breakfast of black coffee

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.460
 whole roast with a thin layer of 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.010
 fresh cheese lunch 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.130

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.820

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.010
 tea 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.660
 Attention to the vanilla ice cream is not 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.580
 it's about an ice cream it's actually made 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.610
 with four whites beaten to the point of 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.170
 snow and vanilla sprinkles are 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.630
 Also take in two with sweetener 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.729
 the means in the fridge before taking it 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.319
 and with the texture the flavor and the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.060
 appearance of a vanilla ice cream 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.020
 the idea is to consume a cup or half 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.410
 Protein cup according to the day 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.000

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.740
 in the bottom part we can not true 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.940
 offer an image in which it is shown 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.020
 the sequence let's say the preparation 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.020
 on this side of vanilla 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.569

 let's go on the second day to breakfast is 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.200
 true an egg cooked on the grill or in 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.689

 from vanilla to mid afternoon half banana 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.330
 in tea and finally dinner a sixth 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.420
 a cup of fresh cheese and six cookies 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.420
 salty 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.080
 we go to the third and last day 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.280
 [Music] 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:36.120
 at breakfast an apple 30 grams of 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.300
 sader cheese 5 of the salted black or 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.650
 coffee in the case of cheddar cheese 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.450
 basically it's a pale cheese with flavor 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.670
 sour originally evolution e 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.950
 england but if you can not count on 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.520
 this cheese can also be substituted 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.680
 by ricota 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.390
 but in most countries of 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.430
 Latin America from Europe and other countries 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.170
 you can find let's say society 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.720
 years in which those that are very similar 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.480
 so you should not worry press 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.350
 and we go to lunch a tin of tuna at 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.000
 natural a cup of carrots a cup 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.120
 of cauliflower and half cup of dessert 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.730

 a hard-boiled egg a slice of bread 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.850
 integral toast 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.720
 an important tip during this age 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.090
 is to drink two liters of water a day 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.360
 You can help with all kinds of teas and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.590
 coffee and tea drinks such light 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.590
 last two in moderation 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.290
 then I will read some points 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.350
 important issues related to diet 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.300
 to pay close attention 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.680
 life works with a process of 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.840
 chemical transformation and is proven 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.300
 it should not vary or replace without any 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.969
 food just skip that bridge the 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.269
 case of cheddar cheese 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.590
 you can use salt or pepper a dressing 

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:03.750
 plus 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.260
 where the amount is indicated do not 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.540
 restrictions with common sense 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.370
 the diet should be followed for three days in 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.680
 those three days you can get to lose 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.630
 up to five kilograms 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.460
 after three days of the diet it 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.220
 You can eat normally but obviously 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.830
 Do not exceed after four days 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.970
 normal can start another cycle of 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.670
 three days diet 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.830
 [Music]

 if you need to lose more weight or 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.700
 supplement this diet with a system 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.080
