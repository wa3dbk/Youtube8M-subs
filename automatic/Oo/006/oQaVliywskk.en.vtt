recently<00:00:07.380> I<00:00:07.500> realized<00:00:08.040> something<00:00:08.340> although

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
recently I realized something although

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.970 
recently I realized something although
I've<00:00:09.420> covered<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.870> lot<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.170> games<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.710> almost

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
I've covered a lot of games I almost

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.369 
I've covered a lot of games I almost
never<00:00:11.250> review<00:00:11.700> their<00:00:11.850> boxart<00:00:12.389> I'm<00:00:12.930> not<00:00:13.170> sure

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
never review their boxart I'm not sure

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.720 
never review their boxart I'm not sure
why<00:00:13.559> the

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
why the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.610 
why the
so<00:00:14.150> maybe<00:00:14.599> it<00:00:14.719> just<00:00:14.870> didn't<00:00:15.080> occur<00:00:15.289> to<00:00:15.320> me<00:00:15.440> to

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
so maybe it just didn't occur to me to

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.529 
so maybe it just didn't occur to me to
do<00:00:15.769> that<00:00:15.799> but<00:00:16.550> I<00:00:16.609> figured<00:00:17.000> you<00:00:17.150> know<00:00:17.270> why<00:00:17.480> don't

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539
