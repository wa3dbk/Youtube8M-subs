a<00:04:06.840> really<00:04:06.990> good<00:04:07.110> machine<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.740> know<00:04:07.890> sound<00:04:08.130> a

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
a really good machine you know sound a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.680 
a really good machine you know sound a
lot<00:04:08.280> really<00:04:08.460> powerful<00:04:09.000> built-in<00:04:09.300> eight<00:04:09.540> hour

lot really powerful built-in eight hour
battery<00:04:09.840> like<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.350> said<00:04:10.590> earlier<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.640> if<00:04:11.790> you

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
battery like I said earlier so if you

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.760 
battery like I said earlier so if you
aren't<00:04:12.180> long<00:04:12.330> journeys<00:04:12.870> perhaps<00:04:13.170> your<00:04:13.350> cups

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
aren't long journeys perhaps your cups

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.130 
aren't long journeys perhaps your cups

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
but you're not you know you don't mind

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.240

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
yeah I think it's definitely worth the

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.730 
yeah I think it's definitely worth the
price<00:04:30.090> if<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.419> can<00:04:30.569> afford<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:31.020> eight<00:04:31.410> hours

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740

option I think I like the sound of this

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.879 
option I think I like the sound of this
long-lasting<00:04:47.250> battery<00:04:47.879> and<00:04:48.060> maybe<00:04:48.620> maybe<00:04:49.620> in

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
long-lasting battery and maybe maybe in

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.529 
long-lasting battery and maybe maybe in
a<00:04:50.009> couple<00:04:50.039> years<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.610> come<00:04:50.789> maybe<00:04:50.970> Apple<00:04:51.360> or<00:04:51.449> do

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
a couple years to come maybe Apple or do

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.510 
a couple years to come maybe Apple or do
that<00:04:51.720> into<00:04:51.900> their<00:04:52.050> 15<00:04:52.379> inch<00:04:52.530> notebooks<00:04:52.949> maybe

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
that into their 15 inch notebooks maybe

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.279 
that into their 15 inch notebooks maybe
the<00:04:53.940> batteries<00:04:54.509> have<00:04:54.599> been<00:04:54.750> made<00:04:54.870> up<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.139> eight

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
the batteries have been made up to eight

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.600 
the batteries have been made up to eight
hours<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:56.330> maybe<00:04:57.330> they<00:04:57.659> will<00:04:58.190> be<00:04:59.190> longer<00:04:59.400> life

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
hours and maybe they will be longer life

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.089 
hours and maybe they will be longer life
batteries<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:01.470> there's<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.680> lot<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.830> people

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
batteries and there's a lot of people

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:03.740 
batteries and there's a lot of people
worried<00:05:02.430> lately<00:05:02.580> about<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.060> batteries<00:05:03.599> and

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
worried lately about the batteries and

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.809 
worried lately about the batteries and
the<00:05:03.780> 15<00:05:04.139> inches<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.949> new<00:05:05.069> macbook<00:05:05.280> saying

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
the 15 inches and the new macbook saying

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.670 
the 15 inches and the new macbook saying
that<00:05:06.060> people<00:05:06.780> are<00:05:06.870> worried<00:05:07.110> about<00:05:07.289> not<00:05:07.500> asking

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
that people are worried about not asking

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.430 
that people are worried about not asking
letter<00:05:08.310> lasting<00:05:08.789> very<00:05:08.909> long<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:10.139> I<00:05:10.229> think

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
letter lasting very long and I think

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.860 
letter lasting very long and I think
that's<00:05:10.590> simply<00:05:10.949> to<00:05:11.099> do<00:05:11.340> due<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.449> what<00:05:12.599> sort<00:05:12.840> of

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
that's simply to do due to what sort of

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.080 
that's simply to do due to what sort of
batteries<00:05:13.319> you<00:05:14.190> know<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.310> get<00:05:14.490> five<00:05:14.729> hours

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
else maybe I could tell you about it if

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.159 
else maybe I could tell you about it if
you<00:05:51.210> look<00:05:51.360> perhaps<00:05:51.479> if<00:05:51.690> you're<00:05:51.810> looking<00:05:52.080> to

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
you look perhaps if you're looking to

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.909 
you look perhaps if you're looking to
buy<00:05:52.319> one<00:05:53.690> I'm<00:05:54.690> not<00:05:54.840> sure<00:05:54.900> if<00:05:55.770> it's<00:05:56.099> just<00:05:56.699> me<00:05:56.759> or

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
buy one I'm not sure if it's just me or

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:04.999 
buy one I'm not sure if it's just me or
maybe<00:05:58.919> i'm<00:05:59.219> just<00:06:00.169> weird<00:06:01.169> in<00:06:01.349> the<00:06:01.440> head<00:06:01.560> but<00:06:04.009> now

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
maybe i'm just weird in the head but now

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.649 
maybe i'm just weird in the head but now
she<00:06:05.069> says<00:06:05.520> here<00:06:05.849> for<00:06:06.120> I<00:06:06.150> thought<00:06:06.389> of

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
she says here for I thought of

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.379 
she says here for I thought of
kimberlite<00:06:07.020> doesn't<00:06:07.590> say<00:06:07.889> but<00:06:08.000> if<00:06:09.000> I<00:06:09.150> look<00:06:09.300> at

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
kimberlite doesn't say but if I look at

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.089 
kimberlite doesn't say but if I look at
the<00:06:09.449> pictures<00:06:09.900> with<00:06:10.139> the<00:06:10.289> 15<00:06:10.740> inch<00:06:10.860> and

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
the pictures with the 15 inch and

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:15.649 
the pictures with the 15 inch and
17-inch<00:06:11.759> side-by-side<00:06:12.770> the<00:06:14.300> trackpad<00:06:15.300> looks

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
17-inch side-by-side the trackpad looks

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.540 
17-inch side-by-side the trackpad looks
slightly<00:06:15.990> smaller<00:06:16.560> now<00:06:16.919> I'm<00:06:17.069> not<00:06:17.250> sure<00:06:17.460> if

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
slightly smaller now I'm not sure if

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.490 
slightly smaller now I'm not sure if
that's<00:06:17.699> just<00:06:18.000> because<00:06:18.150> it's<00:06:18.900> a<00:06:19.050> bigger<00:06:19.319> laptop

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
that's just because it's a bigger laptop

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.200 
that's just because it's a bigger laptop
and<00:06:19.860> it<00:06:19.949> looks<00:06:20.159> makes<00:06:20.460> it<00:06:20.639> looks<00:06:20.849> from<00:06:21.000> all

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
and it looks makes it looks from all

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.219 
and it looks makes it looks from all
that<00:06:21.710> but<00:06:22.710> to<00:06:22.889> me<00:06:23.039> it<00:06:23.159> looks<00:06:23.310> light<00:06:24.229> slightly

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
that but to me it looks light slightly

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.769 
that but to me it looks light slightly
not<00:06:25.440> as<00:06:25.590> wide<00:06:25.949> I<00:06:26.400> think<00:06:27.210> that<00:06:27.300> could<00:06:27.449> be<00:06:27.509> just

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
not as wide I think that could be just

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.629 
not as wide I think that could be just
me<00:06:27.960> so<00:06:28.529> don't<00:06:28.740> take<00:06:28.919> don't<00:06:29.159> take<00:06:29.340> that

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
me so don't take don't take that

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.670 
me so don't take don't take that
seriously<00:06:30.090> I<00:06:30.210> might<00:06:30.389> be<00:06:30.509> just<00:06:30.690> me<00:06:30.840> if<00:06:31.409> you<00:06:31.529> are

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
seriously I might be just me if you are

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.170 
seriously I might be just me if you are
thinking<00:06:31.860> of<00:06:32.099> buying<00:06:32.279> one<00:06:32.460> don't<00:06:32.940> worry<00:06:33.120> about

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
thinking of buying one don't worry about

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.779 
thinking of buying one don't worry about
it<00:06:33.569> you<00:06:33.990> still<00:06:34.440> good<00:06:34.590> machines<00:06:34.979> just<00:06:35.610> make

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
it you still good machines just make

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:38.360 
it you still good machines just make
sure<00:06:35.820> you<00:06:35.969> check<00:06:36.180> it<00:06:36.360> out<00:06:36.449> before<00:06:37.159> before<00:06:38.159> you

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
sure you check it out before before you

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.490 
sure you check it out before before you
put<00:06:38.699> a<00:06:38.729> full<00:06:39.240> you<00:06:39.300> preorder<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:39.810> I<00:06:40.020> think

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
put a full you preorder it I think

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.250 
put a full you preorder it I think
that's<00:06:40.620> a<00:06:40.710> good<00:06:40.800> idea

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
that's a good idea

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.450 
that's a good idea
I think<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.530> best<00:06:41.710> thing<00:06:41.770> to<00:06:41.890> do<00:06:42.100> is<00:06:42.220> to<00:06:42.250> try

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
I think the best thing to do is to try

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.020 
I think the best thing to do is to try
out<00:06:42.730> first<00:06:43.120> so<00:06:43.600> what<00:06:43.720> you<00:06:43.810> think<00:06:44.910> and<00:06:45.910> those

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
out first so what you think and those

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.370 
out first so what you think and those
are<00:06:46.060> quite<00:06:46.360> a<00:06:46.390> lot<00:06:46.480> of<00:06:46.510> people<00:06:46.810> don't<00:06:47.020> like<00:06:47.110> the

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
are quite a lot of people don't like the

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.890 
are quite a lot of people don't like the
fact<00:06:47.590> that<00:06:47.680> the<00:06:47.800> cart<00:06:48.010> change<00:06:48.280> batteries

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
fact that the cart change batteries

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.230 
fact that the cart change batteries
which<00:06:49.900> I<00:06:49.990> don't<00:06:50.140> think<00:06:50.290> you<00:06:50.350> need<00:06:50.500> to<00:06:50.680> anyway

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.700 

there's<00:06:55.240> also<00:06:55.390> mean<00:06:56.020> if<00:06:56.140> you<00:06:56.200> go<00:06:56.350> on<00:06:56.440> to<00:06:56.590> this
