00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.610
 very good guys welcome back later 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.530
 millennia in another sparkle video 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 that today it will even stop you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.460
 new section think a little about the column 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.320
 in question is called the guest 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.380
 unwanted this year before I will talk about 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.330
 non-native species ie allocca is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.580
 meeting them at fort is not a thing 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.300
 native of a place means is 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.470
 own that place a rose one thing 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.660
 alloctona means is instead comes from a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 another place and we were brought species 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.290
 harmful to the environment in which they come 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.210
 imported and I decided to inaugurate 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.610
 this heading 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.320
 no less than with the killer camero ie 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.750
 cavand watch the camper 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.399
 let's start with the identikit the procambarus 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.489
 clarkii is this its scientific name 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.039
 is an original freshwater crustacean 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.510
 of the Louisiana of the central area 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.030
 southern united states and also 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.739
 in the north east area of ​​mexico 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.480
 this is why it is also called shrimp 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.190
 red of louisiana 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 this case, however, arrived in Italy in the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.869
 1991 1992 following precisely 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.119
 from the import the light areas of origin 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.909
 of a company that was in massarosa 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.380
 that is in Tuscany it is near the lake of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.780
 massaciuccoli where precisely 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 this activity had in mind of 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 start breeding these shrimps for 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.049
 make it a meat farm 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.430
 that's why I also wanted to talk for 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.670
 as before the evils of the killer shrimp 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.950
 because in fact it is about places and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.320
 for me at least they are relatively close 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.930
 the fact is that this shrimp has succeeded 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.880
 to escape and purchase farms and not 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.400
 having predators that nature indeed 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.710
 with help to keep stable 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.659
 the population has exploded because this 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.829
 shrimp has exploded and above all because 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.290
 it's called killer shrimp 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.820
 let's look at its characteristics 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.079
 first of all it has a sexual maturity 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.119
 rather early and there are even more 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.040
 of egg positions per year these 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.930
 shrimp do not take care of the offspring and in 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.500
 once they can also churn out 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.259
 from 400 to 500 eggs against 150 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.909
 of our crayfish that this 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.960
 sir with this situation has not 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.850
 could 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.370
 credible disadvantage this shrimp is 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.490
 Extremely ductile, everything 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.470
 practically both at the level of meat is 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.750
 made a population decimated 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.640
 of many amphibians such as was 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.640
 the fry eats them just fed 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.319
 of the fish the difficult ones are eaten 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.180
 and soul of the beetles that live there 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.980
 he eats even in fresh water 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.180
 plant material especially as an adult 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.950
 in short, the adult is more distinctly 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.510
 omnivore while separating the young 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.459
 instead they are more distinctly years old 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.319
 I still want to adapt with everything 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.030
 so much so that not only have they decimated the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.390
 population of some animal species but 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.010
 even people who had 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.870
 breeding of faith and lotus flowers 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.670
 they found the breeding of 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.440
 structures to these shrimps moreover 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.330
 they can also breathe oxygen 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.040
 atmospheric have not only the branches but 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.540
 I'm able to breathe in the air 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.580
 in fact reduced 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.920
 it is not uncommon to see them walking outside 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.150
 pits inhabit because at night often the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.610
 metabolism increases so they need 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.680
 more energy then breathe 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.780
 atmospheric oxygen sometimes with 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.150
 this thing can also hunt o 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.650
 even moving away from a mirror 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.329
 of water to the other when I go 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.100
 they really want this causes 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.560
 they can also live in water in water 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.269
 dirty polluted, poor in oxygen 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.940
 what is instead not possible that the 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.010
 our shrimp and instead is a guarantor 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.310
 water quality as if not 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.950
 were it enough the killer shrimp is 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.650
 bearer of the name ce.sass taci that 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.610
 it is a fungus that causes the so-called plague 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.260
 of the shrimp 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.090
 the web is that these leading crayfish do not 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.160
 that is, they kill me this holiday of 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.260
 shrimp hits the shrimp and these 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.329
 gambelli nn are healthy carriers 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.250
 so as if that were not enough, not them 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.470
 they make both our shrimp and then an ass 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.320
 bring another the mushroom oh god happened 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.690
 which pretty much kills it for this 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.370
 which in the world is known as shrimp 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.290
 red prawn from Louisiana 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.269
 only we Italians called it shrimp 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.920
 killer for this reason think of these 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.870
 its characteristics starting from 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.209
 tuscany has colonized the whole center and 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.609
 in the northern part of Italy but also 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.670
 precisely, Europe is Asia and so on 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:11.820
 that the only two places in the world that don't 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.880
 they have known populations of red shrimp 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.459
 antarctica is the australia adapt 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.320
 good both to dry climates that is where it exists 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.650
 little water or more period anyway 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.750
 dear 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.699
 alessia very low temperatures can 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.710
 dig burrows along the banks and 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.570
 they can also be quite deep 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.970
 that is to say, which says much more than one 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.889
 meter and a half that these come 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.419
 shrimp in the periods we say in which they are 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.000
 more vulnerable, for example, when they are 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.949
 the change and therefore must reform the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.750
 their exoskeleton or during the 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.699
 reproduction and various phases of their cycle 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.699
 vital this age can accommodate it 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.710
 up to 50 shrimp all together and if more 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.419
 just melt branched more precisely 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.430
 cause damage to the embankments and can 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.350
 even deal with during floods 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.600
 also digging along the banks the 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.550
 shrimp turbid water creates 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.620
 let's say a layer through which the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.389
 light passes worse and therefore the plants 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.750
 aquatic plants can also suffer from 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.669
 damage 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.680
 his activity then of removal of 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.930
 gerini avanotti etc and has anyway 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.210
 animals that eat insects has like 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.880
 consequence that harmful insects o 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.500
 for example, mosquitoes increase 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.690
 let's go back to the beginning because it was 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.789
 imported to eat so why 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.410
 we do not eat bread and weapons are not 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.990
 bad though you have to be careful 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.729
 you should never trust the prawns and yes 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.680
 fishing if you don't know anything about water 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.960
 because their soft tissues are those 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.979
 and we just go to eat 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.479
 retain heavy metals and 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.760
 toxins present in the water 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.610
 if it is true and putting the gamber in it 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.320
 water care and doing precisely in a love affair 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.960
 film that at least breeding 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.210
 he claims the metals can go away 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.099
 heavy instead they cannot pursue if 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.780
 you should not eat shrimp and yes 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.639
 they fish but even wait a couple 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.070
 of generations, in short, to make them reproduce 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.960
 etc. look for these crayfishes keep them 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.380
 also new remains domestic in aquariums 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.909
 they are easy to breed animals that yes 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.710
 can find any store from 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.840
 that filia and that also give it also 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.000
 satisfaction given their color the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.610
 their habits we say rather lively 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.099
 lately birds have been made 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.770
 clever they have eaten the leaf e 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.690
 India has started to take advantage of 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.190
 great availability of shrimp in the lake 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.620
 of massaciuccoli in fact birds like 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.020
 the red heron or the bittern or 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.449
 still the little egret and also the cormorant 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.250
 they have become even more numerous 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.409
 from the arrival of these changes among the fish 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.710
 the most avid prawn eaters 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.020
 they are the boccaloni 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.420
 the other is an alien species he also 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.190
 and even lucio is given his own 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.170
 tonnage its ferocity can to give 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.330
 any type of shrimp seems to be in the 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.910
 urban environments is even given 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.830
 from rats that as you know how they are 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.390
 the Spaniards are not very picky 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.250
 they managed to set up farms 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.080
 controlled and even export it 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.570
 in his home country the united states 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.460
 but still we have not succeeded but many 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.890
 studies are in place a scholar 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.290
 unfortunately disappearance of the killer shrimp is 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.480
 it was my conterranea francesca 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.070
 gherardi who has studied for a long time 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.440
 the phenomenon of its diffusion 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.900
 ecology its ecology at the museum of 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.180
 zoology precisely of the specola in florence 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.820
 where these legs are still studied 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.710
 so whenever you see in one in 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.420
 a pond or a pond what 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.240
 you want these prawns I recommend 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.820
 think of me and think of the danger it can 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.390
 represent an alien species 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.340
 reach without proper precautions in 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.080
 an environment is not his a greeting from 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:35.220
 just sparkle and see you next time 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:35.220
