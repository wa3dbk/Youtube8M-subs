 the hourly update was a bit 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.730

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.399
 neighbor 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.050
 amanda's base starts at 330 mana 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.200
 punishable by 60 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.920
 the damage that the multiplier increased 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.440
 to 0.45 the passive of the gari was snorted 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.690
 now realize this is no longer removed 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.390
 by unethical monsters from the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.989
 level 11 and the regeneration of 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.840
 increasing at level 11 and 16 to 0.82 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.610
 per cent of his maximum life and the time 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.010
 recharge is also decreasing 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.160
 according to the light the passive of the blanc 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.500
 creates a mirror image immediately and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.990
 is blanc your mirror image remain 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.909
 invisible as long as the other 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.770
 invisible and that security is not 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.290
 visibility of a second then this 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.549
 will help you position yourself and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.369
 position your passive to deceive the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.439
 enemy and such eow has four seconds 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.320
 to be able to go back to where you started 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.619
 the one started him giving the maximum stored 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.890
 the crowd falling was reduced to 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.560
 150 and 200 only giving base of it remains 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.780
 unaltered can pull the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.520
 himself on land made by others 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.369
 champions equal pillar of traffic 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.320
 cataclysm djavan and the wall of the snow 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.049
 tonsillitis was also modified 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.829
 her base attack damage was decreased 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.960
 to 47.5 and the base attack speed 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.180
 was also diminished 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.320
 Attack damage multiplier was 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.570
 decreased 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.399
 only that the power multiplier of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.790
 ability has been increased 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.280
 they want to get out of the unit and come back 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.630
 She seap and invest the recharge time 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.790
 invested is reset to 1 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.830
 five seconds if she uses a target 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.960
 canceled a unit now 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.930
 reset the invested recharge time 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.610
 for 1.5 seconds and abilities that 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.640
 reduces recharge time invested now 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.770
 function in combination with attributes of 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.740
 reduction of recharge time and from there 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.110
 example if you have 40% take care of 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.320
 jackson will have the time to 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.560
 reload redefined to 0.9 edu talÃ£o 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.620
 and does not mute the target but he 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.880
 reduces its speed of movement 99% 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.400
 for 0.25 seconds the recharge time of the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.370
 ute de tristana was modified to 100 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.740
 85 70 seconds and the texture of several 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.600
 Champions has been updated for now 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.330
 were those here and will have more 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.010
 champions to see updates on the 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.870
 ranked players who fall 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.910
 quickly to diamond 11 after 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.370
 promoted to the team is retained 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.990
 a minimum of 50 points on the 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.420
 but the activity in the 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.940
 players who are silver and 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.090
 gold are immune to decay by 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.430
 inactivity but you can still fall out of 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.800
 call if you have played poorly and 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.910
 lost so much and can do with 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.090
 that the players' behavior 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.670
 improve ect is creating constraints 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.120
