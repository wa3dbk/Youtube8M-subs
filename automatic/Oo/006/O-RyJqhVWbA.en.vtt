00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
this concept art piece I was very stupid

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.460 
this concept art piece I was very stupid
and<00:00:21.460> I<00:00:21.519> decided<00:00:21.880> to<00:00:22.029> make<00:00:22.240> it<00:00:22.420> in<00:00:22.510> flash<00:00:22.750> which

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
and I decided to make it in flash which

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.460 
and I decided to make it in flash which
is<00:00:23.650> not<00:00:24.070> recommended<00:00:24.599> flash<00:00:25.599> is<00:00:25.869> not<00:00:26.140> the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
is not recommended flash is not the

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.160 
is not recommended flash is not the
typical<00:00:26.680> program<00:00:27.310> you<00:00:27.490> would<00:00:27.609> use<00:00:27.849> for

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
typical program you would use for

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.349 
typical program you would use for
concept<00:00:29.170> art<00:00:29.380> normally<00:00:30.099> you'd<00:00:30.279> use<00:00:30.359> Photoshop

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
concept art normally you'd use Photoshop

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.540 
concept art normally you'd use Photoshop
or<00:00:31.570> in<00:00:31.840> my<00:00:31.990> case<00:00:32.050> I<00:00:32.439> would<00:00:32.590> use<00:00:32.619> critter<00:00:33.040> there

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
or in my case I would use critter there

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.369 
or in my case I would use critter there
are<00:00:33.699> some<00:00:33.910> advantages<00:00:34.809> some<00:00:35.110> small

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
are some advantages some small

are some advantages some small
advantages<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:36.070> working<00:00:36.400> in<00:00:36.489> flash<00:00:36.729> like<00:00:37.659> it's

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:38.229 
advantages to working in flash like it's

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.009 
advantages to working in flash like it's
a<00:00:38.379> vector<00:00:38.830> software<00:00:39.549> so<00:00:39.760> it's<00:00:39.940> perfect<00:00:40.420> for<00:00:40.659> if

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
a vector software so it's perfect for if

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.740 
a vector software so it's perfect for if
you<00:00:41.440> want<00:00:41.650> your<00:00:41.860> art<00:00:42.339> pieces<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:43.030> stay<00:00:43.239> crisper

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
any resolution because it can scale to

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.660 
any resolution because it can scale to
any<00:00:45.909> size<00:00:46.150> and<00:00:46.540> you<00:00:47.530> can<00:00:47.739> manipulate<00:00:47.949> these

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
any size and you can manipulate these

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.710 
any size and you can manipulate these
shapes<00:00:49.440> very<00:00:50.440> easily<00:00:50.769> reflected<00:00:51.519> prints<00:00:51.909> I'm

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
shapes very easily reflected prints I'm

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.259 
shapes very easily reflected prints I'm
pretty<00:00:53.260> pleased<00:00:53.559> with<00:00:53.589> the<00:00:53.920> overall<00:00:54.280> look<00:00:55.059> of

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
pretty pleased with the overall look of

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.210 
pretty pleased with the overall look of
it<00:00:55.479> although<00:00:56.019> there<00:00:56.260> are<00:00:56.440> some<00:00:56.650> things<00:00:57.070> I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
it although there are some things I

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.100 
it although there are some things I
really<00:00:57.430> want<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:57.820> tweak<00:00:58.089> I'm<00:00:58.510> gonna<00:00:58.900> go

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
really want to tweak I'm gonna go

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.799 
really want to tweak I'm gonna go
through<00:00:59.769> and<00:00:59.949> tweak<00:01:00.549> a<00:01:00.580> few<00:01:00.699> things<00:01:01.180> towards

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
through and tweak a few things towards

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.109 
through and tweak a few things towards
the<00:01:01.930> end<00:01:02.080> because<00:01:02.519> just<00:01:03.519> looking<00:01:03.760> at<00:01:03.909> it<00:01:04.000> I'm

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
the end because just looking at it I'm

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.039 
the end because just looking at it I'm
not<00:01:04.239> happy<00:01:04.540> with<00:01:04.659> it

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
not happy with it

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.020 
not happy with it
I've<00:01:05.379> never<00:01:05.560> usually<00:01:06.040> happy<00:01:06.310> with<00:01:06.490> things<00:01:06.820> but

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
I've never usually happy with things but

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.750 
I've never usually happy with things but
though<00:01:07.210> just<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:08.020> clouds<00:01:08.380> were<00:01:09.310> easy<00:01:09.550> at

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
though just the clouds were easy at

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.790 
though just the clouds were easy at
first<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.240> get<00:01:10.360> that<00:01:10.420> overall<00:01:10.960> shape<00:01:11.260> but<00:01:11.620> then

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
first to get that overall shape but then

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.490 
first to get that overall shape but then
I<00:01:12.010> wanted<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.520> change<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.960> shape<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
I wanted to change the shape of the

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.290 
I wanted to change the shape of the
clouds<00:01:14.740> going<00:01:15.040> upwards<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.090> proved<00:01:16.270> to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
clouds going upwards and that proved to

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.240 
clouds going upwards and that proved to
be<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.570> bit<00:01:16.840> more<00:01:16.960> difficult<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:17.920> took<00:01:18.070> me<00:01:18.220> a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
be a bit more difficult and it took me a

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.230 
be a bit more difficult and it took me a
few<00:01:18.550> hours<00:01:18.580> to<00:01:19.090> actually<00:01:20.050> come<00:01:20.650> to<00:01:20.680> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
few hours to actually come to a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.520 
few hours to actually come to a
conclusion<00:01:22.240> with<00:01:22.420> those<00:01:22.720> clouds<00:01:23.080> how<00:01:23.470> to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
conclusion with those clouds how to

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.760 
conclusion with those clouds how to
shape<00:01:24.160> them<00:01:24.400> on<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:24.970> top<00:01:25.180> half<00:01:25.390> of<00:01:25.480> the<00:01:25.630> page

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
shape them on the top half of the page

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.980 
shape them on the top half of the page
yeah<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.070> now<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.310> just<00:01:27.550> need<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.180> do<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.570> few<00:01:28.810> more

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
yeah so now I just need to do a few more

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.660 
yeah so now I just need to do a few more
tweaks<00:01:29.230> to<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.650> clouds<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.250> I've<00:01:30.400> seen

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
tweaks to the clouds that I've seen

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.530 
tweaks to the clouds that I've seen
since<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.240> made<00:01:32.140> my<00:01:32.320> first<00:01:32.560> test<00:01:33.070> publish<00:01:33.540> also

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
since I made my first test publish also

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.920 
since I made my first test publish also
the<00:01:35.440> sky<00:01:36.250> fortress<00:01:36.610> in<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.120> middle<00:01:37.420> which<00:01:37.780> is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
the sky fortress in the middle which is

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.300 
the sky fortress in the middle which is
kind<00:01:38.200> of<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.440> centerpiece<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.280> whole

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
kind of the centerpiece of the whole

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.790 
kind of the centerpiece of the whole
thing<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.990> was<00:01:41.080> really<00:01:41.320> fun<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.650> make

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
thing that was really fun to make

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.710 
thing that was really fun to make
because<00:01:42.040> it's<00:01:42.220> just<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.550> silhouette<00:01:42.909> and<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.570> was

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
because it's just a silhouette and I was

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.750 
because it's just a silhouette and I was
able<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.960> whip<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.890> up<00:01:44.979> really<00:01:45.190> quick<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.700> just

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
able to whip it up really quick and just

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.450 
able to whip it up really quick and just
add<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.479> take<00:01:47.200> things<00:01:47.440> away<00:01:47.560> kind<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:47.979> sculpt

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
add and take things away kind of sculpt

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.320 
add and take things away kind of sculpt
it<00:01:48.610> really<00:01:49.150> fast<00:01:49.450> which<00:01:49.780> was<00:01:49.990> very<00:01:50.440> satisfying

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
it really fast which was very satisfying

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.149 
it really fast which was very satisfying
I'm<00:01:52.330> not<00:01:52.540> too<00:01:52.720> sure<00:01:52.990> about<00:01:53.020> one<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
I'm not too sure about one of the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.550 
I'm not too sure about one of the
pillars<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:55.450> goes<00:01:55.630> off<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.020> left<00:01:56.320> and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
pillars that goes off to the left and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.530 
pillars that goes off to the left and
then<00:01:56.920> how<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:57.550> goes<00:01:57.700> away<00:01:57.940> from<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.210> center

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
then how that goes away from the center

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.539 
then how that goes away from the center
line<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.840> think<00:01:59.409> I'm<00:01:59.620> gonna<00:01:59.799> change<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.340> to

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
line I think I'm gonna change that to

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.450 
line I think I'm gonna change that to
make<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.760> look<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.210> bit<00:02:01.240> nicer<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:02.380> maybe<00:02:03.190> add

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
make it look a bit nicer and maybe add

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.399 
make it look a bit nicer and maybe add
some<00:02:03.700> more<00:02:03.940> details<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.720> ships<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.140> clean

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
some more details to the ships and clean

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.530 
some more details to the ships and clean
it<00:02:05.530> up<00:02:05.620> a<00:02:05.770> little<00:02:05.799> bit<00:02:06.130> for<00:02:06.520> most<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.299> time

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
it up a little bit for most of the time

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.990 
it up a little bit for most of the time
that<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:07.900> was<00:02:08.140> doing<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.950> wasn't<00:02:09.549> zooming

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
that I was doing this I wasn't zooming

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.640 
that I was doing this I wasn't zooming
in<00:02:10.119> at<00:02:10.240> all<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.660> was<00:02:10.780> only<00:02:10.959> occasionally<00:02:11.530> that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
in at all it was only occasionally that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.820 
in at all it was only occasionally that
I<00:02:11.709> would<00:02:11.950> zoom<00:02:12.100> in

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
I would zoom in

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.470 
I would zoom in
didn't<00:02:12.980> really<00:02:13.190> need<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.370> because<00:02:13.850> mostly

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
didn't really need to because mostly

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.780 
didn't really need to because mostly
silhouettes<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:16.430> clouds<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:19.310> shadows

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
silhouettes the clouds the the shadows

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.660 
silhouettes the clouds the the shadows
on<00:02:20.270> them<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.780> couldn't<00:02:21.350> decide<00:02:21.620> what<00:02:21.980> kind<00:02:22.550> of

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
on them I couldn't decide what kind of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.180 
on them I couldn't decide what kind of
hue<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.450> saturation<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:24.380> stuff<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.800> make

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
hue and saturation and stuff to make

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.950 
hue and saturation and stuff to make
them<00:02:25.430> because<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:25.940> was<00:02:26.060> being<00:02:26.270> really<00:02:26.540> silly

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
them because I was being really silly

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.110 
them because I was being really silly
and<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.380> put<00:02:27.740> them<00:02:27.860> at<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> higher<00:02:28.250> saturation

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
and I put them at a higher saturation

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.080 
and I put them at a higher saturation
and<00:02:29.360> hue<00:02:29.630> as<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.500> main<00:02:31.280> part<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.850> clouds

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
and hue as the main part of the clouds

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.310 
and hue as the main part of the clouds
which<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.480> shouldn't<00:02:32.660> have<00:02:32.780> done<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.050> should

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
which I shouldn't have done I should

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.830 
which I shouldn't have done I should
have<00:02:33.440> kept<00:02:33.830> them<00:02:34.010> very<00:02:34.250> close<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.540> same

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
have kept them very close to the same

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.560 
have kept them very close to the same
levels<00:02:36.770> as<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.460> rest<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.910> cloud<00:02:38.120> because

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
levels as the rest of the cloud because

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.270 
levels as the rest of the cloud because
they're<00:02:38.750> very<00:02:38.900> far<00:02:39.200> away<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.500> especially

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
they're very far away so especially

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.490 
they're very far away so especially
behind<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:41.000> sky<00:02:41.270> fortress<00:02:41.570> should<00:02:42.380> have

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
behind the sky fortress should have

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.530 
behind the sky fortress should have
looked<00:02:42.740> much<00:02:42.950> further<00:02:43.280> away<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.360> should

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
looked much further away and so should

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.120 
looked much further away and so should
have<00:02:44.690> kind<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.990> blended<00:02:45.380> in<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:45.770> sky<00:02:46.100> a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
have kind of blended in with the sky a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.750 
have kind of blended in with the sky a
lot<00:02:46.370> more<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:47.120> shadows<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.590> normal<00:02:49.520> fill

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
lot more the shadows and the normal fill

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.940 
lot more the shadows and the normal fill
should<00:02:50.090> not<00:02:50.720> be<00:02:50.959> very<00:02:51.230> different<00:02:51.680> from<00:02:51.800> each

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
should not be very different from each

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.090 
should not be very different from each
other<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.430> terms<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.970> your<00:02:53.540> values<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.470> your

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
other in terms of your values and your

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.970 
other in terms of your values and your
hue<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.700> saturation<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:57.020> this<00:02:57.200> piece<00:02:57.800> is

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
hue and saturation so this piece is

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.240 
hue and saturation so this piece is
actually<00:02:58.130> for<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:59.030> game<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.720> I'm

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
actually for a game that I'm

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.830 
actually for a game that I'm
collaborating<00:03:01.250> on<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:01.820> I'm<00:03:02.480> kind<00:03:02.750> of

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
collaborating on so I'm kind of

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.930 
collaborating on so I'm kind of
contributing<00:03:03.500> like<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.830> art<00:03:04.040> pots<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.910> the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
contributing like the art pots to the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.270 
contributing like the art pots to the
game<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.420> we're<00:03:06.140> in<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.380> very<00:03:06.590> early<00:03:06.680> stages

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
game and we're in at very early stages

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.340 
game and we're in at very early stages
right<00:03:07.670> now<00:03:07.730> with<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.450> game<00:03:08.630> it's<00:03:09.110> not

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
right now with the game it's not

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.199 
right now with the game it's not
something<00:03:09.740> I'm<00:03:09.830> used<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.100> doing<00:03:10.280> I've<00:03:10.610> made

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
something I'm used to doing I've made

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.210 
something I'm used to doing I've made
very<00:03:11.480> few<00:03:11.570> concept<00:03:12.290> arts<00:03:12.530> for<00:03:12.650> games<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.070> most

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
very few concept arts for games and most

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.800 
very few concept arts for games and most
of<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.490> time<00:03:13.670> when<00:03:13.880> I've<00:03:14.000> made<00:03:14.150> concept<00:03:14.630> art

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
of the time when I've made concept art

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.320 
of the time when I've made concept art
for<00:03:14.930> games<00:03:15.140> it's<00:03:15.740> been<00:03:15.920> for<00:03:16.220> my<00:03:16.340> own<00:03:16.520> games<00:03:16.880> so

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
for games it's been for my own games so

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.690 
for games it's been for my own games so
this<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.750> kind<00:03:18.050> of<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.230> new<00:03:18.440> experience<00:03:19.310> for<00:03:19.430> me

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
this is kind of a new experience for me

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.540 
this is kind of a new experience for me
making<00:03:20.600> concept<00:03:21.140> art<00:03:21.380> pieces<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.040> making<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
making concept art pieces and making the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.080 
making concept art pieces and making the
actual<00:03:23.050> character<00:03:24.050> pieces<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.980> objects<00:03:25.910> for

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
actual character pieces and objects for

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.509 
actual character pieces and objects for
the<00:03:26.209> game<00:03:26.420> it's<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.440> new<00:03:27.620> learning<00:03:28.100> experience

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
the game it's a new learning experience

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.640 
the game it's a new learning experience
for<00:03:28.700> me<00:03:28.760> this<00:03:29.330> piece<00:03:29.570> might<00:03:29.900> not<00:03:30.080> even<00:03:30.230> be<00:03:30.500> in

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
for me this piece might not even be in

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.860 
for me this piece might not even be in
the<00:03:30.769> finished<00:03:31.100> game<00:03:31.280> just<00:03:31.850> exploring<00:03:32.450> some<00:03:32.840> of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
the finished game just exploring some of

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.509 
the finished game just exploring some of
the<00:03:33.050> themes<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:33.470> we<00:03:33.680> were<00:03:33.739> talking<00:03:34.310> about

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
the themes that we were talking about

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.520 
the themes that we were talking about
I'm<00:03:35.000> probably<00:03:35.480> going<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.810> make<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:35.989> few<00:03:36.260> other

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
I'm probably going to make a few other

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.070 
I'm probably going to make a few other
art<00:03:37.070> pieces<00:03:37.519> for<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.060> maybe<00:03:38.720> there'll<00:03:39.019> be

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
art pieces for it and maybe there'll be

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.410 
art pieces for it and maybe there'll be
a<00:03:39.200> different<00:03:39.650> theme<00:03:39.830> this<00:03:40.580> is<00:03:40.640> just<00:03:41.120> one<00:03:41.390> of

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
a different theme this is just one of

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.320 
a different theme this is just one of
the<00:03:41.690> choices<00:03:42.320> you<00:03:43.130> see<00:03:43.340> with<00:03:43.610> these<00:03:43.790> aqua

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
the choices you see with these aqua

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.110 
the choices you see with these aqua
clouds<00:03:44.630> I<00:03:44.900> keep<00:03:45.260> on<00:03:45.640> fiddling<00:03:46.640> with<00:03:46.790> them<00:03:46.940> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
clouds I keep on fiddling with them and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.449 
clouds I keep on fiddling with them and
filling<00:03:47.420> with<00:03:47.570> them<00:03:47.690> some<00:03:47.900> more<00:03:48.110> and<00:03:48.459> looking

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
filling with them some more and looking

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.180 
filling with them some more and looking
at<00:03:49.640> them<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.500> reassessing<00:03:51.500> what<00:03:52.010> they're

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
at them and reassessing what they're

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.509 
at them and reassessing what they're
like<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.760> making<00:03:53.300> them<00:03:53.570> again<00:03:54.160> erasing<00:03:55.160> and

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
like and making them again erasing and

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.710 
like and making them again erasing and
adding<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:57.410> gets<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:58.580> took<00:03:58.880> way<00:03:59.090> too<00:03:59.120> long<00:03:59.360> I

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
adding just gets it took way too long I

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.199 
adding just gets it took way too long I
should<00:03:59.900> have<00:04:00.019> had<00:04:00.260> this<00:04:00.470> made<00:04:01.220> much<00:04:01.730> faster

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
should have had this made much faster

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.509 
should have had this made much faster
but<00:04:02.390> that's<00:04:02.630> probably<00:04:02.870> because<00:04:03.230> it's<00:04:03.980> mostly

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
but that's probably because it's mostly

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.729 
but that's probably because it's mostly
down<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:05.000> lack<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.330> experience<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.080> think<00:04:06.140> then

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
down to lack of experience I think then

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.770 
down to lack of experience I think then
I'm<00:04:06.860> trying<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.220> think<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.519> how<00:04:07.670> the

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
I'm trying to think of how the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.240 
I'm trying to think of how the
convection<00:04:08.780> currents<00:04:09.350> could<00:04:09.500> work<00:04:09.709> if<00:04:09.980> there

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
convection currents could work if there

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.600 
convection currents could work if there
was<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.430> an<00:04:10.940> object

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
was a an object

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.760 
was a an object
in<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.090> sky<00:04:13.390> suspended<00:04:14.110> by<00:04:14.230> nothing<00:04:14.590> how

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
in the sky suspended by nothing how

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.360 
in the sky suspended by nothing how
would<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.070> clouds<00:04:16.350> move<00:04:17.350> around<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:18.010> but

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
would the clouds move around that but

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.039 
would the clouds move around that but
yeah<00:04:18.580> there's<00:04:18.910> definitely<00:04:18.970> some<00:04:19.930> things

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
yeah there's definitely some things

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.070 
yeah there's definitely some things
about<00:04:20.380> this<00:04:20.620> one<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.280> need<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.210> change<00:04:22.480> by

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
about this one that I need to change by

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.930 
about this one that I need to change by
the<00:04:23.110> time<00:04:23.410> this<00:04:23.620> video<00:04:23.800> goes<00:04:24.010> up<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.610> might<00:04:24.850> have

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
the time this video goes up I might have
