shape<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.789> flower<00:00:48.030> spike<00:00:48.770> you'll<00:00:49.770> notice

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
shape of the flower spike you'll notice

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.790 
shape of the flower spike you'll notice
here<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.610> flower<00:00:50.940> spike<00:00:51.449> comes<00:00:51.989> from

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
here that a flower spike comes from

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.430 
here that a flower spike comes from
underneath<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.730> second<00:00:54.239> leaf<00:00:54.449> from<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> top

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
underneath the second leaf from the top

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.270 
underneath the second leaf from the top
and<00:00:56.000> next<00:00:57.000> year<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:58.020> flower<00:00:58.289> spike<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:59.039> come

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and next year the flower spike will come

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.070 
and next year the flower spike will come
from<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.940> opposite<00:01:00.690> side<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:02.309> plant

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
from the opposite side of the plant

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.670 
from the opposite side of the plant
underneath<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:05.040> second<00:01:05.519> leaf<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.260> it'll<00:01:07.439> come

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
underneath the second leaf so it'll come

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.760 
underneath the second leaf so it'll come
from<00:01:07.939> roughly<00:01:08.939> right<00:01:09.240> about<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.590> course

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
from roughly right about here of course

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
from roughly right about here of course
it<00:01:10.979> can't<00:01:11.220> come<00:01:11.490> from<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.909> yet<00:01:12.210> until<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it can't come from here yet until the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.060 
it can't come from here yet until the
plant<00:01:13.049> grows<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> new<00:01:13.680> leaf<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.180> look

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
plant grows a new leaf but if we look

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.590
