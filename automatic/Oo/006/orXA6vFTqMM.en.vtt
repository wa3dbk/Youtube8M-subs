00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.170
 Automatically translated by the machine. Today I sew a simple usamimi headband! 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.710
 Collect your materials. Cut long rectangular fabric and put 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.129
 End together. Fold in half wise length. 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.129
 The cut end is inserted into such a circular point. The expansion should be like this. 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:58.479
 Unfold and then fold in half to form a large sausage. 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:09.369
 Wear the needle and start splicing at one point. 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:18.329
 Run the cross stitch down on the side. This may take a while to get to the other side. 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:41.359
 Leave a small gap when you reach the other end of the knot. 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:49.719
 The gap in the whole thing will come out. 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.799
 Put it together, you should have something like this. 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.150
 Double the unwinding tube, as long as a length of wire. 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.150
 Fold in half, twist together, then fold into the ends of the loop. 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:46.409
 Theme wire tube. Then stitch the gap. 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:08.049
 The tie is over. Completed! 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.700
 Taadaa! Cured, it has its own line, 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:47.299
 The perfect rabbit headband. This is it! You can pick up one of these. 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.780
 In one or two minutes, once you get the hang of it, it's even faster than a sewing machine. 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.890
 Instructions in the link to the photo version of the tutorial on my blog. 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.109
