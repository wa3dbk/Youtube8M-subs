after<00:00:16.080> some<00:00:16.260> tinkering<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.740> some<00:00:17.070> up<00:00:17.250> cap

values<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.029> think<00:00:18.060> she<00:00:18.330> grinds<00:00:19.050> really<00:00:19.320> good<00:00:19.529> I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
values I think she grinds really good I

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.500 
values I think she grinds really good I
have<00:00:19.830> no<00:00:20.160> idea<00:00:20.550> if<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> trem<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.210> reverb

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
have no idea if the trem and reverb

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.000 
have no idea if the trem and reverb
actually<00:00:22.199> worked<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.769> don't<00:00:22.920> have

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
actually worked because I don't have

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.089 
actually worked because I don't have
foot<00:00:23.279> switches<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.850> him<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> rest<00:00:25.949> is

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
foot switches for him but the rest is

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.240 
foot switches for him but the rest is
pretty<00:00:26.250> good<00:00:26.550> without<00:00:27.359> further<00:00:27.599> ado<00:00:28.250> I'll

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
pretty good without further ado I'll

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.030 
pretty good without further ado I'll
just<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.580> ahead<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.880> make<00:00:30.779> some<00:00:30.859> make<00:00:31.859> some

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
just go ahead and make some make some

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.790 
just go ahead and make some make some
noise<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.460> her<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:34.380> she<00:00:34.500> puts<00:00:34.710> out

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
noise with her I think she puts out

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
noise with her I think she puts out
about<00:00:35.010> 80<00:00:35.280> watts<00:00:36.079> 6l6<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.070> whole<00:00:38.430> bunch<00:00:38.700> of
