00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.419
 to this position 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.079
 it is 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.879
 on thursday with homemade but in 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.689
 Basically, this too 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:15.639
 new professional 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.810
 brightness will not have it brought up the words on 

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:20.390
 work, yes, I feel awkward 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.730
 is tied 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.599
 and what else did metal etiquette 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.369
 this year bazhov to adapt is 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.599
 love 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.579
 if only there was such a weight 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.470
 however, a little bit gives us a kilogram of 7 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.390
 8 and there is more 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.810
 but not so important here 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.050
 right now it's bright this here these 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.190
 4 more 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.530
 inside stated previously made straight 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.340
 let's not be commented that for 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.430
 transportation was convenient to bring 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.640
 but I hope this supposedly 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.450
 its advantages are not only a cutter 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.170
 I would love to see us 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.520
 will tell what koryazhnik after non-return 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.590
 until they understood 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.680
 here are these questions when all the tasks 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 Dostoevsky develops 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.159
 at the moment only with hands but also 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.710
 when, on the hijacking mylody, we are always on 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.300
 motor 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.710
 have you ever recently 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.950
 all efforts 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.190
 straightening models anchor we don't lose 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.290
 can they never seen no 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.530
 the investigator is heavier 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.520
 all the better 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.400
 Vlad it turned out that no 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.960
 the important thing is to do it in general 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.010
 say spare others who are not 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.180
 need more than four unbend 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.580
 for example here 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.810
 I will do it 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.070
 other fishing 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.110
 we found u right there on the shore yes 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.240
 there is no spare 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.330
 herself 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.420
 it was a good evening when there were two accidents 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 Lexand in America and this anchor 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.000
 have to throw away 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.450
 although ready to look for new rules and 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.480
 who did not believe in his maximum 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.200
 many second mistake i think why 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.030
 opened these things 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.000
 it's too steep 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 it is possible that there was such a snag that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.520
 for example to resign 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.929
 especially dangerous for example 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.929
 now we have to wait for cases therefore 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.339
 they broke the gates of the Czech 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:14.919
 but basically do it 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.339
 follow the same pattern understand yes 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:18.280
 but at the same time 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.029
 according to the plan should be 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.969
 but to supposedly made about 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.719
 one club 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.819
 cause for similar so here it is more expensive i 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.589
 I think that there is no why 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.719
 this here this is about the same frequency that 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:32.589
 when 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.249
 yes when it knows what the left side is doing 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.079
 announced that near her dish for 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.689
 10 thousand 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.080
 honestly not yet 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.429
 Sergey Pogorelov what the guys did 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.279
 here it was another version injured earlier 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.769
 r instead of this indicator 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.459
 he will not suffer 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.419
 staying 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.609
 December 19 I'm a category for 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.569
 final elimination of fish 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.719
 This is a local maternity hospital Volga al Qaeda 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.069
 made about the same pattern only 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.929
 less owls 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.309
 for them, thicker bars due to 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.089
 his speedy bury 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.179
 because they failed microloans 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.579
 it made more technical wisely 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.019
 spare whiskers more delicate deadlines snags 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.189
 develops 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.409
 but also light weight
