00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
yeah but I think it would have had a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.000 
yeah but I think it would have had a
better<00:03:30.750> impression<00:03:31.080> if<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.380> just<00:03:31.530> started<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
better impression if it just started the

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.660
