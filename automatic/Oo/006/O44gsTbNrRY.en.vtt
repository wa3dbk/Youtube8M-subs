looks perfectly smooth to me but if

your<00:02:09.970> frame<00:02:10.269> rates<00:02:10.479> will<00:02:10.750> probably<00:02:11.049> vary<00:02:11.350> as

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
your frame rates will probably vary as

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.680 
your frame rates will probably vary as
well<00:02:11.739> but<00:02:11.890> if<00:02:12.100> you've<00:02:12.790> got<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> same<00:02:13.239> setup<00:02:13.540> as

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
well but if you've got the same setup as

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.630 
well but if you've got the same setup as
me<00:02:13.900> then<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.290> pretty<00:02:14.470> much<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:15.280> will<00:02:15.400> be<00:02:15.459> good

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
me then you pretty much it will be good

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.569 
me then you pretty much it will be good
enough<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:16.090> play<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:17.440> or<00:02:17.980> completely<00:02:18.340> maxed
