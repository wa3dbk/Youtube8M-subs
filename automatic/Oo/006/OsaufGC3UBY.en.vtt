00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.830

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
and I'll just have to lift this bit up

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.319 
and I'll just have to lift this bit up
there<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.960> go<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.970> flips<00:01:32.970> around<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
there we go and that flips around the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.819 
there we go and that flips around the
back<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.479> right<00:01:37.409> let's<00:01:37.560> close<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
back so there we go right let's close it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.399 
back so there we go right let's close it
up<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.780> does<00:01:39.930> look<00:01:40.140> really

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
up so there is it does look really

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.230 
up so there is it does look really
really<00:01:40.590> nice<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> nice<00:01:41.430> heavy<00:01:41.909> weight

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
really nice to go to a nice heavy weight

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.149 
really nice to go to a nice heavy weight
to<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> doesn't<00:01:43.320> feel<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.860> it's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
to it so it doesn't feel like it's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.090 
to it so it doesn't feel like it's
anything<00:01:44.369> cheap<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:45.810> got<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> signet<00:01:46.380> emblem

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
anything cheap you got a signet emblem

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.560 
anything cheap you got a signet emblem
on<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.939> pull<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.180> around<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.540> other

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
on here and pull it around the other

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.319 
on here and pull it around the other
side<00:01:49.159> you've<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.490> stitching<00:01:50.970> down<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
side you've just got stitching down the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.359 
side you've just got stitching down the
middle<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> let's<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.950> look<00:01:52.979> around<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
middle so let's have a look around the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.219 
middle so let's have a look around the
case<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:55.020> cutout<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:56.369> not<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> best<00:01:57.229> kind

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
case the cutout it's not the best kind

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.069 
case the cutout it's not the best kind
of<00:01:58.640> it's<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.729> exactly<00:02:00.180> centered<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.899> there's

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
of it's not exactly centered and there's

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
of it's not exactly centered and there's
a<00:02:01.140> quite<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> bit<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.399> gap<00:02:02.579> at<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.820> top<00:02:02.939> as

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
a quite a bit of a gap at the top as

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.810 
a quite a bit of a gap at the top as
well<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> stitching<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.369> nice<00:02:05.490> though

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
well the stitching is really nice though

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.169 
well the stitching is really nice though
and<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:07.649> does<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> real<00:02:08.489> nice<00:02:08.700> texture<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and it does have a real nice texture to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.499 
and it does have a real nice texture to
it<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.569> well

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
it as well

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.580 
it as well
and<00:02:10.780> if<00:02:10.959> we<00:02:10.989> look<00:02:11.230> at<00:02:11.349> that<00:02:11.560> emblem<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:14.260> looks

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and if we look at that emblem that looks

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.720 
and if we look at that emblem that looks
really<00:02:14.799> nice<00:02:14.920> as<00:02:15.159> well<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.970> if<00:02:16.239> we<00:02:16.269> open<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.750> up

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
really nice as well and if we open it up

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.970 
really nice as well and if we open it up
you<00:02:18.730> can<00:02:18.879> see<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.450> got<00:02:19.750> fat<00:02:20.439> enough<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.829> flip

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
you can see it's got fat enough to flip

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.640 
you can see it's got fat enough to flip
this<00:02:21.099> over<00:02:21.250> somehow<00:02:21.659> there<00:02:22.659> we<00:02:22.780> go<00:02:22.959> there's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
this over somehow there we go there's

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.920 
this over somehow there we go there's
the<00:02:23.980> signet<00:02:24.370> emblem<00:02:24.700> there<00:02:24.939> as<00:02:25.060> well<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.689> I'm

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the signet emblem there as well and I'm

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.569 
the signet emblem there as well and I'm
not<00:02:26.379> really<00:02:26.560> sure<00:02:26.680> what<00:02:26.950> material<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.519> is

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
not really sure what material this is

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.490 
not really sure what material this is
it's<00:02:28.030> not<00:02:28.180> suede<00:02:28.629> it's<00:02:28.870> something<00:02:29.230> else<00:02:29.379> not

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
it's not suede it's something else not

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.589 
it's not suede it's something else not
quite<00:02:29.739> sure<00:02:29.769> but<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.629> a<00:02:31.659> bit<00:02:31.900> softer<00:02:32.409> and
