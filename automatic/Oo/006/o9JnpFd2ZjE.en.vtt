and the memory cards have also been set

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.740 
and the memory cards have also been set
up<00:03:05.030> for<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.920> because<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.310> my<00:03:07.670> last<00:03:07.879> tutorial<00:03:08.150> i

up for you because in my last tutorial i

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.860 
up for you because in my last tutorial i
noticed<00:03:09.379> that<00:03:09.739> people<00:03:10.189> were<00:03:10.849> struggling<00:03:11.599> to

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
noticed that people were struggling to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.020 
noticed that people were struggling to
get<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.980> White<00:03:13.189> House<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.579> work<00:03:13.760> and

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
get the White House to work and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.420 
get the White House to work and
struggling<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.230> figure<00:03:15.409> out<00:03:15.680> how<00:03:15.919> to<00:03:15.980> get<00:03:16.280> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
struggling to figure out how to get the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.030 
struggling to figure out how to get the
memory<00:03:16.760> cards<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.209> work<00:03:17.419> so<00:03:18.379> that's<00:03:18.769> why<00:03:19.010> I

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
memory cards to work so that's why I

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.729 
memory cards to work so that's why I
have<00:03:19.669> pre-configured<00:03:20.659> them<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.260> do<00:03:21.590> not

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
have pre-configured them so you do not

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.039 
have pre-configured them so you do not
have<00:03:21.919> to<00:03:22.069> worry<00:03:22.280> about<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.849> you<00:03:23.689> will<00:03:23.840> also

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
have to worry about that you will also

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.890 
have to worry about that you will also
not<00:03:24.590> have<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:24.919> worry<00:03:25.159> about<00:03:25.599> running<00:03:26.599> out<00:03:26.840> of

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
not have to worry about running out of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.530 
not have to worry about running out of
space<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.530> memory<00:03:27.919> cards<00:03:28.280> because<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:29.359> will

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
space of memory cards because you will

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.289 
space of memory cards because you will
have<00:03:29.750> eight<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.409> them<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:33.579> also<00:03:34.579> noticed<00:03:35.209> that

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
have eight of them I also noticed that

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.390 
have eight of them I also noticed that
in<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.629> previous<00:03:35.870> tutorial<00:03:36.230> people<00:03:37.159> were

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
in the previous tutorial people were

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.659 
in the previous tutorial people were
struggling<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.150> figure<00:03:38.359> out<00:03:38.629> how<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.669> get

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
struggling to figure out how to get

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.589 
struggling to figure out how to get
controls<00:03:41.239> for<00:03:41.689> the<00:03:41.859> emulator<00:03:42.879> so<00:03:43.879> that's<00:03:44.299> why

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
controls for the emulator so that's why

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.969 
controls for the emulator so that's why
I<00:03:45.049> have<00:03:45.970> literate<00:03:46.970> in<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.389> description<00:03:48.109> the

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 
I have literate in the description the

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:53.830 
I have literate in the description the
keys<00:03:50.079> to<00:03:51.079> show<00:03:51.349> you<00:03:51.519> what<00:03:52.519> button<00:03:53.060> does<00:03:53.449> what

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
keys to show you what button does what

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.500 
keys to show you what button does what
so<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.560> will<00:03:54.739> be<00:03:54.799> able<00:03:55.129> to<00:03:55.609> play<00:03:55.909> your<00:03:56.209> games

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
so you will be able to play your games

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.289 
so you will be able to play your games
with<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.290> controls<00:03:57.709> if<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.729> want<00:03:58.909> to<00:03:59.060> play

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
with the controls if you want to play

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.229 
with the controls if you want to play
this<00:03:59.540> game<00:03:59.750> with<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.019> controller<00:04:00.819> I'll<00:04:01.819> be

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
this game with a controller I'll be

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.089 
this game with a controller I'll be
doing<00:04:02.479> that<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:03.139> a<00:04:03.319> separate<00:04:03.919> tutorial

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
doing that in a separate tutorial

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.059 
doing that in a separate tutorial
because<00:04:05.090> it's<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.750> bit<00:04:05.930> fiddly<00:04:06.229> when<00:04:06.709> doing

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
because it's a bit fiddly when doing

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.469 
because it's a bit fiddly when doing
that<00:04:08.470> now<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:09.709> your<00:04:09.889> emulator<00:04:10.220> is<00:04:10.849> working
