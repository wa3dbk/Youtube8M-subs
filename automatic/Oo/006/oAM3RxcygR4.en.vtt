00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.299
 from September we 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.850
 we were without medical attention we were 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.070
 withdraw the health cards therefore 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.290
 if we call the emergency service 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.170
 we appear in your database 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.660
 our medical records do not appear 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.300
 in the archives or the doctors of 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.850
 header or the specialists that we 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.250
 are trying that is the date in the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.380
 which we stayed in a cloud 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.530
 just as they define in the cloud 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.110
 for my treatment in specific I 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.900
 I put three months of attentive reviews 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.930
 of the type of cancer that I have that is a 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.970
 I unfortunately very advanced cancer 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.030
 I am in a palliative treatment I already 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.520
 I have no cure and my condition requires that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.280
 every three thousand lord receive review if 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.770
 every three months I miss an image 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.700
 you what happens I do not know it 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.520
 they have wrong 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.950
 six months ago a sick woman could 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.009
 work and had a health card 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.530
 that allowed me to go to the pharmacy and 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.320
 buy the remedies and never mind 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.780
 because although expensive it was a value that 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.509
 working my family and I could 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.060
 get the money today by staying without 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.369
 health card we have been left without 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.770
 the discount of social security and 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.570
 that's as serious as denying us the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.120
 medical care 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.360
 I did not find a doctor 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.750
 nurse an assistant to tell me 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.000
 I will deny to attend the doctors clear 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.340
 who have declared themselves objectors because 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.590
 they are doctors they have sworn an oath 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.619
 Hippocratic that is beyond what 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.080
 they mark the times but the patients do 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.479
 we have a little sense we can not 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.700
 ask a doctor to donate to us 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.330
 give us more than their science in their 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.119
 praxis we can not ask you to steal or 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.160
 that use the material that of the state and 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.239
 which is highly expensive those are 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.239
 government decisions
