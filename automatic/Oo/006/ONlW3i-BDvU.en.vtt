 more filming the indications and the goal was in this climate 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.460
 Attempted a kind of city and from the moment the denial these

 advertising is where could realize oneself realize it is 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.780
 true that every person who writes off his train but do

 one of them did not do the job remember to be fulfilled 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.030

 fraternity it reinforces more or less well 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.409
 we are not alone but accompanied by the master in the past by our 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.570
 parents from where the interest of putting a little balm to approve before 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.880
 do any movement you are supposed to do signings starting 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.990
 the oil company 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.200
 when typing 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.060
 to achieve this 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.500
 for me we are not going to walk 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.730
 for 30 days 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.530
 the belgian 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.230
 a nice craze 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 Barrere 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 no 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.120
 some months later 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.930
 Why 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.930
 Why 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.780
 mid-day in the world of which the most important is everybody 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:36.889
 to know oneself 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.430
 and then to practice really telling the rest of the kids no matter how happy 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.719
 children we are there for the bianconeri have played too much they have 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.629
 well done in the establishment 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.000
 a jaw 3la red uncovered the day j and unknowingly because 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:52.359
 legal 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.519
 you get to reach a certain intensity stung nose 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.519
 it is absolutely necessary to develop the listened the observation because it is 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.439
 like that 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.689
 that we can progress 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.090
 and go a lot further much further thanks to him observations 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:18.449
 and all that it had participated in more than half a second the number 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.799
 wants to do this game is no more margin map you have to be objective 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.159
 as often a lot of things around us about goals are 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.359
 everything around us marc we manage to capture things 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.180
 we did not manage to perpignan this is the demand if we can not also 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.139
 can we not have the same rate named in relation to others it's the boom of 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.139
 the demand is the world 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.219
 6 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.969
 during this time it is still unclear where is the army and the rebels 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.139
 were announced at the moment 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.449
 we do not know each other we are a team 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:22.460
 a scene 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.969
 that's also the definition of clapping hands 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.120
 it means that 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.120
 we fell into the deep coma of each 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.360
 it's important sign that things do not happen you have to be in a 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.719
 positive direction you have to think you have to be good with yourself you have to be 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.479
 well surrounded for the sake of the highest it is also that the clap of the hands 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.300
 we started together two films became a team 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.180
 they do not know where they leave each other anymore
