okay<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.139> story<00:00:10.650> i'm<00:00:11.429> going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.790> show<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.120> is

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
okay in story i'm going to show you is

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.970 
okay in story i'm going to show you is
metaphoric<00:00:13.969> experimentation<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.800> have

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
metaphoric experimentation and you have

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.810 
metaphoric experimentation and you have
to<00:00:17.130> know<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.490> six<00:00:18.300> algorithms<00:00:19.820> first

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
to know on six algorithms first

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.800 
to know on six algorithms first
algorithm<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.609> parity<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.880> goes<00:00:24.480> like

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
algorithm is the parity it goes like

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:44.880 
algorithm is the parity it goes like
this

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:55.670 

switch<00:00:45.520> this<00:00:46.450> a<00:00:53.129> second<00:00:54.129> algorithm<00:00:54.460> is<00:00:54.970> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
switch this a second algorithm is the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:11.320 
switch this a second algorithm is the
easiest<00:00:56.680> is<00:00:57.190> like<00:00:57.579> this<00:00:58.270> and<00:00:58.629> this<00:00:58.899> and<00:00:59.199> just

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:27.520 

first<00:01:12.330> algorithm<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.790> relying<00:01:14.790> line

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.430 

our<00:01:28.580> algorithm<00:01:29.580> is<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:32.630> parity<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.750> top<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
our algorithm is the parity on top and

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:48.320 
our algorithm is the parity on top and

line on button if you liked this fifth
algorithm<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.710> line<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.090> top<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.710> 30

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
algorithm is a line on the top and 30

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:09.169 
algorithm is a line on the top and 30
and<00:01:53.160> button<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.770> goes<00:01:56.760> like<00:01:57.210> this

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:18.140 

and<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.390> last<00:02:10.569> one<00:02:10.989> is<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:12.569> line<00:02:14.130> parity<00:02:15.130> and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:37.260 

goes<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.360> this

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.020 

okay<00:02:38.270> it's<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.810> whole<00:02:38.990> algorithms<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:40.040> now<00:02:40.880> i'm

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
okay it's a whole algorithms and now i'm

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.150 
okay it's a whole algorithms and now i'm
going<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.360> show<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:42.700> examples<00:02:43.700> how<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.150> do<00:02:44.450> a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
going to show you examples how to do a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.550 
going to show you examples how to do a
determination<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:52.310> our<00:02:52.459> first<00:02:52.730> example

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
determination this is our first example

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.980 
determination this is our first example
you<00:02:54.560> have<00:02:54.590> line<00:02:55.070> on<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.940> top<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:58.990> rich

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
you have line on the top and rich

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.900 
you have line on the top and rich
situation<00:03:00.860> on<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.520> button<00:03:05.440> see<00:03:06.440> in<00:03:06.590> this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
situation on the button see in this

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.590 
situation on the button see in this
schematic<00:03:08.650> ok<00:03:12.160> firstly<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.820> have<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.209> do<00:03:14.390> that

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
schematic ok firstly you have to do that

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:24.600 
schematic ok firstly you have to do that
a<00:03:14.870> line<00:03:15.590> line<00:03:16.010> algorithm<00:03:16.520> is<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.150> sec<00:03:17.630> efforts

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.860 

and<00:03:25.610> now<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:27.380> have<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:28.550> burn<00:03:28.880> on<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.660> bottom

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
and now you have you burn on the bottom

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.980 
and now you have you burn on the bottom
and<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:32.600> have<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.020> do<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.350> these<00:03:34.340> two

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.370 

and<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.620> too

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:53.220 

and<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.250> last<00:03:45.690> and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:06.899 

okay<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.099> the<00:03:54.370> first<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:56.050> second<00:04:05.580> if<00:04:06.580> you<00:04:06.700> see

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
okay is the first the second if you see

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.699 
okay is the first the second if you see
that<00:04:07.180> is<00:04:07.500> hypermutation<00:04:09.660> on<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:11.170> top<00:04:11.410> end

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
that is hypermutation on the top end

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:20.250 
that is hypermutation on the top end
this<00:04:12.870> party<00:04:13.870> on<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:15.340> bottom<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:18.870> firstly<00:04:19.870> and

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
this party on the bottom and firstly and

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.110 
this party on the bottom and firstly and
you<00:04:20.919> have<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.400> do<00:04:21.549> that<00:04:21.960> 50<00:04:22.960> algorithms<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:24.190> line

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
you have to do that 50 algorithms a line

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:36.330 
you have to do that 50 algorithms a line
and<00:04:25.530> sister<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.970> goes<00:04:28.270> like<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:36.130> see

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
and sister it goes like this and you see

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:49.520 
and sister it goes like this and you see
you<00:04:36.460> have<00:04:36.669> only<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:39.100> line<00:04:39.370> parity

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:58.320 

ok<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:51.610> next<00:04:52.030> one<00:04:55.860> this<00:04:56.860> is<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.520> tour

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
ok and next one this is the a tour

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.790 
ok and next one this is the a tour
permit<00:04:59.170> a<00:04:59.350> shin<00:04:59.620> and<00:05:02.640> so<00:05:03.780> firstly<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:05.500> have<00:05:05.590> to

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
permit a shin and so firstly you have to

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:14.140 
permit a shin and so firstly you have to
do<00:05:06.010> these<00:05:06.670> two<00:05:07.000> and<00:05:07.330> these<00:05:07.990> two

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:26.249 

and<00:05:14.240> now<00:05:15.760> is<00:05:16.760> to<00:05:16.900> enlist

ok<00:05:27.259> and<00:05:27.949> next<00:05:28.639> example<00:05:38.949> okay<00:05:40.270> so<00:05:41.270> this<00:05:42.110> is<00:05:42.379> an

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:43.129 
ok and next example okay so this is an

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:52.330 
ok and next example okay so this is an
old<00:05:43.669> pair<00:05:44.060> impatient

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
and now you have to do this too and let

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:26.300 
and now you have to do this too and let
us<00:06:12.240> win<00:06:12.539> this<00:06:16.550> ok<00:06:17.550> let's<00:06:17.910> example<00:06:23.810> the<00:06:25.310> the

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
us win this ok let's example the the

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:33.249 
us win this ok let's example the the
line<00:06:26.550> and<00:06:26.880> you<00:06:27.479> burn<00:06:28.970> so<00:06:29.970> fiercely<00:06:30.449> line<00:06:30.840> line

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259 
line and you burn so fiercely line line

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:38.420 
line and you burn so fiercely line line
and<00:06:35.690> you<00:06:36.690> have<00:06:36.750> to<00:06:36.960> do<00:06:37.139> this<00:06:37.169> and<00:06:37.740> this<00:06:38.130> chain

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
and you have to do this and this chain

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:51.860 
and you have to do this and this chain
is<00:06:38.460> too<00:06:40.160> and<00:06:41.160> now<00:06:41.400> you<00:06:41.460> have<00:06:41.810> 30<00:06:42.810> on<00:06:43.169> the<00:06:43.349> top<00:06:50.870> I

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
is too and now you have 30 on the top I

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.490 
is too and now you have 30 on the top I
think<00:06:52.620> it's<00:06:52.860> all<00:06:54.590> maybe<00:06:55.590> it<00:06:56.370> will<00:06:56.610> help<00:06:56.639> you
