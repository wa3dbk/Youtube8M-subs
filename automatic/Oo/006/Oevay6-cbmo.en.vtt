cobblestone you can continue on with

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.369 
cobblestone you can continue on with
tutorial<00:02:41.349> so<00:02:42.099> for<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.209> first<00:02:43.420> floor<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.200> want

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
tutorial so for the first floor you want

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.039 
tutorial so for the first floor you want
to<00:02:44.469> make<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.739> about<00:02:44.950> four<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.969> five<00:02:46.049> blocks

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
to make it about four to five blocks

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.830 
to make it about four to five blocks
high<00:02:47.439> make<00:02:47.799> sure<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.129> at<00:02:48.220> least<00:02:48.400> four<00:02:48.939> it'll

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
high make sure it's at least four it'll

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.380 
high make sure it's at least four it'll
give<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.109> a<00:02:50.260> better<00:02:50.620> look<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.280> will<00:02:51.819> allow<00:02:51.939> for

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
give it a better look and will allow for

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.819 
give it a better look and will allow for
the<00:02:52.480> zombies<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.079> be<00:02:53.200> killed<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:56.079> this<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
the zombies to be killed so this is the

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.530 
the zombies to be killed so this is the
main<00:02:57.040> floor<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.819> can<00:02:57.849> go<00:02:58.060> ahead<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.239> see<00:02:58.450> how

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
main floor you can go ahead and see how

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.240 
main floor you can go ahead and see how
it<00:02:58.750> works<00:02:58.930> i'll<00:02:59.290> explain<00:02:59.620> how<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.829> build<00:03:00.099> this

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
it works i'll explain how to build this

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.580 
it works i'll explain how to build this
part<00:03:00.549> now<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.930> make<00:03:02.920> sure<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.370> doors<00:03:03.700> are

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
part now so make sure the doors are

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.349 
part now so make sure the doors are
Willie<00:03:05.670> preferably<00:03:06.670> make<00:03:06.849> them<00:03:07.060> at<00:03:07.180> least

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
Willie preferably make them at least

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.460 
Willie preferably make them at least
eight<00:03:08.079> blocks<00:03:08.500> away<00:03:08.799> from<00:03:09.959> three<00:03:10.959> blocks<00:03:10.989> on

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
eight blocks away from three blocks on

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.069 
eight blocks away from three blocks on
one<00:03:11.680> side<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.329> one<00:03:14.489> one<00:03:15.489> or<00:03:15.700> two<00:03:16.540> blocks<00:03:16.780> on<00:03:16.959> one

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
one side so one one or two blocks on one

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.830 
one side so one one or two blocks on one
side<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.439> to<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:17.680> one<00:03:17.980> two<00:03:18.370> three<00:03:18.400> four<00:03:19.389> five

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
side so to have one two three four five

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.000 
side so to have one two three four five
six<00:03:20.230> seven<00:03:20.889> eight<00:03:21.689> so<00:03:22.689> I'd<00:03:23.109> probably<00:03:23.650> make<00:03:23.889> the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
six seven eight so I'd probably make the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.789 
six seven eight so I'd probably make the
doors<00:03:24.250> right<00:03:24.549> here<00:03:24.819> nine<00:03:25.329> and<00:03:25.569> ten<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.530> can

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
doors right here nine and ten so I can

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.250 
doors right here nine and ten so I can
have<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.310> water<00:03:28.060> extending<00:03:28.599> all<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.780> way<00:03:28.900> it

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
have the water extending all the way it

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.720 
have the water extending all the way it
makes<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.680> bunch<00:03:29.829> easier<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.280> collect<00:03:30.489> items

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
makes it a bunch easier to collect items

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.629 
makes it a bunch easier to collect items
because<00:03:31.389> you<00:03:32.349> can<00:03:32.560> see<00:03:32.680> right<00:03:32.709> now<00:03:32.889> it's<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.459> bit

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
because you can see right now it's a bit

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:39.180 
because you can see right now it's a bit
hefty<00:03:34.629> process<00:03:35.940> i'll<00:03:36.940> be<00:03:37.120> editing<00:03:37.239> that's<00:03:38.190> it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
hefty process i'll be editing that's it

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.649 
hefty process i'll be editing that's it
with<00:03:39.489> Jacob<00:03:40.120> sharks<00:03:40.419> permission<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:42.659> once

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
you've done with the first floor and you

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.939 
you've done with the first floor and you
go<00:03:46.599> ahead<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:46.840> put<00:03:46.959> these<00:03:47.079> on<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.409> end<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.709> the

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
go ahead and put these on the end of the

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.819 
go ahead and put these on the end of the
water<00:03:48.729> if<00:03:48.909> you<00:03:49.030> want<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:50.169> can<00:03:50.319> just<00:03:50.379> go<00:03:50.709> ahead

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
and go to the second more importance

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.759 
and go to the second more importance
floor<00:03:54.540> for<00:03:55.540> more<00:03:55.750> important<00:03:56.379> things<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:58.769> there

twelve side when you see this the 14 and
14<00:04:09.340> dimension<00:04:10.150> should<00:04:10.780> be<00:04:10.989> on<00:04:11.260> your<00:04:11.680> sides<00:04:12.250> and

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
14 dimension should be on your sides and

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.179 
14 dimension should be on your sides and
on<00:04:12.849> your<00:04:13.060> front<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.419> back<00:04:13.569> you<00:04:14.500> should<00:04:14.799> have

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
all along the ends of this cobblestone

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.310 
all along the ends of this cobblestone
and<00:05:08.790> if<00:05:09.790> you've<00:05:10.060> done<00:05:10.330> this<00:05:10.510> correctly<00:05:10.750> we've

and if you've done this correctly we've

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.220 
and if you've done this correctly we've
done<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.530> right<00:05:11.650> dimensions<00:05:12.130> it<00:05:12.400> should<00:05:12.670> end

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
done the right dimensions it should end

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.630 
done the right dimensions it should end
about<00:05:14.230> well<00:05:14.830> this<00:05:15.190> should<00:05:15.370> be<00:05:15.400> one<00:05:17.640> little

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
about well this should be one little

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.510 
about well this should be one little

line of Kabul left of floor with no
water<00:05:21.940> in<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.440> now<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:23.500> after<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.520> you're

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
water in it now you after that you're

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.520 
water in it now you after that you're
going<00:05:24.820> to<00:05:24.940> want<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.150> break<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.540> Kabul<00:05:26.020> down

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
going to want to break that Kabul down

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.600 
going to want to break that Kabul down
to<00:05:26.890> this<00:05:27.340> area<00:05:27.610> with<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.090> glass<00:05:29.430> so<00:05:30.430> go<00:05:30.550> ahead

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
to this area with the glass so go ahead

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.390 
to this area with the glass so go ahead
and<00:05:30.700> break<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.090> cobble<00:05:31.420> down<00:05:31.570> all<00:05:32.280> into<00:05:33.280> the

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
and break the cobble down all into the

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.130 
and break the cobble down all into the
wall<00:05:33.610> here<00:05:33.910> make<00:05:34.180> sure<00:05:34.210> their<00:05:34.450> walls<00:05:34.720> on<00:05:35.020> each

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
wall here make sure their walls on each

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.190 
wall here make sure their walls on each
side<00:05:35.640> so<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:37.150> salt<00:05:37.390> the<00:05:37.600> way<00:05:37.720> that<00:05:37.870> will<00:05:38.020> work

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
side so the salt the way that will work

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.650 
side so the salt the way that will work
is<00:05:38.500> zombies<00:05:39.130> will<00:05:39.280> spawn<00:05:39.550> here<00:05:39.850> we'll<00:05:40.300> jump

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
is zombies will spawn here we'll jump

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.900 
is zombies will spawn here we'll jump
off<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:42.040> water<00:05:42.280> will<00:05:42.460> pull<00:05:42.700> them<00:05:42.880> down

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
off and the water will pull them down

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.530 
off and the water will pull them down
and<00:05:44.130> they'll<00:05:45.130> suffocate<00:05:45.550> now<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.030> make<00:05:46.300> them

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
and they'll suffocate now to make them

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.660 
and they'll suffocate now to make them
suffocate<00:05:47.110> go<00:05:47.650> down<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:47.950> where<00:05:48.070> this<00:05:48.250> glass<00:05:48.640> is

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
suffocate go down to where this glass is

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.530 
suffocate go down to where this glass is
here<00:05:49.540> and<00:05:49.990> by<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.680> way<00:05:50.830> make<00:05:51.100> sure<00:05:51.130> it's<00:05:51.540> three

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
here and by the way make sure it's three

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.950 
here and by the way make sure it's three
blocks<00:05:52.690> tall<00:05:53.230> and<00:05:54.270> there's<00:05:55.270> one<00:05:55.480> block<00:05:55.720> below

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
blocks tall and there's one block below

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.440 
blocks tall and there's one block below
it<00:05:56.170> open<00:05:56.860> so<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:59.170> items<00:05:59.560> can<00:05:59.800> go<00:06:00.030> I'm<00:06:01.030> somebody

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
it open so the items can go I'm somebody

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.350 
it open so the items can go I'm somebody
we<00:06:01.510> don't<00:06:01.660> use<00:06:01.960> spiders<00:06:02.760> because<00:06:03.760> the<00:06:03.910> spiders

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
we don't use spiders because the spiders

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.870 
we don't use spiders because the spiders
will<00:06:04.660> go<00:06:05.410> through<00:06:05.650> that<00:06:05.740> hole<00:06:05.950> and<00:06:06.100> hurt<00:06:06.460> me

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
will go through that hole and hurt me

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.580 
will go through that hole and hurt me
very<00:06:07.350> harshly<00:06:09.570> so<00:06:10.570> that's<00:06:10.990> pretty<00:06:11.290> much<00:06:11.440> all

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
very harshly so that's pretty much all
