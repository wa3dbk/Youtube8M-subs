question paddle lengths just in recent

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.370 
question paddle lengths just in recent
years<00:00:27.849> now<00:00:28.060> people<00:00:28.810> would<00:00:28.900> go<00:00:29.080> on<00:00:29.170> a<00:00:29.200> little

bit shorter for racing and paddling in

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.590 
bit shorter for racing and paddling in
general<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:33.250> used<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.550> be<00:00:33.730> shaka<00:00:34.059> taller<00:00:34.390> than

latest formula now every year it's been

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.189 
latest formula now every year it's been
creeping<00:00:43.000> down<00:00:43.150> because<00:00:43.449> my<00:00:43.570> top<00:00:43.780> riders<00:00:44.110> that

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
creeping down because my top riders that

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.930 
creeping down because my top riders that
you're<00:00:44.320> all<00:00:44.410> finding<00:00:44.769> this<00:00:44.860> goal<00:00:45.160> faster<00:00:45.489> just

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
you're all finding this goal faster just

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.030 
you're all finding this goal faster just
a<00:00:46.030> little<00:00:46.239> shorter<00:00:46.510> in<00:00:46.540> length<00:00:46.600> so<00:00:46.900> most<00:00:47.890> of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
a little shorter in length so most of

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.469 
a little shorter in length so most of
the<00:00:48.100> top<00:00:48.280> guys<00:00:48.489> now<00:00:48.729> paddle<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:49.180> paddle<00:00:49.300> is

the top guys now paddle and paddle is
about<00:00:49.809> 10%<00:00:50.260> taller<00:00:50.860> than<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.129> height<00:00:51.339> so<00:00:52.089> from

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
about 10% taller than the height so from

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.990 
about 10% taller than the height so from
my<00:00:52.750> height<00:00:52.960> at<00:00:53.140> five<00:00:53.409> nine<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:54.070> my<00:00:54.670> paddle<00:00:54.940> is

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000

it's<00:01:34.899> going<00:01:35.049> to<00:01:35.109> give<00:01:35.229> you<00:01:35.320> more<00:01:35.500> leverage

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
it's going to give you more leverage

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.310 
it's going to give you more leverage
more<00:01:36.159> torque<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.609> the<00:01:36.850> blade<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.960> how<00:01:38.140> do<00:01:38.200> you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
more torque to the blade so how do you

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.349 
more torque to the blade so how do you
determine<00:01:38.439> that<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.159> it<00:01:39.640> just<00:01:39.850> so<00:01:39.969> happens

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
determine that and it just so happens

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.060 
determine that and it just so happens
that<00:01:40.450> if<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.109> measure<00:01:41.380> me<00:01:41.679> from<00:01:41.890> outside

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
that if you measure me from outside

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.700 
that if you measure me from outside
elbow<00:01:42.549> to<00:01:42.700> outside<00:01:42.820> elbow<00:01:43.390> I'm<00:01:43.749> exactly<00:01:44.409> half

four<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.049> half<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:51.159> if<00:01:51.249> you<00:01:51.340> make<00:01:51.549> one<00:01:51.579> tape

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
four and a half so if you make one tape

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.370 
four and a half so if you make one tape
mark<00:01:52.509> at<00:01:52.659> thirty<00:01:52.869> four<00:01:53.049> and<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.200> half

mark at thirty four and a half
you'll<00:01:53.679> see<00:01:53.829> a<00:01:53.859> my<00:01:54.369> friend<00:01:54.640> Brody<00:01:54.939> from<00:01:55.780> paddle

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
you'll see a my friend Brody from paddle

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.779 
you'll see a my friend Brody from paddle
fit<00:01:56.320> made<00:01:56.530> these<00:01:56.710> really<00:01:56.859> cool<00:01:57.159> little<00:01:57.280> labels

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
fit made these really cool little labels

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.730 
fit made these really cool little labels
you<00:01:57.880> gave<00:01:58.060> me<00:01:58.179> in<00:01:58.270> Fiji<00:01:58.689> and<00:01:58.869> you'll<00:01:59.590> see<00:01:59.710> a

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
you gave me in Fiji and you'll see a

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.529 
you gave me in Fiji and you'll see a
plot<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.340> plus<00:02:00.609> here<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:00.939> a<00:02:00.999> minus<00:02:01.179> here<00:02:01.479> and

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
plot a plus here and a minus here and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.200 
plot a plus here and a minus here and
that<00:02:02.049> plus<00:02:02.289> actually<00:02:02.679> is<00:02:02.799> a<00:02:02.829> symbol<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.999> help

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
that plus actually is a symbol to help

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.630 
that plus actually is a symbol to help
you<00:02:04.299> realize<00:02:04.719> that<00:02:04.899> if<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.140> go<00:02:05.170> lower<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.369> this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
you realize that if you go lower to this

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.950 
you realize that if you go lower to this
side<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:06.939> that<00:02:07.060> tape<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.450> actually<00:02:07.689> have<00:02:07.780> more

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
side of that tape you actually have more

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.080 
side of that tape you actually have more
power<00:02:08.229> if<00:02:08.830> you'da<00:02:09.190> creep<00:02:09.399> up<00:02:09.580> higher<00:02:09.880> than

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
power if you'da creep up higher than

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.760 
power if you'da creep up higher than
that<00:02:10.149> tape<00:02:10.479> mark<00:02:10.750> you're<00:02:11.350> actually<00:02:11.620> going<00:02:11.710> to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
that tape mark you're actually going to

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.430 
that tape mark you're actually going to
lose<00:02:12.000> torque<00:02:13.000> lose<00:02:13.270> leverage<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.140> blade

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
lose torque lose leverage to the blade

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.900 
lose torque lose leverage to the blade
okay<00:02:14.710> it's<00:02:14.920> comfortable<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.520> might<00:02:15.760> have<00:02:15.850> a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
okay it's comfortable you might have a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.010 
okay it's comfortable you might have a
longer<00:02:16.090> stroke<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:16.600> you're<00:02:16.750> not<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:16.990> to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
longer stroke but you're not going to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.380 
longer stroke but you're not going to
effectively<00:02:17.650> get<00:02:17.830> more<00:02:18.190> power<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.180> blades

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
effectively get more power to the blades

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.600 
effectively get more power to the blades
so<00:02:19.630> holding<00:02:20.050> your<00:02:20.170> hand<00:02:20.410> down<00:02:20.560> lower<00:02:20.860> is

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
so holding your hand down lower is

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.830 
so holding your hand down lower is
really<00:02:21.819> going<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:21.970> give<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.180> more<00:02:22.299> power<00:02:22.510> so

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
really going to give you more power so

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.479 
really going to give you more power so
what<00:02:22.989> we<00:02:23.140> recommend<00:02:23.349> is<00:02:23.769> even<00:02:23.980> putting<00:02:24.280> tape

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
what we recommend is even putting tape

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.119 
what we recommend is even putting tape
below<00:02:25.480> your<00:02:25.720> hand<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.230> try<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.830> hold<00:02:26.980> your

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
below your hand and try and hold your

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:27.450 
below your hand and try and hold your
hand

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
farther down on the shaft to give you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.170 
farther down on the shaft to give you
more<00:02:32.580> torque<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.790> blade<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:36.000> measure<00:02:37.000> your

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
more torque to the blade so measure your

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.210 
more torque to the blade so measure your
paddle<00:02:37.570> see<00:02:38.050> how<00:02:38.170> tall<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.620> if<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.010> 10%

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
paddle see how tall it is if it's 10%

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.620 
paddle see how tall it is if it's 10%
tall<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.760> your<00:02:39.820> height<00:02:40.030> you're<00:02:40.450> in<00:02:40.570> the

tall in your height you're in the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.690 
tall in your height you're in the
ballpark<00:02:40.810> where<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.290> should<00:02:41.470> be

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
ballpark where you should be

always trying to grip it lower if at all

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.140 
always trying to grip it lower if at all
possible<00:03:05.260> you're<00:03:05.890> going<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.070> bend<00:03:06.790> more<00:03:07.060> at

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
possible you're going to bend more at

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.030 
possible you're going to bend more at
the<00:03:07.270> waist<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.930> you're<00:03:08.170> going<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.320> have<00:03:08.860> to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
the waist and you're going to have to

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.220 
the waist and you're going to have to
get<00:03:09.310> your<00:03:09.640> body<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:10.060> little<00:03:10.240> lower<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.930> get<00:03:11.080> the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
get your body a little lower to get the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.440 
get your body a little lower to get the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
blade fully bear it upfront but you're

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.060 
blade fully bear it upfront but you're
going<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.630> find<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:13.960> your<00:03:14.170> leverage<00:03:14.890> is

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
going to find that your leverage is

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.830 
going to find that your leverage is
better<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.640> if<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.880> use<00:03:16.090> your<00:03:16.270> power<00:03:16.540> and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
better and if you use your power and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.020 
better and if you use your power and
sit-up<00:03:17.830> effectively<00:03:18.430> you're<00:03:18.670> going<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.850> have

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
sit-up effectively you're going to have

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.150 
sit-up effectively you're going to have
better<00:03:19.960> distance<00:03:20.380> per<00:03:20.620> stroke<00:03:20.910> better<00:03:21.910> speed

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
better distance per stroke better speed

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.590 
better distance per stroke better speed
go<00:03:24.160> faster<00:03:24.550> ultimately<00:03:24.910> once<00:03:25.210> you're<00:03:25.360> up<00:03:25.480> to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
go faster ultimately once you're up to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.630 
go faster ultimately once you're up to
speed<00:03:25.720> or<00:03:25.870> if<00:03:26.140> you're<00:03:26.320> in<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:27.100> draft<00:03:27.370> train

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
speed or if you're in a draft train

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.580 
speed or if you're in a draft train
settling<00:03:28.210> in<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.750> know<00:03:28.840> then<00:03:29.140> at<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.410> point

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
settling in you know then at that point

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.720 
settling in you know then at that point
it's<00:03:29.770> like<00:03:29.800> shifting<00:03:30.070> gears<00:03:30.250> on<00:03:30.520> your<00:03:30.610> bike

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
it's like shifting gears on your bike

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.220 
it's like shifting gears on your bike
you<00:03:30.910> can<00:03:31.060> creep<00:03:31.270> up<00:03:31.450> your<00:03:31.630> hand<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.900> little<00:03:31.930> bit

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
you can creep up your hand a little bit

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.200 
you can creep up your hand a little bit
hold<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.130> little<00:03:33.160> bit<00:03:33.490> higher<00:03:33.700> as<00:03:34.090> a

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
hold it a little bit higher as a

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.240 
hold it a little bit higher as a
conservative<00:03:34.720> energy<00:03:35.170> it's<00:03:35.770> like<00:03:35.920> being<00:03:36.160> in

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
conservative energy it's like being in

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.770 
conservative energy it's like being in
that<00:03:36.340> heavier<00:03:36.670> gear<00:03:36.910> on<00:03:36.970> your<00:03:37.060> bike<00:03:37.270> pedaling

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
that heavier gear on your bike pedaling

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.640 
that heavier gear on your bike pedaling
downhill<00:03:39.000> drafting<00:03:40.000> behind<00:03:40.270> somebody<00:03:40.720> so

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
downhill drafting behind somebody so

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.440 
downhill drafting behind somebody so
where<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.370> hold<00:03:42.520> your<00:03:42.670> hand<00:03:42.850> is<00:03:43.030> almost<00:03:43.300> like

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
where you hold your hand is almost like

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.050 
where you hold your hand is almost like
changing<00:03:43.930> gears<00:03:44.170> on<00:03:44.320> your<00:03:44.440> bike<00:03:44.560> so<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.310> hope

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
changing gears on your bike so I hope

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.360 
changing gears on your bike so I hope
that<00:03:46.240> helps<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.570> go<00:03:46.660> faster<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.560> helps<00:03:48.280> you

figure out a better more effective way
to<00:03:49.840> hold<00:03:50.080> your<00:03:50.200> paddles<00:03:50.590> with<00:03:50.710> bastard<00:03:51.040> have
