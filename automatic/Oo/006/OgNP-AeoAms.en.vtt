00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
 hello you people it's Christmas Eve 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.200
 we could actually go to the celebration of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.030
 day this candle 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.349
 the here for the rest to one 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.849
 year in this room is never 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.560
 use or see how dusty it is 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.050
 is and I want to be with you today too 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.119
 no legs become commercial 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.439
 I just want to do things 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.400
 enjoy sitting here with you and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.720
 have christmas 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.490
 I do not know if we are already covered 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.810
 had or still have in the evening 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.340
 Evaluate some things in the morning 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.720
 some in the evening with some at noon 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 somehow different at each one though 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 our pleasure is now friends 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 friends I really thought 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.950
 I 've considered how can 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.750
 I give you something of what each 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.579
 has and not just a single or 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590
 a few but all and the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.989
 Solution is easy you get it all 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.890
 from me a self-knit sweater 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.360
 my grandma with bear yes okay I know 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.620
 that had been quite epic 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.420
 but there is something better 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.320
 I'll say that now I would 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.340
 actually quite like right 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.960
 make exciting 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.489
 I have been meeting you last night as well 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.660
 said that it is really cool and me 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.470
 I do not think I have too much 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.409
 promised 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.010
 ok someday i have to say i was 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.369
 really long thought and thought something like that 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.200
 would be something really cool and then came 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.180
 at one time we had friends 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.590
 really a lot of fun like the last 24 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.340
 days and then I already have it 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.340
 read comments 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.250
 and then I thought so does 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.320
 It would be fun, too 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.290
 now mega pity actually with it 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.180
 to stop and so I got the idea 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.120
 but just keep going 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.160
 january every day is a video raushauen is 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.320
 is cool today or christmas 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.900
 changed friends that will be easy 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.940
 a mega action we'll just see each other 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.440
 every day go together properly if 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.400
 My dream is you coming 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.050
 home at noon and wanted to go first 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 switch off and then it should be one 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.420
 it goes without saying that we 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.880
 first a nice video 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.560
 and that's exactly what I want 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.000
 It should just be given to you 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.530
 it goes without saying that we 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.180
 see us every day and now sometimes 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.759
 lunch from not only in the evening at nine 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.530
 is the target says as I have pleasure 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.450
 it you just write that in their 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.980
 Daily schedule I would be more 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.630
 We are happy to see you again 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.070
 you would be annoyed at noon 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.150
 first youtube and then we see 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.890
 us so much for now 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.270
 entertainment so four to five minutes on 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.709
 day a little bit to come down 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.120
 relaxed again and then it continues 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.470
 and be honest you know each other 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.780
 but anyway at noon word 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.190
 calculator is not a detour anymore 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.450
 if you only have time in the evening that's 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.220
 no thing we are the youtube and 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.019
 can watch TV, it would really 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.790
 a great honor if you are me in yours 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.799
 integrate daily routine 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.450
 just like you would otherwise just teeth 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.799
 I think that sounds clean 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.810
 After a great plan I do not know how 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.130
 you see if that is now time consuming or 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.600
 do not let me be my worry 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.970
 we see the thing more like that 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.410
 Advent calendars were a mega spontaneous 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.760
 idea I've indeed been a 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.140
 Month ago thought made me like that 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.549
 what does or does not want then 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.380
 but with me just because I am 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.220
 not somewhere 08 15 advent calendar 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.600
 wanted to do 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.519
 On the other hand, I have to go first 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.340
 not so it happened that they did that 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.410
 first door on the first of December at 24 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.090
 started 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.560
 that it's not so spontaneous 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.000
 I can also go on that 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.410
 it will not be for nothing 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.390
 we see it now had better then the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.370
 Advent calendar was the alpha of january 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.420
 offers the beta and afterwards with the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.340
 Project still happens 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.720
 then decisive but I forget 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.100
 even in a beta, there are still 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.260
 bugs and glitches that's kind of like 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.120
 unavoidable you might see me 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.980
 really give me a lot of effort but I am 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.540
 no god i am just a normal 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.400
 human as well as with a small one 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.260
 utopie do not be surprised if in the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.490
 january still a few things go wrong and end 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.960
 in january we will look over it again 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.600
 and then decide together like it 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.100
 going on friends today is christmas 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.420
 and that's about the biggest 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.280
 gift that I could do 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.510
 I hope you see it as such 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.920
 others if you 're still upset 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.050
 have a head if you still feel like it 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.570
 that we continue to see each other every day 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.600
 then that's the biggest gift we have 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.770
 I can not do more than that 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.270
 I wish you a beautiful 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.130
