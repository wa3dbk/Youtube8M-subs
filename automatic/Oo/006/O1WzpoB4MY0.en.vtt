work<00:00:53.280> hard<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.379> horrible<00:00:56.370> measurable<00:00:56.789> Tuesday

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
work hard so horrible measurable Tuesday

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.779

nights<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.309> fantastic<00:01:00.090> places

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
nights and in not so fantastic places

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.429 
nights and in not so fantastic places
that<00:01:02.789> really<00:01:03.059> count<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.660> gotta<00:01:03.840> grind<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.320> out

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
that really count you gotta grind it out

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.320 
that really count you gotta grind it out
they're<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.369> pretty<00:01:05.549> football<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
they're going to be pretty football and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.500 
they're going to be pretty football and
then<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:07.049> everyone's<00:01:07.500> favorite<00:01:07.950> football

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
then not everyone's favorite football

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.539 
then not everyone's favorite football
but<00:01:09.510> i<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.260> how<00:01:10.830> many<00:01:10.890> points<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.400> get

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
but i think it's how many points you get

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.640 
but i think it's how many points you get
when<00:01:11.700> you're<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.180> so

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
when you're not going so

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.490 
when you're not going so

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
is the most important in this league

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.420 
is the most important in this league
hopefully<00:01:15.500> we<00:01:15.620> can<00:01:15.710> get<00:01:15.800> as<00:01:15.920> many<00:01:16.040> as<00:01:16.100> we<00:01:16.280> can

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
hopefully we can get as many as we can

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.310 
hopefully we can get as many as we can
and<00:01:17.030> you've<00:01:17.150> got<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.270> good<00:01:17.630> goalscoring<00:01:18.170> record
