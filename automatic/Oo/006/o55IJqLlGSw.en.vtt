 called digital crowe which meets 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.460
 a fundamental role in the management of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.969
 clock 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.000

 in the other corner is the apple 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.960
 wise sport that focuses more on the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.300
 resistance of the equipment since it incorporates 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.030
 an external glass more resistant and

 You see really be for all 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.759
 tastes and pockets 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.860
 now let's go to the most important part 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.450
 what we can do with it, well 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.060
 company imposed itself to create a system 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.060
 operating different from the web year for this 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.159
 platform and so he did getting 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.399
 an easy-to-use interface and 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.410
 quite intuitive this little watch has 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.959
 a touch screen and you can connect 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.030
 with our iphone which will allow us 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.060
 answer calls receive 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.130
 notifications of messages and emails 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.250

 and attentive athletes because in case 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.790
 outside little this gadget can also 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:36.190
 measure us the pulse as you hear the part 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.489
 The back of the watch has four lenses 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.440
 LEDs protected by sapphire which makes 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.430
 possible that by means of a light 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.349
 infrared we can measure our pulse 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.989
 this without counting the accelerometer and the 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.659
 gyroscope that also possesses as for 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.709
 really juicing the gel kit 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.709
 the iau is 8 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.010
 This mini ass also incorporates a 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.260
 communication system based on 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.780
 drawings made on the screen with 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.910
 pressure points the same as 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.550
 You will receive the sender with a slight 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.250
 vibration in your wrist 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.960
 but without a doubt the great novelty has to 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.420
 see that we can also send 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.930
 our own heartbeats to 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.930

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.140

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.469
 and also has nfc to make cash 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.530
 the system to paul p recently 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:32.290
 explained in the previous note 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.260
 Finally, the issue of the duration of the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.180
 battery is still an enigma in the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.490
 back of the device is 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.069
 find a magsafe connector for 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.500
 charge by battery induction but 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:49.460
 basically you do not know more about this 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.320
 that's what the long-awaited one is about 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.440
 apple watch but if you want what
