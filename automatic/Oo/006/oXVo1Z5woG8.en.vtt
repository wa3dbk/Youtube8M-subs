00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
is a rhombus a parallelogram is it

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.999 
is a rhombus a parallelogram is it
sometimes<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.959> parallelogram<00:00:04.529> or<00:00:04.560> always<00:00:04.830> a

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009

students working on the game when you're
thinking<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:37.140> does<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.829> with

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
thinking what does that have to do with

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.130 
thinking what does that have to do with
math<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.850> somehow<00:00:39.270> he's<00:00:39.540> figured<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.930> way

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
math but somehow he's figured out a way

math but somehow he's figured out a way
to<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.680> students<00:00:41.010> attention<00:00:41.340> and

to get that students attention and
they're<00:00:42.059> working<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.780> their<00:00:42.960> math<00:00:43.230> work<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
they're working on their math work and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.229 
they're working on their math work and
they're<00:00:43.829> learning<00:00:44.340> things<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.030> math<00:00:45.210> that

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
they're learning things in math that

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.459 
they're learning things in math that
they<00:00:45.480> thought<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.870> weren't<00:00:46.050> able<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> do

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
they thought they weren't able to do

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.100 
they thought they weren't able to do
before<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:47.129> love<00:00:48.000> being<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.420> mr.<00:00:48.660> Bell's<00:00:48.840> class

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
before I love being in mr. Bell's class

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.479 
before I love being in mr. Bell's class
because<00:00:49.620> he's<00:00:49.950> fun<00:00:50.309> he<00:00:51.270> actually<00:00:51.840> teaches

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
because he's fun he actually teaches

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.279 
because he's fun he actually teaches
into<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> way<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:54.090> understand<00:00:54.510> he<00:00:54.840> takes<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
into a way I can understand he takes the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.069 
into a way I can understand he takes the
time<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:56.420> individually<00:00:57.420> talk<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.870> each<00:00:58.050> one

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
time to individually talk to each one

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
time to individually talk to each one
and<00:00:58.320> make<00:00:58.829> sure<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.340> understand

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and make sure that they understand

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.970 
and make sure that they understand
everything<00:01:00.090> before<00:01:00.600> he<00:01:00.840> moves<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.379> he<00:01:01.800> like

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
everything before he moves on he like

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.439 
everything before he moves on he like
gets<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.430> front<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> class<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.059> he'll

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
gets up in front of the class and he'll

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.090 
gets up in front of the class and he'll
explain<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.409> don't<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> he'll

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
explain it and if you don't get it he'll

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
explain it and if you don't get it he'll
explain<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.610> until<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.090> understand<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
explain it until you do understand you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.190 
explain it until you do understand you
see<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.830> dyslexia<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.330> sometimes<00:01:09.780> mix

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
see I have dyslexia and I sometimes mix

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.010 
see I have dyslexia and I sometimes mix
numbers<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.100> letters<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:12.000> x<00:01:12.630> equals

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
numbers and letters like x equals

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.609 
numbers and letters like x equals
something<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.189> would<00:01:14.430> mix<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.689> he

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
something I would mix that up and he

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.010 
something I would mix that up and he
breaks<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.979> down<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.159> me<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.790> two<00:01:18.240> ways<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.869> can

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
breaks it down for me in two ways I can

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.260 
breaks it down for me in two ways I can
understand<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.250> kids<00:01:20.549> walk<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
understand it but kids walk into that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.480 
understand it but kids walk into that
classroom<00:01:21.420> never<00:01:22.140> knowing<00:01:22.650> what's<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
classroom never knowing what's going to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
classroom never knowing what's going to
happen<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.000> day<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.960> what's<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
happen that day and that's what's so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.170 
happen that day and that's what's so
powerful<00:01:25.560> about<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.610> their<00:01:26.880> their

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
powerful about it that their their

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
powerful about it that their their
anticipation<00:01:27.750> level<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.439> causes<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
anticipation level it causes them to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.969 
anticipation level it causes them to
want<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.420> classroom<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:31.710> always

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
want to be in that classroom we always
