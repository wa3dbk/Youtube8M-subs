00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.700
 curious about the games of this the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.970
 imac character and related things 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.970
 to this without saying more let's start 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.720
 the American boxer mike tyson 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.970

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.520
 Danish finished with him 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.979
 It should be mentioned that Mike Tyson never 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.190
 had played this game and did it until 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:19.229
 the 2013 26 years later that came out 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.229
 the game go I think it's late a little 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.330
 by entering the following code 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.750
 Y 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.070

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.750

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.750
 nintendo customer service

 linux mac appears in capital greenbook 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.810
 a game for the wii but this character 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.060
 comes out with a few extra kilos 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.369
 this is normal for this game since 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.819
 many parodies of other games in this 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.819
 Title 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.300
 in the arcade version of punch out in the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.000
 spectators can be seen among the 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.620
 characters to mario and donkey kong in the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.630
 version of the nes we can see mario 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.640
 as a referee and in the wii version 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.460
 we can see donkey kong again 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.380
 among the spectators without counting that in 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.790
 this game donkey kong appears as a 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.790
 unlockable enemy 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.569
 mac dayron throughout history has 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.879
 had many physical changes as per 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.340
 example the heat other hair the form 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.500
 of your body and the shape of your face 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.870
 give them an example of a moon - which is a 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.989
 playable character of fight night round 2 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.260
 but only for the gamecube version and 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.269
 appears in this way 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.069
 I suppose he was in his teens 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.069
 where people get ugly 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.100
 There is a Danish punch-out trail legend 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.260
 which says that if you press the start button 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.090
 while you fight with Mike Tyson in the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.880
 second jump when there is one minute left and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.280
 30 seconds Mario appears and shoots at 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.740
 mike tyson in the face this legend is 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.040
 completely false and is proven 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.040
 for me 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.150
 in the super smash bros for wii and the 3ds 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.460
 if you select a from a mac and at the moment 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.890
 of winning an enemy we have a high 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.990
 percentage of damage depending on how much 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.140
 percentage we have and normal will come out with 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.710
 Bruises bumps or bandages on the face 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.710
