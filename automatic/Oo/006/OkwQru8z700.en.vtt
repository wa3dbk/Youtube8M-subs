deck<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.460> know<00:01:17.549> some<00:01:17.759> players<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.240> they

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
deck and you know some players if they

deck and you know some players if they
happen<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.840> access<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> these<00:01:19.470> they

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
happen to have access to these they

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.840 
happen to have access to these they
probably<00:01:19.920> definitely<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> pick<00:01:20.640> some<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
probably definitely want to pick some of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.399 
probably definitely want to pick some of
these<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.150> these<00:01:21.689> cards<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.259> good

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
these up so these cards going to be good

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.840 
these up so these cards going to be good
if<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.830> haven't<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.250> them<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.520> now<00:01:23.640> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
if you haven't have them right now I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.820 
if you haven't have them right now I
don't<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.659> up<00:01:24.930> anytime<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
don't see them going up anytime in the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
don't see them going up anytime in the
future<00:01:26.040> curry<00:01:26.790> bandit<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.750> probably<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
future curry bandit is probably going to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
future curry bandit is probably going to
be<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.680> useful<00:01:28.979> than<00:01:29.250> rainbow<00:01:29.670> kuriboh

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
be it more useful than rainbow kuriboh

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.550 
be it more useful than rainbow kuriboh
but<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> see<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> game

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
but that's just the way I see the game

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.260 
but that's just the way I see the game
being<00:01:32.220> played<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:33.119> whatever

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
being played right now for whatever

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.270 
being played right now for whatever
reason<00:01:33.630> rainbow<00:01:34.079> kuriboh<00:01:34.320> seeing<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> lot<00:01:35.250> more

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
reason rainbow kuriboh seeing a lot more

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
reason rainbow kuriboh seeing a lot more
play<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.329> kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.869> don't<00:01:37.020> have

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
play it's kind of because we don't have

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.990 
play it's kind of because we don't have
an<00:01:37.229> electromagnetic<00:01:37.979> turtle<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.850> not

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
an electromagnetic turtle that is not

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.460 
an electromagnetic turtle that is not
out<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> TCG<00:01:39.810> yet<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.110> once<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.320> comes

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
out in the TCG yet but once that comes

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.870 
out in the TCG yet but once that comes
out<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:41.310> players<00:01:41.520> will<00:01:41.640> probably

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
out I think some players will probably

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.910 
out I think some players will probably
swap<00:01:42.060> over<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:43.049> running<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:43.560> players<00:01:43.770> just

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
swap over to running some players just

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.590 
swap over to running some players just
run<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.250> rainbow<00:01:44.520> kuriboh<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.149> probably<00:01:45.509> at

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
run to rainbow kuriboh the probably at

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
run to rainbow kuriboh the probably at
least<00:01:45.689> drop<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.770> electromagnetic

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
least drop one for electromagnetic

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.469 
least drop one for electromagnetic
turtle<00:01:47.610> because<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> card<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.240> much

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
turtle because that card is just much

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.990 
turtle because that card is just much
better<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.229> necro<00:01:49.530> gardna<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:50.280> negates

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
better it's a necro gardna that negates

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.399 
better it's a necro gardna that negates
the<00:01:51.149> entire<00:01:51.390> battle<00:01:51.810> phase<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> guys<00:01:52.290> are

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the entire battle phase if you guys are

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.810 
the entire battle phase if you guys are
wondering<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> heck<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:52.979> card<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.399> but

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
wondering what the heck that card is but

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.490 
wondering what the heck that card is but
it's<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:54.060> out<00:01:54.210> yet<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.720> um<00:01:54.899> Corey<00:01:55.350> Bennett

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
it's not out yet but um Corey Bennett

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.929 
it's not out yet but um Corey Bennett
will<00:01:55.680> probably<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> lot<00:01:56.250> more<00:01:56.369> utility

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
will probably have a lot more utility

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.789 
will probably have a lot more utility
for<00:01:57.149> other<00:01:57.329> decks<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.439> happen<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> have

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
for other decks so if you happen to have

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.200 
for other decks so if you happen to have
the<00:01:58.950> option<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.399> these<00:01:59.490> are<00:01:59.610> about<00:01:59.729> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the option because these are about the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
the option because these are about the
same<00:02:00.329> price<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.229> time<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.740> making<00:02:01.860> this

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
same price as the time of making this

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.800 
same price as the time of making this

a<00:03:18.310> little<00:03:18.460> bit<00:03:18.640> too<00:03:18.820> complicated<00:03:19.270> for<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.690> lot

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
a little bit too complicated for a lot

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.780 
a little bit too complicated for a lot
of<00:03:19.990> players<00:03:20.170> because<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.130> combos<00:03:21.610> in<00:03:21.700> this

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
of players because the combos in this

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.340 
of players because the combos in this
deck<00:03:21.910> are<00:03:22.060> really<00:03:22.360> really<00:03:22.570> extensive<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.230> if

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
deck are really really extensive and if

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.350 
deck are really really extensive and if
you<00:03:23.470> mess<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:23.800> up<00:03:24.040> or<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.640> missed<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.090> me<00:03:25.240> or

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
you mess it up or you missed I me or

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.520 
you mess it up or you missed I me or
something<00:03:25.600> like<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:26.080> can<00:03:26.200> cause<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.380> lot

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
something like that it can cause a lot

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.380 
something like that it can cause a lot
of<00:03:26.680> problems<00:03:27.070> but<00:03:27.610> it's<00:03:27.910> kind<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.210> difficult

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
of problems but it's kind of a difficult

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.360

deck to play but it definitely can be

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.920

technically make it ranked five it's a

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.070 
technically make it ranked five it's a
little<00:04:45.400> bit<00:04:45.490> more<00:04:45.670> difficult<00:04:45.820> but<00:04:46.210> it's<00:04:46.960> just

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
little bit more difficult but it's just

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.330 
little bit more difficult but it's just
going<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.230> be<00:04:47.290> much<00:04:47.440> faster<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.980> don't<00:04:48.160> think

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
going to be much faster I don't think

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.680 
going to be much faster I don't think

clerk Chrissy actually saw a rise in
price<00:05:30.070> and<00:05:30.100> I<00:05:30.430> was<00:05:30.550> trying<00:05:30.790> to<00:05:30.970> wonder<00:05:31.270> how

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
price and I was trying to wonder how

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.330 
price and I was trying to wonder how
this<00:05:31.720> card<00:05:31.990> actually<00:05:32.200> got<00:05:32.650> more<00:05:32.890> expensive

this card actually got more expensive

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.210 
this card actually got more expensive
because<00:05:33.400> like<00:05:33.730> I<00:05:33.940> guess<00:05:34.720> we<00:05:34.840> got<00:05:34.990> that<00:05:35.220> agent

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
because like I guess we got that agent

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.580 
because like I guess we got that agent
Uranus<00:05:36.640> that<00:05:36.940> card<00:05:37.240> perhaps<00:05:38.080> is<00:05:38.260> what<00:05:38.410> causes

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
Uranus that card perhaps is what causes

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.260 
Uranus that card perhaps is what causes
card<00:05:38.950> to<00:05:39.040> kind<00:05:39.220> of<00:05:39.280> go<00:05:39.400> up<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.610> mean<00:05:39.640> the<00:05:40.030> card<00:05:40.240> is

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
potential to be reprinted and Konami

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.150 
potential to be reprinted and Konami
already<00:06:56.960> basically<00:06:57.110> hinted<00:06:57.620> at<00:06:57.740> it<00:06:57.890> anyways

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
already basically hinted at it anyways

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.340 
already basically hinted at it anyways
I'm<00:06:58.340> and<00:06:58.760> how<00:06:59.090> long<00:06:59.390> has<00:06:59.690> it<00:06:59.720> been<00:06:59.870> since<00:07:00.020> we

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
I'm and how long has it been since we

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.320 
I'm and how long has it been since we
asked<00:07:00.740> for<00:07:00.770> a<00:07:00.890> draco<00:07:01.190> sack<00:07:01.370> reprint<00:07:01.850> and<00:07:02.030> you

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
asked for a draco sack reprint and you

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.180 
asked for a draco sack reprint and you
know<00:07:02.420> we<00:07:02.810> haven't<00:07:03.140> gotten<00:07:03.290> it<00:07:03.470> so<00:07:03.710> I<00:07:03.890> think

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
know we haven't gotten it so I think

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.380 
know we haven't gotten it so I think
it's<00:07:04.310> a<00:07:04.370> relatively<00:07:04.730> soon<00:07:05.030> that<00:07:05.150> will<00:07:05.240> get

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
it's a relatively soon that will get

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.730 
it's a relatively soon that will get
this<00:07:05.600> and<00:07:05.780> as<00:07:05.840> well<00:07:06.050> as<00:07:06.080> other<00:07:06.350> cards<00:07:06.680> I

strong<00:07:25.520> back<00:07:25.940> because<00:07:26.720> it's<00:07:26.810> going<00:07:26.900> to<00:07:26.960> be

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
strong back because it's going to be

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.780 
strong back because it's going to be
super<00:07:27.290> super<00:07:27.590> consistent<00:07:28.100> and<00:07:28.490> on<00:07:28.580> top<00:07:28.760> of

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:28.790 
super super consistent and on top of

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.090 
super super consistent and on top of
that<00:07:28.940> it's<00:07:29.240> relatively<00:07:30.110> simple<00:07:30.230> to<00:07:30.590> play<00:07:30.800> the

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.100 
that it's relatively simple to play the

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.470 
that it's relatively simple to play the
combos<00:07:31.550> aren't<00:07:31.730> really<00:07:31.880> too<00:07:32.000> difficult

something<00:07:32.630> like<00:07:32.840> a<00:07:32.870> plan<00:07:33.590> back<00:07:34.280> in<00:07:34.430> the<00:07:34.490> day

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.580 
something like a plan back in the day

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.370 
something like a plan back in the day
like<00:07:34.610> the<00:07:34.820> synchro<00:07:35.150> plan<00:07:35.330> is<00:07:35.419> very<00:07:35.450> very

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380 
like the synchro plan is very very

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.610 
like the synchro plan is very very
simple<00:07:36.650> deck<00:07:36.890> to<00:07:37.010> play<00:07:38.290> compared<00:07:39.290> to<00:07:39.380> like<00:07:39.470> I
