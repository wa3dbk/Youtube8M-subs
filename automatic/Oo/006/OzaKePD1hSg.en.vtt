00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.670

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.059
 with this piece and until then has conditions 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.770
 you work at that time requires a 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.350
 very complex structure is not only the 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.090
 horizontal stabilizer scaffolding also 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:35.550
 which in turn be washed wings 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:35.550

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.870

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.960

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.960

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.220
 years ago 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.040

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.480
 cart 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.670
 You can see it here, it's not, it's not a 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.000
 business done so the way it is done by 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.730
 aviation professionals already much more 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.730

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.970
 enough said that I will not take it anymore 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.440
 any professional to do this 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.570
 service has to be professional that 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.570
 has a very good feedback has then 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:05:04.060
 very large in professional life 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:06.639

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.389
