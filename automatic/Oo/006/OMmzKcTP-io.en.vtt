00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:58.820
Unseen tears dance in the empty sky on the sixteenth night.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:14.420
My words drift aimlessly, and i know they won't reach you.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.170
The noise freezes in time, losing itself in my love.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:28.670
One by one i lock the memories inside me, hoping i'll forget them.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.720
Lonely days, you are far in the past, i can't touch you.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.870
I can't say anything, but i want to meet you even now.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.970
Lonely heart has seen this distant dream through time.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:58.820
I hold on to my firm wish and my vague memories.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:25.520
Morning and night never meet each other, just as I can't meet you no matter how much I love you.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.320
The shreds of this world are stained with my love.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:41.470
I lock away your voice, and your image deep inside my precious past.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.120
Lonely days, unwind the time, let me see your past self.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.170
Don't leave me, let me hear your voice.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.270
Lonely heart, what dreams it saw over that time?

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:24.120
Quiet night, forget the promise we made on that sixteenth night.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.970
Forget it...
