00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
shooting a helicopter as you can see and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.910

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
by and those who markers are not just

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.719

from<00:01:24.200> shooting<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.649> pilot<00:01:24.860> inside<00:01:25.429> I'm

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
from shooting the pilot inside I'm

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.820 
from shooting the pilot inside I'm
actually<00:01:26.060> thinking<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.350> it's<00:01:27.470> because<00:01:27.710> he's

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
actually thinking that it's because he's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.740 
actually thinking that it's because he's
doing<00:01:28.069> damage<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.610> helicopter<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.330> I'm

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
doing damage to the helicopter and I'm

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.539 
doing damage to the helicopter and I'm
pretty<00:01:30.140> sure<00:01:30.259> that<00:01:30.649> if<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:30.890> played<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.280> beta

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
pretty sure that if you played the beta

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.850 
pretty sure that if you played the beta
you<00:01:31.850> noticed<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.780> could<00:01:32.929> shoot<00:01:33.200> vehicles<00:01:33.679> and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
you noticed you could shoot vehicles and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.260 
you noticed you could shoot vehicles and
they<00:01:33.920> actually<00:01:34.310> did<00:01:34.429> damage<00:01:34.789> to<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.940> vehicles

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
they actually did damage to the vehicles

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.880

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
inside but you cannot shoot the vehicle

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.899 
inside but you cannot shoot the vehicle
and<00:01:51.049> do<00:01:51.170> damage<00:01:51.320> itself<00:01:51.829> but<00:01:52.490> amount<00:01:52.820> from

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
and do damage itself but amount from

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.719 
and do damage itself but amount from
hardline<00:01:53.240> they<00:01:53.659> are<00:01:53.810> bringing<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.920> factor

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
hardline they are bringing in the factor

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.459 
hardline they are bringing in the factor
that<00:01:55.850> if<00:01:55.969> you<00:01:56.060> shoot<00:01:56.270> vehicles<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.140> bullets

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
that if you shoot vehicles the bullets

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.560 
that if you shoot vehicles the bullets
are<00:01:57.530> doing<00:01:57.770> damage<00:01:57.950> which<00:01:58.450> personally<00:01:59.450> I

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
are doing damage which personally I

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.929 
are doing damage which personally I
don't<00:01:59.780> like<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.369> might<00:02:01.640> work<00:02:01.789> out

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
don't like that but it might work out

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.639 
don't like that but it might work out
good<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.659> make<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.899> vehicle<00:02:03.229> is<00:02:03.320> not<00:02:03.350> so

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
good just to make the vehicle is not so

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.990 
good just to make the vehicle is not so
overpowered<00:02:04.219> because<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.490> know<00:02:04.609> they<00:02:04.939> were

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
overpowered because I know they were

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.630 
overpowered because I know they were
focusing<00:02:05.539> more<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:05.990> some<00:02:06.229> infantry<00:02:07.100> gameplay

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
focusing more on some infantry gameplay

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.539 
focusing more on some infantry gameplay
in<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:08.450> game<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.560> that's<00:02:09.799> that<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.340> then

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
in this game so that's that and then

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.280 
in this game so that's that and then
moving<00:02:10.850> on<00:02:11.060> here<00:02:11.239> he<00:02:11.540> runs<00:02:11.690> up<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.840> stairs<00:02:11.930> you

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
moving on here he runs up the stairs you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.259 
moving on here he runs up the stairs you
can<00:02:12.410> see<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.560> guy<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:13.040> he<00:02:13.100> goes<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.489> do<00:02:13.609> what<00:02:14.239> I

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
can see a guy and he goes to do what I

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.910 
can see a guy and he goes to do what I
assume<00:02:14.630> he<00:02:14.780> presses<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.260> knife<00:02:15.410> button<00:02:15.769> which

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
assume he presses the knife button which

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.780 
assume he presses the knife button which
is<00:02:16.100> f<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:17.950> it's<00:02:18.950> not<00:02:19.100> really<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.280> knife<00:02:19.489> it's

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
is f and it's not really a knife it's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.520 
is f and it's not really a knife it's
more<00:02:20.000> like<00:02:20.209> I'm<00:02:20.750> guessing<00:02:21.109> he's<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.230> cop

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
more like I'm guessing he's the cop

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.670 
more like I'm guessing he's the cop
because<00:02:21.799> he's<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> cop<00:02:23.000> he<00:02:23.930> gets<00:02:24.109> out<00:02:24.230> his<00:02:24.350> baton

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
because he's a cop he gets out his baton

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.349 
because he's a cop he gets out his baton
and<00:02:24.950> he<00:02:25.040> posted<00:02:25.370> around<00:02:25.430> his<00:02:25.640> neck<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.030> pulls

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
and he posted around his neck and pulls

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:27.550 
and he posted around his neck and pulls
the<00:02:26.420> guy<00:02:26.510> down<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.900> chokes<00:02:27.079> him<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.410> then

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the guy down and chokes him and then

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.059 
the guy down and chokes him and then
he's<00:02:27.709> gone<00:02:27.920> um<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:30.140> does<00:02:30.470> one<00:02:30.709> thing<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:30.890> noticed

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
he's gone um it does one thing I noticed

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.319 
he's gone um it does one thing I noticed
and<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.400> think<00:02:31.579> this<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.819> definitely<00:02:31.970> more

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
and I think this is definitely more

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.780 
and I think this is definitely more
realistic<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:33.019> do<00:02:33.079> like<00:02:33.739> this<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.069> lot<00:02:34.130> and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
realistic and I do like this a lot and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.849 
realistic and I do like this a lot and
previously<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.109> all<00:02:36.290> other<00:02:36.500> battlefields

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.259 
previously on it all other battlefields

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
there's no as far as I know there's been

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.809 
there's no as far as I know there's been

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
no other forms and knifing and so as you

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.130 
no other forms and knifing and so as you
can<00:02:40.880> see<00:02:41.030> here<00:02:41.180> this<00:02:41.299> guy<00:02:41.480> did<00:02:41.810> not<00:02:41.840> actually

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
can see here this guy did not actually

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.509 
can see here this guy did not actually

the<00:02:52.200> kind<00:02:52.379> of<00:02:52.410> thing<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:53.129> my<00:02:53.250> point<00:02:53.519> is<00:02:53.610> that

the kind of thing but my point is that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.460 
the kind of thing but my point is that

like<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.560> don't<00:03:04.739> know<00:03:04.800> two<00:03:05.010> seconds<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:06.330> year

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
like I don't know two seconds this year

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.960 
like I don't know two seconds this year
I<00:03:06.599> can<00:03:07.019> tell<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.739> like<00:03:07.920> noticeably<00:03:08.489> longer<00:03:08.670> at

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
I can tell is like noticeably longer at

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.699 
I can tell is like noticeably longer at
least<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.269> animation<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.170> even<00:03:10.349> if<00:03:10.560> it's

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
least the animation is and even if it's

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.500 
least the animation is and even if it's
like<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.519> animation<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.180> still<00:03:12.420> means

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
like just the animation that still means

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.729 
like just the animation that still means
you<00:03:12.690> aren't<00:03:12.870> able<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.230> shoot<00:03:13.410> while<00:03:13.620> you're

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
you aren't able to shoot while you're

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.410 
you aren't able to shoot while you're
knifing<00:03:14.040> which<00:03:14.519> i<00:03:14.640> think<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.849> very<00:03:14.940> good<00:03:15.269> that

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
knifing which i think is very good that

something<00:03:59.459> similar<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.910> this<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.209> called

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
something similar to this is called

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.170 
something similar to this is called
insanitary<00:04:01.049> in<00:04:01.319> sinaa<00:04:01.829> trary<00:04:02.130> today<00:04:02.670> i<00:04:02.910> can't

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
insanitary in sinaa trary today i can't

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.559 
insanitary in sinaa trary today i can't
i<00:04:03.299> can't<00:04:03.329> i<00:04:03.720> pronounced<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.500> in<00:04:05.280> ternary<00:04:05.609> i'm

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
i can't i pronounced it in ternary i'm

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.150

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.710 
gonna say incendiary grenade there we go
i<00:04:08.190> think<00:04:08.489> that's<00:04:08.609> right<00:04:08.700> basically<00:04:09.600> when<00:04:09.690> you

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
i think that's right basically when you

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.240 
i think that's right basically when you
throw<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.170> blew<00:04:10.319> up<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.590> fire<00:04:10.739> kind<00:04:11.130> of

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
throw it it blew up and fire kind of

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.789 
throw it it blew up and fire kind of
like<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.700> but<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> bit<00:04:12.389> more<00:04:12.799> real

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
like this but this is a bit more real

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.740 
like this but this is a bit more real
for<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:14.340> robbers<00:04:14.760> which<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.299> cool<00:04:15.540> because

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
for the robbers which is so cool because

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.199 
for the robbers which is so cool because
it's<00:04:16.019> just<00:04:16.169> it's<00:04:16.620> it's<00:04:16.950> more<00:04:17.400> its<00:04:17.700> diversity

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
it's just it's it's more its diversity

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.330 
it's just it's it's more its diversity
in<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.419> game<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.780> makes<00:04:18.870> just<00:04:19.139> it<00:04:19.829> separates

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
in the game that makes just it separates

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.039 
in the game that makes just it separates
the<00:04:20.459> two<00:04:20.489> teams<00:04:20.850> into<00:04:21.239> their<00:04:21.389> own<00:04:21.510> individual

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
the two teams into their own individual

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.210 
the two teams into their own individual
things<00:04:22.289> which<00:04:22.470> is<00:04:22.590> just<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.889> think<00:04:23.100> that's

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
things which is just I think that's

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.129 
things which is just I think that's
really<00:04:23.370> cool<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:24.360> is<00:04:24.510> one<00:04:24.660> small<00:04:24.870> thing<00:04:24.930> I

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
really cool this is one small thing I

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.250 
really cool this is one small thing I
noticed<00:04:25.470> here<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.580> also<00:04:27.389> here<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.840> can<00:04:27.990> see

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
noticed here and also here you can see

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.770 
noticed here and also here you can see
the<00:04:28.650> ceiling<00:04:29.099> falls<00:04:29.310> in<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.729> a<00:04:29.789> giant<00:04:30.030> air

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.200 
up the road falls in at a tank falls
through<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:05.980> was<00:05:06.220> really<00:05:06.430> cool<00:05:06.730> but<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.090> was

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
through it it was really cool but it was

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.140 
through it it was really cool but it was
the<00:05:07.330> only<00:05:07.570> map<00:05:08.140> in<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.440> game<00:05:09.030> basically<00:05:10.030> I'm

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
the only map in the game basically I'm

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.730 
the only map in the game basically I'm
they<00:05:10.270> were<00:05:10.420> like<00:05:10.570> a<00:05:10.600> few<00:05:10.960> others<00:05:11.260> had<00:05:11.500> stuff

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
they were like a few others had stuff

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.080 
they were like a few others had stuff
similar<00:05:12.070> to<00:05:12.160> this<00:05:12.250> but<00:05:12.430> this<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:12.580> really<00:05:12.880> the

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
similar to this but this is really the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.600 
similar to this but this is really the
only<00:05:13.120> time<00:05:13.600> that<00:05:13.870> this<00:05:14.410> this<00:05:15.040> clip<00:05:15.430> actually

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
only time that this this clip actually

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.430 
only time that this this clip actually
happened<00:05:16.120> was<00:05:16.150> this<00:05:16.330> one<00:05:16.630> spot<00:05:16.930> in<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.230> entire

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
happened was this one spot in the entire

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.600 
happened was this one spot in the entire
map<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:17.890> could<00:05:18.010> blow<00:05:18.190> up<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.400> road<00:05:18.520> and

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
map you could blow up the road and

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.860 
map you could blow up the road and
there's<00:05:18.730> a<00:05:18.760> katenka<00:05:19.030> following<00:05:19.450> it<00:05:19.570> wasn't

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
there's a katenka following it wasn't

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.140 
there's a katenka following it wasn't
like<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:19.990> useful<00:05:20.440> thing<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:21.550> wasn't<00:05:21.760> too<00:05:21.940> useful

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
like a useful thing it wasn't too useful

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.210 
like a useful thing it wasn't too useful
as<00:05:22.420> many<00:05:22.600> made<00:05:22.990> for<00:05:23.170> a<00:05:23.200> maid<00:05:23.470> for<00:05:23.500> effect<00:05:23.950> but

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
as many made for a maid for effect but

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.820 
as many made for a maid for effect but
I'm<00:05:24.630> hoping<00:05:25.630> that<00:05:25.780> maybe<00:05:25.930> this<00:05:26.230> is<00:05:26.380> used<00:05:26.620> more

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
I'm hoping that maybe this is used more

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.050 
I'm hoping that maybe this is used more
in<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.040> game<00:05:27.220> because<00:05:27.460> when<00:05:27.610> I<00:05:27.640> played<00:05:27.910> the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
in the game because when I played the

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.970 
in the game because when I played the
beta<00:05:28.660> there<00:05:28.960> was<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.110> lot<00:05:29.380> of<00:05:29.410> underground

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
beta there was a lot of underground

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.400 
beta there was a lot of underground
tunnels<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:30.550> stuff<00:05:30.730> and<00:05:30.910> this<00:05:31.000> may<00:05:31.240> be<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.750> type

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
tunnels and stuff and this may be a type

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.070 
tunnels and stuff and this may be a type
of<00:05:33.180> evolution<00:05:34.180> and<00:05:34.240> destruction<00:05:34.750> that's<00:05:34.870> more

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
of evolution and destruction that's more

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.290 
of evolution and destruction that's more
common<00:05:35.290> that<00:05:35.530> didn't<00:05:36.130> we<00:05:36.220> actually<00:05:36.490> think<00:05:36.670> but

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
common that didn't we actually think but

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.940 
common that didn't we actually think but
yeah<00:05:37.750> who<00:05:37.960> knows<00:05:38.140> it<00:05:38.350> could<00:05:38.380> be<00:05:38.620> just<00:05:38.800> like

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
yeah who knows it could be just like

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.500 
yeah who knows it could be just like
that<00:05:39.100> before<00:05:39.280> where<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.790> roof<00:05:39.940> falls<00:05:40.150> in<00:05:40.300> this

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
that before where the roof falls in this

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.540 
that before where the roof falls in this
one<00:05:40.720> spot<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:41.230> that's<00:05:41.290> it<00:05:41.530> who<00:05:42.160> knows<00:05:42.370> i

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
one spot and that's it who knows i

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.900 
one spot and that's it who knows i
really<00:05:42.940> hope<00:05:43.090> it's<00:05:43.270> everywhere<00:05:43.570> though<00:05:43.780> and

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
really hope it's everywhere though and

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.280 
really hope it's everywhere though and
lastly<00:05:45.910> here<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:46.240> can<00:05:46.420> see<00:05:46.690> or<00:05:46.960> not<00:05:47.050> really

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
lastly here you can see or not really

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.600 
lastly here you can see or not really
lastly<00:05:47.590> but<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:47.830> can<00:05:47.950> see<00:05:48.070> these<00:05:48.160> guys<00:05:48.310> up<00:05:48.520> on

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
lastly but you can see these guys up on

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.410 
lastly but you can see these guys up on
a<00:05:48.670> tower<00:05:48.940> and<00:05:49.230> he<00:05:50.230> actually<00:05:51.040> is<00:05:51.610> sniping<00:05:52.210> here

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
a tower and he actually is sniping here

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.270 
a tower and he actually is sniping here
and<00:05:52.690> i<00:05:53.050> just<00:05:53.260> noticed<00:05:53.620> a<00:05:53.680> thing<00:05:53.800> that<00:05:53.860> did<00:05:54.130> not

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
and i just noticed a thing that did not

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.730 
and i just noticed a thing that did not
change<00:05:54.580> is<00:05:54.880> it's<00:05:55.480> not<00:05:55.630> one<00:05:55.840> shot<00:05:56.170> kills<00:05:56.500> now

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
change is it's not one shot kills now

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.740 
change is it's not one shot kills now
always<00:05:57.280> it's<00:05:57.880> still<00:05:58.030> one<00:05:58.210> shot<00:05:58.360> head<00:05:58.510> shots

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
always it's still one shot head shots

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.870 
always it's still one shot head shots
but<00:05:59.080> not<00:05:59.320> one<00:05:59.590> shot<00:05:59.890> kills<00:06:00.190> like<00:06:00.490> in<00:06:00.640> Call<00:06:00.850> of

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
but not one shot kills like in Call of

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.210 
but not one shot kills like in Call of
Duty<00:06:01.150> or<00:06:01.180> whatever<00:06:01.480> so<00:06:02.170> that's<00:06:02.320> pretty<00:06:02.650> nice<00:06:02.890> I

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
Duty or whatever so that's pretty nice I

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.470 
Duty or whatever so that's pretty nice I
think<00:06:03.430> that<00:06:03.460> makes<00:06:03.700> it<00:06:03.820> a<00:06:03.910> little<00:06:04.060> bit<00:06:04.240> more

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
think that makes it a little bit more

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.600 
think that makes it a little bit more
realistic<00:06:04.810> I<00:06:05.110> guess<00:06:05.380> maybe<00:06:05.860> not<00:06:06.130> I<00:06:06.340> don't<00:06:06.370> know

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
realistic I guess maybe not I don't know

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.430 
realistic I guess maybe not I don't know
I<00:06:06.760> think<00:06:07.150> I'll<00:06:07.360> do<00:06:07.570> like<00:06:07.720> a<00:06:07.750> bed<00:06:07.960> looks<00:06:08.200> it<00:06:08.320> add

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
I think I'll do like a bed looks it add

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.780 
I think I'll do like a bed looks it add
some<00:06:08.560> more<00:06:08.620> skilled<00:06:08.860> of<00:06:08.950> sniping<00:06:09.160> there's<00:06:09.700> no

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
some more skilled of sniping there's no

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.310 
some more skilled of sniping there's no
quick<00:06:10.090> scoping<00:06:10.480> cuz<00:06:10.630> that's<00:06:10.750> really<00:06:11.140> really

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
quick scoping cuz that's really really

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.260 
quick scoping cuz that's really really
unrealistic<00:06:11.890> and<00:06:12.250> just<00:06:12.460> not<00:06:12.640> I<00:06:12.880> don't<00:06:13.180> know

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
unrealistic and just not I don't know

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.240 
unrealistic and just not I don't know
anyway<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:14.140> then<00:06:14.320> also<00:06:14.470> you<00:06:14.680> can<00:06:14.890> see<00:06:15.040> here

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
anyway so then also you can see here

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.830 
anyway so then also you can see here
this<00:06:15.430> is<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.700> last<00:06:15.910> sort<00:06:16.210> of<00:06:16.270> function<00:06:16.630> I'd

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
this is the last sort of function I'd

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.380 
this is the last sort of function I'd
say<00:06:17.020> is<00:06:17.140> definitely<00:06:17.500> new<00:06:17.560> to<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.740> game

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
say is definitely new to the game

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.700 
say is definitely new to the game
ziplining<00:06:19.390> and<00:06:19.660> then<00:06:19.810> also<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.410> for<00:06:20.590> that

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
ziplining and then also the for that

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.140 
ziplining and then also the for that
sniper<00:06:20.950> to<00:06:21.070> get<00:06:21.160> up<00:06:21.250> there<00:06:21.370> he<00:06:21.700> actually<00:06:21.880> did

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
sniper to get up there he actually did

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.670 
sniper to get up there he actually did
have<00:06:22.300> to<00:06:22.450> use<00:06:22.570> a<00:06:22.600> grappling<00:06:22.960> hook<00:06:23.140> which<00:06:23.500> is

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
have to use a grappling hook which is

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.500 
have to use a grappling hook which is
pretty<00:06:23.860> cool<00:06:24.130> and<00:06:24.340> then<00:06:24.970> the<00:06:25.090> zip<00:06:25.240> line<00:06:25.390> of

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
pretty cool and then the zip line of

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.430 
pretty cool and then the zip line of
course<00:06:25.720> he<00:06:25.840> rides<00:06:26.050> it<00:06:26.140> all<00:06:26.230> the<00:06:26.290> way<00:06:26.410> down

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
course he rides it all the way down

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.770 
course he rides it all the way down
there<00:06:26.770> for<00:06:27.010> a<00:06:27.070> fast<00:06:27.310> sort<00:06:27.880> of<00:06:28.000> way<00:06:28.150> to<00:06:28.210> get<00:06:28.630> out

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
there for a fast sort of way to get out

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.810 
there for a fast sort of way to get out
of<00:06:28.900> there<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.230> I<00:06:30.070> don't<00:06:30.460> know<00:06:30.610> if<00:06:30.700> they're

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
of there and I don't know if they're

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.000 
of there and I don't know if they're
going<00:06:30.910> to<00:06:31.000> be<00:06:31.120> like<00:06:31.270> very<00:06:32.110> limited<00:06:32.650> spots<00:06:32.830> on

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
going to be like very limited spots on

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.470 
going to be like very limited spots on
the<00:06:33.100> map<00:06:33.130> you<00:06:33.460> can<00:06:33.610> use<00:06:33.820> these<00:06:33.970> or<00:06:34.270> if<00:06:34.360> it's

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
the map you can use these or if it's

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.090 
the map you can use these or if it's
going<00:06:34.570> to<00:06:34.630> be<00:06:34.780> like<00:06:34.960> almost<00:06:35.530> everywhere<00:06:35.950> you

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
going to be like almost everywhere you

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.920 
going to be like almost everywhere you
can<00:06:36.190> actually<00:06:36.340> use<00:06:36.520> your<00:06:36.760> zip<00:06:36.790> line<00:06:37.090> I<00:06:37.300> really

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
can actually use your zip line I really

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.570 
can actually use your zip line I really
hope<00:06:38.080> it's<00:06:38.320> really<00:06:38.710> versatile<00:06:39.190> and<00:06:39.460> you<00:06:39.550> can

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
hope it's really versatile and you can

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.310 
hope it's really versatile and you can
use<00:06:39.790> them<00:06:39.970> everywhere<00:06:40.300> but<00:06:40.600> who<00:06:40.750> knows<00:06:40.930> it<00:06:41.200> may

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
use them everywhere but who knows it may

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.840 
use them everywhere but who knows it may
just<00:06:41.350> be<00:06:41.590> like<00:06:41.830> four<00:06:42.100> spots<00:06:42.460> in<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.640> map<00:06:42.820> you

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
just be like four spots in the map you

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.910 
just be like four spots in the map you
can<00:06:43.120> use<00:06:43.330> them<00:06:43.480> nonetheless<00:06:44.320> it's<00:06:44.680> really

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920 
can use them nonetheless it's really

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.460 
can use them nonetheless it's really
cool<00:06:45.130> and<00:06:45.600> yeah<00:06:46.600> so<00:06:46.810> and<00:06:46.960> then<00:06:47.050> here<00:06:47.290> at<00:06:47.410> the

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
cool and yeah so and then here at the

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.880 
cool and yeah so and then here at the
very<00:06:47.620> end<00:06:47.740> you<00:06:47.860> can<00:06:47.980> see<00:06:48.160> this<00:06:48.340> clip<00:06:48.640> of<00:06:49.890> the

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
very end you can see this clip of the

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.260 
very end you can see this clip of the
destruction<00:06:51.340> in<00:06:51.610> the<00:06:51.700> game<00:06:51.850> which<00:06:52.090> I<00:06:52.180> was

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
destruction in the game which I was

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.850 
destruction in the game which I was
talking<00:06:52.480> about<00:06:52.600> earlier<00:06:52.750> where<00:06:53.350> if<00:06:53.560> you<00:06:53.680> shoot

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
talking about earlier where if you shoot

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.980 
talking about earlier where if you shoot
the<00:06:54.010> walls<00:06:54.220> they<00:06:54.550> break<00:06:54.820> a<00:06:54.850> lot<00:06:55.120> and<00:06:55.450> you<00:06:55.840> can

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
the walls they break a lot and you can

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.300 
the walls they break a lot and you can
just<00:06:56.200> like<00:06:56.350> shoot<00:06:56.590> straight<00:06:56.920> through<00:06:57.160> them

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
just like shoot straight through them

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.280 
just like shoot straight through them
and<00:06:57.520> damage<00:06:58.510> the<00:06:58.540> people<00:06:58.900> on<00:06:58.990> the<00:06:59.080> other<00:06:59.170> side

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
and damage the people on the other side

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.440 
and damage the people on the other side
because<00:06:59.980> before<00:07:00.490> in<00:07:00.640> battlefield<00:07:01.120> it<00:07:01.330> was

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
because before in battlefield it was

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.150 
because before in battlefield it was
like<00:07:01.630> from<00:07:01.840> you<00:07:02.140> shoot<00:07:02.320> a<00:07:02.350> wall<00:07:02.620> a<00:07:02.650> lot<00:07:03.070> of

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
like from you shoot a wall a lot of

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.400 
like from you shoot a wall a lot of
times<00:07:03.340> the<00:07:03.520> walls<00:07:03.730> invincible<00:07:04.300> so<00:07:04.990> I<00:07:05.230> mean

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
times the walls invincible so I mean

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.330 
times the walls invincible so I mean
there<00:07:05.500> were<00:07:05.560> certain<00:07:05.830> walls<00:07:05.980> that<00:07:06.130> weren't

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
there were certain walls that weren't

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.950 
there were certain walls that weren't
but<00:07:06.490> this<00:07:06.610> is<00:07:06.760> like<00:07:06.940> I<00:07:07.150> mean<00:07:07.330> you<00:07:07.480> needed<00:07:07.780> like

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
but this is like I mean you needed like

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.810 
but this is like I mean you needed like
c4<00:07:08.200> to<00:07:08.500> blow<00:07:08.560> the<00:07:08.800> wall<00:07:08.920> open<00:07:09.250> and<00:07:09.400> this<00:07:09.490> is<00:07:09.640> so

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
c4 to blow the wall open and this is so

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.230 
c4 to blow the wall open and this is so
much<00:07:09.970> more<00:07:10.030> realistic<00:07:10.270> because<00:07:10.630> real<00:07:11.020> walls

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
much more realistic because real walls

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.879 
much more realistic because real walls
our<00:07:12.300> own<00:07:12.539> they're<00:07:13.229> they're<00:07:13.470> really<00:07:13.680> actually

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:13.889 
our own they're they're really actually

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.309 
our own they're they're really actually
pretty<00:07:14.190> thin<00:07:14.520> and<00:07:14.789> if<00:07:15.449> anything<00:07:15.690> is<00:07:15.900> just<00:07:16.050> wood

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 
pretty thin and if anything is just wood

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.999 
pretty thin and if anything is just wood
and<00:07:16.500> bullets<00:07:16.800> can<00:07:17.009> go<00:07:17.220> through<00:07:17.960> walls<00:07:19.009> wood

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:20.009 
and bullets can go through walls wood

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.309 
and bullets can go through walls wood
walls<00:07:20.370> like<00:07:20.669> this<00:07:20.849> right<00:07:21.240> so<00:07:21.479> that's<00:07:22.050> really

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 
walls like this right so that's really

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.080 
walls like this right so that's really
really<00:07:22.620> cool<00:07:22.680> and<00:07:23.160> I<00:07:23.280> hope<00:07:23.460> you<00:07:23.580> guys<00:07:23.699> enjoyed

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
really cool and I hope you guys enjoyed

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.730 
really cool and I hope you guys enjoyed
