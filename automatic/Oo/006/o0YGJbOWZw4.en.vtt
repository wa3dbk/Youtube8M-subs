00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.849
 will hire you learn without turning on a 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.410
 fire of which is more neglect is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.510
 much more dangerous is how 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.230
 the state and do not take this video to 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.230
 slight even an experienced cap and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.539
 some warned may commit 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.340
 a few forgetful things about me this summer 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.960
 I went to the forest with a friend 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 and when I leave, I think I have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.539
 put out the fire and actually no five 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.649
 days later even though it had rained 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.929
 fire had started to take 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.039
 you see a little the dangerous the 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.839
 dangerousness of facts so that's when 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.479
 you find out how it's the first 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.780
 thing to do before the disperse publisher 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.780
 embers 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.700
 then go take some water either 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.700
 no rumbles a popote wamer jerrycans 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.140
 that's it, then it'll have to watered time 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.680
 who has always assumed very little 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.490
 heat are still there again a little 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.229
 little hot you have to add water 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:45.220
 and that's why we need to have 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:48.549
 large amounts of water you see there the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.090
 fire and immerse yourself in water that's good on 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.650
 can stop 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.690
 he does not assume any more 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.380
 now we will take care of the pieces 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.690
 charred that are still wood too 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.800
 the coal that we will not let them 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.730
 here we put them somewhere else 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.730
 it's me 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.619
 the pieces of charcoal wood and I lay 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.750
 before authors we are not at 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.790
 ground contact like for example a 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.680
 tree stump a stone a big 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.340
 stone or anything that can be 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.069
 they can be high here I 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.640
 puts them the charbonned part towards the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.870
 top and the others too 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.870
 they must not touch each other 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.220
 here it is with no risk that it will take 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.910
 after this one must check if the fire 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.400
 is very cold for that the sink 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.170
 finger in the earth we look if the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.319
 cold or hot 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.340
 if it is hot to add water 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.100
 now only coal remains 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.450
 and ashes there is a little fire 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.590
 but when at a fire of several days 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.310
 has deep roots in this hall 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.420
 so using a solid anton stick 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.420
 digging values 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.460
 here and that now all the sambre 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.480
 we will put it 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.480
 we will disperse it elsewhere 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.330
 the fire is out now 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.330
 to hide one covers of earth 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.340
 and then dead leaves and 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.670
 other plants will seem like a 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.670
 suspect 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.390
 it takes more or less fire than 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:54.710
 Having soft was still adds 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:57.800
 water and after that too would have to stay 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.620
 few moments in the vicinity for 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.020
 see if the lights do not smoke anymore hydro smokes 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.790
 must do everything to remove everything 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.920
 return the earth scratch cover 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.200
 water and put back beer and 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.550
 leaves so this video is one of 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.930
 safest ways to put out a fire 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.790
 with that the fire will answer very little 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.109
 chances that the hair will resume so 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.410
 I hope this video will be much slower 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.650
 account that the mouths cafes and others 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.570
 is a funny good their fire because 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.950
 we and flight we evolve in nature 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.100
 it would be stupid to ruin her let her 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.140
 burn really read lately all 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.920
 false arts in relation to fires and 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.350
 to go to the damage that makes havoc 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.700
 so be careful thank you for having 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.700
 business video no more
