 accompanied by melting potatoes 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.760
 onions are placed generous and 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.039
 friendly and for six people 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380
 it is moderately difficult to achieve 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.600
 count 20 minutes of preparation and a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.939
 thirty minutes of cooking for 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.830
 ingredients you need a shoulder 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.960

 red for their sweet little taste that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.360
 will go very well with this dish first of all 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.149
 preheat your oven to 180 degrees or 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.190
 thermostat 6 we have to start this 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.109
 recipe by preparing apples from 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.969
 earth with onions that must cook more 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.809
 long time to be well melting and 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.210
 well preserved 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 peel the potatoes remove the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 possible small black spots if 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 needed for slices then in 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.409
 rondelles of half a centimeter 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.380
 thick on a regular basis if 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.390
 possible used a robot if you in 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.450
 have one to go faster it's done 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.500
 for that we divide everything into a dish 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.900
 baking and around onions on 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.820
 remove the ends and the first 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 skin we cut them in half then 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.720
 roughly in 2000 have her in it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.460
 the other way as for apples from 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.689
 land a robot elbow can you 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.689
 save a lot of time 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.100
 spread the onions in the dish 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.990
 with potatoes or pepper well 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.020
 we water well olive oil 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.940
 and a glass of water nothing complicated 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.470
 just a little bit of preparation and its 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.820
 priests bake for 20 minutes 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.890
 while the potatoes are cooking 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.440

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.160
 container we peel the garlic cloves on 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.060

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.060
 go to press garlic 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.650
