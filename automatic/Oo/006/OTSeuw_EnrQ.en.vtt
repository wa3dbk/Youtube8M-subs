 Hello everyone, everything good 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.809
 a week ago i put a photo 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.809
 mine on instagram on my back with a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.670
 hairstyle and their crazy faces preventing 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.010
 How did you do that hairstyle? 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.320
 in fact who already taught him that in 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.390
 internet was the one I saw that would be the owner 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.670
 a long time ago she said that the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.949
 Frenchwoman wears this hairstyle and went with 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 The one I learned I found that everything 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.420
 world had seen this video davi that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.730
 so I never taught it because I found it 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.030
 that people are listening but like some 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.890
 girls asked me for hairdo it's mega 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.260
 easy to do 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.510
 Today I'll teach you how to do it. Come on. 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.520
 You did not see my picture on instagram. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.789
 there lost of seeing all the happiness in 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.180
 punta cana place as beautiful as the beaches 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.129
 Wonderful but it still gives time and goes there 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.070
 in instagram and looking for things of 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.050
 diva then starting we go 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.260
 need a little hair 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.180
 normal and some large 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.100
 If you want, you can drop something. 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.500
 in the hair before he earns more 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.760
 texture can be those products 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.930
 powder up to a few premiums goes from 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.060
 I like the customer 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.229
 What you're going to do is get the track and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.890
 put on the head is like a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.540
 buttocks over the same hair 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.820
 so I'll take this first one 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:36.960
 march here from the front and roll 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:42.150
 window and fit behind not think I'll 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.820
 Turn around so you can see I think the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.820
 and caught a ride on the hair here 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.700
 The idea is to stay well straight up. 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.300
 maybe with the strands falling a thing well 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.310
 loose without being all millimeter 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.190
 company places on the hair only comes a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.680
 thing like that but then I'm our mother 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.780

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.530

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.630
 that pt picks up the little one and goes through 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.660
 in that the elastic means giving a 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.680

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.880

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.220

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.540

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.660
 these two pieces here do the same 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.660
 thing 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.209

 even in hair that is super thin and smooth 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.200
 Average is cool, you do not like it. 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.900
 if you do that hairstyle at home 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.630
