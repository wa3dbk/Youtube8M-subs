00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
surprise and but I thought in the second

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.160 
surprise and but I thought in the second
part<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> second<00:00:30.300> half<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.630> came<00:00:30.840> into<00:00:31.019> it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
part the second half we came into it

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.200

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
think you know they're just just a very

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.959 
think you know they're just just a very
imposing<00:00:51.600> figure<00:00:52.100> in<00:00:53.100> goal<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:53.640> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
imposing figure in goal and I think it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.580 
imposing figure in goal and I think it
was<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> good<00:00:54.329> tactical<00:00:54.809> move<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.340> anyway<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
was a good tactical move and anyway the
