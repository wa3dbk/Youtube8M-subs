said the same thing this is a microphone

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.620 
said the same thing this is a microphone
that<00:01:58.930> if<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.110> put<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.700> where<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.729> sound<00:02:01.390> is

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
that if you put it where the sound is

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.859 
that if you put it where the sound is
good<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.860> when<00:02:03.130> you're<00:02:03.340> there<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:04.540> open

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
good to you when you're there you open

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.899 
good to you when you're there you open
up<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.140> faders<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.830> that's<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.430> sound<00:02:06.670> you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
up the faders and that's the sound you

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.139 
up the faders and that's the sound you
get<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.990> if<00:02:08.080> you've<00:02:08.200> spent<00:02:08.640> years<00:02:09.640> or<00:02:10.000> decades

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
get so if you've spent years or decades

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.990 
get so if you've spent years or decades
working<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.230> your<00:02:11.439> own<00:02:11.560> sound<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:12.790> a

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
working on your own sound this is a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
working on your own sound this is a
useful<00:02:13.360> microphone<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.319> think<00:02:14.530> about<00:02:14.819> it's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
useful microphone to think about it's

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.380 
useful microphone to think about it's
a<00:02:16.110> figure-8<00:02:16.950> which<00:02:17.520> means<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.970> will<00:02:18.030> make<00:02:18.210> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
a figure-8 which means it will make the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.060 
a figure-8 which means it will make the
room<00:02:18.570> sound<00:02:18.900> bigger<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.740> put<00:02:19.950> it

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
room sound bigger if you put it

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.680 
room sound bigger if you put it
vertically<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.670> won't<00:02:20.850> pay<00:02:21.060> any<00:02:21.240> attention<00:02:21.330> to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
vertically it won't pay any attention to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.930 
vertically it won't pay any attention to
the<00:02:21.870> Florida<00:02:22.200> ceiling<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.400> look<00:02:23.610> at<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> view<00:02:23.880> a
