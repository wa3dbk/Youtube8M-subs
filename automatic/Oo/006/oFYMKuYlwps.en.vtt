00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.509 

we<00:00:06.540> take<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.930> regulations<00:00:07.589> look<00:00:08.189> what<00:00:08.370> would

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
we take the regulations look what would

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.700 
we take the regulations look what would
be<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> ultimate<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.389> then<00:00:09.900> apply<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.320> car

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
be the ultimate and then apply the car

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.490 
be the ultimate and then apply the car
to<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.370> so<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.420> think<00:00:12.630> you've<00:00:12.780> broken<00:00:13.049> up<00:00:13.320> into

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
to that so I think you've broken up into

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.440 
to that so I think you've broken up into
probably<00:00:13.769> six<00:00:14.009> months<00:00:14.070> sectors<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.059> first<00:00:15.299> is

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
probably six months sectors the first is

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.599 
probably six months sectors the first is
the<00:00:15.599> generic<00:00:15.929> design<00:00:16.379> then<00:00:17.010> you're<00:00:17.190> starting

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
the generic design then you're starting

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.660 
the generic design then you're starting
to<00:00:17.840> detailed<00:00:18.840> application<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> car<00:00:20.490> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
to detailed application of the car to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.970 
to detailed application of the car to
those<00:00:20.850> designs<00:00:21.359> then<00:00:22.320> you're<00:00:22.500> looking<00:00:22.859> at

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
those designs then you're looking at

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.130 
those designs then you're looking at
another<00:00:23.670> six<00:00:24.060> months<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> detailed

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
another six months to do the detailed

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.620 
another six months to do the detailed
drawings<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.000> manufacturing<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.119> prototype

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
drawings and manufacturing of prototype

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.320 
drawings and manufacturing of prototype
parts<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.500> then<00:00:28.830> about<00:00:29.460> another<00:00:29.519> six<00:00:30.029> months

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
parts and then about another six months

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
parts and then about another six months
for<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> testing<00:00:31.109> program<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.800> you're

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
for the testing program so you're

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040 
for the testing program so you're
looking<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.430> two-year<00:00:33.390> gestation

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
looking at this two-year gestation

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
looking at this two-year gestation
period<00:00:34.440> from<00:00:34.590> original<00:00:35.430> thought<00:00:35.670> process<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
period from original thought process to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.990 
period from original thought process to
delivering<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.200> car<00:00:37.410> when<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.489> thinks<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
delivering the car when one thinks of it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.930 
delivering the car when one thinks of it
in<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.239> British<00:00:39.660> context<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.790> considers<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
in a British context and considers the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.229 
in a British context and considers the
impact<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.440> on

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
impact this is going to have on

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
impact this is going to have on
motorsport<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> UK<00:00:45.930> we've<00:00:46.140> had<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> sort

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
motorsport in the UK we've had the sort

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.610 
motorsport in the UK we've had the sort
