hello<00:00:02.340> folks<00:00:02.639> you<00:00:03.330> know<00:00:03.480> I've<00:00:03.659> had<00:00:03.840> this

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hello folks you know I've had this

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.230 
hello folks you know I've had this
vintage<00:00:04.259> flying<00:00:04.770> toy<00:00:05.009> for<00:00:05.310> many<00:00:05.520> years<00:00:05.819> but<00:00:06.089> I

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
vintage flying toy for many years but I

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.089 
vintage flying toy for many years but I
don't<00:00:06.450> ever<00:00:06.629> remember<00:00:06.779> trying<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.440> fly<00:00:07.740> it<00:00:07.770> I

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
don't ever remember trying to fly it I

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.490 
don't ever remember trying to fly it I
guess<00:00:08.400> for<00:00:08.610> lack<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.820> room<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:09.960> supposed<00:00:10.380> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
guess for lack of room it's supposed to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.320 
guess for lack of room it's supposed to
be<00:00:10.679> used<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:11.130> boomerangs<00:00:11.790> which<00:00:12.150> are

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
be used like boomerangs which are

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.419 
be used like boomerangs which are
designed<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:13.049> lift<00:00:13.349> when<00:00:13.559> thrown<00:00:13.889> and

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
designed to have lift when thrown and

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.279 
designed to have lift when thrown and
glide<00:00:14.820> back<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.450> if<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.719> throw<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.049> right

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
glide back to you if you throw it right

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.590 
glide back to you if you throw it right
but<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> little<00:00:17.520> practice<00:00:17.850> you'll<00:00:18.359> see

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
but with a little practice you'll see

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200 
but with a little practice you'll see
that's<00:00:18.840> actually<00:00:19.350> quite<00:00:19.529> manageable<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
that's actually quite manageable the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.910 
that's actually quite manageable the
directions<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:21.869> pretty<00:00:22.080> hard<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.439> read<00:00:22.710> on

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
directions are pretty hard to read on

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.950 
directions are pretty hard to read on
the<00:00:23.070> toy<00:00:23.250> as<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.600> I'm<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:24.930> sure

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
can't read it very well myself there's

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.650 
can't read it very well myself there's
also<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.970> bat<00:00:30.420> printed<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> wings
