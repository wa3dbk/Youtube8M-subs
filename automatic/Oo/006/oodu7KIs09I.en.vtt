and<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.640> didn't<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:47.790> keep<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.120> had<00:02:49.810> times

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
and if it didn't I keep I had times

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.370 
and if it didn't I keep I had times
where<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:51.790> was<00:02:52.090> towards<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.690> end<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
where it was towards the end of the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.910 
where it was towards the end of the
cycle<00:02:53.680> there<00:02:54.190> wasn't<00:02:54.670> much<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.269> there<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.200> it

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
cycle there wasn't much in there and it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.190 
cycle there wasn't much in there and it
didn't<00:02:57.310> realize<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.030> what<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.209> do<00:02:58.329> is<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.750> keep<00:02:58.959> my

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
didn't realize so what I do is I keep my

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.340 
didn't realize so what I do is I keep my
torch<00:02:59.560> here<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.250> if<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.299> have<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.930> at<00:03:02.109> that

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
torch here and if I have to at that

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.350 
torch here and if I have to at that
stage

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
stage

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.670 
stage
and<00:03:05.470> hid<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.770> literally<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:08.120> ten<00:03:08.959> seconds

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
and hid it and literally in ten seconds

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.570 
and hid it and literally in ten seconds
I've<00:03:10.280> got<00:03:10.520> fire<00:03:10.940> going<00:03:11.450> again<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.650> I'm<00:03:13.370> not

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
I've got fire going again so I'm not

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.170 
I've got fire going again so I'm not
sure<00:03:13.640> how<00:03:14.030> long<00:03:14.090> it's<00:03:14.540> been<00:03:14.660> here

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
sure how long it's been here

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.760 
sure how long it's been here
but<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.209> want<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.630> see<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.110> where<00:03:18.349> we're<00:03:18.590> at<00:03:18.739> now

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
short time and we got some pretty good

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.870 
short time and we got some pretty good
coals<00:03:30.380> going<00:03:30.890> again<00:03:31.480> inside<00:03:32.480> there<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:34.220> we

coals going again inside there and we
are<00:03:35.350> working<00:03:36.350> towards<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.890> end<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.670> this

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
are working towards the end of this

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.789 
are working towards the end of this
cycle<00:03:39.220> since<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.430> loaded<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:41.180> stove<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.560> we're

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
cycle since I loaded this stove so we're

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.990 
cycle since I loaded this stove so we're
burning<00:03:43.370> through<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.880> complete<00:03:44.600> cycle<00:03:45.880> so<00:03:46.880> at

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
burning through a complete cycle so at

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.420 
burning through a complete cycle so at
this<00:03:47.209> stage<00:03:47.569> while<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.019> was<00:03:48.410> here<00:03:48.709> not<00:03:49.400> a

the<00:03:58.010> sides<00:03:58.370> at<00:03:59.120> this<00:03:59.510> stage

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:24.520 

pretty<00:04:06.860> good<00:04:07.070> right<00:04:08.030> there<00:04:23.020> all<00:04:24.020> right<00:04:24.110> so

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
pretty good right there all right so

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.930 
pretty good right there all right so
we're<00:04:24.970> we're<00:04:25.970> starting<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.450> get<00:04:26.660> going<00:04:27.050> again

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
we're we're starting to get going again

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:37.740 
we're we're starting to get going again
and<00:04:28.940> put<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.360> back<00:04:29.570> in<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.990> run<00:04:30.200> position<00:04:33.910> and

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.560 

I'm<00:04:38.750> going<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:38.930> open<00:04:39.350> this<00:04:40.180> secondary<00:04:41.180> burn

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
I'm going to open this secondary burn

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.260 
I'm going to open this secondary burn
chamber<00:04:43.240> we're<00:04:44.240> at<00:04:44.919> 166<00:04:45.919> so<00:04:46.310> we<00:04:46.490> dipped<00:04:46.940> a

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
chamber we're at 166 so we dipped a

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.510 
chamber we're at 166 so we dipped a
little<00:04:47.720> bit<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.440> house<00:04:48.620> is<00:04:48.890> still<00:04:49.160> calling

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
little bit the house is still calling

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.010 
little bit the house is still calling
for<00:04:49.970> heat<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:51.710> boiler<00:04:52.160> is<00:04:52.220> trying<00:04:52.610> to

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
for heat and the boiler is trying to

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.950 
for heat and the boiler is trying to
satisfy<00:04:54.020> that<00:04:54.440> need<00:04:54.950> plus<00:04:55.610> recover<00:04:56.300> back<00:04:56.660> to

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
satisfy that need plus recover back to

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.170 
satisfy that need plus recover back to
1/8<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:59.500> here's<00:05:00.500> what<00:05:00.710> we<00:05:00.860> got<00:05:00.890> going<00:05:01.430> on<00:05:01.550> the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
1/8 so here's what we got going on the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.000 
1/8 so here's what we got going on the
secondary<00:05:02.870> burners<00:05:03.169> so<00:05:03.440> we're<00:05:03.620> starting<00:05:03.830> to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
secondary burners so we're starting to

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.159 
secondary burners so we're starting to
get<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.190> pretty<00:05:04.430> good<00:05:04.520> fire<00:05:04.940> on<00:05:05.360> back<00:05:05.660> in<00:05:05.930> there

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
get a pretty good fire on back in there

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.560 
get a pretty good fire on back in there
I<00:05:06.380> hope<00:05:06.950> you<00:05:07.130> could<00:05:07.280> see<00:05:07.669> that<00:05:07.910> I'm<00:05:08.180> not<00:05:08.390> going

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
I hope you could see that I'm not going

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.780 
I hope you could see that I'm not going
to<00:05:08.630> leave<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:08.990> open<00:05:09.080> for<00:05:09.910> very<00:05:10.910> long<00:05:12.130> but<00:05:13.130> we're

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
to leave it open for very long but we're

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.060 
to leave it open for very long but we're
recovering<00:05:14.540> now<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.140> house<00:05:15.500> is<00:05:15.800> still

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
recovering now the house is still

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.969 
recovering now the house is still
calling<00:05:16.430> for<00:05:16.580> Heat<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.720> boiler<00:05:18.370> is<00:05:20.979> running

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
calling for Heat the boiler is running

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.370 
calling for Heat the boiler is running
at<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:23.150> tail<00:05:23.479> end<00:05:23.510> of<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.110> cycle<00:05:24.610> with<00:05:25.610> wood

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
at the tail end of the cycle with wood

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.580 
at the tail end of the cycle with wood
that<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:27.410> just<00:05:27.979> stirred<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.640> coals<00:05:28.940> up<00:05:29.360> so<00:05:30.200> from

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
that I just stirred the coals up so from

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.480 
that I just stirred the coals up so from
this<00:05:30.890> point<00:05:31.340> forward<00:05:31.930> this<00:05:32.930> fire<00:05:33.410> is<00:05:34.010> going<00:05:34.400> to

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
this point forward this fire is going to

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.659 
this point forward this fire is going to
burn<00:05:34.729> hot<00:05:35.200> because<00:05:36.200> most<00:05:36.650> of<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.070> moisture

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
burn hot because most of the moisture

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.840 
burn hot because most of the moisture
that<00:05:37.729> was<00:05:38.150> in<00:05:38.450> any<00:05:38.810> of<00:05:39.080> that<00:05:39.290> wood<00:05:39.650> has<00:05:40.370> burned

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
that was in any of that wood has burned

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.270 
that was in any of that wood has burned
out<00:05:41.150> that's<00:05:41.540> why<00:05:41.780> we<00:05:42.020> had<00:05:42.229> that<00:05:42.470> build<00:05:42.860> up<00:05:43.070> in

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
out that's why we had that build up in

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.460 
out that's why we had that build up in
there<00:05:43.640> now<00:05:44.390> it's<00:05:45.169> gonna<00:05:45.500> burn<00:05:45.950> and<00:05:47.140> the<00:05:48.140> fire

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
there now it's gonna burn and the fire

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.550 
there now it's gonna burn and the fire
will<00:05:48.830> be<00:05:49.040> burning<00:05:49.760> so<00:05:50.030> hot<00:05:50.330> it'll<00:05:51.020> burn<00:05:51.530> the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
will be burning so hot it'll burn the

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.450 
will be burning so hot it'll burn the
