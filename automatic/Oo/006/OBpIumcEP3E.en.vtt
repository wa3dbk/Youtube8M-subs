00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
up there is it a little panicky feeling

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.319 
up there is it a little panicky feeling
or<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.320> does<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.860> feel<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.329> it's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
or what does it feel like it's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.880 
or what does it feel like it's
definitely<00:01:36.600> intense<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.290> justify<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> most

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
definitely intense I justify the most

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.499 
definitely intense I justify the most
intense<00:01:38.189> race<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.820> everybody<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.299> close

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
intense race because everybody so close

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.590 
intense race because everybody so close
the<00:01:39.780> traction<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.439> high<00:01:41.150> tight<00:01:42.150> track<00:01:42.450> is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the traction is so high tight track is

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.289 
the traction is so high tight track is
so<00:01:42.720> tight<00:01:43.189> competition<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.579> close<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.060> just

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
so tight competition so close it's just

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.270 
so tight competition so close it's just
it's<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.229> I've<00:01:46.350> getting<00:01:46.649> tens<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.159> than<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
it's like I've getting tens more than I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.760 
it's like I've getting tens more than I
used<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.820> you're<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.180> nun<00:01:48.329> normal<00:01:48.770> but

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
used to like you're a nun normal but

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.740 
used to like you're a nun normal but
it's<00:01:49.979> probably<00:01:50.610> most<00:01:50.850> intense<00:01:51.149> race<00:01:51.360> that

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it's probably most intense race that

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.359 
it's probably most intense race that
I've<00:01:51.899> been<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.799> speed

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
approximately where you're going to be

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.559 
approximately where you're going to be
you<00:02:31.040> can<00:02:31.190> probably<00:02:31.340> improve<00:02:31.580> by<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> position

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
you can probably improve by a position

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.600 
you can probably improve by a position
or<00:02:32.870> two<00:02:33.050> or<00:02:33.290> are<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.250> try<00:02:34.430> anything

or two or are you to try anything
different<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.959> don't<00:02:36.380> know<00:02:36.440> what<00:02:36.590> tires<00:02:36.800> are

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
different I don't know what tires are

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.140 
different I don't know what tires are
gonna<00:02:37.010> run<00:02:37.160> yet<00:02:37.340> we're<00:02:37.519> trying<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.790> see<00:02:38.030> what

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
gonna run yet we're trying to see what

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.120 
gonna run yet we're trying to see what
attract<00:02:38.420> as<00:02:38.600> they<00:02:38.780> didn't<00:02:38.989> get<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.200> water<00:02:39.380> last

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
attract as they didn't get to water last

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.920 
attract as they didn't get to water last
night<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.550> it's<00:02:40.700> kind<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.940> breaking<00:02:41.660> up<00:02:41.750> get

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
night so it's kind of breaking up get

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.840 
night so it's kind of breaking up get
maybe<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.170> little<00:02:42.260> more<00:02:42.410> edgy<00:02:42.709> so<00:02:42.980> I'll<00:02:43.700> see

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
maybe a little more edgy so I'll see

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.640 
maybe a little more edgy so I'll see
what<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.030> does<00:02:44.090> before<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.510> buggy<00:02:44.660> around<00:02:44.780> but

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
what it does before the buggy around but

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.140 
what it does before the buggy around but
truggy<00:02:45.920> probably<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.280> just<00:02:46.340> run<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.700> same<00:02:46.910> car

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
truggy probably is just run the same car

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.820 
truggy probably is just run the same car
that<00:02:47.180> was<00:02:47.480> before<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:48.049> keep<00:02:48.470> trying<00:02:48.650> to

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
that was before and just keep trying to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.090 
that was before and just keep trying to
get<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.640> good<00:02:50.080> qualifying<00:02:51.080> when<00:02:51.799> you're<00:02:51.950> here

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
get a good qualifying when you're here

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.949 
get a good qualifying when you're here

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.720 
versus the beginning and buggy it was a
little<00:03:03.440> bit<00:03:03.590> hairy<00:03:03.799> at<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.010> start<00:03:04.250> just<00:03:04.579> kind

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
little bit hairy at the start just kind

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.759 
little bit hairy at the start just kind
of<00:03:04.760> waiting<00:03:04.910> for<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.090> tourists<00:03:05.329> to<00:03:05.390> break<00:03:05.540> in

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
of waiting for the tourists to break in

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.870 
of waiting for the tourists to break in
but<00:03:06.769> then<00:03:06.920> through<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.250> main<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.519> was<00:03:07.640> really

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
but then through the main it was really

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.250 
but then through the main it was really
good<00:03:09.459> just<00:03:10.459> try<00:03:11.000> not<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.209> crash<00:03:11.450> too<00:03:11.660> much<00:03:11.810> but

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
good just try not to crash too much but

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.660 
good just try not to crash too much but
I<00:03:12.320> didn't<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.650> as<00:03:12.709> much<00:03:12.739> pressure<00:03:13.100> either<00:03:13.310> so

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
I didn't have as much pressure either so

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.830 
I didn't have as much pressure either so
it's<00:03:13.820> gonna<00:03:14.000> be<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.359> think<00:03:14.570> it's<00:03:14.660> gonna<00:03:14.750> be

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
it's gonna be I think it's gonna be

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.810 
it's gonna be I think it's gonna be
different<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.170> track<00:03:15.350> is<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.560> little<00:03:15.650> bit<00:03:15.920> more

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
different the track is a little bit more

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.240 
different the track is a little bit more
edgy<00:03:17.150> than<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.480> was<00:03:17.570> for<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.780> warmup<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.980> I

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
edgy than it was for the warmup so I

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.220 
edgy than it was for the warmup so I
think<00:03:19.400> it's<00:03:19.609> going<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.760> be<00:03:19.820> definitely<00:03:20.390> tough

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
think it's going to be definitely tough

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.180 
think it's going to be definitely tough
to<00:03:21.380> make<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.590> through<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.799> hour<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.130> the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
to make it through the hour and the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.640 
to make it through the hour and the
semis<00:03:22.880> well<00:03:23.750> it's<00:03:23.840> good<00:03:24.019> that's<00:03:24.470> high

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
semis well it's good that's high

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.979 
semis well it's good that's high
