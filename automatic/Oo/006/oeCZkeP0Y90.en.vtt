00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 welcome to a connect tutorial 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.270
 dotcom tutorials my name is 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.940
 ildefonso secure in a previous tutorial 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.650
 of cinema 4d we saw how to make an intro 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.870
 original in which we used the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.700
 code that you are seeing in the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.859
 screen is a code that contains 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.520
 unique information such as the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.680
 url of our website today we are going to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.140
 make a 4d cinema tutorial where 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.359
 we will complete the intro with the text 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.550
 just flying over that code qr 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.170
 As you can see on the right, you can 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.360
 also use this technique to 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.430
 build the intro of universal pictures 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.200
 Stay with me to whom I connect 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.649
 tutorials and we learn a little bit of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.649
 cinema 4d 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.000
 Welcome to connect tutorials 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.030
 your community to users officer 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.030
 time 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.300
 about what we have we are going to incorporate 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.070
 a text like graph object text we're going to 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.769
 change what comes by default to 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.989
 connect tutorials we move the text 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.130
 to the left tool 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.590
 dimensional we make more tiny there 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.590
 rotate tool rotate on this axis 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.470
 to put the text like that and we bring the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.630
 text more towards the camera how are we going 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.140
 here to the y axis and we put you for example 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.450
 100 or 120 as you want we are going to move the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.490
 text again there and with control 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.289
 pressed we drag the text towards 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.560
 below to create a copy and instead of 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.420
 connect tutorials we put dot com 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.399
 we do this to consider two 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.070
 types of materials in the word this 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.039
 it's a little to your decision more or 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.380
 least we already had everything positioned there 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.830
 we are going to assign a material 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.899
 to the first text and to the other text another 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 different material you can change the 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.100
 type of source or type of material a 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.320
 little to your liking now let's create 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.840
 a null object 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.170
 and we will make children the two objects 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.540
 connect tutorials and dotcom from 1 there 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.370
 we have it grouped within the null to 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.740
 below I will select from a 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.810
 trainer that is called wrapper that is 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.140
 the effect that we are looking for in the text 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.420
 let's put the wrapping effect there 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.730
 inside to affect the two objects 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.530
 text if we have that for now 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.590
 get the curve we seek us 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.530
 we go to the y axis and rotate minus 90 degrees 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.989
 intro and now you will see it better by removing 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.820
 the view of the camera this is the camera 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.220
 from the editor we selected the null for 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.930
 move it all up and you see that already 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.330
 is appearing to the effect that 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.190
 we were looking for there we have that curvature 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.050
 we position ourselves in the envelope and we 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.300
 we change the attributes that you have here 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.000
 below for example the radio we are going to 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.400
 put 600 because that you have to go 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.280
 testing you go from frame 0 where 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.769
 the whole structure of the qr code appears 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.440
 and we select the null to go up all 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.930
 up and you see that 600 is the radius 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.210
 suitable to build the road that goes 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.040
 to carry the text from left to right 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.680
 surpassing all the training of 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.290
 qr code placed me in the wrapper for 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.950
 give movement to the text zero frame 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.500
 and here I have the final length in 360 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.910
 but I'm going to change it to 180 disappears the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.950
 text if I move it up and towards 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.170
 down you are already seeing a little bit the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.050
 movement that will have the text in the 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.150
 frame 0 fixed 180 degrees and I do 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.460
 control click control click on both 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.750
 spheres to fix keyframe me 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.080
 I'm going to move forward to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.020
 frame 160 and there I want a movement 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.290
 of the text for it I remove the 180 in 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.140
 final length and I put 270 click control 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.160
 in the two spheres and fixed the frame 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.810
 key 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.260
 I move later the line of 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.780
 time and where to frame 320 here 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.870
 I'm going to change the variables of the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.420
 length in the end I'll put 360 degrees and 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.160
 in the initial I will also put 360 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.930
 degrees so you have the text now 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.380
 disappear but on the right you see 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.910
 have disappeared we move the length 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.950
 initial and you see that there is the text is 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.540
 collects to finally disappear 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.819
 click control 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.890
 and you're here to fix the last 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.349
 keyframe we move to the 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.359
 zero frame to play the 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.579
 animation we move to the one who does 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.310
 right and we see that the text is to the 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.680
 left to right let's go over or 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.270
 less already drawing the circumference 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.940
 whose radio we had defined at 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.789
 principle when we have the text there 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.740
 we are going to position ourselves in the null object 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.259
 to move the text to our 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.150
 convenience there is in the null we move 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.560
 to just put the text in the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.240
 angle of view of the sun camera 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.490
 green that you see there is the camera we are going to 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.470
 see the camera view and take advantage now 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.960
 for example in the text object for 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.060
 give a cover and sing for example here 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.349
 you have a cap and I do not know what can be 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.500
 if you want steps 2 radio 2 and the kind of 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:59.530
 song let's go for example to engraving for 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.880
 make that cleft effect up here 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.500
 we have achieved the effect of 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.699
 circular path of the text that 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.110
 we were looking for 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.000
 now let's position the text 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.039
 correctly for example in this 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.780
 frame we want the text to appear 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.970
 in the scene with which we go to the 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.889
 wrapping we selected in the line of 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.499
 all time 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.810
 keyframes and we move them towards the 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:21.449
 right to get the text 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.490
 go back there there we would have it 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.289
 If I place myself in another frame, I see that 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.620
 the text is misplaced I put myself in 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.120
 the null and I move it to the view that a 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.969
 I'm interested in what this is for example 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.919
 I put myself in another frame for example and 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.889
 I see that I stay very down then I take 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.449
 the null and I add it up and I'm going 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.879
 playing with the position of the text up 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.490
 that suits me or interests me for example 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:46.169
 I could leave it there I think the 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.300
 animation would be pretty good 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.219
 synchronized the appearance of the qr code 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.289
 end with the total disappearance of 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.199
 text if you want to do a delay 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.150
 previous to see how this technique is 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.560
 It can be applied to all kinds of 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.539
 interest like for example the law 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.029
 universal pictures I tried to make a 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.370
 draft where I used this from 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:07.409
 wrapper educator to get the 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.050
 text go around what is the sphere 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.029
 from the earth up here this video 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.159
 tutorial that I hope you are functional 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:17.400
 and you can show me our results 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:22.040
 on facebook connect tutorials 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.040
 my own forever a hug
