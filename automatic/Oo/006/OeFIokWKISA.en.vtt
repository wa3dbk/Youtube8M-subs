00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello everyone, I have bloomed here 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.400
 beautiful red lily I am very long 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.950
 waited until she starts to bloom and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.160
 it inspired me to take off 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.590
 so they are briefly, I hope 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.590
 informative video so first want 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.980
 tell you about how it should be 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.640
 planted in pots line here is I have here 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.189
 bulbs main line to her you bulbs in 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.030
 three years ago she missed 2 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.550
 babes this here this year before that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.500
 I let you sit down so look 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.690
 between the bulbs and the pot when you 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.360
 you will not take much big pot 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.450
 should be about the distance somewhere 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.600
 two fingers between the bulbs and the walls 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.579
 a pot why not take a big pot 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
 because if you take a big pot 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 your line will fatten grow 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.609
 tuber will be leaves over green juicy 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.339
 but not the fact that you have it will bring 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.470
 delight you with flowers one more 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.880
 important fact as you can see 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.590
 is mine on earth just 1 4 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.500
 its main part is on 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.860
 the surface above the ground usually sits down 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.710
 so here as it grows if 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 reduced distance less than that of the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.850
 2 finger centimeter 5-6 it is from the closet from 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.049
 stenochku. it must be transplanted of course 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:38.270
 even when lily Ali is not pruned for the winter 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.970
 give them a rest supplies here so 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.509
 cut off the bag to put them dark 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.259
 place of the month of February on the flock 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.380
 sesna periodically watered not poured 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.600
 rarely do i have a dormant state 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.460
 are located 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.979
 Will I go to the window she lets leaves 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.810
 and here are such beautiful flowers 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.689
 still can if you live in private 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.869
 sector in the spring can I completely 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.260
 dig up and land in the ground 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.040
 open to warm naturally to us 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:21.049
 same joy not to please you if 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:25.310
 suddenly she doesnâ€™t want you to reduce it 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:29.930
 fertilize fertilizer contributing 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.900
 flowering plants can also be in September 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.329
 month somewhere dig up a bulb and give 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.370
 completely without land and the article is able 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:42.099
 rest then re-plant give 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:46.700
 relax or love southern windows 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:50.170
 so they grow more there more 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.049
 bloom them these conditions more like and 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.629

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.690
