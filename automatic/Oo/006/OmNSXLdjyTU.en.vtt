brush and I'm going to wrap the hair

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.150

around why it's still hot and hold it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.420 
around why it's still hot and hold it
now<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.150> could<00:03:08.540> use<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.230> flexi<00:03:09.829> rods<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.370> I

won't be so you know tight I like to do
it<00:03:20.989> this<00:03:21.170> way<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:22.340> I'll<00:03:22.430> hold<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:23.030> few<00:03:23.890> kind

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
it this way so I'll hold it a few kind

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.229 
it this way so I'll hold it a few kind
of<00:03:24.950> way<00:03:25.160> they<00:03:25.400> let<00:03:25.579> it<00:03:25.730> get<00:03:25.880> um<00:03:27.130> cool<00:03:28.130> so<00:03:29.120> hold

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
of way they let it get um cool so hold

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.840 
of way they let it get um cool so hold
the<00:03:29.390> curl<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:30.320> I'm<00:03:30.650> trying<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:30.980> get<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.190> lesser

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
the curl and I'm trying to get a lesser

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.229 
the curl and I'm trying to get a lesser
wavy<00:03:32.660> curls<00:03:33.079> so<00:03:33.320> I'm<00:03:33.440> not<00:03:33.820> trying<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:34.910> hold<00:03:35.120> it

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
wavy curls so I'm not trying to hold it

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.810 
wavy curls so I'm not trying to hold it
for<00:03:35.299> too<00:03:35.570> long<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.310> then<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:37.609> kind<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:39.820> let

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
for too long and then I kind of like let

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.280 
for too long and then I kind of like let
it<00:03:40.850> go<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.359> curl<00:03:44.600> pattern<00:03:45.140> that

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
it go and this is the curl pattern that

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.550 
it go and this is the curl pattern that
I<00:03:45.440> got<00:03:46.810> really<00:03:47.810> nice<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.440> loose

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.430 

and<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.550> could<00:03:52.760> think<00:03:52.940> it's<00:03:53.090> doing<00:03:53.569> that<00:03:53.599> on<00:03:54.110> the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
and I could think it's doing that on the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:03.040 
and I could think it's doing that on the
bottom<00:03:54.650> half<00:03:55.130> of<00:03:55.670> my<00:03:56.390> hair

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.400 

make<00:04:04.050> sure<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.410> comb<00:04:04.710> it<00:04:04.740> out<00:04:05.900> close<00:04:06.900> my<00:04:07.170> any

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
make sure you comb it out close my any

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.110 
make sure you comb it out close my any
tangles<00:04:08.660> take<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.840> curl<00:04:10.140> one<00:04:10.760> wrap<00:04:11.760> it<00:04:11.970> around

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
tangles take the curl one wrap it around

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.850 
tangles take the curl one wrap it around
twice<00:04:12.660> your<00:04:13.020> face<00:04:15.200> hold<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.470> for<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.799> few

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
twice your face hold it for a few

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:30.310 
twice your face hold it for a few
seconds

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.310 

let<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.460> go<00:04:32.500> get<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.710> brush<00:04:34.900> wrap<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.050> hair

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
let it go get the brush wrap the hair

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:54.970 
let it go get the brush wrap the hair
around<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.890> brush<00:04:39.970> old<00:04:40.970> fan

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.580 

and<00:04:55.400> let<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.060> go<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.950> you<00:04:58.370> get<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:59.380> really<00:05:00.380> nice

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
and let it go and you get a really nice

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.280 
and let it go and you get a really nice
loose<00:05:01.430> curl<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:02.360> that's<00:05:02.840> what<00:05:03.020> I'm<00:05:03.140> going<00:05:03.380> for

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
loose curl and that's what I'm going for

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.390 
loose curl and that's what I'm going for
so<00:05:06.290> yeah<00:05:06.560> that's<00:05:06.770> pretty<00:05:06.890> much<00:05:07.160> what<00:05:07.580> I<00:05:07.610> do<00:05:09.400> ok

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
so yeah that's pretty much what I do ok

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.820 
so yeah that's pretty much what I do ok
so<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.700> am<00:05:11.030> at<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.450> top<00:05:11.690> now<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.380> basically

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
so I am at the top now and basically

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.390 
so I am at the top now and basically
what<00:05:13.340> i<00:05:13.370> do<00:05:13.520> i<00:05:14.030> did<00:05:14.330> this<00:05:14.540> one<00:05:14.750> already<00:05:15.400> so

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
what i do i did this one already so

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.030 
what i do i did this one already so
basically<00:05:17.090> what<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:20.440> make<00:05:21.440> sure<00:05:21.650> I<00:05:21.680> get<00:05:21.980> all

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
basically what I to make sure I get all

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:31.780 
basically what I to make sure I get all
of<00:05:22.430> them<00:05:27.190> ok<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.430> just<00:05:28.910> take<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:30.310> little<00:05:31.310> bit<00:05:31.550> of<00:05:31.610> a

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
of them ok I just take a little bit of a

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.060 
of them ok I just take a little bit of a
smaller<00:05:32.150> section<00:05:32.660> at<00:05:33.170> the<00:05:33.230> top<00:05:33.350> because<00:05:33.800> i

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
smaller section at the top because i

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.830 
smaller section at the top because i
like<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.610> look<00:05:34.760> a<00:05:34.910> little<00:05:34.970> bit<00:05:35.180> fuller<00:05:35.540> up

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
like it to look a little bit fuller up

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.740 
like it to look a little bit fuller up
there<00:05:36.340> I'll<00:05:37.340> take<00:05:37.550> really<00:05:37.910> small<00:05:38.240> sections

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
there I'll take really small sections

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.450 
there I'll take really small sections
like<00:05:38.930> this<00:05:41.230> and<00:05:42.230> then<00:05:42.500> I<00:05:43.090> curl<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.270> hair<00:05:45.460> away

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
like this and then I curl the hair away

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:55.170 
like this and then I curl the hair away
from<00:05:46.850> the<00:05:47.420> on<00:05:47.570> face<00:05:49.420> so<00:05:50.420> this<00:05:51.170> is<00:05:51.200> how<00:05:51.440> I<00:05:51.650> do<00:05:51.770> it

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.390 

just<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.300> same<00:05:56.330> technique<00:05:57.230> as<00:05:57.470> I<00:05:57.920> use<00:05:58.130> at<00:05:58.370> the

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
just the same technique as I use at the

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.640 
just the same technique as I use at the
bottom<00:05:58.940> but<00:05:59.090> I<00:05:59.150> curl<00:05:59.600> it<00:05:59.750> away<00:06:00.020> from<00:06:00.320> the<00:06:00.440> face

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
bottom but I curl it away from the face

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:40.439 
bottom but I curl it away from the face
and<00:06:01.160> I<00:06:01.940> use<00:06:02.120> smaller<00:06:02.510> sections<00:06:04.270> ok

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:46.350 

go<00:06:41.080> and<00:06:41.590> that's<00:06:42.159> the<00:06:42.340> curl<00:06:44.520> take<00:06:45.520> smaller

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
go and that's the curl take smaller

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.410 
go and that's the curl take smaller
section

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:07:10.129 

curl<00:06:53.070> away<00:06:54.070> from<00:06:54.700> the<00:06:54.790> face

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:42.040 

goes

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:58.890 

and<00:07:42.289> this<00:07:42.979> is<00:07:43.250> the<00:07:43.430> curl<00:07:44.530> really<00:07:45.530> really<00:07:45.770> cute

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:58.900 

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.960 

you
