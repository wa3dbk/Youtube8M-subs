00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.240
 yes cool 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.380
 In the past year Husqvarna has the 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:20.140
 560 xp and the 562 xp on the market 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.090
 We brought the two professionals 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.960
 blessings in practice and on the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 test bench tested 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.400
 Externally, the two differ 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.380
 Blessing only slightly affects the 560 xp 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.860
 through the lower air filter cover 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.860
 smaller 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.600
 The air filter itself can be easily 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.490
 remove and clean it soiled in 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.490
 our test but only a little 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.830
 both blessings are with a manual one 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.750
 fuel pump for the cold start 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.250
 equipped the starting behavior at 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.250
 cold engine was good 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.920
 a decompression sven thiel reduced 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.920
 the effort when starting 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.090
 there is a small improvement at 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.400
 refuel 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.500
 the level in the fuel tank 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.490
 can now be through a view window 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.490
 recognize 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.670
 the two blessings are with the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.350
 Electronic carburetor regulation auction 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.110
 equipped the system compensated 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.790
 Dirty air filters as well as heights and 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.670
 weather differences 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.820
 a manual carburettor setting is 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.140
 no longer necessary the ixtoc 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.240
 Engine technology reduces the 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.960
 emissions according to the current 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.960
 emission guidelines 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.000
 the engine power convinced us 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.190
 both blessings worked very strong 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.830
 thanks to its central location narrow 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.170
 Construction and favorable power weight 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.170
 There were also good grades for the handling 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.030
 when relieving the red bulls 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.250
 technology for a short-term 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.970
 performance boost to increase the chains 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.970
 speed 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.470
 the start stop switch is now jumping 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.590
 after turning off the saw by itself 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.410
 The saw was back in the starting position 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.390
 first warm , she was partly only 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.530
 by pulling repeatedly at the state 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.530
 only to values 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.280
 the nuts on the chain are rat cover 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.949
 secured against loss 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.229
 the oil pump for the chain lubrication 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.830
 can be adjusted according to need 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.550
 that logic system absorbs vibrations 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.800
 and already so the hands of the operator 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:56.320
 Both blessings completed the test 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.320
 a 45 cm long rail 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.430
 a screw in the lid becomes the 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.430
 chain tense 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.650
 the detailed practical test of the two 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:36.390
 Power saws read in issue 23 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.390
