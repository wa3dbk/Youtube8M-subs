00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.310
 hi all served to find you 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.470
 for a euro debrief with fred weill 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.240
 second night fred frankly debrief a 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.830
 little sad tonight since the csp a little 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.900
 to everyone's surprise lost to the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.520
 red lantern boulogne was offering you and 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.510
 comment on the match on france bleu your 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.040
 first feeling hot 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.180
 first change for feelings 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.920
 it is above all that it is the first of 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.810
 claws I'm doing or a picture has lost 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.690
 so this is actually the hardest 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.010
 find positive things to say no 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.449
 it's especially that I think it's 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.250
 especially very bored during this match 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.059
 because not much has happened 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.430
 it's not exciting 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.640
 it was very hot so that it 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.050
 contribute to this hour there frankly 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.159
 it helps in all cases what the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.750
 spectators are a little apathetic 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.920
 also so they did not give 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.839
 maybe the breath needed to 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.089
 the team to play basketball best 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.170
 so not frankly at the level of the 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.699
 tax is not that bad because at 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.989
 level the ball circulation we see 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.360
 the white that circulates rather well 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.159
 we already see my smith which puts 21 points 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.510
 but mostly thanks to good passes of 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.310
 his teammates have found much good 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.700
 sought but it's funded standard in 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.409
 attack 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.370
 there is not much to them 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.130
 blame the frank attacks have 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.080
 apprehended French catastrophic 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.580
 because so I think so much of 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.130
 quarter years time we take 28 points to 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.180
 53 in the second half we say that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.170
 it's not it's not possible already 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.810
 we find and that the defense was 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.890
 average during May 1 while 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.820
 it's not possible to take as many 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.470
 points in a dance of a half time 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.700
 especially that the standards of philippe 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.200
 hervé his 75 points do they 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.910
 had announced it they wanted to know each other 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.990
 however what is 75 points then 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.180
 I agree boulogne-sur-mer and 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.380
 an eclipse or a little bit because 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.720
 that we expect that they deserve better than 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.100
 what they could show up 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.630
 now but from there to say he can 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.300
 score 88 points in limoges 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.250
 frankly that it shocks me a bit in 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.230
 break-in and cap his minds 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.580
 today and have animated the cap 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.900
 for sure they win and then I 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.550
 can I sleep more first try by 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.170
 worth 2 I will never again 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.700
 fresco is a paramedic who condemns and 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 one for the pro b what it is he plays 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.400
 released is that okay it's playing too its 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.110
 honestly life how do we say come 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.670
 three matches lately has very very 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.530
 quickly very very close to 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.909
 gravelines cholet then tonight so so 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.900
 we think that finally when they 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.370
 play released when they no longer have the 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.940
 pressure to be forced to win they 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.289
 are much better 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.119
 actually it frees up a weight 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.890
 necessarily they have nothing to gain or 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.209
 lose so it's easier to play 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.349
 basketball and from and to play well at 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.629
 basketball and in their team they have to 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.000
 brown stéphane who is untouchable who 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.980
 fly on the water assessment ayem 30 this 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 evening it's old warrior there who is 35 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.349
 years 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.640
 he sees the moment 10 that works but he 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.140
 is so strong that he's flying on the water 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.239
 the truth that it is untouchable what it is 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.560
 incredible yet he saw a good 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.640
 start of the match we will say first a 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.290
 first quarter first half time 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.569
 as the first quarter-time honestly 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.010
 for me not exceptional but correct 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.170
 or in French a little bit for blow and 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.550
 it is fighting tc it is 112,01 here is 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.050
 does the cases it's exactly and a 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.700
 period when csp arrives at completely 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.870
 blocked the attack game to bolt the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.790
 blonde is no longer a basket during 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.780
 almost five points five minutes and there 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.489
 that we say is they found the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.599
 automatisms in defense they are well in 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.019
 attack the ball goes well everything is going 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.150
 go well 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.500
 third quarter time in the water 13.25 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.299
 especially starting in a way 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.430
 catastrophic in takes basket over the 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.870
 fault and first action we say they 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.950
 have not come out super concentrated 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.080
 locker rooms you also see a rebound 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.310
 offensive we really thought that 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.810
 really we were completely in the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.160
 cabbage debut third quarter time 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.880
 a lot if eventually it can be more 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.000
 complicated xamarin can hide the forest 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.110
 exactly 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.030
 but that's what made a beautiful 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.890
 match go see her go but a lot 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.420
 more back on 10 believe so so we 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.440
 thinks that eventually he was gone on 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.989
 the same bases but unfortunately 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.519
 level of play and the players around 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.599
 gerard we do not know how to answer the same 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.549
 way and then there is this quarter 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.930
 time 28 15 provolone of the three points 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.519
 in every sense we get the impression that 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.650
 as against pau where the least is 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.480
 always a player who catches fire against 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.920
 this csp at the moment yes that's it 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.390
 a little bit of real three points that happened 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.190
 spent this weekend had to have a lot of three 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.930
 points and especially how they play 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.799
 small ball concert with that little 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.510
 donations continue one puts pressure 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.430
 of hell and finally it was the moment 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.780
 came to defend me the ball and wii 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.299
 take the most baskets so 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.400
 finally the solution of philippe hervé 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.630
 to work on that for now lé 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.859
 palace not completely in point there 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.569
 will have to keep it for other occasions 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.220
 or if a little worry the inside game 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.709
 yet nonexistent tonight there are two 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.100
 points dati camara stage then however 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.880
 a batista and 0 rebounds in 15 minutes 0 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.769
 rebounds in 15 minutes 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.989
 there we are we are clearly below 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.510
 destroyer pylons have farted 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.590
 Winehouse is like me I stole Frejus 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.850
 zerbo no bad parent when he is 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.530
 entered after he got hurt and so the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.440
 more back on his first entry is 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.760
 not bad after there a little bit less 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.320
 less bulging on the first and not bad 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.180
 who are the authors have not been 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.709
 necessarily very powerful in the wind a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.489
 been very awkward that's why we 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.019
 is actually fewer assists 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.670
 than usual and that our ratio 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.990
 positive or bac lost and less good too 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.120
 because we lost a lot of bullets 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.790
 in balloon sometimes from 2.2 against changed 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.130
 so we had seen the csp the saurai 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.260
 cabourg and three days the stunt 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.250
 that's due to what it's a rate clearly 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.840
 it's inexplicable 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.910
 and precisely it is difficult to locate the csp 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.620
 are they the team that has been 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.750
 moved to wood that is able to 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.430
 exceed 32 to a team that was not 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.260
 still relegated and who was playing 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.100
 to life and death or is that it's 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.900
 this team that plays against 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.550
 boulogne-sur-mer who plays well in 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.900
 attack but who finally for 88 what 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.910
 it's worrying we were f 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.070
 no i think philippe hervé koné 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.530
 way where he sees the Vanille Islands vexed 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.790
 follow him to the maximum after us from 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.230
 outside it can worry us a little 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.940
 gold precisely the play offs and soon he 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.740
 ya last game in nancy maybe a 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.180
 next opponent by the way nancy bat 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.830
 according to the few adjustments in 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.030
 texting train with suchu karim who 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.380
 play to Nancy and who bet 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.610
 ecologically if everything went well 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.620
 he should deliver against nancy 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.780
 would have a preference you by coloring 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.770
 a preference for the holy land for 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.060
 pray an opponent with me I 'm going 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.190
 to do and nancy necessarily rain or that 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.300
 happens I know my best friends and 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.740
 it is in Lorraine so I necessarily 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.030
 prefers fell against them and in addition 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.470
 I think it's the team that are worth 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.750
 less often who in the situation 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.430
 little more complicated than firman 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.230
 villeurbanne has a very offensive team 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.669
 and it does not match us well the proof 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.050
 we take a lot of points so I'll 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.760
 say that in six might be the 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.080
 body is the best draw of 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.030
 general rehearsal on Saturday then 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.990
 for the last of the nba season but 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.919
 it's super complicated at the same time 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.660
 because what makes you re 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.220
 must give it all and show all 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.000
 his weapons directly or play on a 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.450
 psychological warfare 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.130
 tintin and lens is seen that anyway 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.030
