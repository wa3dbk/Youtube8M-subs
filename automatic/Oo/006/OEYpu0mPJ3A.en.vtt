frustration and less money in my pocket
at<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.590> end<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> day<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:39.090> after<00:01:39.450> multiple

I was about ready to throw in the towel

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.490 
I was about ready to throw in the towel
until<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.850> decided<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.540> try<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:46.049> last<00:01:46.259> thing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
until I decided to try one last thing

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
until I decided to try one last thing
and<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> internet<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and that was to get on the internet and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.749 
and that was to get on the internet and
search<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.200> more<00:01:49.409> solution<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.670> was

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
search for one more solution and it was

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.490 
search for one more solution and it was
in<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.000> search<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:52.079> came

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
in that search that I actually came

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.679 
in that search that I actually came
across<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.860> system<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.880> ended<00:01:54.180> up<00:01:54.270> being<00:01:54.570> the

lifeblood of any business they're
absolutely<00:02:43.469> necessary<00:02:43.799> in<00:02:44.370> order<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.670> create

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
absolutely necessary in order to create

a consistent income from that business
but<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.510> best<00:02:48.720> part<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.349> that<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:49.680> system

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
but the best part is is that this system

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.920 
but the best part is is that this system
didn't<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.639> teach<00:02:50.879> us<00:02:51.090> how<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.269> generate<00:02:51.659> any

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
didn't just teach us how to generate any

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.569 
didn't just teach us how to generate any
old<00:02:52.200> generic<00:02:52.620> leads<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:53.129> taught<00:02:53.340> us<00:02:53.430> how<00:02:53.459> to

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
old generic leads it taught us how to

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.420 
old generic leads it taught us how to
generate<00:02:54.000> laser<00:02:54.629> targeted<00:02:55.470> leads<00:02:55.680> which<00:02:56.280> were

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430
