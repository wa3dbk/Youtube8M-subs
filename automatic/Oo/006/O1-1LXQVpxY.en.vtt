00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.060
 we are the best of santa faith and that we show you in the 1989 classic 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.830
 we won by the goal of madelón that was triumph tatengue by 1 to 0 and 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.419
 we broke the ass 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.529

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.949
 we broke the pipe twice for a change colon 4 union 0 colom 6 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.249
 union 0 among others 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.620

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.449
 0 and not let you ascend and now we beat them the classic 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.430
 I'll explain you tatengue idiot 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.670
 the party bought it because if they lost union they lost more than half 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.400
 of the partners as very cold chest they are they would stop going to the court to pay 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.370
 the fee and the club would go bankrupt 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.600
 bava what you say are pavadas 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.940
 we all know that union of holy faith 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.610
 then because the majority of Argentina said that colon beat him 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.070
 union in the classic 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.520
 because said from the same mouth years ago said that colon was santa fe 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.260
 hahaha now you guide by those porteños 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.530
 I'm not getting involved in Buenos Aires, I'm saying that the majority 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.060
 before the classic the great majority of Argentina thought about the triumph of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 colon in the classic 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.620
 why do not you talk about history 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.310

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.490
 I tell you some things about colon and union 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.490
