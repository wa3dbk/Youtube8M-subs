thingy so you're going to start by

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.660 
thingy so you're going to start by
drawing<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.300> dot<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.470> middle<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.949> your

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
drawing one dot in the middle of your

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.890 
drawing one dot in the middle of your
canvas<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:28.910> remember<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.060> choose<00:00:30.539> your

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
canvas and remember to choose your

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.749 
canvas and remember to choose your
pattern<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.500> which<00:00:31.740> colors<00:00:32.279> you're<00:00:32.579> going<00:00:32.669> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
pattern and which colors you're going to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.139 
pattern and which colors you're going to
use<00:00:33.149> before<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.110> start<00:00:34.680> drawing<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.969> way

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
use before you start drawing that way

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.410 
use before you start drawing that way
it's<00:00:36.390> easier<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.760> it's<00:00:38.760> easier<00:00:39.300> to

it's easier for you and it's easier to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.160 
it's easier for you and it's easier to
keep<00:00:39.629> everything<00:00:40.020> organized<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.219> meat<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:43.020> as

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170

orange circles all around it I'm going
to<00:00:52.199> continue<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.770> do<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.610> pattern

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to continue to do that in my pattern

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
so now as you can see I have finished my

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.870 
so now as you can see I have finished my
very<00:01:39.600> first<00:01:39.899> circle<00:01:40.319> and<00:01:40.499> I<00:01:40.590> went<00:01:40.829> ahead<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
very first circle and I went ahead and I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.459 
very first circle and I went ahead and I
did<00:01:41.939> part<00:01:42.569> of<00:01:42.689> another<00:01:42.960> circle<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.859> corner

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
did part of another circle in the corner

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.130 
did part of another circle in the corner
some<00:01:46.469> tips<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.039> have<00:01:47.399> are<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.149> use<00:01:48.270> larger

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
some tips I have are to use larger

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.240 
some tips I have are to use larger
circles<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.969> have<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
circles then I have the one in the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
circles then I have the one in the
corner<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.299> circles<00:01:54.810> were<00:01:55.200> okay<00:01:56.039> um<00:01:57.229> but<00:01:58.229> if

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
corner the circles were okay um but if

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.240 
corner the circles were okay um but if
you<00:01:58.649> want<00:01:59.039> all<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.179> colors<00:02:00.569> to<00:02:00.869> show<00:02:01.109> up<00:02:01.319> not

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you want all the colors to show up not

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.080 
you want all the colors to show up not
just<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.849> bright<00:02:03.119> ones<00:02:03.420> um<00:02:04.219> you<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
just the bright ones um you are going to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.930 
just the bright ones um you are going to
want<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> use<00:02:06.569> larger<00:02:07.049> circles<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.859> found<00:02:08.729> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
want to use larger circles I found that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.839 
want to use larger circles I found that
the<00:02:09.090> brighter<00:02:09.360> colors<00:02:09.929> are<00:02:10.229> pinks<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.220> blues

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the brighter colors are pinks and blues

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.369 
the brighter colors are pinks and blues
and<00:02:12.799> if<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:14.370> orange<00:02:14.760> circle<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.390> larger<00:02:15.629> it

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
and if the orange circle is larger it

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.920 
and if the orange circle is larger it
can<00:02:16.650> also<00:02:16.829> be<00:02:17.160> pretty<00:02:17.400> bright<00:02:17.849> but<00:02:18.450> if<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.720> use

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
can also be pretty bright but if you use

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.710 
can also be pretty bright but if you use
small<00:02:19.290> circles<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.910> mainly<00:02:21.299> going<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.660> be

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
small circles it's mainly going to be

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.830 
small circles it's mainly going to be
pink<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.290> blue<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.799> show<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:23.329> after<00:02:24.329> you<00:02:24.540> put

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
pink and blue that show up after you put

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.039 
pink and blue that show up after you put
the<00:02:25.230> alcohol<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.480> you're<00:02:27.480> using<00:02:27.510> other

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
the alcohol on if you're using other

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.949 
the alcohol on if you're using other
colors<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:29.310> same<00:02:29.579> rules<00:02:29.910> will<00:02:30.299> probably

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
colors the same rules will probably

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.099 
colors the same rules will probably
apply<00:02:31.319> um<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:32.730> would<00:02:33.390> guess<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.629> it's<00:02:33.959> going

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
apply um I would guess that it's going

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.160 
apply um I would guess that it's going
to<00:02:34.170> be<00:02:34.349> reds<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.489> blues<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.810> are<00:02:36.989> going<00:02:37.109> to

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
to be reds and blues that are going to

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.849 
to be reds and blues that are going to
show<00:02:37.410> up<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.769> most<00:02:38.040> um<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:39.390> did<00:02:40.109> use<00:02:40.500> neon

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
show up the most um I did use neon

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.970 
show up the most um I did use neon
markers<00:02:41.489> just<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.269> guys<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.950> except<00:02:43.950> for

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
markers just so you guys know except for

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.319 
markers just so you guys know except for
the<00:02:44.190> green<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.349> don't<00:02:46.980> know<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:48.030> may

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
the green so I don't know if that may

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.430 
the green so I don't know if that may
have<00:02:48.420> made<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.599> difference<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.670> did<00:02:50.940> I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
have made a difference but if it did I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.319 
have made a difference but if it did I
love<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.470> way<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.829> turned<00:02:53.099> out<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.549> I<00:02:54.030> highly

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
love the way it turned out and I highly

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:03.120 
love the way it turned out and I highly
recommend<00:02:54.510> it
