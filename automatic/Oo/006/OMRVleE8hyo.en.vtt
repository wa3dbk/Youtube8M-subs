characters and their values but if you

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.650 
characters and their values but if you
don't<00:05:22.290> know<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.680> value<00:05:22.830> for<00:05:23.070> sure<00:05:23.510> just<00:05:24.510> go

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
don't know the value for sure just go

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.040 
don't know the value for sure just go
ahead<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.350> leave<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.520> last<00:05:26.850> slot<00:05:27.270> in<00:05:27.630> the

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
ahead and leave the last slot in the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.650 
ahead and leave the last slot in the
preset<00:05:28.470> team<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:29.550> character<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.120> want<00:05:30.450> the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
preset team the character you want the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.420 
preset team the character you want the
entire<00:05:30.930> team<00:05:31.229> to<00:05:31.410> be<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.800> then<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.160> can<00:05:32.310> just

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
entire team to be and then you can just

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.850 
entire team to be and then you can just
look<00:05:32.640> for<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:32.850> variable<00:05:33.510> so<00:05:34.470> we<00:05:34.620> go<00:05:34.770> ahead

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
look for that variable so we go ahead

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.100 
look for that variable so we go ahead
and<00:05:35.010> we<00:05:35.220> save<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.880> we<00:05:36.300> exit<00:05:36.840> out<00:05:36.900> of<00:05:36.960> that

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
and we save that we exit out of that

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.409 
and we save that we exit out of that
would<00:05:37.380> go<00:05:37.410> back<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:38.010> brute<00:05:38.250> force<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.910> now<00:05:39.360> we

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
would go back to brute force and now we

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.969 
would go back to brute force and now we
have<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.810> undo<00:05:40.229> what<00:05:40.440> we<00:05:40.560> previously<00:05:40.919> did<00:05:41.430> by

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
have to undo what we previously did by

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.620 
have to undo what we previously did by
encrypting<00:05:43.979> so<00:05:44.340> we're<00:05:44.490> gonna<00:05:44.610> select<00:05:44.880> encrypt

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
encrypting so we're gonna select encrypt

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.710 
encrypting so we're gonna select encrypt
PFD<00:05:46.470> but<00:05:47.160> before<00:05:47.610> we<00:05:47.760> do<00:05:47.940> that<00:05:47.970> we<00:05:48.419> got<00:05:48.570> to

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
PFD but before we do that we got to

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.150 
PFD but before we do that we got to
apply<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.140> cheat<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:50.580> that<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:51.030> brute<00:05:51.720> force

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
apply a cheat so that the brute force

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.490 
apply a cheat so that the brute force
program<00:05:53.330> rehashes<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.510> save<00:05:54.780> data<00:05:55.020> so<00:05:55.350> that

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
program rehashes the save data so that

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.380 
program rehashes the save data so that
the<00:05:55.620> PlayStation<00:05:55.860> 3<00:05:56.490> can<00:05:56.700> recognize<00:05:57.210> that

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
the PlayStation 3 can recognize that

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.630 
the PlayStation 3 can recognize that
this<00:05:57.510> is<00:05:57.570> very<00:05:57.930> important<00:05:58.530> if<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:59.160> don't<00:05:59.340> do

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
this is very important if you don't do

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.240 
this is very important if you don't do
this<00:05:59.880> when<00:06:00.330> you<00:06:00.450> plug<00:06:00.690> your<00:06:00.720> USB<00:06:01.169> back<00:06:01.950> into

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
this when you plug your USB back into

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.880 
this when you plug your USB back into
your<00:06:02.370> ps3<00:06:02.700> is<00:06:03.240> gonna<00:06:03.870> say<00:06:04.200> that<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.620> file<00:06:04.860> is

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
your ps3 is gonna say that the file is

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.320 
your ps3 is gonna say that the file is
corrupt<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.580> you're<00:06:05.729> going<00:06:05.880> to<00:06:05.940> have<00:06:06.090> to<00:06:06.210> go

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
corrupt and you're going to have to go

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.710 
corrupt and you're going to have to go
back<00:06:06.570> and<00:06:06.750> do<00:06:06.870> this<00:06:07.050> so<00:06:07.919> apply<00:06:08.460> cheat<00:06:08.880> update

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
back and do this so apply cheat update

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.800 
back and do this so apply cheat update
and<00:06:09.960> then<00:06:10.710> incur

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
and then incur

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.200 
and then incur
PFD<00:06:12.350> from<00:06:13.010> there<00:06:13.220> you<00:06:13.400> can<00:06:13.550> pretty<00:06:13.700> much<00:06:13.790> close

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
PFD from there you can pretty much close

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.490 
PFD from there you can pretty much close
it<00:06:14.450> and<00:06:14.630> we're<00:06:14.810> going<00:06:14.930> to<00:06:14.960> head<00:06:15.139> right<00:06:15.290> back

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
it and we're going to head right back

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.870 
it and we're going to head right back
over<00:06:15.680> to<00:06:15.950> the<00:06:16.040> ps3<00:06:20.200> and<00:06:21.340> then<00:06:22.340> we're<00:06:22.730> gonna

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
over to the ps3 and then we're gonna

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.970 
over to the ps3 and then we're gonna
copy<00:06:23.950> so<00:06:24.950> we<00:06:25.070> access<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.730> file<00:06:26.000> copy<00:06:26.980> it's

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
copy so we access the file copy it's

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.740 
copy so we access the file copy it's
gonna<00:06:28.100> ask<00:06:28.370> if<00:06:28.669> you<00:06:28.760> want<00:06:28.970> to<00:06:29.060> overwrite<00:06:29.510> and

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
gonna ask if you want to overwrite and

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.430 
gonna ask if you want to overwrite and
you're<00:06:29.870> gonna<00:06:30.020> say<00:06:30.260> yes

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.560 

but<00:06:35.070> you<00:06:35.190> do<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:35.820> copy'<00:06:36.060> is<00:06:36.300> going<00:06:36.510> to

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
but you do that the copy' is going to

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:44.280 
but you do that the copy' is going to
take<00:06:36.780> place

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.160 

and<00:06:44.710> it's<00:06:45.250> time<00:06:45.460> to<00:06:45.490> see<00:06:46.480> the<00:06:46.510> fruits<00:06:46.870> of<00:06:47.020> our

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
and it's time to see the fruits of our

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.260 
and it's time to see the fruits of our
labor<00:06:47.370> so<00:06:48.370> we're<00:06:48.490> gonna<00:06:48.580> go<00:06:48.790> ahead<00:06:49.030> and<00:06:49.180> get

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
labor so we're gonna go ahead and get

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.270 
labor so we're gonna go ahead and get
back<00:06:49.480> into<00:06:49.720> the<00:06:49.930> game<00:06:50.140> to<00:06:50.500> check<00:06:50.830> out<00:06:51.040> our

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
back into the game to check out our

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.000 
back into the game to check out our
newly<00:06:51.640> modded<00:06:52.570> license<00:06:53.230> card<00:06:53.500> and<00:06:53.830> our
