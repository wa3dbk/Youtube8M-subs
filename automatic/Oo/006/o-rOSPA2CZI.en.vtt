wonderful<00:02:23.660> I'm<00:02:24.230> thinking<00:02:24.709> it's<00:02:24.860> probably<00:02:27.940> 12

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
wonderful I'm thinking it's probably 12

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.850 
wonderful I'm thinking it's probably 12
to<00:02:29.090> 14<00:02:29.450> inches<00:02:29.540> I'm<00:02:29.870> going<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.080> mark<00:02:30.470> those<00:02:30.620> off

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
to 14 inches I'm going to mark those off

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.170 
to 14 inches I'm going to mark those off
and<00:02:31.069> we'll<00:02:31.250> measure<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.760> next<00:02:31.910> time<00:02:31.970> they

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
and we'll measure it the next time they

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.760 
and we'll measure it the next time they
come<00:02:32.209> down<00:02:32.480> measuring<00:02:33.080> tapes<00:02:33.260> back<00:02:33.470> at<00:02:33.680> the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
come down measuring tapes back at the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.970 
come down measuring tapes back at the
vehicle<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.720> we<00:02:35.720> will<00:02:35.959> mark<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.380> two<00:02:36.500> farthest

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
vehicle so we will mark the two farthest

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.729 
vehicle so we will mark the two farthest
apart<00:02:37.070> ones<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.610> come<00:02:37.760> down<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.060> measured

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
apart ones and come down and measured

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.110 
apart ones and come down and measured
okay<00:02:39.739> here's<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.160> tip<00:02:40.340> number<00:02:40.550> two<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:40.970> time

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
okay here's the tip number two this time

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.830 
okay here's the tip number two this time
I'm<00:02:41.269> going<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.450> use<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.870> optics<00:02:42.350> see<00:02:43.010> if<00:02:43.130> this

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
I'm going to use the optics see if this

00:02:43.840 --> 00:04:33.150 
I'm going to use the optics see if this
helps<00:02:44.840> any

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.380 

okay<00:04:34.160> first<00:04:34.460> things<00:04:34.670> first<00:04:34.760> these<00:04:35.210> are<00:04:35.240> the

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
okay first things first these are the

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.990 
okay first things first these are the
two<00:04:35.600> from<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.140> last<00:04:36.400> two<00:04:37.400> furthers<00:04:37.790> from<00:04:37.940> the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
two from the last two furthers from the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.610 
two from the last two furthers from the
last<00:04:38.180> go<00:04:38.390> either<00:04:38.510> they<00:04:38.660> put<00:04:38.840> a<00:04:38.870> hot<00:04:39.170> toward<00:04:39.500> and

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
last go either they put a hot toward and

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.050 
last go either they put a hot toward and
half<00:04:39.740> patch<00:04:39.980> on<00:04:40.190> it<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.400> know<00:04:40.490> we<00:04:40.700> told<00:04:40.940> it

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
half patch on it so I know we told it

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.540 
half patch on it so I know we told it
was<00:04:41.180> is<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.390> one<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.700> it's<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:43.970> one<00:04:44.090> there

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
was is that one and it's that one there

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.060 
was is that one and it's that one there
hopefully<00:04:46.550> measure<00:04:46.760> those<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:49.520> is<00:04:50.950> Center<00:04:51.950> to

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
hopefully measure those it is Center to

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.700 
hopefully measure those it is Center to
Center<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.550> is<00:04:52.700> 13<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.420> a<00:04:53.480> quarter<00:04:53.840> inches<00:04:54.170> for

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
Center it is 13 and a quarter inches for

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.610 
Center it is 13 and a quarter inches for
the<00:04:54.740> most<00:04:55.220> widely<00:04:55.610> spread<00:04:56.380> alright<00:04:57.380> moving

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
the most widely spread alright moving

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.150 
the most widely spread alright moving
down<00:04:57.890> gonna<00:04:58.220> patch<00:04:58.370> those<00:04:59.200> two<00:05:00.200> back<00:05:00.440> up<00:05:00.710> we'll

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
down gonna patch those two back up we'll

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.890 
down gonna patch those two back up we'll
move<00:05:01.310> down<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.880> second<00:05:02.270> group<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.720> I

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
move down to the second group that I

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:10.210 
move down to the second group that I
fired<00:05:03.170> with<00:05:05.500> with<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.650> optics<00:05:09.010> okay<00:05:10.010> here's

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
fired with with the optics okay here's

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.650 
fired with with the optics okay here's
the<00:05:10.400> second<00:05:11.240> free<00:05:11.570> hand<00:05:11.920> standing<00:05:12.920> group

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
these are the farthest spread apart

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.330 
these are the farthest spread apart
and<00:05:21.380> we've<00:05:21.590> got<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.860> bulk<00:05:22.010> of<00:05:22.100> them<00:05:22.220> here
