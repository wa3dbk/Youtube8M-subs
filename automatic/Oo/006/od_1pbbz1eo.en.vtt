00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
reason why has amassing gloves on is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.459 
reason why has amassing gloves on is
because<00:00:11.820> there's<00:00:12.150> been<00:00:12.330> rodents<00:00:12.900> nesting

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
because there's been rodents nesting

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.530 
because there's been rodents nesting
inside<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.130> snowblower<00:00:14.519> he's<00:00:15.089> going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.330> take

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
inside the snowblower he's going to take

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.450 
inside the snowblower he's going to take
it<00:00:15.690> off<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.080> show<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.740> damage<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
it off and just show you the damage and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.849 
it off and just show you the damage and
the<00:00:17.970> nest<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.420> there<00:00:22.340> well<00:00:23.340> look<00:00:23.580> at<00:00:23.730> that

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
the nest in there well look at that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:35.090 
the nest in there well look at that
that's<00:00:25.859> huge<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:29.390> look<00:00:30.390> who's<00:00:30.599> here<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:34.100> don't

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that's huge and look who's here I don't

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.290 
that's huge and look who's here I don't
think<00:00:35.309> he's<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.640> sleeping<00:00:35.820> he<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:39.059> reason

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
think he's just sleeping he the reason

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.819 
think he's just sleeping he the reason
why<00:00:39.450> he<00:00:39.510> has<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> mask<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.290> because<00:00:40.590> sometimes

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
why he has a mask is because sometimes

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.670 
why he has a mask is because sometimes
the<00:00:41.219> mice<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.969> viruses<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.870> sometimes

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the mice can have viruses and sometimes

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
the mice can have viruses and sometimes
when<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> disturb<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.579> nest<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.300> could<00:00:45.450> be

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
when you disturb the nest it could be

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
when you disturb the nest it could be
more<00:00:45.870> vulnerable<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.500> catching<00:00:47.100> these<00:00:47.329> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
more vulnerable to catching these so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.400 
more vulnerable to catching these so
what<00:00:48.570> he's<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.379> just

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
what he's going to do now is just

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
what he's going to do now is just
basically<00:00:50.070> clean<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.180> again<00:00:51.449> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
basically clean it up but again this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.779 
basically clean it up but again this
video<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.260> show<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
video is just to show you just how the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.299 
video is just to show you just how the
rodents<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.809> into<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.289> equipment<00:00:55.590> nest

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
rodents can get into your equipment nest

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
rodents can get into your equipment nest
in<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.940> possibly<00:00:57.120> cause<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
in there and possibly cause a lot of

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:12.980 
in there and possibly cause a lot of
problems<00:01:05.869> he's<00:01:06.869> frozen

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.240 

one<00:01:13.990> way<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:14.170> can<00:01:14.380> prevent<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.130> by

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
one way you can prevent this is by

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.070 
one way you can prevent this is by
leaving<00:01:15.430> mothballs<00:01:16.090> in<00:01:16.270> your<00:01:16.450> equipment<00:01:16.870> but

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
leaving mothballs in your equipment but

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.170 
leaving mothballs in your equipment but
that's<00:01:17.230> a<00:01:17.350> bit<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.680> pain<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:17.950> do<00:01:18.280> best<00:01:18.970> thing

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
that's a bit of a pain to do best thing

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.820 
that's a bit of a pain to do best thing
is<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.360> start<00:01:19.840> where<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.260> know<00:01:20.410> there's<00:01:20.650> no

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
is to start where you know there's no

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.730 
is to start where you know there's no
rodents<00:01:21.280> lurking<00:01:21.940> around<00:01:22.230> so<00:01:23.230> Joel<00:01:23.500> here<00:01:23.650> is

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
rodents lurking around so Joel here is

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.290 
rodents lurking around so Joel here is
located<00:01:24.100> at<00:01:24.160> a<00:01:24.250> major<00:01:24.520> problem<00:01:24.970> with<00:01:25.150> this

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
located at a major problem with this

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.900 
located at a major problem with this
blower<00:01:25.720> can<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:26.350> show<00:01:26.530> us<00:01:26.560> there<00:01:26.830> Joel<00:01:27.070> right

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
blower can you show us there Joel right

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.820 
blower can you show us there Joel right
there<00:01:28.530> yeah<00:01:30.780> I've<00:01:31.780> never<00:01:31.960> really<00:01:32.290> seen<00:01:32.620> that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
there yeah I've never really seen that

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.250 
there yeah I've never really seen that
but<00:01:33.280> I'm<00:01:33.430> wondering<00:01:33.790> if<00:01:34.360> all<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.930> stuff

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
but I'm wondering if all the stuff

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.500 
but I'm wondering if all the stuff
inside<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.860> transmission<00:01:36.250> had<00:01:36.850> something<00:01:37.300> to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
inside the transmission had something to

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.530 
inside the transmission had something to
do<00:01:37.690> with<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:38.080> probably<00:01:38.590> I'm<00:01:39.490> not<00:01:39.850> totally<00:01:40.300> sure

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
do with it probably I'm not totally sure

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.290 
do with it probably I'm not totally sure
but<00:01:40.720> it<00:01:41.020> kind<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:41.290> looks<00:01:41.500> like<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:43.119> just

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
but it kind of looks like it it just

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.210 
but it kind of looks like it it just
goes<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.630> show<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:43.869> it<00:01:44.140> can<00:01:44.170> be<00:01:44.290> costly<00:01:44.650> when

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
goes to show that it can be costly when

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.030 
goes to show that it can be costly when
rodents<00:01:45.759> make<00:01:46.030> nests<00:01:46.300> in<00:01:46.600> your<00:01:46.720> equipment

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
rodents make nests in your equipment

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.290 
rodents make nests in your equipment
sometimes<00:01:48.040> I've<00:01:48.369> seen<00:01:48.400> them<00:01:48.820> chewed<00:01:49.150> the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
sometimes I've seen them chewed the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.790 
sometimes I've seen them chewed the
rubber<00:01:49.540> here<00:01:49.810> on<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.020> drive<00:01:50.290> disc<00:01:50.590> as<00:01:50.770> well

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
rubber here on the drive disc as well

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.920 
rubber here on the drive disc as well
and<00:01:51.729> then<00:01:51.910> people<00:01:52.119> don't<00:01:52.390> have<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.630> drive

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
and then people don't have a drive

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.109 
and then people don't have a drive
anymore<00:01:53.259> or<00:01:53.770> if<00:01:54.190> they<00:01:54.310> keep<00:01:54.490> using<00:01:54.759> it<00:01:54.910> with<00:01:55.090> a

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
anymore or if they keep using it with a

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.180 
anymore or if they keep using it with a
rubber<00:01:55.330> tooth<00:01:55.750> they<00:01:56.110> end<00:01:56.229> up<00:01:56.350> damaging<00:01:56.890> this

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
rubber tooth they end up damaging this

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.430 
rubber tooth they end up damaging this
disc<00:01:57.490> over<00:01:57.820> here<00:01:58.119> so<00:01:58.690> it<00:01:58.780> just<00:01:58.810> goes<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.259> show

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
disc over here so it just goes to show

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.200 
disc over here so it just goes to show
the<00:01:59.619> damage<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.160> can<00:02:00.340> get<00:02:00.580> from<00:02:00.820> rodents

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
the damage you can get from rodents

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.080 
the damage you can get from rodents
nesting<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:01.810> your<00:02:01.960> equipment<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.670> thanks<00:02:03.970> for
