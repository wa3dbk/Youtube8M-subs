K<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.929> if<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.289> low<00:00:31.500> amount<00:00:31.769> of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
K so this is if you have a low amount of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.200 
K so this is if you have a low amount of
money's<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.489> got<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:32.790> really<00:00:33.000> good<00:00:33.030> at

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
money's but you got to be really good at

money's but you got to be really good at
sniping<00:00:33.390> these<00:00:33.780> get<00:00:33.989> dropped<00:00:34.230> big<00:00:34.500> time<00:00:34.710> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
sniping these get dropped big time I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.950 
sniping these get dropped big time I
guess<00:00:35.790> he<00:00:35.969> doesn't<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.540> much<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.899> you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
guess he doesn't go for that much so you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.229 
guess he doesn't go for that much so you
can<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.469> can<00:00:37.649> lower<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> price<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.120> know

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
can you can lower the price or you know

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.410 
can you can lower the price or you know
factor<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.660> defensive<00:00:40.200> ends<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:42.300> know

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
factor out defensive ends or you know

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.729 
factor out defensive ends or you know
you<00:00:42.450> could<00:00:42.570> put<00:00:42.780> them<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.410> got<00:00:43.530> sold

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you could put them all you just got sold

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.700 
you could put them all you just got sold
so<00:00:44.129> apparently<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.670> was<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> snipe<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.710> just

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
so apparently that was a snipe I just

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.139 
so apparently that was a snipe I just
refreshed<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.489> time<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.700> guess<00:00:48.000> what

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
refreshed it right in time I guess what

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690 
refreshed it right in time I guess what
time<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.570> yep<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.680> times<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> six

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
time is it yep the times are one is six

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.240 
time is it yep the times are one is six
right<00:00:50.879> now<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.500> yeah<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> could<00:00:52.890> got<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
right now so yeah I could got that I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.299 
right now so yeah I could got that I
guess<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:54.199> you<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.440> these<00:00:55.559> good<00:00:55.800> drop<00:00:56.039> like

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
guess but you see these good drop like

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.540 
guess but you see these good drop like
five<00:00:57.030> did<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.539> know<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.870> five<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.160> twenty

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
often it's only the Manning one but you

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.320 
often it's only the Manning one but you
know<00:04:41.810> it's<00:04:42.020> all<00:04:42.110> right<00:04:42.340> you<00:04:43.340> can<00:04:43.520> usually<00:04:43.669> some

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
know it's all right you can usually some

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.050 
know it's all right you can usually some
you<00:04:44.509> know<00:04:44.539> you<00:04:44.659> sometimes<00:04:45.020> get<00:04:45.560> some<00:04:46.490> cars<00:04:46.759> off

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060

of this nothing dropped here though so

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.980 
of this nothing dropped here though so
that's<00:04:50.990> all<00:04:51.139> right<00:04:51.259> another<00:04:51.919> good<00:04:52.159> idea<00:04:52.460> is<00:04:53.449> to

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
that's all right another good idea is to

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.110 
that's all right another good idea is to
snipe<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.439> position<00:04:54.919> collectible<00:04:55.789> so<00:04:55.969> if<00:04:56.029> you

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:08.790 
want to type in just POS i liek
collectibles<00:05:01.360> probably<00:05:02.360> for<00:05:02.569> about<00:05:02.689> like<00:05:02.779> 30k

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.550 

and<00:05:10.029> those<00:05:11.029> get<00:05:11.240> pop<00:05:11.419> those<00:05:11.870> pop-ups<00:05:12.319> semi

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
and those get pop those pop-ups semi

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.100 
and those get pop those pop-ups semi
often<00:05:12.949> too<00:05:13.099> so<00:05:14.500> yeah<00:05:16.569> those<00:05:17.569> are<00:05:17.750> some<00:05:17.930> good

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
often too so yeah those are some good

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.189 
often too so yeah those are some good
filters<00:05:18.620> for<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:18.919> guys<00:05:19.099> uh<00:05:20.080> basically<00:05:21.080> I
