outbreak<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.320> they<00:02:45.470> break<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:46.690> know

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
outbreak is that they break I know

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.199 
outbreak is that they break I know
that's<00:02:48.080> realistic<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.950> whatever<00:02:49.220> but<00:02:49.459> I<00:02:49.850> just

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
that's realistic and whatever but I just

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.620 
that's realistic and whatever but I just
prefer<00:02:50.480> not<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.020> have<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:51.380> space<00:02:51.680> eaten<00:02:52.040> up

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
prefer not to have that space eaten up

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.940 
prefer not to have that space eaten up
because<00:02:53.630> when<00:02:53.990> you<00:02:54.080> do<00:02:54.260> want<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.770> break

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
because when you do want it to break

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.380 
because when you do want it to break
because<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.459> see<00:02:55.640> something<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.180> need
