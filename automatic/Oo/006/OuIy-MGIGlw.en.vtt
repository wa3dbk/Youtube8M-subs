it<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.420> lot<00:00:33.600> harder<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.290> work<00:00:34.470> on<00:00:34.590> our<00:00:34.710> hand

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it a lot harder so we work on our hand

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.590 
it a lot harder so we work on our hand
eye<00:00:35.070> coordination<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.880> we're<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
eye coordination and we're going to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660 
eye coordination and we're going to
spread<00:00:37.290> out<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.620> bit<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:38.489> going

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
to train our hand-eye coordination so we

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.189 
to train our hand-eye coordination so we
want<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.089> in<00:00:45.179> a<00:00:45.239> position<00:00:45.359> as<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:46.050> we've

want to get in a position as if we've

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.529 
want to get in a position as if we've
already<00:00:46.320> taken<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.829> stride<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.390> then<00:00:48.390> we're

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
already taken a stride and then we're

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.000 
already taken a stride and then we're
going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> actually<00:00:48.870> transfer<00:00:49.499> our<00:00:49.589> weight<00:00:49.800> so

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
going to actually transfer our weight so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.529

if you want to cheat a little bit get in
the<00:00:51.660> back<00:00:51.809> side<00:00:52.109> let<00:00:52.859> the<00:00:53.010> ball<00:00:53.100> come<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the back side let the ball come up and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.599 
the back side let the ball come up and
