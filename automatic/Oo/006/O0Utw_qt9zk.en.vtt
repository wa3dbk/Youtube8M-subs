business<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.540> mean<00:03:24.660> when<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.870> look<00:03:25.050> around<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
business I mean when you look around the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.350 
business I mean when you look around the
country<00:03:25.500> at<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.010> lot<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.700> large<00:03:26.910> companies

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
country at a lot of the large companies

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.180 
country at a lot of the large companies
that<00:03:27.390> are<00:03:27.690> falling<00:03:28.410> on<00:03:28.530> hard<00:03:28.710> times<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.130> think

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
that are falling on hard times I think

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.770 
that are falling on hard times I think
it's<00:03:29.460> a<00:03:29.550> spirit<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:29.970> entrepreneurship<00:03:30.570> and

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
it's a spirit of entrepreneurship and

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.360 
it's a spirit of entrepreneurship and
innovation<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.470> has<00:03:31.890> always<00:03:32.070> propelled

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
innovation that has always propelled

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.620 
innovation that has always propelled
this<00:03:32.670> country<00:03:33.030> forward

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
this country forward

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.690 
this country forward
