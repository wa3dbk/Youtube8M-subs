to walk out onto the MCG and a world cup

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.219 
to walk out onto the MCG and a world cup
final<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> very<00:01:35.520> special<00:01:35.909> event<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.509> yeah

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
final it's a very special event but yeah

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.690 
final it's a very special event but yeah
it's<00:01:37.439> no<00:01:37.590> more<00:01:37.799> special<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.579> my

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
it's no more special because it's my

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's no more special because it's my
last<00:01:38.909> game<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:40.439> about<00:01:40.740> timing<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.310> me

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
last game it's it's about timing for me

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.160 
last game it's it's about timing for me
and<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.060> us<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.049> right

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and like us I think now is the right

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.090 
and like us I think now is the right
time<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.960> walk<00:01:46.140> away<00:01:46.290> from<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.770> from<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
time to to walk away from the from the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.020 
time to to walk away from the from the
one<00:01:47.280> day<00:01:47.430> game<00:01:47.610> oh<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.840> guy

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
one day game oh that guy

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.260 
one day game oh that guy
ah<00:01:51.580> again<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:52.610> thought<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.030> was<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.240> best

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
ah again I thought it was the best

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
ah again I thought it was the best
decision<00:01:54.049> for<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.619> team<00:01:54.830> you<00:01:55.220> know<00:01:55.369> I<00:01:56.290> think

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
decision for the team you know I think

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.600 
decision for the team you know I think
through<00:01:57.440> my<00:01:57.590> career<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:58.010> I<00:01:58.100> think<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.520> was

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
through my career and I think if it was

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.420 
through my career and I think if it was
about<00:01:58.850> me<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.180> think<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.840> would<00:02:00.020> have<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.470> would

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
about me I think I would have I would

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.460 
about me I think I would have I would
have<00:02:01.490> batted<00:02:01.850> at<00:02:01.940> number<00:02:02.210> three<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.930> hell<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.320> a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
have batted at number three a hell of a

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.630 
have batted at number three a hell of a
lot<00:02:03.619> more<00:02:03.650> than<00:02:03.799> I<00:02:04.009> have<00:02:04.159> throughout<00:02:04.430> my

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
lot more than I have throughout my

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.180 
lot more than I have throughout my
career<00:02:04.700> but<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.540> think<00:02:06.380> Ricky<00:02:06.680> told<00:02:06.860> me<00:02:07.070> at<00:02:07.130> a

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
career but I think Ricky told me at a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.559 
career but I think Ricky told me at a
very<00:02:07.220> young<00:02:07.460> age<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.090> thought<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.360> was

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
very young age and you thought I was

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.999 
very young age and you thought I was
best<00:02:08.810> suited<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.319> middle<00:02:09.560> order<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
best suited to the middle order in the

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.400 
best suited to the middle order in the
one-day<00:02:10.369> game<00:02:10.670> especially<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.870> go<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.230> face

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
one-day game especially to go and face

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.140 
one-day game especially to go and face
spin<00:02:12.739> bowling<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.310> make<00:02:13.459> sure<00:02:13.489> I<00:02:13.670> bet<00:02:13.940> through

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
spin bowling and make sure I bet through

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.300 
spin bowling and make sure I bet through
those<00:02:14.300> middle<00:02:14.600> overs<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.680> help<00:02:15.860> our<00:02:16.010> power

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
those middle overs to to help our power

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.220 
those middle overs to to help our power
game<00:02:16.550> at<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.819> end<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.540> guess<00:02:18.050> I've

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
game at the end and I guess I've

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.400 
game at the end and I guess I've
probably<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:19.520> know<00:02:19.569> continued<00:02:20.569> on<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.200> same

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
probably you know continued on the same

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.890 
probably you know continued on the same
way<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.190> think<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.700> other<00:02:22.880> night<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.420> in

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
way and I think the other night and in

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.540 
way and I think the other night and in
Perth<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.410> think<00:02:24.590> those<00:02:24.709> two<00:02:24.739> opportunities

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
Perth I think those two opportunities

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.120 
Perth I think those two opportunities
you<00:02:26.300> know<00:02:26.450> being<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:26.900> down<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.350> 30th<00:02:27.800> over

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
you know being one down in the 30th over

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.250 
you know being one down in the 30th over
I<00:02:28.420> thought<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.540> was<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.720> right<00:02:29.750> thing<00:02:29.900> for<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
I thought it was the right thing for the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.870 
I thought it was the right thing for the
team<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.500> send<00:02:30.830> some<00:02:31.040> power<00:02:31.250> hitters<00:02:31.580> out<00:02:31.730> in

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
team to send some power hitters out in

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.770 
team to send some power hitters out in
front<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.180> me<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:34.160> know<00:02:34.280> it's<00:02:34.610> yeah<00:02:35.239> it's

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
front of me and you know it's yeah it's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.660 
front of me and you know it's yeah it's
not<00:02:35.959> about<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.440> individual<00:02:36.950> performance<00:02:37.550> or

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
not about the individual performance or

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.370 
not about the individual performance or
the<00:02:37.790> individual<00:02:38.239> success<00:02:38.720> it's<00:02:38.989> about<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
the individual success it's about the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.460 
the individual success it's about the
team<00:02:39.560> winning<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:41.110> fortunately<00:02:42.110> on<00:02:42.230> both

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
team winning and fortunately on both

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.900 
team winning and fortunately on both
occasions<00:02:42.739> I've<00:02:43.040> made<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.400> decision<00:02:43.640> we've

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
occasions I've made that decision we've

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.270 
occasions I've made that decision we've
gone<00:02:44.120> on<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.420> win<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.690> game<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:46.160> know

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
tomorrow will be no different if I feel

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.600 
tomorrow will be no different if I feel
it's<00:02:48.019> best<00:02:48.260> for<00:02:48.500> me<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.620> walk<00:02:48.830> out<00:02:49.040> at<00:02:49.160> number<00:02:49.400> 4
