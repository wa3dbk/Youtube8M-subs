have<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.760> very<00:00:36.000> conversant<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.260> if

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
have to be very conversant with it if

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.889 
have to be very conversant with it if
this<00:00:37.620> opening<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.489> be<00:00:38.610> played

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
this opening is going to be played

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.410 
this opening is going to be played
because<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.649> go<00:00:41.010> under<00:00:41.550> pretty<00:00:42.000> quickly

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
because you can go under pretty quickly

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.910 
because you can go under pretty quickly
if<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.140> play<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.680> incorrectly<00:00:45.500> there<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.680> in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
if you play it incorrectly there are in

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.940 
if you play it incorrectly there are in
fact<00:00:46.950> things<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.910> books<00:00:48.600> written<00:00:49.110> about<00:00:49.469> one

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
fact things like books written about one

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.150 
fact things like books written about one
single<00:00:50.640> variant<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.960> Sicilian<00:00:52.440> response

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
single variant of the Sicilian response

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.299 
single variant of the Sicilian response
so<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.789> shows<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.719> how<00:00:54.960> key<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.949> in

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so it shows you how key it is in

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.990 
so it shows you how key it is in
modern-day<00:00:57.180> chess<00:00:57.859> but<00:00:58.859> without<00:00:59.760> getting

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
modern-day chess but without getting

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.740 
modern-day chess but without getting
into<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.539> these<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.199> great<00:01:01.500> complexity<00:01:02.750> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
into all these this great complexity the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.560 
into all these this great complexity the
basic<00:01:04.229> game<00:01:04.589> starts<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.580> Paul<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
basic game starts like this Paul in the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.100 
basic game starts like this Paul in the

and<00:01:14.720> from<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.080> many<00:01:16.770> different<00:01:17.159> things<00:01:17.340> can

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and from here many different things can

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.289 
and from here many different things can
happen<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.330> mentioned<00:01:19.729> usually<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
happen as I mentioned usually the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.780 
happen as I mentioned usually the
players<00:01:21.689> would<00:01:22.080> go<00:01:22.290> into<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.650> thing<00:01:22.979> called<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
players would go into a thing called the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.679 
players would go into a thing called the
classical<00:01:24.390> dragger<00:01:24.750> well<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.290> say<00:01:25.799> usually

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
classical dragger well I say usually

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.100 
classical dragger well I say usually
most<00:01:27.689> commonly<00:01:28.790> White's<00:01:29.790> next<00:01:30.180> move<00:01:30.360> would<00:01:31.079> be

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
most commonly White's next move would be

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.219 
most commonly White's next move would be
to<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.939> King's<00:01:32.939> Bishop<00:01:33.150> three<00:01:33.540> which<00:01:33.810> leads

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
to this King's Bishop three which leads

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.240 
to this King's Bishop three which leads
towards<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.780> so-called<00:01:36.780> dragon<00:01:37.250> variation

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
towards the so-called dragon variation

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.480 
towards the so-called dragon variation
of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.729> opening<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.439> typical<00:01:40.860> black

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
of the opening and the typical black

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.690 
of the opening and the typical black
response<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.450> point<00:01:42.780> would<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.700> now

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
response at this point would be this now

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.120 
response at this point would be this now
the<00:01:45.270> idea<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.500> game<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:48.090> black

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the idea of this game is that black

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.490 
the idea of this game is that black
concentrates<00:01:50.149> primarily<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.540> attacking<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
concentrates primarily on attacking the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.859 
concentrates primarily on attacking the
Queen<00:01:53.070> side<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.290> white<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:56.479> continues<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
Queen side and white can continues to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.980 
Queen side and white can continues to
focus<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.549> Kings<00:01:59.850> side<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.600> has<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
focus more on the Kings side but has to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.889 
focus more on the Kings side but has to
as<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.290> said<00:02:01.530> earlier<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:02.549> extremely<00:02:03.479> quick

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
as I said earlier be extremely quick

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.649 
as I said earlier be extremely quick
careful<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.920> cautious<00:02:05.130> about<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
careful and cautious about what is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.809 
careful and cautious about what is
happening<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.560> Queen<00:02:07.829> side<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> board

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
happening on the Queen side of the board

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.530 
happening on the Queen side of the board
and<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.709> decide<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.910> develop<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.510> a
