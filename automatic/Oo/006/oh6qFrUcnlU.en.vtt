 Juninas who are missing 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.000
 So this recipe we're going to make 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.240
 yes no coral walking will start now and 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.000
 who will not be able to eat any more at will 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.980
 the recipe is super easy let's go people 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.070
 You will need to say that you say corn 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.650
 had ml of coconut milk half a spoonful 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.310
 butter a pinch of salt and 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.360
 cinnamon 200 ml of water and a cup of 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.000
 sugar 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.670
 the first step is to get an ear 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.320
 of corn and cut only that not my mother 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.150
 already with the program ask someone 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.840
 cut you because it 's enough 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.840
 dangerous 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.200
 now I'm going to hit a corn water and milk 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.600
 coconut but does not put it all up to 100 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.780
 akp at the time of the stove you put the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.780
 rest 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.880
 now is to leave the coral well 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.890
 People are going to lose right? 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.990
 take a country scoop movie too 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.759
 That's all you can do. 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.750
 throw away is the rest of the corn that the 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.490
 people will not use 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.289
 that's why the choir becomes cool 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.240
 now is the part of the stove 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.610
 I'll go in the kitchen but I'll explain. 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.429
 You'll dump it from here in the pan. 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.619
 this very small fire there you put a 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.560
 bit of butter those measures I 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.509
 I said at first a pinch of salt and 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.099
 a cup of sugar you have to stir 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.020
 for 15 minutes 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:51.979
 Now I go there in the kitchen, it's already 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.500
 ready 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.360
 if you want you can dump a 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.830
 little cinnamon that leaves a 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.599
 in the refrigerator to not stay 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.490
 very hot but preferably 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.679
 each one who likes iced tea 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.099
 and has a pretty hot record 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:11.950
