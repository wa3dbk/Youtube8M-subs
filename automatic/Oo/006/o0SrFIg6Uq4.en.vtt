00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
define small so to say and so really any

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
define small so to say and so really any
any<00:01:33.540> circle<00:01:33.960> lens<00:01:34.110> that's<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> color

any circle lens that's actually a color

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.700 
any circle lens that's actually a color
even<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.909> there's<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> regular<00:01:36.450> 14

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
even if there's a regular 14

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.060 
even if there's a regular 14
in<00:01:38.150> diameter<00:01:39.350> they<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.619> opened<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.010> my

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
in diameter they really opened up my

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
in diameter they really opened up my
eyes<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.520> make<00:01:41.610> them<00:01:41.729> look<00:01:41.820> bigger<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.530> um

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
eyes and make them look bigger so um

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.130 
eyes and make them look bigger so um
this<00:01:44.520> clearly<00:01:44.850> does<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.150> really<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:45.690> good

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
this clearly does a really really good

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200 
this clearly does a really really good
job<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.710> enlarging<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.310> eyes<00:01:47.520> especially<00:01:48.090> the

job at enlarging my eyes especially the
color<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.960> design<00:01:48.990> looks<00:01:49.560> really

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
color and the design looks really

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.460 
color and the design looks really
natural<00:01:50.070> from<00:01:50.340> afar<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:50.970> well<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.080> when<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
natural from afar as well as when you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.210 
natural from afar as well as when you
get<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.950> close<00:01:53.869> it's<00:01:54.869> still<00:01:55.440> natural<00:01:56.040> it's

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
get up close it's still natural it's

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.880 
get up close it's still natural it's
like<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.400> lot<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> people<00:01:57.200> really<00:01:58.200> thinks<00:01:58.680> my

like a lot of people really thinks my

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.020 
like a lot of people really thinks my
natural<00:01:59.220> eye<00:01:59.280> color<00:02:01.100> see<00:02:02.100> enlargement<00:02:02.820> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
natural eye color see enlargement it

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
set some boundaries because that's

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.430

for me as well as enlargement because

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.920 
for me as well as enlargement because
these<00:02:21.180> are<00:02:21.360> 14.5<00:02:21.840> which<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.709> standard

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
these are 14.5 which is like standard

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.070 
these are 14.5 which is like standard

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
which is pretty big in largeman terms

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.590 
which is pretty big in largeman terms
for<00:02:28.080> most<00:02:28.230> people<00:02:28.590> because<00:02:29.040> 4.2<00:02:29.670> gives<00:02:30.450> you

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
for most people because 4.2 gives you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.350 
for most people because 4.2 gives you
like<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> slight<00:02:31.110> enlargement<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:32.360> 14.5

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
like a slight enlargement but 14.5

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.440 
like a slight enlargement but 14.5
really<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.320> know<00:02:34.440> really<00:02:35.100> pushes<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.150> limit

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
really you know really pushes the limit

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.300 
really you know really pushes the limit
and<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.319> 15<00:02:37.680> which<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.069> personally

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
and then you have 15 which I personally

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.479 
and then you have 15 which I personally
seem<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.910> love<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:40.140> only<00:02:40.380> thing<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.069> came<00:02:41.340> as

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
seem to love the only thing that came as

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.370 
seem to love the only thing that came as
a<00:02:41.519> downfall<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.060> these<00:02:42.299> lenses<00:02:42.690> are<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
a downfall for these lenses are the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.410 
a downfall for these lenses are the
comfort<00:02:43.950> now<00:02:44.220> they're<00:02:44.640> not<00:02:44.910> super

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
comfort now they're not super

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.470 
comfort now they're not super
uncomfortable<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.709> they're<00:02:47.459> also<00:02:47.700> not

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
uncomfortable but they're also not

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.460 
uncomfortable but they're also not
really<00:02:49.110> comfortable<00:02:49.799> for<00:02:51.230> comfort<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.320> would

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
really comfortable for comfort I would

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.110 
really comfortable for comfort I would
say<00:02:52.590> these<00:02:52.739> are<00:02:52.799> like<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.570> 2.8<00:02:54.570> ad<00:02:54.959> 5<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:56.760> being

say these are like a 2.8 ad 5 that being

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.140 
say these are like a 2.8 ad 5 that being
is<00:02:57.420> once<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.320> put<00:02:58.530> them<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.769> they<00:02:58.890> feel<00:02:59.040> ok<00:02:59.430> for

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
is once I put them in they feel ok for

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.990 
is once I put them in they feel ok for
like<00:03:00.299> 30<00:03:00.780> seconds<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.500> then<00:03:01.769> after<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.760> I

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
like 30 seconds and then after that I

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.640

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
like the only downfall for me but other

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.009 
like the only downfall for me but other
than<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.489> these<00:03:50.790> are<00:03:51.030> one<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.269> my<00:03:51.569> favorite

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.059 
them due to the comfort but for each
person's<00:04:09.989> eyes<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.590> eyes<00:04:10.739> are<00:04:10.980> very

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
person's eyes the eyes are very

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.649 
person's eyes the eyes are very
sensitive<00:04:11.189> it's<00:04:11.819> different<00:04:12.150> for<00:04:12.329> each<00:04:12.359> person

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
sensitive it's different for each person

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.619 
sensitive it's different for each person
so<00:04:13.530> if<00:04:13.859> you<00:04:14.340> have<00:04:14.489> super<00:04:14.669> sensitive<00:04:15.120> eyes<00:04:15.389> I

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
so if you have super sensitive eyes I

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.150 
so if you have super sensitive eyes I
probably<00:04:15.989> wouldn't<00:04:16.320> recommend<00:04:16.560> these<00:04:16.829> lenses

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160
