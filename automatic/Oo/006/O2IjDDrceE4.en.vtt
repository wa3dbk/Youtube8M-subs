Legends<00:02:33.540> groove<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.440> plug<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.770> front<00:02:34.980> here

Legends groove to plug on the front here

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.040 
Legends groove to plug on the front here
but<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> think<00:02:35.820> he<00:02:35.970> looks<00:02:36.060> all<00:02:36.660> right<00:02:36.900> without

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
but I think he looks all right without

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.410 
but I think he looks all right without
him<00:02:37.290> up<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.550> if<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.760> decided<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.209> get<00:02:39.300> him

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
him up to you if you decided to get him

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.930 
him up to you if you decided to get him
or<00:02:39.480> not<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.800> don't<00:02:40.860> think<00:02:41.070> he's<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.400> all

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
or not but I don't think he's really all

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.900

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.150 

some<00:04:26.540> people<00:04:26.750> were<00:04:26.840> pointing<00:04:27.620> out<00:04:27.800> they<00:04:27.980> just

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
some people were pointing out they just

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.440 
some people were pointing out they just

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
have a rather narrow waist and he does

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.510 
have a rather narrow waist and he does
and<00:04:29.690> those<00:04:29.780> are<00:04:29.960> where<00:04:30.800> he's<00:04:30.890> hypocrites<00:04:31.400> are

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
and those are where he's hypocrites are

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.100 
and those are where he's hypocrites are
basically<00:04:31.970> so<00:04:32.510> they've<00:04:32.660> sort<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.870> got<00:04:33.020> this

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
basically so they've sort of got this

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.640 
basically so they've sort of got this
fake<00:04:34.040> hip<00:04:34.310> thing<00:04:34.850> gone<00:04:35.090> down<00:04:35.420> here<00:04:35.650> visually

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
fake hip thing gone down here visually

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.140 
fake hip thing gone down here visually
implies<00:04:37.190> are<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.490> down<00:04:37.640> here<00:04:37.880> but<00:04:38.060> they're

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
implies are the down here but they're

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.170 
implies are the down here but they're
actually<00:04:38.420> up<00:04:38.510> here<00:04:39.760> so<00:04:40.760> we<00:04:40.850> can<00:04:40.970> look<00:04:41.060> a<00:04:41.150> little

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
actually up here so we can look a little

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.170 
actually up here so we can look a little
awkward<00:04:41.540> it's<00:04:41.900> certain<00:04:42.440> angles<00:04:42.740> sometimes

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
awkward it's certain angles sometimes

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.240 
awkward it's certain angles sometimes
because<00:04:44.180> of<00:04:44.270> how<00:04:44.420> they've<00:04:44.570> done<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.250> just

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
because of how they've done that I just

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.080 
because of how they've done that I just
don't<00:04:46.340> think<00:04:46.520> he<00:04:46.580> looked<00:04:46.730> a<00:04:46.760> little<00:04:46.850> better

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
don't think he looked a little better

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.910 
don't think he looked a little better
than<00:04:47.300> say<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.800> stock<00:04:48.800> minutes<00:04:49.370> or<00:04:50.710> you<00:04:51.710> can<00:04:51.830> be

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
than say the stock minutes or you can be

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.140 
than say the stock minutes or you can be
sure<00:04:52.070> it's<00:04:52.160> not<00:04:52.220> sitting<00:04:52.460> down<00:04:52.610> right<00:04:52.850> yeah

there we go here it does click into
place<00:05:31.540> there's<00:05:32.540> better<00:05:32.770> now<00:05:33.770> it'll<00:05:33.980> hold<00:05:35.200> so

yeah overall pretty glad I got the sick
I<00:06:00.330> do<00:06:00.960> like<00:06:01.259> my<00:06:01.470> defensores<00:06:02.810> so<00:06:03.810> naturally<00:06:04.259> I

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
I do like my defensores so naturally I

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.680 
I do like my defensores so naturally I
had<00:06:04.500> to<00:06:04.590> have<00:06:04.710> more<00:06:05.250> than<00:06:05.400> just<00:06:05.460> went<00:06:05.759> over

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
had to have more than just went over

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.330 
had to have more than just went over
there<00:06:06.840> four<00:06:06.990> minutes<00:06:07.289> I'll<00:06:07.949> get<00:06:08.099> the<00:06:08.220> other

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
there four minutes I'll get the other

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.290 
there four minutes I'll get the other
defense<00:06:09.240> all<00:06:09.419> that<00:06:09.659> I<00:06:09.720> happen<00:06:09.930> to<00:06:10.849> his<00:06:11.849> TF<00:06:12.120> C's

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
defense all that I happen to his TF C's

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.529 
defense all that I happen to his TF C's
prometheus<00:06:15.319> so<00:06:16.319> obviously<00:06:17.210> TCS<00:06:18.210> is<00:06:18.300> quite

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
prometheus so obviously TCS is quite

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.159 
prometheus so obviously TCS is quite
different<00:06:18.900> quite<00:06:19.800> a<00:06:19.889> bit<00:06:20.039> larger<00:06:20.750> price<00:06:21.750> here

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
different quite a bit larger price here

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.779 
different quite a bit larger price here
of<00:06:22.259> course<00:06:23.810> so<00:06:25.220> if<00:06:26.220> you're<00:06:26.430> on<00:06:26.490> a<00:06:26.520> limited

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
of course so if you're on a limited

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:27.290 
of course so if you're on a limited
budget

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
budget

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.469 
budget
I<00:06:27.389> guess<00:06:27.629> Hasbro<00:06:28.050> stuffs<00:06:28.319> all<00:06:28.770> you<00:06:28.979> really<00:06:29.099> got

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
I guess Hasbro stuffs all you really got

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.119 
I guess Hasbro stuffs all you really got
but<00:06:30.479> at<00:06:30.629> least<00:06:30.930> I<00:06:31.110> think<00:06:31.169> has<00:06:31.530> done<00:06:31.560> a<00:06:31.919> decent

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129 
but at least I think has done a decent

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:35.749 
but at least I think has done a decent
job<00:06:32.310> with<00:06:32.750> defense<00:06:33.750> or<00:06:34.520> so<00:06:35.520> I<00:06:35.580> certainly

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
job with defense or so I certainly

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.119 
job with defense or so I certainly
recommend<00:06:36.150> him<00:06:36.530> tips<00:06:37.530> he<00:06:37.620> said<00:06:37.860> he's<00:06:38.009> still

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.129 
recommend him tips he said he's still

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.209 
recommend him tips he said he's still
pretty<00:06:38.310> good<00:06:38.490> though<00:06:38.669> so<00:06:39.569> I<00:06:39.599> don't<00:06:39.719> know<00:06:40.219> with

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
pretty good though so I don't know with

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:43.070 
pretty good though so I don't know with
the<00:06:41.310> one<00:06:41.610> over<00:06:41.879> the<00:06:41.940> other<00:06:41.969> regardless<00:06:42.810> of<00:06:42.960> if

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
the one over the other regardless of if

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.339 
the one over the other regardless of if
he<00:06:43.169> can<00:06:43.259> afford<00:06:43.379> Amon<00:06:45.169> depends<00:06:46.169> on<00:06:46.229> what

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
he can afford Amon depends on what

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.740 
he can afford Amon depends on what
you're<00:06:46.469> after<00:06:46.590> I<00:06:46.770> guess<00:06:46.949> I<00:06:47.479> still<00:06:48.479> think<00:06:48.659> the

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
you're after I guess I still think the

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.980 
you're after I guess I still think the
TFC<00:06:49.169> did<00:06:49.319> a<00:06:49.349> really<00:06:49.469> good<00:06:50.069> job<00:06:50.129> with<00:06:50.370> this<00:06:50.520> but

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
TFC did a really good job with this but

00:06:50.990 --> 00:07:05.909 
TFC did a really good job with this but
probably<00:06:51.990> not<00:06:52.229> for<00:06:52.289> everyone

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.879 

so<00:07:06.460> we<00:07:06.520> were<00:07:06.909> pretty<00:07:07.060> good<00:07:07.150> together<00:07:07.889> slightly

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:08.889 
so we were pretty good together slightly

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.649 
so we were pretty good together slightly
shorter<00:07:09.189> than<00:07:09.310> minister<00:07:09.699> in<00:07:10.030> their<00:07:10.210> default

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:10.659 
shorter than minister in their default

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:13.649 
shorter than minister in their default
configurations<00:07:11.969> so<00:07:12.969> maybe<00:07:13.150> once<00:07:13.389> I've<00:07:13.509> got

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:13.659 
configurations so maybe once I've got

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:16.170 
configurations so maybe once I've got
the<00:07:13.749> perfect<00:07:14.169> defeat<00:07:14.529> perfect<00:07:15.279> effect<00:07:15.699> and

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
the perfect defeat perfect effect and

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.029 
the perfect defeat perfect effect and
defeat<00:07:16.569> for<00:07:16.749> both<00:07:16.870> of<00:07:16.990> them<00:07:17.080> they'll<00:07:17.770> each<00:07:17.949> be

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 
defeat for both of them they'll each be

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:19.439 
defeat for both of them they'll each be
a<00:07:18.129> little<00:07:18.400> taller<00:07:18.639> and<00:07:18.759> they'll<00:07:18.999> look<00:07:19.360> a

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.449 
a little taller and they'll look a

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:22.649 
a little taller and they'll look a
little<00:07:19.569> nicer<00:07:19.719> a<00:07:21.120> defense<00:07:22.120> her<00:07:22.210> especially

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:22.659 
little nicer a defense her especially

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:24.480 
little nicer a defense her especially
because<00:07:22.749> he's<00:07:22.930> got<00:07:23.110> rather<00:07:23.650> wide<00:07:23.919> lower<00:07:24.249> legs

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
because he's got rather wide lower legs

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.379 
because he's got rather wide lower legs
I<00:07:24.639> think<00:07:24.759> he's<00:07:24.849> gonna<00:07:24.999> look<00:07:25.090> a<00:07:25.180> lot<00:07:25.270> better

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:25.389 
I think he's gonna look a lot better

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:35.450 
I think he's gonna look a lot better
with<00:07:25.599> some<00:07:25.779> bigger<00:07:26.529> feet<00:07:30.120> but<00:07:31.120> yeah<00:07:32.039> that<00:07:33.039> was

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.689 

combiner<00:07:36.460> wars<00:07:36.759> defense<00:07:37.479> or
