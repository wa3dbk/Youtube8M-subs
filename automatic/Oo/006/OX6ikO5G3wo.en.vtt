Peacekeeper and it turns out to be a
pretty<00:00:14.370> good<00:00:14.639> combination<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.660> do<00:00:15.750> cuz<00:00:15.960> let's

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
pretty good combination to do cuz let's

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
shit and for really the rapid fire

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.070 
shit and for really the rapid fire
that's<00:00:20.580> gone<00:00:20.699> isn't<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.180> bad<00:00:21.420> even<00:00:21.930> River

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
that's gone isn't that bad even River

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960 
that's gone isn't that bad even River
the<00:00:22.199> Sun<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.650> both<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.890> which<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.850> know

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
the Sun so both of which you know

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.340 
the Sun so both of which you know
decrease<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.660> range<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:24.960> all<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> stuff

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
decrease the range and all that stuff

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.290 
decrease the range and all that stuff
but<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:26.670> together<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.150> does

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
but really you know together it does

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.029 
but really you know together it does
make<00:00:27.480> quite<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.750> good<00:00:27.869> combination<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.619> also

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
make quite a good combination and also

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.529 
make quite a good combination and also
something<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.640> note<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.210> don't<00:00:30.359> know<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
something to note I don't know if you

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.669 
something to note I don't know if you
guys<00:00:30.630> know<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.349> when<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.500> put<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
guys know this is that when you put the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.100 
guys know this is that when you put the
rapid<00:00:31.800> fire<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.030> Peacekeeper<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.870> does

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
rapid fire on the Peacekeeper it does

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.620 
rapid fire on the Peacekeeper it does
make<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.100> hipfire<00:00:35.309> spread<00:00:35.520> much<00:00:36.120> bigger<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
make the hipfire spread much bigger so

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.819 
make the hipfire spread much bigger so
that's<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> put<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.110> laser<00:00:37.260> sight<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.559> as

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that's what I put the laser sight on as

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.350 
that's what I put the laser sight on as
well<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.430> works<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.910> tangent

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
well so it all works and tangent

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299 
well so it all works and tangent
together<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.379> makes<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> pretty<00:00:40.710> beast<00:00:40.980> gun

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
together and it makes a pretty beast gun

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.639 
together and it makes a pretty beast gun
so<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.270> would<00:00:42.510> recommend<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.440> did

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so I would recommend this if you did

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.290 
so I would recommend this if you did
actually<00:00:43.890> buy<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.370> peace<00:00:44.730> keeper<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.149> all

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
actually buy the peace keeper of all

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.700 
actually buy the peace keeper of all
those<00:00:45.480> maps<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.870> work<00:00:46.050> stuff<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> do

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
those maps and work stuff but if you do

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.130 
those maps and work stuff but if you do
not<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.610> peace<00:00:47.820> keeper<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.930> not

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
not have the peace keeper then the not

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.209 
not have the peace keeper then the not
to<00:00:49.289> worry<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.800> trying<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
to worry if you are trying to do the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.470 
to worry if you are trying to do the
rapid<00:00:50.399> fire<00:00:50.640> challenges<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.210> could<00:00:51.329> just

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
rapid fire challenges you could just

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.389 
rapid fire challenges you could just
stick<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> scorpion<00:00:52.620> evo<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.160> ready

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
stick it on the scorpion evo which ready

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.110 
stick it on the scorpion evo which ready
has<00:00:54.230> huge<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.739> rapid<00:00:56.250> fire<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> ready<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
has huge like rapid fire on it ready you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.580 
has huge like rapid fire on it ready you
know<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.449> fire<00:00:57.660> rates<00:00:57.870> crazy<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
know that fire rates crazy on the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.080 
know that fire rates crazy on the
Scorpion<00:00:58.980> already<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.730> put<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
Scorpion already so if you just put the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.180 
Scorpion already so if you just put the
wrapper<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> Scorpion<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.039> doesn't

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
wrapper on the Scorpion you know doesn't

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.560 
wrapper on the Scorpion you know doesn't
make<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> bullets<00:01:02.640> come<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:02.820> fast<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.420> all

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
make the bullets come out fast and all

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.119 
make the bullets come out fast and all
the<00:01:03.660> stuff<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.229> kill<00:01:04.470> them<00:01:04.589> faster<00:01:05.070> as

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the stuff you can kill them faster as

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.350 
the stuff you can kill them faster as
well<00:01:05.339> um<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.110> guess<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.820> if

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
well um so I guess you can do that if

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.820 
well um so I guess you can do that if
you<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> peacekeeper<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> course

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you do not have a peacekeeper of course

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.670 
you do not have a peacekeeper of course
these<00:01:11.100> keepers<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> better<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.930> choose<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
these keepers a better one to choose and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
these keepers a better one to choose and
also<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> pig<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> video<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.850> may

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
also at the pig in the video you may

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
also at the pig in the video you may
have<00:01:15.540> realized<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:16.830> i've<00:01:16.920> also<00:01:17.040> got

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
engineer one which is a bit strange to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.649 
engineer one which is a bit strange to
have<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.880> kill<00:01:20.880> confirms<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.479> usually

could see people's like charges and like

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.260 
could see people's like charges and like
that<00:01:25.890> bounce<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.310> Betty's<00:01:26.580> claymores<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
that bounce and Betty's claymores and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090 
that bounce and Betty's claymores and
stuff<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.689> where<00:01:27.869> people<00:01:27.990> are<00:01:28.259> but

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
stuff and you know where people are but

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.429 
stuff and you know where people are but
here<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> had<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.060> I'm<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.930> entirely<00:01:31.259> sure

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
here I had it on I'm not entirely sure

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.830 
here I had it on I'm not entirely sure
why<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> was<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> had<00:01:33.540> flat

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
why I think it was because it had flat

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.179 
why I think it was because it had flat
jacket<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.350> had<00:01:34.500> light<00:01:34.740> right<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
jacket you know I had light right on and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
jacket you know I had light right on and
hardline<00:01:35.549> instead<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> had<00:01:36.360> no<00:01:36.509> room<00:01:36.689> for

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
hardline instead so I had no room for

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.050 
hardline instead so I had no room for
that<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.229> they<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.890> tap<00:01:38.159> mask<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that and they have tap mask on because I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670 
that and they have tap mask on because I
didn't<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.360> flat<00:01:39.600> jacket<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> thought

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
didn't have flat jacket on so I thought

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.260 
didn't have flat jacket on so I thought
you<00:01:40.740> know<00:01:40.890> there's<00:01:41.040> no<00:01:41.220> point<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.790> could<00:01:42.119> just

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you know there's no point I could just

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
you know there's no point I could just
put<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.540> engineer<00:01:43.110> um<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:44.220> probably<00:01:44.579> should

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
put on engineer um I probably should

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.190 
put on engineer um I probably should
have<00:01:44.880> had<00:01:45.000> dexterity<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> wasn't

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
have had dexterity on because it wasn't

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.410 
have had dexterity on because it wasn't

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
it's good to stop firing at them and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.140 
it's good to stop firing at them and
just<00:02:48.980> run<00:02:49.220> along<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.520> know<00:02:49.730> run<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.060> their

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
just run along you know run to their

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.610 
just run along you know run to their
sides<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.630> stuff<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.080> they<00:02:51.230> can't<00:02:51.470> actually

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
sides and stuff so they can't actually

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.979 
sides and stuff so they can't actually
aim<00:02:52.040> at<00:02:52.190> your<00:02:52.220> anymore<00:02:52.640> cuz<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:53.000> main<00:02:53.630> thing

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
aim at your anymore cuz the main thing

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.930 
aim at your anymore cuz the main thing
to<00:02:54.200> do<00:02:54.320> right<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:55.340> survive<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:55.910> not

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
to do right is to survive it's not

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.910 
to do right is to survive it's not
necessary<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.540> kill<00:02:56.780> people<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.650> it's<00:02:57.769> to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
necessary to kill people but it's to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.470 
necessary to kill people but it's to
survive<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.550> that's<00:02:58.640> that's<00:02:59.060> one<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
survive and that's that's one of the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.670 
survive and that's that's one of the
main<00:02:59.600> things<00:02:59.630> here<00:03:00.019> meaning<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.380> street<00:03:00.620> but

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
main things here meaning the street but

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.930 
main things here meaning the street but
I've<00:03:00.800> got<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.010> Blackbird<00:03:01.370> up<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.730> all<00:03:01.790> that

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
I've got the Blackbird up and all that

stuff and what I do I ran out you know
there's<00:03:05.390> no<00:03:05.510> team<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:05.989> about<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:06.769> was

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
there's no team it is about and that was

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.080 
there's no team it is about and that was
just<00:03:07.010> bound<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.489> happen<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.820> didn't<00:03:08.030> know

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
just bound to happen I didn't know

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.900 
just bound to happen I didn't know
exactly<00:03:08.390> where<00:03:08.810> they<00:03:08.989> were<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:09.560> was<00:03:10.489> just<00:03:10.640> being

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
exactly where they were I was just being

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.180 
exactly where they were I was just being
stupid<00:03:11.330> what's<00:03:11.959> going<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.410> air<00:03:12.590> goes<00:03:12.799> in<00:03:12.830> but

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
stupid what's going on air goes in but

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.330 
stupid what's going on air goes in but
anyway<00:03:13.459> guys<00:03:13.670> um<00:03:14.000> people<00:03:14.420> compare<00:03:14.870> this<00:03:15.049> to<00:03:15.410> to

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
anyway guys um people compare this to to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.310 
anyway guys um people compare this to to
the<00:03:16.459> mp7<00:03:16.700> when<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.330> put<00:03:17.510> rapid<00:03:17.900> fire<00:03:18.110> in<00:03:18.230> it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
the mp7 when you put rapid fire in it

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.580 
the mp7 when you put rapid fire in it
and<00:03:18.440> all<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.620> stuff<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.310> did<00:03:19.730> see<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.269> like

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
and all that stuff I I did see the like

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.050 
and all that stuff I I did see the like
the<00:03:21.590> resemblance<00:03:22.130> but<00:03:22.430> now<00:03:22.610> that<00:03:22.910> they've

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
the resemblance but now that they've

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.670 
the resemblance but now that they've
light<00:03:23.239> enough<00:03:23.510> silencers<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.350> all<00:03:24.530> that

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
light enough silencers and all that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.979 
light enough silencers and all that
stuff<00:03:24.829> it<00:03:25.190> isn't<00:03:25.549> really<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.660> good<00:03:26.959> I

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
stuff it isn't really that good I

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.420 
stuff it isn't really that good I
wouldn't<00:03:27.260> really<00:03:27.440> recommend<00:03:27.560> putting<00:03:28.190> them

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
wouldn't really recommend putting them

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.400 
wouldn't really recommend putting them
two<00:03:28.670> together<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.150> all<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.510> stuff<00:03:29.630> anyway

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
two together and all that stuff anyway

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.680 
two together and all that stuff anyway
guys<00:03:30.590> also<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.190> notice<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:32.030> EMP

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
guys also you notice that I have the EMP

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.229 
guys also you notice that I have the EMP
up<00:03:32.870> or<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.680> have<00:03:34.100> it<00:03:34.190> up<00:03:34.340> at<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.700> moment<00:03:34.850> but

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
up or that have it up at the moment but

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.810 
up or that have it up at the moment but
I've<00:03:35.450> also<00:03:35.900> got<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.140> selected<00:03:36.290> because<00:03:36.820> right

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
I've also got it selected because right

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.940 
I've also got it selected because right
yeah<00:03:38.090> I'm<00:03:38.930> trying<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.230> all<00:03:39.350> these<00:03:39.440> challenges

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
yeah I'm trying to all these challenges

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.020 
yeah I'm trying to all these challenges
and<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.870> have<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.049> get<00:03:42.250> 2,500<00:03:43.250> assists<00:03:43.790> for

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
and you have to get 2,500 assists for

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.390 
and you have to get 2,500 assists for
the<00:03:44.060> EMP<00:03:44.450> which<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:44.810> crazy<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:46.040> know<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.220> know

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
the EMP which is crazy you know you know

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.890 
the EMP which is crazy you know you know
how<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:46.579> takes<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.209> is<00:03:47.329> like<00:03:47.480> how<00:03:47.720> many

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
how that takes that is like how many

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.370 
how that takes that is like how many
EMPs<00:03:48.290> that's<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:48.769> 20<00:03:49.220> 20<00:03:49.910> 30<00:03:50.150> mps<00:03:50.690> i'm<00:03:51.170> not

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
EMPs that's like 20 20 30 mps i'm not

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.960 
EMPs that's like 20 20 30 mps i'm not
entirely<00:03:51.590> sure<00:03:51.739> you<00:03:52.100> know<00:03:52.190> it's<00:03:52.430> just<00:03:52.549> varies

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
entirely sure you know it's just varies

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.910 
entirely sure you know it's just varies
depending<00:03:53.390> 66<00:03:54.140> as<00:03:54.290> well<00:03:54.470> you<00:03:54.590> know<00:03:54.709> it's<00:03:54.829> going

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
depending 66 as well you know it's going

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.979 
depending 66 as well you know it's going
to<00:03:54.980> be<00:03:55.100> much<00:03:55.280> less<00:03:55.549> as<00:03:55.730> well<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.209> people<00:03:56.810> doing

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
to be much less as well so people doing

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.390 
to be much less as well so people doing
it<00:03:57.079> in<00:03:57.170> ground<00:03:57.380> war<00:03:57.620> which<00:03:57.769> i<00:03:57.860> probably<00:03:58.100> should

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
it in ground war which i probably should

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.620 
it in ground war which i probably should
do<00:03:58.519> i<00:03:58.549> probably<00:03:58.820> should<00:03:59.030> move<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.420> ground

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
do i probably should move up to ground

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.509 
do i probably should move up to ground
war<00:03:59.810> doing<00:04:00.410> that<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:00.769> i<00:04:00.829> can<00:04:00.980> get<00:04:01.040> more<00:04:01.220> assists

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
war doing that so i can get more assists

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.460 
war doing that so i can get more assists
with<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.760> EMP<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:02.180> make<00:04:02.299> it<00:04:02.390> much<00:04:02.510> faster<00:04:02.750> but

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
with the EMP and make it much faster but

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.930 
with the EMP and make it much faster but
it's<00:04:03.590> just<00:04:03.739> it's<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.160> bit<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.400> hassle<00:04:04.579> I

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
it's just it's just a bit of a hassle I

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.580 
it's just it's just a bit of a hassle I
mean<00:04:05.329> like<00:04:05.450> that's<00:04:05.720> that's<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.110> only<00:04:06.320> way<00:04:06.440> I'm

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
mean like that's that's the only way I'm

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.500 
mean like that's that's the only way I'm
finding<00:04:07.250> this<00:04:07.370> game<00:04:07.610> fun<00:04:07.820> is<00:04:07.970> just<00:04:08.000> doing<00:04:08.299> with

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
finding this game fun is just doing with

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.580 
finding this game fun is just doing with
these<00:04:08.570> challenges<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.110> stuff<00:04:09.230> it's<00:04:09.410> already

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
these challenges and stuff it's already

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.960 
these challenges and stuff it's already
got<00:04:09.739> all<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.010> guns<00:04:10.190> diamond<00:04:10.640> I<00:04:10.700> don't<00:04:10.850> if<00:04:10.910> you
