now most of the time that's absolutely

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.100 
now most of the time that's absolutely
fine<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.130> sometimes<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.060> humans<00:01:12.570> we

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
fine but sometimes just like humans we

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
fine but sometimes just like humans we
change<00:01:13.409> addresses<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.100> change<00:01:14.369> telephone

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
change addresses and we change telephone

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
change addresses and we change telephone
numbers<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.770> circumstances<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.189> we

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
numbers in circumstances like that we

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.539 
numbers in circumstances like that we
might<00:01:17.970> need<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.390> flush<00:01:18.659> our<00:01:18.900> DNS<00:01:19.500> cache<00:01:19.770> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
might need to flush our DNS cache so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.190 
might need to flush our DNS cache so
I'll<00:01:20.820> show<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> couple<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> ways<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
I'll show you a couple of ways that you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.740 
I'll show you a couple of ways that you
can<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.180> click<00:01:24.720> on

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
