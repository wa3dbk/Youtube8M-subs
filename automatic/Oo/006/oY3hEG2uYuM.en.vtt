I<00:00:57.440> chose<00:00:58.400> bournemouth<00:00:58.730> university<00:00:58.790> because

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
I chose bournemouth university because

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.330 
I chose bournemouth university because
it<00:00:59.690> has<00:00:59.840> a<00:01:00.110> really<00:01:00.320> good<00:01:00.470> reputation<00:01:00.680> for

it has a really good reputation for
hands-on<00:01:01.880> midwifery<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.140> kind<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.380> a

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
hands-on midwifery so it's kind of a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.040 
hands-on midwifery so it's kind of a
more<00:01:03.620> practical<00:01:03.830> way<00:01:04.250> of<00:01:04.280> learning<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:05.050> think
