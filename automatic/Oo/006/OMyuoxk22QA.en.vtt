00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
why is it that when he evolved then I

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.979 
why is it that when he evolved then I
then<00:02:26.220> he<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.640> went<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.209> random<00:02:27.690> blind

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989

the<00:02:30.660> only<00:02:30.989> argument<00:02:31.290> i<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.739> make<00:02:31.890> towards

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the only argument i can make towards

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.370 
the only argument i can make towards
that<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.430> because<00:02:32.760> croc<00:02:33.300> Crooker<00:02:33.810> rock<00:02:34.050> use

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
didn't think it would be a complete you

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.960 
didn't think it would be a complete you
know<00:03:01.019> transformation<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.100> was<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.430> was<00:03:02.580> hoping

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
know transformation I was I was hoping

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.120 
know transformation I was I was hoping
he<00:03:03.209> would<00:03:03.360> lose<00:03:03.480> shit<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.019> was<00:03:04.440> hoping<00:03:04.560> iris

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
he would lose shit I was hoping iris

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.770 
he would lose shit I was hoping iris
would<00:03:05.280> lose<00:03:05.489> control<00:03:05.850> Dragonite<00:03:06.420> again

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
would lose control Dragonite again

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.620 
would lose control Dragonite again
because<00:03:07.230> if<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:08.340> were<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.000> happen<00:03:09.030> where<00:03:09.510> she

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
because if that were to happen where she

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.270 
because if that were to happen where she
just<00:03:09.810> gained<00:03:10.049> complete<00:03:10.319> control<00:03:10.410> drag<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.100> and

just gained complete control drag I and
they<00:03:11.430> still<00:03:11.700> lost<00:03:11.880> I'd<00:03:12.150> be<00:03:12.239> like<00:03:12.390> what<00:03:12.860> that's

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
they still lost I'd be like what that's

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.990 
they still lost I'd be like what that's
not<00:03:13.980> gonna<00:03:14.100> be<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.250> drink<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.549> trust<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:14.880> at

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
all like what the one time I trust she

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.090 
all like what the one time I trust she
was<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.950> one<00:03:17.100> time<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.400> lose<00:03:17.579> no<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:19.100> still

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
was the one time we lose no I still

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.220 
was the one time we lose no I still
don't<00:03:20.280> think<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.670> random<00:03:21.209> rage<00:03:21.450> fit<00:03:21.930> didn't

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
don't think that random rage fit didn't

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.509 
don't think that random rage fit didn't
really<00:03:22.530> make<00:03:22.650> sense<00:03:22.709> unless<00:03:23.220> you're<00:03:23.489> just

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
really make sense unless you're just

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.860 
really make sense unless you're just
gonna<00:03:23.760> make<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:23.970> argument<00:03:24.209> because<00:03:24.660> he<00:03:24.750> hit

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
gonna make the argument because he hit

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.810 
gonna make the argument because he hit
him<00:03:24.959> with<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.109> dragon<00:03:25.350> attack<00:03:25.739> would<00:03:25.950> still

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
him with a dragon attack would still

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.240 
him with a dragon attack would still
seems<00:03:27.060> kind<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.299> bullshit<00:03:27.950> overall<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:28.980> was

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
seems kind of bullshit overall I was

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.470 
seems kind of bullshit overall I was
fine<00:03:29.430> with<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.640> fighting<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.120> thought<00:03:30.329> I

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
fine with the fighting I thought I

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.690 
fine with the fighting I thought I
thought<00:03:30.690> he<00:03:31.079> was<00:03:31.170> using<00:03:31.380> crunch<00:03:31.799> way<00:03:32.160> too<00:03:32.220> much

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
thought he was using crunch way too much

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.460 
thought he was using crunch way too much
in<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:32.970> fight<00:03:33.299> oh<00:03:33.329> I<00:03:33.540> would<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.900> why<00:03:34.440> would

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
in that fight oh I would you why would

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.710 
in that fight oh I would you why would
