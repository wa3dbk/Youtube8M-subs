00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 very good to all people that such as 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.870
 we are here black with the new champion 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.240
 that was to come with beat a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.429
 champion that good is very funny that 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.380
 above all and apart since I had 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.250
 quite and hold well do not rely on plan 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.420
 of tank and so and so well tell you that 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.760
 you are already the last champion or 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.160
 2012 people we will go see a little bit 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.039
 how your passive skills work 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.660
 it's a shield whenever we use a 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.279
 of our idea activated abilities 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.560
 an objective if it does not give the objective is not 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 active we will have a shield that absorbs 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.059
 10% of our maximum life for 5 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.170
 seconds we will see now 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.880
 example in operation with the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.760
 next skill 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.830
 the stability that is a skills or the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.560
 which has two forts crosses through 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.660
 example also walls and tam or walls 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.310
 as for example it is good because if 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.630
 we have for example the brands we leave 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.550
 pressed the skill and start it 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.410
 load you know blank like for example 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.920
 the one of varus so that you can have an idea 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.690
 it's exactly that style 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.670
 and the issue of while I'm loading the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.230
 skill will then be reduced to 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.170
 our speed of movement in a 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.340
 percent and apart the damage will also be 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.689
 which do more other than this as 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.720
 for example children make them less 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.310
 damage and apart it also throws them towards 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.680
 back a little bit not to the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.049
 Champions to those who give stability 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.460
 applies to the w which we are going to explain 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.880
 now and apart from it then of course 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.500
 logically does physical damage 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.119
 the champion or whatever it is I saw stop 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.950
 roasted when it's loading if it 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.340
 find therefore with a goal with a 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.340
 champion 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.580
 in the video 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.560
 and there you put it you know and it gets well when 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.040
 I was up to the maximum rank and such a 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.650
 quite 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.000
 let's see w lara say that good 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.100
 Well stability is a little bit in plan 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.330
 you know without a doubt three champions for the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.040
 three they eat it is not that it's just 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.780
 an objective but to be able to give several 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.530
 since it is very good 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.420
 let's see the w which then applies not to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.150
 what we have seen does not apply the w 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.369
 what makes stability so easy every 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.470
 three attacks on the same target you 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.720
 we will do physical damage equal to a portal 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.580
 percent of your maximum life as a state 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.860
 watching here and also scale with his 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.989
 percent or you know all this 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.120
 as physical damage reduces the armor 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.250
 in a percent and apart from it 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.720
 we will also gain speed of 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.120
 attack for a brief period of 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.739
 time since it's a checada you know the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.739
 damage because it is as always 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:33.000
 admin me if there are monsters in this case 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.819
 baron or whatever look 12 and fvm to 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.069
 kiss the shield that is very very good 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.069
 he puts you 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.230
 2 with the shatter 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.749
 well let's see it is a truth is that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.150
 to me I like more has two charges as 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:51.640
 for example is the cork missiles and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.290
 or rudder appointments or 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.640
 and well, it's going to recharge with the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.730
 step of the seconds right now 11 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.490
 seconds that then is less you know according to 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.200
 the level goes up and such good 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.270
 this time our power is very well 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.850
 next basic attack this life of 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.500
 scale with ap and conade nevertheless 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.690
 the physical damage all your abilities what 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.670
 are 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.320
 It hurts the target that we give 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.920
 with our next basic attack already 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.400
 all those who are behind eye look 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.310
 we use a slap on the plan you know 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.379
 back and then 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.810
 We are very good people and good because it 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.069
 is going recharging not like we are seeing is 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.409
 skills that have helped me the most 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.980
 liked you know in flat and point does not stop 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.659
 I know how I mola mola it is beautiful 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.730
 very well and finally we are left to the air 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.860
 the ultimate in this life of this very 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.360
 well we will use it in a champion 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.140
 enemy and when we use it 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.900
 we will charge towards him we are going to inflict 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.280
 physical damage and apart from that 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.870
 we will create your pressure we do not cast you for 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.549
 above italy will be that in the 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.660
 effect of your pressure that for example is 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.160
 the same as warwick or apple tree 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.040
 while we are loading for example to 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.470
 this to this enemy and there is some champion 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.750
 well in front of you or whatever it is not 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.060
 you know you know the champions give them 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.879
 undone backwards making the 1 75% 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.040
 of the stability year apart from it 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.690
 when we are loading you know in plan 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.329
 of course we 'll see when he takes home 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.070
 asia you are immune to all kinds of cc what 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.990
 what they are is your silence of slowdown 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.400
 it's because if you do not imagine you know that 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.530
 charges towards him you get stronista 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.940
 They humiliate with status in this way 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.439
 Well, it's not done like that, so it's good 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.210
 let's see him look when he loads 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:37.650
 and dad 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.220
 apart from that he applies the w 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.900
 you know 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.550
 so curly first does not take away much 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.289
 it is true that it does not take away but it happened until 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.009
 the other skills you know look we're going to 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.449
 kill him 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.449
 so we go like when palm 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.970
 every time is that about the three attacks and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.970
 such is that you are crazy 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.970
 and that's how he dies in the shit 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.520
 good that more things have gotten through here 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.250
 look when it recalls that base changes to 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.180
 look at the minimum for that goes out so much in 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.860
 allies as enemies is a little bit no 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.180
 a bit streaked but it's good on everything 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.860
 for the enemies more than your companions 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.420
 we're also going to good for everything a little 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.280
 it's okay 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.440
 what happens that good I do not know how are they going 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.360
 to do for your partners in spam plan 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.550
 imagine that the five are near 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.040
 let it be good lights 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.330
 referent even with champion pasta what 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.220
 kind of how can we do it 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.350
 honestly you have two skills and 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.970
 one is passive you have two a passive and the 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.020
 last there is not much to choose more 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.760
 how are we seeing what the 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.100
 skills things that can be done 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.540
 for example the theme of the ultimate you know 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.760
 for if we want to throw it at someone or 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.920
 whatever it is and we get to it you know 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.990
 we can use this skill you know 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.510
 to travel distance and then throw 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.250
 the ere something of that style but good 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.680
 As I'm telling you, there's no plan there either 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.930
 the mega combo you know the champion is what 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.820
 if you do not have much more this life 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.820
 people love the effect 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.470
 very well with this we are finishing saying 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.479
 that within a few people of the 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.099
 new skins that are about to arrive those of 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.990
 Christmas and some out there you know 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.630
 for example there is also the sack that 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.370
 It is on the plan for the anniversary of Korea 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.000
 of a year there in lolita and well then 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.830
 little things 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.500
 You see you fight a little bit with the ugly 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.490
 diana comes an ugly rikín and some 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.920
 little thing more than we will already comment 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.920
 people like I always say see you
