the first thing is i must say that i
have<00:00:16.199> already<00:00:16.800> built<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.160> frame<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> house

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.599 
have already built this frame of a house
it's<00:00:19.800> three<00:00:20.580> blocks<00:00:20.970> high<00:00:21.590> and<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:26.010> first<00:00:26.340> tip

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
it's three blocks high and the first tip

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
it's three blocks high and the first tip
i'm<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> give<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.510> make<00:00:27.779> everything

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
i'm going to give you is make everything

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.319 
i'm going to give you is make everything
symmetrical<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:31.640> because<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.790> was<00:00:33.000> an<00:00:33.120> odd

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
symmetrical so because this was an odd

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.940 
symmetrical so because this was an odd
odd<00:00:33.600> number<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.969> blocks<00:00:35.969> wide<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.840> made<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
odd number of blocks wide I made the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.869 
odd number of blocks wide I made the
door<00:00:38.300> 22<00:00:40.850> to<00:00:41.850> white<00:00:43.340> cuz<00:00:44.340> I'll<00:00:44.430> always<00:00:44.579> it'll

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
door 22 to white cuz I'll always it'll

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.529 
door 22 to white cuz I'll always it'll
be<00:00:45.000> offset<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:47.219> number<00:00:47.489> two<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.420> can

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
be offset so number two is if you can

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.840 
be offset so number two is if you can
have<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.719> window<00:00:49.160> make<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> same<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.700> those

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
have a window make it the same of those

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.790 
have a window make it the same of those

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
sides and put glass panes in to make it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.380 
sides and put glass panes in to make it
look<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.160> bit<00:00:59.190> better<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> you've<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.059> blast

it makes it look more traditional and
you're<00:03:21.360> going<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.510> add<00:03:21.630> some<00:03:21.660> furnaces<00:03:22.200> as

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
you're going to add some furnaces as

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:33.310 
you're going to add some furnaces as
ovens<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:27.630> if<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.780> find<00:03:27.960> some<00:03:28.200> furnaces

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.430 

you've<00:03:34.320> got<00:03:34.560> some<00:03:34.710> furnaces<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:36.440> you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
you've got some furnaces here and you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:48.680 
you've got some furnaces here and you
place<00:03:37.710> them<00:03:40.970> like<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:46.940> but<00:03:47.940> sometimes<00:03:48.210> it's

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
place them like that but sometimes it's

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.440 
place them like that but sometimes it's
easier<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.410> put<00:03:50.340> chests<00:03:51.710> on<00:03:52.710> top<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:54.000> just

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
easier to put chests on top I just
