down<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.790> move<00:01:27.060> themselves<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:28.439> advantage

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
down they move themselves the advantage

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:29.620 
down they move themselves the advantage
of<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.100> system

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
of this system

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.480 
of this system

eggs as the Porsche car not eat the eggs

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.760 
eggs as the Porsche car not eat the eggs
and<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.960> reduces<00:01:39.960> diseases<00:01:40.650> over<00:01:40.909> 90%<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and it reduces diseases over 90% this is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.590 
and it reduces diseases over 90% this is
the<00:01:43.860> advantage<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.180> poor<00:01:45.420> tree

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the advantage because the poor tree

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.139 
the advantage because the poor tree
cannot<00:01:45.930> eat<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.950> manure<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:47.909> they

cannot eat the the manure which they

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.499 
cannot eat the the manure which they
produce<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.740> those<00:01:49.979> native<00:01:50.939> materials

produce and all those native materials

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.789 
produce and all those native materials
this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> advantage

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
this is the advantage

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.789 
this is the advantage

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
whole this place

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.420 
whole this place
I<00:05:02.759> can't<00:05:03.389> accommodate<00:05:03.719> 2040<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.919> time<00:05:05.159> I

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
I can't accommodate 2040 of the time I

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.189 
I can't accommodate 2040 of the time I
could<00:05:05.819> hardly<00:05:06.029> accommodate<00:05:06.719> around<00:05:07.499> 700<00:05:08.310> but

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
could hardly accommodate around 700 but

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.469 
could hardly accommodate around 700 but
because<00:05:10.199> of<00:05:10.229> these<00:05:10.949> battery<00:05:11.340> cages<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.939> could

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
because of these battery cages I could

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.129 
because of these battery cages I could
accommodate<00:05:12.900> up<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.370> 2050<00:05:14.370> time<00:05:14.729> so<00:05:15.689> this<00:05:15.960> I

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
accommodate up to 2050 time so this I

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.489 
accommodate up to 2050 time so this I
find<00:05:16.379> it<00:05:16.499> successful<00:05:17.099> and<00:05:17.389> helpful<00:05:18.389> yes<00:05:19.139> and

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:19.499 
find it successful and helpful yes and

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:25.760 
find it successful and helpful yes and
even<00:05:20.960> diseases<00:05:23.090> being<00:05:24.090> reduced<00:05:24.479> over<00:05:25.139> 90%

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
even diseases being reduced over 90%

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.769 
even diseases being reduced over 90%
because<00:05:26.279> when<00:05:26.669> they<00:05:26.819> stay<00:05:27.029> at<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.449> free-range

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
because when they stay at the free-range

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.879 
because when they stay at the free-range
system<00:05:28.439> you<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.669> lot<00:05:30.150> of<00:05:30.300> diseases<00:05:30.629> rise<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:31.349> lot

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
system you a lot of diseases rise a lot

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.159 
system you a lot of diseases rise a lot
of<00:05:32.039> diseases<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.639> 40<00:05:33.270> die<00:05:33.449> the<00:05:33.900> mortality

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
of diseases and 40 die the mortality

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.920 
of diseases and 40 die the mortality
rate<00:05:34.560> was<00:05:34.830> so<00:05:35.069> up<00:05:35.279> but<00:05:35.550> when<00:05:36.270> they<00:05:36.479> stay<00:05:36.689> at<00:05:36.750> the

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
rate was so up but when they stay at the

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.649 
rate was so up but when they stay at the
cages<00:05:37.319> there<00:05:38.069> is<00:05:38.189> no<00:05:38.340> mortality<00:05:38.879> rate<00:05:39.029> is

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
cages there is no mortality rate is

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.920 
cages there is no mortality rate is
highly<00:05:40.169> reduced<00:05:40.529> I<00:05:40.830> think<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:42.479> government

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
highly reduced I think the government

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.929 
highly reduced I think the government
should<00:05:43.020> continue<00:05:43.740> supporting<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.430> bdg

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:44.939 
should continue supporting the bdg

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.079 
should continue supporting the bdg
program<00:05:45.389> and<00:05:45.949> should<00:05:46.949> continue<00:05:47.400> supporting

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
program and should continue supporting

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.290 
program and should continue supporting
