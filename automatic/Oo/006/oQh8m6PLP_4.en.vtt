grill<00:01:13.899> at<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.080> bottom<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.100> it's<00:01:15.729> that<00:01:15.940> sort

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
grill at the bottom and it's that sort

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.960 
grill at the bottom and it's that sort
of<00:01:16.270> popped<00:01:16.509> by<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.780> makeshift<00:01:17.320> big<00:01:17.830> like<00:01:18.460> metal

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
of popped by a makeshift big like metal

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.330 
of popped by a makeshift big like metal
bowl<00:01:19.179> and<00:01:19.509> then<00:01:20.350> that's<00:01:20.710> what<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.979> grill<00:01:21.190> is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
bowl and then that's what the grill is

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.770 
bowl and then that's what the grill is
so<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.850> coals<00:01:22.030> are<00:01:22.149> at<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.360> bottom<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:22.750> that

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
so the coals are at the bottom in that

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.290 
so the coals are at the bottom in that
round<00:01:23.200> grill<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:23.920> then<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:24.850> almost<00:01:25.090> must

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
round grill and then that almost must

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.560 
round grill and then that almost must
work<00:01:25.630> like<00:01:25.660> almost<00:01:26.170> like<00:01:26.289> an<00:01:26.410> oven<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:27.399> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
work like almost like an oven so the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.139 
work like almost like an oven so the
kind<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.600> like<00:01:28.750> indirect<00:01:29.320> low<00:01:30.130> heat<00:01:30.429> so<00:01:31.030> the

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
kind of like indirect low heat so the

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.469 
kind of like indirect low heat so the
chickens<00:01:31.509> slow<00:01:31.840> cooks<00:01:32.170> on<00:01:32.470> top<00:01:33.190> of<00:01:33.429> that<00:01:33.700> that

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
chickens slow cooks on top of that that

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.870 
chickens slow cooks on top of that that
like<00:01:34.929> metal<00:01:35.229> basin<00:01:35.740> which<00:01:35.890> sits<00:01:36.340> on<00:01:36.580> top<00:01:36.820> of

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
like metal basin which sits on top of

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.139 
like metal basin which sits on top of
the<00:01:37.360> coals<00:01:38.429> hopefully<00:01:39.429> I<00:01:39.459> explained<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.000> all

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
the coals hopefully I explained that all

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.160 
the coals hopefully I explained that all
right<00:01:40.360> but<00:01:40.929> anyway<00:01:41.020> it's<00:01:41.319> a<00:01:41.410> really

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
right but anyway it's a really

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.340 
right but anyway it's a really
and<00:01:43.560> very<00:01:44.220> cool<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.909> grill<00:01:45.720> chicken<00:01:45.960> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and very cool way to grill chicken I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.580 
and very cool way to grill chicken I
think<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.950> sky<00:01:47.220> bot<00:01:47.460> which<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> style

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
think this is sky bot which is the style

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
think this is sky bot which is the style
which<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> very<00:01:50.430> variety<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:51.150> chicken<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
which is a very variety of chicken that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.990 
which is a very variety of chicken that
is<00:01:51.899> smaller<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.770> more<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> free-range

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is smaller and more like a free-range

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.020 
is smaller and more like a free-range
chicken<00:01:54.479> skin<00:01:54.810> tastes<00:01:55.080> really<00:01:55.320> good<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
chicken skin tastes really good and the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.539 
chicken skin tastes really good and the
meat<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.509> more<00:01:58.170> natural<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.979> chickeny

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
meat is more natural like chickeny

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
meat is more natural like chickeny
flavoured<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:00.990> small<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.470> can

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
flavoured it's really small so you can

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.469 
flavoured it's really small so you can
see<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> whole<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.360> is

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
see this is the whole I think this is

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.740 
see this is the whole I think this is
the<00:02:03.630> drumstick<00:02:04.190> it's<00:02:05.190> tiny<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the drumstick it's tiny and this is the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.020 
the drumstick it's tiny and this is the
