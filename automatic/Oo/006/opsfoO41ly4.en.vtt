00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.550 
way to just another tool isn't it really
stuff<00:01:53.860> yeah<00:01:54.400> I<00:01:54.700> think<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.570> Photoshop<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.440> the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
stuff yeah I think the Photoshop is the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.040 
stuff yeah I think the Photoshop is the
tattoo<00:01:56.920> artist<00:01:57.310> best<00:01:57.520> friend<00:01:58.000> right<00:01:58.360> now<00:01:58.540> we'd

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
tattoo artist best friend right now we'd

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.510 
tattoo artist best friend right now we'd
have<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.230> lot<00:01:59.470> more<00:01:59.530> sleepless<00:02:00.160> nights

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
have a lot more sleepless nights

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.780 
have a lot more sleepless nights
speaking<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:01.540> lot<00:02:01.690> more<00:02:05.010> comes<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.130> lot<00:02:06.310> timeout

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
speaking a lot more comes a lot timeout

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.860 
speaking a lot more comes a lot timeout
so<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:10.149> spend<00:02:10.420> more<00:02:10.510> time<00:02:10.690> with<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.899> family

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
so you spend more time with the family

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.120 
so you spend more time with the family
and<00:02:13.870> you've<00:02:13.990> got<00:02:14.110> more<00:02:14.230> time<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.650> do<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
and you've got more time to do the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.150 
and you've got more time to do the
tattoos<00:02:15.850> as<00:02:16.030> well<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.600> think<00:02:17.040> personally<00:02:18.040> I

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
tattoos as well I think personally I

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.190 
tattoos as well I think personally I
think<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.459> Photoshop<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:18.970> necessary<00:02:19.510> it's

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
think a Photoshop is necessary it's

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.610 
think a Photoshop is necessary it's
necessary<00:02:20.340> because<00:02:22.230> everyone<00:02:23.230> want<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.500> see

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
necessary because everyone want to see

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.740 
necessary because everyone want to see
beauty<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.670> want<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.940> see<00:02:25.060> better<00:02:25.330> photo

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
beauty that want to see better photo

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.470 
beauty that want to see better photo
quality<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:27.040> know<00:02:27.130> most<00:02:27.610> camera<00:02:28.090> cannot

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
quality you know most camera cannot

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.360 
quality you know most camera cannot
bring<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.989> quality<00:02:29.410> while<00:02:29.560> we<00:02:29.709> human<00:02:30.160> eye<00:02:30.340> to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
bring the quality while we human eye to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.750 
bring the quality while we human eye to
see<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:31.150> know<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.160> Photoshop<00:02:33.610> a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
see you know so I think a Photoshop a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.780 
see you know so I think a Photoshop a
little<00:02:34.030> bit<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.720> adjust<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.620> light<00:02:35.890> shadow

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
little bit to adjust the light shadow

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.990 
little bit to adjust the light shadow
sharpness<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:38.800> make<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.190> look<00:02:39.310> better<00:02:39.580> I

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
sharpness to make you look better I

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.210 
sharpness to make you look better I
think<00:02:40.300> it's<00:02:40.630> good<00:02:40.840> because<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.530> can<00:02:41.800> draw<00:02:41.980> how

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
think it's good because you can draw how

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.800 
think it's good because you can draw how
important<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:43.150> artists<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.690> draw

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
important is it that artists to draw

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.570 
important is it that artists to draw
outside<00:02:44.140> catches<00:02:44.590> yeah<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:45.010> just<00:02:45.040> makes<00:02:45.400> a

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
outside catches yeah it just makes a

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.310 
outside catches yeah it just makes a
life<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.940> little<00:02:46.090> bit<00:02:46.270> easier<00:02:46.390> using<00:02:46.840> Photoshop

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
life a little bit easier using Photoshop

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.410 
life a little bit easier using Photoshop
cuz<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.650> click<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.400> tool<00:02:48.700> guy<00:02:48.970> bang<00:02:49.209> bang

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
cuz you just click a tool guy bang bang

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.210 
cuz you just click a tool guy bang bang
banging<00:02:49.810> head<00:02:50.290> stuff<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.770> just<00:02:50.920> makes<00:02:51.070> it

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
banging head stuff it just makes it

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.830 
banging head stuff it just makes it
easier<00:02:51.489> for<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.760> both<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:51.970> us<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.360> leaves<00:02:52.540> like

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
easier for the both of us it leaves like

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.229 
easier for the both of us it leaves like
definitely<00:02:53.230> less<00:02:53.770> doubts<00:02:54.040> yeah<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.640> think<00:02:54.940> it's

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
definitely less doubts yeah I think it's

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.080 
definitely less doubts yeah I think it's
great<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.920> think<00:02:56.920> we<00:02:57.459> all

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
great I think we all

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.020 
great I think we all
use<00:02:59.090> Photoshop<00:02:59.660> and<00:03:00.520> materials<00:03:01.520> like<00:03:01.760> this

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
use Photoshop and materials like this

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.830 
use Photoshop and materials like this
you<00:03:02.209> know<00:03:02.390> if<00:03:03.110> anyone<00:03:03.590> can<00:03:04.190> work<00:03:05.180> good<00:03:05.630> with

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
okay but I will have to be careful

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.220

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
so we have a whole reference yeah and

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.960 
so we have a whole reference yeah and
the<00:03:45.560> last<00:03:45.590> stop<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.220> put<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.489> together<00:03:46.580> it's

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
the last stop to put it together it's

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.360 
the last stop to put it together it's
you<00:03:47.150> distort<00:03:47.840> work<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.380> feel<00:03:48.680> where's<00:03:49.160> the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
you distort work you feel where's the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.920 
you distort work you feel where's the
shadow<00:03:49.610> where's<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.030> lightning<00:03:50.420> this<00:03:50.600> is<00:03:50.750> the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
shadow where's the lightning this is the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.490 
shadow where's the lightning this is the
important<00:03:51.319> thing

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
important thing

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.740 
important thing
so<00:03:51.890> how<00:03:52.010> would<00:03:52.069> it<00:03:52.220> affect<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.790> if<00:03:53.180> photoshop

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
so how would it affect you if photoshop

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.620 
so how would it affect you if photoshop
did<00:03:54.080> not<00:03:54.230> exist<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:55.040> don't<00:03:55.970> know<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.150> would<00:03:56.510> have

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
did not exist I don't know I would have
