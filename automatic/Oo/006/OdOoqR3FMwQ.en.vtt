came with the tan Tien that i got for a
gift<00:00:55.129> out<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.370> both<00:00:56.520> these<00:00:56.730> two<00:00:57.149> rows<00:00:57.329> i<00:00:57.660> would

gift out of both these two rows i would
recommend<00:01:00.859> probably<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:05.150> actually<00:01:06.150> another

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.399 

my<00:01:10.119> opinion<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.810> terrible<00:01:11.799> terrible<00:01:12.040> hook<00:01:12.340> up

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
my opinion the terrible terrible hook up

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.219 
my opinion the terrible terrible hook up
they<00:01:14.409> wear<00:01:14.770> really<00:01:15.159> really<00:01:15.490> fast<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.420> you

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
they wear really really fast and you

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.010 
they wear really really fast and you
could<00:01:17.409> definitely<00:01:17.649> buy<00:01:17.979> a<00:01:18.009> better<00:01:18.369> wheel<00:01:19.020> for

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
could definitely buy a better wheel for

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.420 
could definitely buy a better wheel for
the<00:01:20.080> money<00:01:20.259> you<00:01:20.350> spend<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.680> these<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.590> 83a<00:01:24.189> are

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
the money you spend on these the 83a are

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.340 
the money you spend on these the 83a are
more<00:01:24.729> smooth<00:01:25.030> than<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.780> 6a<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:28.060> have<00:01:29.049> a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
more smooth than the 6a and have a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.960 
more smooth than the 6a and have a
little<00:01:29.799> butter<00:01:30.100> hook<00:01:30.399> up<00:01:30.580> but<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.990> 86<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.970> break

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
little butter hook up but the 86 a break

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.109 
little butter hook up but the 86 a break
a<00:01:34.240> lot<00:01:34.509> easier<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.350> don't<00:01:36.189> require<00:01:36.490> as<00:01:36.939> much

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
a lot easier and don't require as much

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.160 
a lot easier and don't require as much
effort<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.869> throw<00:01:38.560> slide<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:40.299> feel<00:01:40.780> looking<00:01:41.020> for

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
effort to throw slide I feel looking for

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.570 
effort to throw slide I feel looking for
a<00:01:41.200> beginner<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.799> your<00:01:41.950> look<00:01:42.190> you're

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
a beginner and your look you're

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.340 
a beginner and your look you're
absolutely<00:01:42.759> set<00:01:43.479> on<00:01:43.600> these<00:01:43.720> wheels<00:01:43.959> i<00:01:44.200> would

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
absolutely set on these wheels i would

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.609 
absolutely set on these wheels i would
go<00:01:44.500> for<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.740> ATA<00:01:45.220> which<00:01:45.640> have<00:01:46.569> a<00:01:46.690> very<00:01:46.720> very

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
go for the ATA which have a very very

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.130 
go for the ATA which have a very very
very<00:01:47.799> smooth<00:01:48.369> side<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:49.440> nice<00:01:50.440> hookup<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
very smooth side and nice hookup but the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.469 
very smooth side and nice hookup but the
only<00:01:53.289> downside<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:53.799> those<00:01:54.190> will<00:01:54.399> die<00:01:54.670> super

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
only downside is those will die super

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.580 
only downside is those will die super
fast<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:56.649> wouldn't<00:01:57.580> run<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.880> a6<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.569> all<00:01:59.140> that

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
fast I wouldn't run the a6 a all that

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.279 
fast I wouldn't run the a6 a all that
much<00:01:59.770> because<00:01:59.950> I'm<00:02:00.159> looking<00:02:00.459> to<00:02:00.490> trade<00:02:00.729> them

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.710 

but<00:02:05.289> what<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.009> have<00:02:06.280> run<00:02:06.490> it's<00:02:06.939> been<00:02:07.149> like<00:02:07.479> two

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
but what I have run it's been like two

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.230 
but what I have run it's been like two
weeks<00:02:09.780> they're<00:02:10.780> chattery<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.650> don't<00:02:12.130> like<00:02:12.280> that

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.610 

they're<00:02:16.240> not<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.540> best<00:02:16.720> side<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.470> world

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
they're not the best side in the world

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.310 
they're not the best side in the world
but<00:02:18.310> they<00:02:18.610> slide<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.300> while<00:02:21.690> terms<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.960> urethane

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
but they slide a while terms of urethane

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.050 
but they slide a while terms of urethane
characteristics<00:02:26.730> they're<00:02:27.730> really<00:02:27.970> really

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
characteristics they're really really

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.260 
characteristics they're really really
fast<00:02:28.480> wearing<00:02:29.020> gnarly<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.890> plush<00:02:30.460> wheel<00:02:30.760> like<00:02:31.240> a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
fast wearing gnarly a plush wheel like a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.800 
fast wearing gnarly a plush wheel like a
firewall<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.870> send<00:02:32.110> oh<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:33.510> know<00:02:34.510> kind<00:02:34.780> of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
firewall and send oh but I know kind of

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.110 
firewall and send oh but I know kind of
dense<00:02:37.980> they<00:02:38.980> call<00:02:39.250> them<00:02:39.400> really<00:02:39.640> really<00:02:39.670> easy

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
dense they call them really really easy

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.930 
dense they call them really really easy
which<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:41.410> major<00:02:41.980> downside<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> wheel

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
which is a major downside of the wheel

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.970 
which is a major downside of the wheel
and<00:02:43.420> see<00:02:43.660> that's<00:02:43.950> combed<00:02:44.950> versus<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:47.290> which

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
and see that's combed versus that which

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.230 
and see that's combed versus that which
is<00:02:48.130> not

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.830 

I<00:02:51.360> measured<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.320> inside<00:02:52.620> lip<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.360> 83

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
I measured the inside lip and of the 83

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.070 
I measured the inside lip and of the 83
A's<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.640> one<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.790> them<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:56.940> 65<00:02:57.510> millimeters

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080
