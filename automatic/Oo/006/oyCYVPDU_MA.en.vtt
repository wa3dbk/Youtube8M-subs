00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
obvious what they are but what role they

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
obvious what they are but what role they
perform<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.140> first<00:00:40.350> things

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.780 
perform and and so on the first things
first<00:00:40.650> is<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.280> quest<00:00:41.580> in<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
first is that this quest in the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.580 
first is that this quest in the
background<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.629> advanced<00:00:42.930> quest<00:00:43.320> and

the points I am making within this video

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.719 
the points I am making within this video
because<00:00:51.750> ivory<00:00:52.320> likey<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
because ivory likey is one of the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.640 
because ivory likey is one of the
creatures<00:00:54.210> within<00:00:54.479> this<00:00:54.629> game<00:00:54.839> that<00:00:55.110> will<00:00:55.320> rip

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
creatures within this game that will rip

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.859 
creatures within this game that will rip
the<00:00:55.860> shit<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.339> you<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.059> less<00:00:57.390> him<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
the shit out of you if you less him and

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.410 
the shit out of you if you less him and
you<00:00:58.739> also<00:00:58.949> need<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.250> pay<00:00:59.549> attention<00:00:59.790> to<00:01:00.030> what

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you also need to pay attention to what

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.020 
you also need to pay attention to what
they<00:01:00.930> are<00:01:00.960> doing<00:01:01.110> at<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.010> times<00:01:02.159> because<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
they are doing at all times because I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.329 
they are doing at all times because I
rely<00:01:03.510> expression<00:01:04.260> especially<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.890> rage<00:01:05.100> mode

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
rely expression especially in rage mode

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.250 
rely expression especially in rage mode
is<00:01:05.549> very<00:01:05.970> quick<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:07.500> also<00:01:07.650> teaches<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.250> about

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
is very quick it also teaches you about

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.300 
is very quick it also teaches you about
positioning<00:01:10.260> predominantly<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.220> were

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
positioning predominantly if you were

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.429 
positioning predominantly if you were
gonna<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.909> also<00:01:12.030> helps<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.990> you're<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> blade

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
gonna it also helps if you're a blade

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.870 
gonna it also helps if you're a blade
master<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:13.920> well<00:01:13.979> because<00:01:14.369> there's<00:01:14.549> several

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
AOE you know lightning attacks but more

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
game I believe something that's that's

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.620 
game I believe something that's that's
why<00:01:28.410> I<00:01:28.440> picked<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.830> background<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.270> fast

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
why I picked this background so fast

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.600 
why I picked this background so fast
what<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:30.960> gun<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.470> gunning<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.860> using<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.400> form

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
what is gun and gunning is using a form

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.640 
what is gun and gunning is using a form
of<00:01:32.760> gun<00:01:33.030> you'll<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.780> using<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.200> weapon<00:01:34.530> at

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of gun you'll be using the weapon at

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.880 
of gun you'll be using the weapon at
range<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.970> love<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.930> love<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.620> much

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
range and I love it I love it so much

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.040 
range and I love it I love it so much
now<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.370> reason<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.850> love<00:01:39.060> gunning<00:01:39.480> is<00:01:39.720> it's

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
now the reason I love gunning is it's

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.750 
now the reason I love gunning is it's
probably<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.620> downside<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.400> gunning<00:01:41.730> for

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
probably the downside to gunning for

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.670 
probably the downside to gunning for
many<00:01:42.060> people<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.810> fact<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.260> can<00:01:43.409> die<00:01:43.620> at

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
many people the fact that you can die at

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.990 
many people the fact that you can die at
any<00:01:43.860> point<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.540> amazing<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.170> so

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
any point is amazing like it's so

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.050 
any point is amazing like it's so
ridiculously<00:01:48.000> fun<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:49.230> it<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:50.550> makes<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
ridiculously fun that it just makes it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.690 
ridiculously fun that it just makes it
work<00:01:51.540> now<00:01:52.080> I<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.830> into<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.460> class

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
work now I don't go into the class

the complete opposite instead because

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.070 
the complete opposite instead because
you<00:01:58.560> are<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.490> die<00:01:59.670> seemingly<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.510> most

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
you are you can die seemingly to most

so<00:02:49.020> Maggie<00:02:49.350> was<00:02:49.650> looking<00:02:49.950> at<00:02:50.010> me<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.280> was

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
so Maggie was looking at me so I was

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.770 
so Maggie was looking at me so I was
like<00:02:50.490> okay<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.760> don't<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.330> because<00:02:51.690> you

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
like okay I don't like this because you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.600 
like okay I don't like this because you
can<00:02:51.930> immediately<00:02:52.110> charge<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.370> roll<00:02:53.580> out

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
can immediately charge it so I roll out

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.160 
can immediately charge it so I roll out
the<00:02:53.760> way<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.570> see<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:54.960> I'm

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
the way as you can see in this I'm

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.030 
the way as you can see in this I'm
always<00:02:55.320> at<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> slight<00:02:56.190> 30<00:02:56.970> or<00:02:57.510> 45<00:02:58.350> degree

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
always at like a slight 30 or 45 degree

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.980 
always at like a slight 30 or 45 degree
angle<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.580> front<00:02:59.610> of<00:03:00.120> lagging<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:00.690> because

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
angle in front of lagging just because

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.350 
angle in front of lagging just because
it's<00:03:01.140> how<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.560> works<00:03:01.880> because<00:03:02.880> II<00:03:03.150> can't

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
it's how it works because II can't

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.060 
it's how it works because II can't
really<00:03:03.540> do<00:03:03.660> much<00:03:03.690> if<00:03:04.020> he<00:03:04.110> turns<00:03:04.320> once<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.860> face

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
really do much if he turns once to face

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.380 
really do much if he turns once to face
me<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.490> roll<00:03:05.700> out<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> way

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
me I can roll out of the way

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.000 
me I can roll out of the way
if<00:03:06.480> he<00:03:06.690> doesn't<00:03:06.870> lightening<00:03:07.380> charge<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.860> could

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
if he doesn't lightening charge I could

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.440 
if he doesn't lightening charge I could
I<00:03:08.100> should<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.610> able<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.790> go<00:03:08.940> out<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.120> way<00:03:09.300> if

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
I should be able to go out of the way if

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.820 
I should be able to go out of the way if
he<00:03:09.540> does<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.780> lightening<00:03:10.140> ball<00:03:10.290> attack<00:03:10.620> he's

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
he does the lightening ball attack he's

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.750 
he does the lightening ball attack he's
not<00:03:10.980> going<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.190> hit<00:03:11.370> me

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
not going to hit me

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.420 
not going to hit me
so<00:03:12.090> I'm<00:03:12.150> trying<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.650> eliminate<00:03:13.650> as<00:03:14.130> many

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
so I'm trying to eliminate as many

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.520 
so I'm trying to eliminate as many
possibilities<00:03:15.240> of<00:03:15.360> attacks<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:16.140> hit<00:03:16.350> me

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
possibilities of attacks that can hit me

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.460 
possibilities of attacks that can hit me
is<00:03:16.770> humanly<00:03:17.250> possible<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:17.910> my<00:03:18.570> like<00:03:19.170> folk

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
is humanly possible and my like folk

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.740 
is humanly possible and my like folk
running<00:03:19.830> friend<00:03:20.160> Mota<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.760> he's<00:03:21.300> also<00:03:21.450> doing

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
of a couple reasons the first as I said

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.820 
of a couple reasons the first as I said
is<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.280> armor<00:03:50.580> value<00:03:51.020> so<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.080> screwed<00:03:52.500> right

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
is the armor value so you screwed right

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.950 
is the armor value so you screwed right
here<00:03:53.400> you're<00:03:53.940> pretty<00:03:54.090> much<00:03:54.330> done<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.630> mean<00:03:54.810> you

here you're pretty much done I mean you

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.420 
here you're pretty much done I mean you
can<00:03:55.110> take<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> couple<00:03:55.590> hits<00:03:55.890> every<00:03:56.160> now<00:03:56.280> and

a wyvern semane hit it's just not gonna
happen

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
happen

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.670

right<00:04:02.430> if<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.510> every<00:04:03.720> lag<00:04:03.900> he<00:04:04.050> hit<00:04:04.260> me<00:04:04.410> with<00:04:04.440> his

attack<00:04:06.990> I'd<00:04:07.230> be<00:04:07.380> taken<00:04:07.770> down<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.190> half<00:04:08.520> elf

attack I'd be taken down to the half elf

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.000

this<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.390> with<00:04:09.540> positive<00:04:10.230> resistance<00:04:10.830> to

this is with positive resistance to

this is with positive resistance to
lightning<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:12.030> if<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.240> was<00:04:12.390> negative<00:04:12.870> I'd<00:04:13.140> be

they're going to damage so what appears
you<00:05:00.810> should<00:05:00.990> be<00:05:01.110> about<00:05:01.319> maybe<00:05:01.650> four<00:05:02.660> four

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
you should be about maybe four four
