first impressions first it serves as a
body<00:02:44.780> blocker

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
body blocker

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.620

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.690 
so I'm actually blocking my torso from
your<00:02:47.810> torso<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.410> our<00:02:48.770> brains<00:02:49.130> like<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.550> feel

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
like we have an open connection between

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.300 
like we have an open connection between
the<00:02:51.380> person<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.770> we're<00:02:51.860> speaking<00:02:52.040> with<00:02:52.280> our

the person that we're speaking with our
torso<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:52.940> torso<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:53.900> doing<00:02:54.170> this<00:02:54.290> essentially

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
torso to torso so doing this essentially

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.460 
torso to torso so doing this essentially
blocks<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.460> connection<00:02:55.990> second<00:02:56.990> it<00:02:57.200> makes

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
blocks that connection second it makes

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.230 
blocks that connection second it makes
you<00:02:57.710> look<00:02:57.920> nervous<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.700> like<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.030> don't

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240

credibility so the way you get that

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.250 
credibility so the way you get that
credibility<00:04:09.980> back<00:04:10.160> is<00:04:10.490> you<00:04:10.610> combine<00:04:11.260> warmth

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
credibility back is you combine warmth

and intelligence and intelligence is

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.479 
and intelligence and intelligence is
that<00:04:14.720> an<00:04:14.930> authoritative<00:04:15.650> voice<00:04:15.980> tone<00:04:16.280> where
