already<00:02:48.120> did<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> couple<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.960> them<00:02:49.110> first<00:02:49.800> we've

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
already did a couple of them first we've

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.110 
already did a couple of them first we've
installed<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.030> 1.02<00:02:51.630> retail<00:02:52.170> patch<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:53.120> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
installed the 1.02 retail patch and the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.640 
installed the 1.02 retail patch and the
second<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.080> we<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.620> our<00:02:55.980> own<00:02:56.280> ff7

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
second is that we have our own ff7

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.470 
second is that we have our own ff7

patch<00:03:04.730> but<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.820> other<00:03:05.970> thing<00:03:06.240> you'll<00:03:06.420> need<00:03:06.600> to

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
patch but the other thing you'll need to

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.480 
patch but the other thing you'll need to
do<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.940> have<00:03:08.960> save<00:03:09.960> files<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.980> way<00:03:11.130> that

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
do is have save files and the way that

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.260 
do is have save files and the way that
your<00:03:11.960> your<00:03:12.960> game<00:03:13.260> folder<00:03:15.080> initiates<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:17.270> save

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
your your game folder initiates a save

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.680 
your your game folder initiates a save
file<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.930> by<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.720> playing<00:03:22.170> through<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:24.660> game

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
file is by you playing through the game

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.070 
file is by you playing through the game
up<00:03:25.170> until<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.710> first<00:03:25.860> save<00:03:26.190> point<00:03:26.570> so<00:03:27.570> all<00:03:27.960> you

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
up until the first save point so all you

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.870 
up until the first save point so all you
have<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.260> do<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.830> play<00:03:29.130> through<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.580> reactor

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
have to do is play through the reactor

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.490 
have to do is play through the reactor
until<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.480> get<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> very<00:03:31.050> first<00:03:31.290> save

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
until you get to the very first save

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.340 
until you get to the very first save
point<00:03:31.830> save<00:03:32.460> your<00:03:32.700> game<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.240> a<00:03:33.540> both<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.110> save

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
point save your game and a both a save

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.630 
point save your game and a both a save
folder<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.920> save<00:03:35.160> file<00:03:35.430> will<00:03:36.150> be<00:03:36.180> created

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
folder and a save file will be created

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.830 
folder and a save file will be created
once<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:39.000> have<00:03:39.210> that<00:03:39.450> save<00:03:40.200> folder<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:42.630> want

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
once you have that save folder you want

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.890 
once you have that save folder you want
to<00:03:42.990> make<00:03:43.140> copies<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.590> your<00:03:43.860> save<00:03:44.130> files<00:03:44.430> and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
to make copies of your save files and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.010 
to make copies of your save files and
simply<00:03:45.900> rename<00:03:46.290> them<00:03:46.850> up<00:03:47.850> until<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.510> get<00:03:48.720> to

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
simply rename them up until you get to

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.070 
simply rename them up until you get to
save<00:03:49.590> file<00:03:49.950> number<00:03:50.310> 9<00:03:50.520> so<00:03:50.880> from<00:03:51.270> save<00:03:51.480> file<00:03:51.720> 0

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
save file number 9 so from save file 0

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.180 
save file number 9 so from save file 0
to<00:03:52.830> save<00:03:53.040> file<00:03:53.250> number<00:03:53.550> 9<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.710> in<00:03:55.710> doing<00:03:56.040> so

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
to save file number 9 and in doing so

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.960 
to save file number 9 and in doing so
you<00:03:56.430> will<00:03:56.700> meet<00:03:57.090> all<00:03:57.270> three<00:03:57.600> requirements<00:03:57.810> for

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
you will meet all three requirements for

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
you will meet all three requirements for
Ali's<00:03:59.970> custom<00:04:00.690> graphic<00:04:01.110> driver<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:03.450> once<00:04:03.750> you

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
Ali's custom graphic driver so once you

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:14.570 
Ali's custom graphic driver so once you
do<00:04:05.210> download<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.720> driver

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.880 

and<00:04:15.959> as<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.200> see<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.800> appears<00:04:18.220> in<00:04:18.430> the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
and as you see it appears in the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.760 
and as you see it appears in the
download<00:04:20.890> file<00:04:21.130> folder<00:04:21.820> as<00:04:22.350> ff7<00:04:23.350> OpenGL<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:26.350> we

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
download file folder as ff7 OpenGL so we

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.840 
download file folder as ff7 OpenGL so we
will<00:04:26.950> extract<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:28.980> make<00:04:29.980> sure<00:04:30.160> you<00:04:30.280> extract<00:04:30.700> it

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
will extract it make sure you extract it

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.820 
will extract it make sure you extract it
to<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:31.000> folder<00:04:31.090> because<00:04:31.840> there<00:04:32.530> are<00:04:32.620> numerous

playthrough before I deleted it for the
purpose<00:05:05.200> of<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.440> tutorials<00:05:06.660> so<00:05:07.660> that's<00:05:07.870> what

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080

first<00:05:48.889> of<00:05:49.100> which<00:05:49.250> is<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:50.650> run<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.979> ff7<00:05:52.639> config

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
first of which is to run the ff7 config

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.100 
first of which is to run the ff7 config
application<00:05:53.900> and<00:05:54.880> as<00:05:55.880> you<00:05:56.090> can<00:05:56.240> see<00:05:56.449> it<00:05:56.780> shows

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
application and as you can see it shows

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.550 
application and as you can see it shows
you<00:05:57.320> which<00:05:57.530> drivers<00:05:58.160> are<00:05:58.400> in<00:05:58.490> use<00:05:58.760> and<00:05:59.560> the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
you which drivers are in use and the

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.980 
you which drivers are in use and the
status<00:06:00.949> of<00:06:01.100> them<00:06:01.310> and<00:06:01.550> when<00:06:02.540> you<00:06:02.690> select

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
status of them and when you select

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.170 
status of them and when you select
graphics<00:06:03.889> you<00:06:04.130> should<00:06:04.370> get<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.550> self<00:06:05.060> test<00:06:05.330> pass

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
graphics you should get a self test pass

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.680 
graphics you should get a self test pass
after<00:06:08.229> you<00:06:09.229> switch<00:06:09.680> your<00:06:10.370> render<00:06:10.850> to<00:06:11.180> custom

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
after you switch your render to custom

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.920 
after you switch your render to custom
driver<00:06:13.000> and<00:06:15.130> this<00:06:16.130> custom<00:06:16.639> driver<00:06:16.940> is<00:06:17.300> Ally's

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
driver and this custom driver is Ally's

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.529 
driver and this custom driver is Ally's
custom<00:06:18.380> driver<00:06:18.560> and<00:06:18.940> this<00:06:19.940> is<00:06:20.120> what<00:06:20.360> will

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
custom driver and this is what will

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.409 
custom driver and this is what will
allow<00:06:20.720> the<00:06:20.900> graphical<00:06:21.740> enhancements<00:06:21.979> to<00:06:22.940> take

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
allow the graphical enhancements to take

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.620 
allow the graphical enhancements to take
effect<00:06:24.490> so<00:06:25.490> like<00:06:25.789> I<00:06:25.910> said<00:06:25.970> once<00:06:26.300> you<00:06:26.419> switch

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
effect so like I said once you switch

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.629 
effect so like I said once you switch
over<00:06:26.840> to<00:06:26.990> it<00:06:27.229> you<00:06:27.470> should<00:06:27.680> get<00:06:27.830> a<00:06:28.039> self-tan

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
over to it you should get a self-tan

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.969 
over to it you should get a self-tan
itself<00:06:29.539> pass<00:06:29.750> and<00:06:30.880> you<00:06:31.880> click<00:06:32.060> OK<00:06:32.889> now<00:06:33.889> the

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
itself pass and you click OK now the

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.070 
itself pass and you click OK now the
second<00:06:34.460> thing<00:06:34.639> is<00:06:34.880> we're<00:06:35.180> going<00:06:35.330> to<00:06:35.449> open<00:06:35.539> the

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
second thing is we're going to open the

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:43.719 
second thing is we're going to open the
ff7<00:06:36.889> OpenGL<00:06:38.590> dot<00:06:39.590> CFG<00:06:40.160> file<00:06:40.460> and<00:06:42.490> this<00:06:43.490> will

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
ff7 OpenGL dot CFG file and this will

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.589 
ff7 OpenGL dot CFG file and this will
allow<00:06:43.910> you<00:06:43.970> to<00:06:44.120> make<00:06:44.419> some<00:06:44.630> edits<00:06:45.910> such<00:06:46.910> as<00:06:47.150> the

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 
allow you to make some edits such as the

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.950 
allow you to make some edits such as the
window<00:06:47.960> size<00:06:48.229> and<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:49.130> screen<00:06:49.430> aspect<00:06:49.930> so<00:06:50.930> we

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
window size and the screen aspect so we

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.159 
window size and the screen aspect so we
want<00:06:51.289> to<00:06:51.470> change<00:06:51.800> this<00:06:52.150> I'll<00:06:53.150> do<00:06:53.599> window<00:06:53.930> size

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
want to change this I'll do window size

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.690 
want to change this I'll do window size
1280<00:06:54.770> and<00:06:56.110> the<00:06:57.110> y-coordinate<00:06:57.860> will<00:06:58.010> be<00:06:58.130> 800

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
1280 and the y-coordinate will be 800

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.100 
1280 and the y-coordinate will be 800
and<00:06:58.870> I<00:06:59.870> want<00:07:00.139> to<00:07:00.260> change<00:07:00.560> it<00:07:00.710> from<00:07:00.860> full-screen

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
and I want to change it from full-screen

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.890 
and I want to change it from full-screen
once<00:07:03.110> you're<00:07:03.289> done<00:07:03.440> with<00:07:03.620> that<00:07:04.570> it'll<00:07:05.570> ask<00:07:05.720> you

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
once you're done with that it'll ask you

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.570 
once you're done with that it'll ask you
if<00:07:05.960> you<00:07:06.080> want<00:07:06.260> to<00:07:06.380> save<00:07:06.590> it<00:07:06.620> and<00:07:06.889> again<00:07:07.190> this<00:07:07.370> is

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
if you want to save it and again this is

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.040 
if you want to save it and again this is
why<00:07:07.729> it's<00:07:07.760> important<00:07:08.389> to<00:07:08.630> have<00:07:08.840> the

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
why it's important to have the

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.510 
why it's important to have the
notification<00:07:10.510> process<00:07:11.979> to<00:07:12.979> a<00:07:13.010> minimum

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
notification process to a minimum

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.550 
notification process to a minimum
because<00:07:14.090> otherwise<00:07:14.360> this<00:07:14.810> will<00:07:15.020> be<00:07:15.199> hindered

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
because otherwise this will be hindered

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.040 
because otherwise this will be hindered
and<00:07:15.710> you<00:07:15.830> will<00:07:15.979> not<00:07:16.099> be<00:07:16.280> able<00:07:16.400> to<00:07:16.520> save<00:07:16.789> it

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
and you will not be able to save it

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:25.420 
and you will not be able to save it
so<00:07:18.050> we<00:07:18.169> now<00:07:18.320> save<00:07:18.620> it<00:07:19.030> and<00:07:23.289> Ally's<00:07:24.430> custom

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
so we now save it and Ally's custom

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.689 
so we now save it and Ally's custom
graphic<00:07:26.300> drivers<00:07:26.750> should<00:07:27.110> be<00:07:28.070> ready<00:07:28.370> to<00:07:28.460> work

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:28.699 
graphic drivers should be ready to work

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.480 
graphic drivers should be ready to work
