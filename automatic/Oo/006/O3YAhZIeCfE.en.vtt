00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 There we are, I'm here today. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.250
 People can make a light pudding I 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.050
 I've never made bread pudding is a recipe 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.830
 I got it because I did it. 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.740
 panettone and chocotone at the end of the year 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:22.550
 lots of plates so look I'm in the mood for 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:27.060
 So we 'll use it here. 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 350 ml of egg whites is reminding 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.420
 The mixer has to be very dry not 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:40.110
 can have no moisture at all and no water 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:43.770
 there to beat 350 and averages of clearings 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.020
 along with about 20 tablespoons of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.510
 sugar is showing step by step 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.579
 while the other one because I'm going to give it to you 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.670
 will make the fame caramel and I will use 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.309
 two cups of sugar to a cup of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.070
 water then show you now what 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.590
 the point is good, it's okay, we pass. 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.080
 to fame and leave a bar deck 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.439
 I wondered if I extended the symbol of that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.409
 crazy to speed up the process I already 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.689
 I put it on the blocks to hit it. 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 so here it is only clear 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.490
 Let's leave the batteries to stay. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.030
 more firm in mine and in that time I 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:26.220
 I'll start, I 'll start doing the na 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.400
 then use this car 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.380
 here I'll only use two cups 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.250
 from here to sugar for a cup of 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.020
 Water 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.600
 I'll do the house later, I'll show her. 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.600
 ready for you 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 ready 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.310
 mouth 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.310
 we grab you 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.430
 so here we put 20 tablespoons of 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:36.379
 now bear in our house as she 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:39.500
 it's our alda she 's almost ready 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.720
 A little more, she'll be at the 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.760
 point should show you the cause already 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:50.269
 It's ready now I'll kiss you beyond 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:53.569
 way we were almost training in the 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.840
 truth is very golden now 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:11.150
 people will spread well beyond 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:14.620
 Your not going to stop being fussy 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.620
 keep stirring keep stirring 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:30.460
 It's hot, I'm going to wait for one. 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.919
 we'll just put the sigh now 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.740
 here I think it will not work very well right? 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:41.169
 and like I've never done before 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:44.039
 I have a bit of fear in investing 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.039
 one more body 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.849
 now it 's hoped faith is expected 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:05:00.430
 get ready and let it cool more 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:05:03.550
 or less arm like that - now we 're going 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.370
 put inside the flona 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:20.020
 she debuted well it's not too hot 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:41.800
 yet we will see what will give it to 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:43.750
 gently walk from here now and let's go 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.289
 take the sheet I'll leave it in the oven 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.569
 or so until golden're hence the 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.759
 body we see the final step of this 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.909
 light pudding that I do not know if it will 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.460
 give something to cheer for this 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:06:03.550
 I'll show you the pope still. 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:07.360
 Hot, we look at the size of the pudding. 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.250
 Of course I'm going to hang up and now I'm going 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.169
 let it cool a little bit for me 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.719
 to be able to report what he said or have no 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.330
 How am I going to report this? 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:18.370
 clear white pudding that will not 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:26.139
 I think they see the dose and we're going 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:26.870
 There, people, I'm going to try to inform 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.570
 monster 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.120
 This could be I'm going to try to turn him 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.520
 here in this deal as I am alone 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.490
 now there's nobody to help then a goal 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.520
 show step by step 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:45.770
 people I managed to turn I could go alone 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:47.510
 I can not believe I did it and people look at it. 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.810
 how beautiful 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:53.920
 I'm afraid of him dismounting now looks 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:56.720
 the monster size of egg whites 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.320
 ours loved the way it stayed for 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.720
 was still inside the 3rd 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:07.340
 Of course I 'm going to throw on him people. 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.190
 She was beautiful too pleased as ever 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.430

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:16.040
 it's cool to something important is 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.570
 You take him out in a shower. 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:22.310
 after you take him to roast in 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:25.190
 bath-maria then you leave until golden 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:28.490
 he grows up, he grows up a lot 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:31.130
 people are beautiful 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:36.740
 I'll show you later he'll cut it 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:42.700
 because the people now go in the worst part 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.700
