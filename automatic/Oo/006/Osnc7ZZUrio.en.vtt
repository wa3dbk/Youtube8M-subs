curious to see where they're gonna go
from<00:04:04.470> here<00:04:04.650> especially<00:04:05.490> since<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.630> is

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
from here especially since this is

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.310 
from here especially since this is
actually<00:04:07.260> an<00:04:07.320> episode<00:04:07.770> 0<00:04:08.460> that's<00:04:09.390> what<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.900> am

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320

actually an episode 0 that's what I am
very<00:04:10.470> curious<00:04:10.800> about<00:04:11.780> what<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:12.990> think<00:04:13.530> is

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
very curious about what I do think is

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.420 
very curious about what I do think is
probably<00:04:14.400> going<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.060> happen<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:16.080> i<00:04:16.430> honestly

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
probably going to happen is i honestly

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.420 
probably going to happen is i honestly
think<00:04:17.730> we're<00:04:17.970> probably<00:04:18.210> going<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.810> go<00:04:19.440> back<00:04:20.400> a

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
think we're probably going to go back a

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.770 
think we're probably going to go back a
bit<00:04:20.730> in<00:04:21.540> all<00:04:22.020> honesty<00:04:22.590> because

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
bit in all honesty because

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.890 
bit in all honesty because
we<00:04:24.260> already<00:04:24.470> got<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:25.040> point<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:25.520> where<00:04:25.910> and

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
we already got it a point to where and

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.360 
we already got it a point to where and
this<00:04:27.080> was<00:04:27.230> actually<00:04:27.410> something<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:28.010> needed<00:04:28.220> to

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
this was actually something I needed to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.970 
this was actually something I needed to
talk<00:04:28.490> about<00:04:28.730> real<00:04:28.880> quick<00:04:29.470> while<00:04:30.470> watching

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
talk about real quick while watching

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.300 
talk about real quick while watching
this<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.430> honestly<00:04:32.060> could<00:04:32.960> not<00:04:32.990> help<00:04:33.530> but<00:04:33.680> feel

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
this I honestly could not help but feel

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.510 
this I honestly could not help but feel
that<00:04:34.669> there<00:04:35.450> was<00:04:35.480> just<00:04:35.750> like<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:35.930> big<00:04:36.710> chunk<00:04:37.400> of

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
that there was just like a big chunk of

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.550 
that there was just like a big chunk of
information<00:04:38.240> missing<00:04:38.870> that's<00:04:39.320> just<00:04:39.470> how<00:04:39.530> I

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
information missing that's just how I

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.430 
information missing that's just how I
honestly<00:04:39.980> felt<00:04:40.190> about<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.550> just<00:04:40.820> felt<00:04:41.150> like

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
honestly felt about it just felt like

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.110 
honestly felt about it just felt like
there's<00:04:42.440> so<00:04:42.650> much<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:42.889> had<00:04:43.250> gone<00:04:43.580> on<00:04:43.639> in<00:04:43.880> the

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
there's so much that had gone on in the

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.030 
there's so much that had gone on in the
past<00:04:44.150> before<00:04:44.630> reaching<00:04:44.990> this<00:04:45.230> point<00:04:45.350> and

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
past before reaching this point and

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.190 
past before reaching this point and
that's<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.120> reason<00:04:47.300> why<00:04:47.510> i<00:04:47.540> think<00:04:47.720> that<00:04:47.960> the

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
that's a reason why i think that the

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.330 
that's a reason why i think that the
next<00:04:48.410> episode<00:04:48.740> we're<00:04:48.860> actually<00:04:49.010> gonna<00:04:49.220> go

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
next episode we're actually gonna go

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.510 
next episode we're actually gonna go
back<00:04:49.940> a<00:04:50.300> long<00:04:50.660> way<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.889> know<00:04:51.980> probably<00:04:52.250> to

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
back a long way you know probably to

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.390 
back a long way you know probably to
where<00:04:52.840> he<00:04:53.840> first<00:04:54.050> meets<00:04:54.350> these<00:04:54.620> characters<00:04:55.190> or

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
where he first meets these characters or

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.280 
where he first meets these characters or
something<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.910> i<00:04:56.030> don't<00:04:56.390> know<00:04:56.480> i<00:04:57.020> mean

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
something that i don't know i mean

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.020 
something that i don't know i mean
that's<00:04:57.500> just<00:04:57.680> what<00:04:57.800> my<00:04:58.160> guess<00:04:58.550> would<00:04:58.700> be<00:04:58.760> is

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
that's just what my guess would be is

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.580 
that's just what my guess would be is
that<00:04:59.060> they<00:04:59.480> he<00:04:59.870> meet<00:05:00.050> them<00:05:00.200> and<00:05:00.320> then<00:05:00.440> they

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
that they he meet them and then they

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.020 
that they he meet them and then they
start<00:05:00.890> working<00:05:01.280> on<00:05:01.400> it<00:05:01.550> or<00:05:01.669> some<00:05:01.820> kind<00:05:02.000> of

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
start working on it or some kind of

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.750 
start working on it or some kind of
introduction<00:05:02.510> into<00:05:03.140> how<00:05:03.890> he<00:05:03.950> got<00:05:04.400> interested

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
introduction into how he got interested

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.340 
introduction into how he got interested

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
for all these other girls developed into

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.490

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
what they are now that's what I

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.260 
what they are now that's what I
obviously<00:05:18.770> think<00:05:18.979> is<00:05:19.100> going<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.310> happen<00:05:19.340> and

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.530 

that<00:05:23.290> you<00:05:24.290> know<00:05:24.410> as<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.740> said<00:05:24.950> it<00:05:25.729> did<00:05:26.000> feel<00:05:26.180> like

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
that you know as I said it did feel like

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.850 
that you know as I said it did feel like
there<00:05:26.720> was<00:05:26.810> a<00:05:26.840> lot<00:05:26.990> of<00:05:27.020> information<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:27.770> I

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
there was a lot of information and I

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.020 
there was a lot of information and I
just<00:05:28.070> couldn't<00:05:28.250> shake<00:05:28.370> that<00:05:28.640> fill<00:05:28.820> in<00:05:28.940> the

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
just couldn't shake that fill in the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.080 
just couldn't shake that fill in the
entire<00:05:29.240> episode<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.960> do<00:05:30.680> like<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.550> normal<00:05:31.760> girl
