00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:11.390
 every time in any case several times the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.160
 topic was when 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.889

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.889
 all forms are medium 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.889
 cumbersome 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.099
 with a poor girl I was going to debut in australia 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.200
 I talk about year 2000 formula 1 does not take me 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.210
 an airplane in Bologna makes a stop in 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.910
 milan and then we went singapore kuala 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.530
 lumpur and then he was leaving 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.170
 I think we ended up in good in 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.350
 melbourne directly 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.379
 and here asleep unfortunately knowing 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.440
 that later I had the connection in 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.949
 milan at 11 in the morning as the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.170
 seven in the morning I took the car and that 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:56.719
 I was living at 300 m3, I was going to the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.280

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:07.300

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:11.010
 some alfa romeo answers 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.910
 at the moment nothing noticed that there is a 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.560
 patrolman that for everything what is the 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.010
 highway traffic 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.390
 I arrive not let me overcome good I thought 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.030
 and that was a weird thing because everyone 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.500
 hindered by the patrolman and josu 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.100

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.980

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.140
 I'm fed up and one with a paper 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.390
 It is not a good paper, it did not waste a 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.760
 plane to do a good test but 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.590
 This class also are giving here 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.600

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.490

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.860

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.950
 catalina as well says it 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.480
 the saying for questions that looked at the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.000
 rear-view mirror and another patrol car comes 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.289
 10,000 block and there everything and they make me 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.539
 sanguchito with the patrolman who was 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.780
 there forward lets let everyone go 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.630
 the other cars stop me from surrounding me 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.580
 ask for a ballot, it is clear that you are 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.440
 reading coming to 200 kilometers per hour 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.980
 we can not reach you calm sweat 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.980
 of the nerves 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.910
 does not debut in formula one on you 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:37.540
 is prisoner came by italy ten thousand per 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:39.550
 time and they take something good everything ends 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.670
 showing the documentation shows 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.680
 the click of the equipment of our 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.910
 the actual passage that he had to travel to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.160
 australia of a series of things so that 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.200
 me so that they believed me and ultimately 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.790
 because I was doing I was doing and 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.040
 obviously it was not an excuse but what 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.010
 I needed to do good police in Italy 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.780
 they were disrespectfully wrong the terms 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.420
 convincing and I tell you guys look 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.020
 that we arrived at ten thirty that 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.430
 I had the grandfather this one they hang me but 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.080
 for this I have to travel at least 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.700
 200 meters did not come back to us 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.420
 the hour was with me 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.400
 but I take the police me in my car and 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.230
 them with obviously with the patrol car to 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.390
 that speed yes because I was going 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.849
 obviously if they were not going to stop me 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.709
 police from the next town's next or 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.080
 of the city although let's say that I 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.080
 put on the handcuffs that discounted me 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.269
 escorted that's why later it served me 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.220
 that they have 34 passes for the 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.900
 imola race because it was in modena 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.560
 he passes it and I also got him the police 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.560
 he was in contact 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.630
 you are not imagining him at the time 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.500
 vinegar face and the face of room and the 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.500
 face of the sponsor
