00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
really going to focus on the crease

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.690 
really going to focus on the crease
today<00:01:54.590> then<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:55.709> buffing<00:01:56.069> that<00:01:56.220> out<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.670> a

today then I'm buffing that out with a

clean e-40 brush by Sigma I want to make

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.930 
clean e-40 brush by Sigma I want to make
sure<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.660> any<00:02:00.899> harsh<00:02:01.289> lines<00:02:01.940> just

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
sure I don't have any harsh lines just

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.460 
sure I don't have any harsh lines just
because<00:02:03.149> sometimes<00:02:03.539> it<00:02:03.690> does<00:02:03.869> stick<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
condemned to the eye primer then I'm

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.529 
condemned to the eye primer then I'm
taking<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.920> little<00:02:08.069> bit<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.670> shimmery

two<00:02:12.300> thirds<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.290> eye<00:02:13.319> I'm<00:02:14.280> also<00:02:14.610> going<00:02:15.000> to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
two thirds of the eye I'm also going to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.420 
two thirds of the eye I'm also going to
be<00:02:15.450> applying<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.230> on<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.650> inner<00:02:16.860> corners<00:02:17.400> of

and this will help open my eyes and make

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.160 
and this will help open my eyes and make
them<00:02:25.920> appear<00:02:26.340> brighter<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.239> whiter

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.410 

then<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.470> back<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.829> with<00:02:32.860> my<00:02:33.220> cleany<00:02:33.610> 42

then going back in with my cleany 42

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.149 
then going back in with my cleany 42
buff<00:02:34.689> everything<00:02:35.170> out<00:02:35.379> you'll<00:02:35.650> see<00:02:35.709> me<00:02:35.980> doing

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
buff everything out you'll see me doing

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.100 
buff everything out you'll see me doing
this<00:02:36.370> quite<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.360> bit<00:02:37.569> throughout<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.959> video

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
this quite a bit throughout the video

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.589 
this quite a bit throughout the video
and<00:02:38.530> then<00:02:38.980> again<00:02:39.250> going<00:02:39.549> in<00:02:39.730> with<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.360> little

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
and then again going in with a little

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.170 
and then again going in with a little
bit<00:02:40.720> more<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.409> crease<00:02:41.769> color<00:02:42.129> to<00:02:42.519> darken

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
bit more of that crease color to darken

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.200 
bit more of that crease color to darken
up<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.420> crease

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.000 

then<00:02:48.210> I'm<00:02:48.360> taking<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:49.080> matte<00:02:49.410> cream<00:02:49.740> color

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
then I'm taking this matte cream color

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.440 
then I'm taking this matte cream color
and<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.370> using<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.760> as<00:02:50.880> my<00:02:51.150> brow<00:02:51.390> bone

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
and I'm using it as my brow bone

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.440 
and I'm using it as my brow bone
highlight<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.590> I'm<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.860> using<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.240> think

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
highlight so I'm just using a I think

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.870 
highlight so I'm just using a I think
this<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.750> sigma<00:02:55.080> e55<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:56.220> I'm<00:02:56.310> patting<00:02:56.610> it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
this is a sigma e55 and I'm patting it

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.750 
this is a sigma e55 and I'm patting it
along<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> brow<00:02:57.510> bone<00:02:57.540> area<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:59.190> like<00:02:59.460> this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
along the brow bone area I like this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.430 
along the brow bone area I like this
color<00:03:00.030> because<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.480> pretty<00:03:00.690> opaque<00:03:01.140> it

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
color because it's pretty opaque it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.680 
color because it's pretty opaque it
covers<00:03:01.830> up<00:03:02.040> most<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.640> imperfections<00:03:03.540> on

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.920 
right on the outer corner of the eye not
exactly<00:04:02.310> where<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.700> applied<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.239> burgundy<00:04:03.720> but

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
exactly where I applied the burgundy but

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.020 
exactly where I applied the burgundy but
pretty<00:04:04.320> much<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:04.800> at<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.550> very<00:04:05.790> edges

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
pretty much just at the very edges

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.000 
pretty much just at the very edges
because<00:04:06.390> this<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.870> pretty<00:04:07.170> dark<00:04:07.440> color<00:04:07.680> as

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
because this is a pretty dark color as

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.370 
because this is a pretty dark color as
much<00:04:08.220> as<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.459> doesn't<00:04:08.610> show<00:04:08.970> up<00:04:09.180> darker<00:04:10.050> swatch

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
much as it doesn't show up darker swatch

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.170 
much as it doesn't show up darker swatch
dark<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:10.890> your<00:04:11.040> hand<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.610> shows<00:04:11.820> up<00:04:11.970> really

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
dark on your hand it shows up really

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.540

dark<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.750> brush<00:04:13.020> and<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:14.250> will<00:04:14.430> just

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
dark on the brush and this will just

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.000 
dark on the brush and this will just
help<00:04:14.670> add<00:04:15.000> more<00:04:15.570> again<00:04:16.230> more<00:04:16.440> dimension<00:04:16.859> to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010

help add more again more dimension to
the<00:04:17.130> eye<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.700> then<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.150> went<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.390> with<00:04:18.540> my

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720

blending<00:04:19.020> brush<00:04:19.169> again<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.709> blended<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.820> out

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
blending brush again and blended it out

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.850 
blending brush again and blended it out
to<00:04:21.180> make<00:04:21.270> sure<00:04:21.330> that<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.840> wasn't<00:04:22.109> harsh

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
to make sure that it wasn't harsh

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.429 
to make sure that it wasn't harsh
I'm<00:04:25.520> also<00:04:25.879> bringing<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.419> color<00:04:26.659> up<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.169> little

bit into the crease to add a little bit

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.080 
bit into the crease to add a little bit
of<00:04:30.139> smokiness<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:31.009> look<00:04:31.490> so<00:04:31.699> that's<00:04:31.849> kind<00:04:32.060> of

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
of smokiness to look so that's kind of

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.339 
of smokiness to look so that's kind of
what<00:04:32.240> I'm<00:04:32.330> doing<00:04:32.659> you<00:04:32.780> can<00:04:32.930> see<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.259> I'm

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.089 
sometimes I think it opens up to the eye

then<00:05:35.910> draw<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.660> wing<00:05:37.520> into<00:05:38.520> in<00:05:38.670> towards<00:05:39.270> the

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.630 
then draw the wing into in towards the
eye<00:05:39.450> i<00:05:39.810> guess<00:05:40.080> if<00:05:40.290> that<00:05:40.440> makes<00:05:40.680> sense<00:05:40.890> so<00:05:41.520> I'm

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
eye i guess if that makes sense so I'm

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.460 
eye i guess if that makes sense so I'm
not<00:05:41.760> really<00:05:41.820> fast<00:05:42.510> forwarding<00:05:42.960> this<00:05:43.080> I<00:05:43.260> just

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
not really fast forwarding this I just

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.440 
not really fast forwarding this I just
wanted<00:05:43.710> to<00:05:43.800> show<00:05:43.950> it<00:05:43.980> to<00:05:44.100> you<00:05:44.310> in<00:05:44.520> real<00:05:45.120> time

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
wanted to show it to you in real time

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.300 
wanted to show it to you in real time
instead<00:05:45.840> of<00:05:45.900> fast<00:05:46.140> forwarding<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:46.830> eyeliner

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
instead of fast forwarding the eyeliner

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.309 
instead of fast forwarding the eyeliner
application

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.379

a<00:05:59.629> shot<00:06:00.080> of<00:06:00.319> the<00:06:00.439> mascara<00:06:00.889> that<00:06:00.949> i'm<00:06:01.219> using<00:06:01.520> but

a shot of the mascara that i'm using but

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.140 
a shot of the mascara that i'm using but

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
voluminous mascara i think it gives a

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.140 
voluminous mascara i think it gives a
lot<00:06:08.360> of<00:06:08.419> volume<00:06:08.809> to<00:06:09.139> the<00:06:09.169> lashes
