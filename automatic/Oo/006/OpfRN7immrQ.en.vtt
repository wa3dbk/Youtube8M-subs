00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.440
Método Abellán. Cajón flamenco

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.380
Initiation level. Soléa, soleá por bulería, alegrías and bulería

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.600
Applying accents to the cajon

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.420
Going on with bulería

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.600
We are going to apply the rhythmic pattern

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.240
Of the claps to the cajon

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.760
If we first go over the rhytmic pattern

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.640
We get

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.740
If we apply this to the cajon

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.200
We will hit all the hits with the right hand

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.040
Softer ones

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.560
The softer ones we will hit them high, and the accents will hit low

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.040
Resulting in this

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.100
In the next exercise

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.100
We introduce the left hand as a fill

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.660
I mean hitting soft

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.440
Between each hit

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.120
That I already hit with the right hand

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.020
Looking like this

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.780
In the next video

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.600
We will start with left-handed accents

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.480
In bulería
