great when fighting stuff like that

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.650 
great when fighting stuff like that
because<00:02:48.140> ten<00:02:48.410> percent<00:02:48.710> is<00:02:48.860> added<00:02:49.250> before<00:02:49.820> your

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
because ten percent is added before your

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.530 
because ten percent is added before your
the<00:02:50.870> armor<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:52.790> armors<00:02:53.030> calculator<00:02:53.480> on

the armor is for armors calculator on

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.420 
the armor is for armors calculator on
your<00:02:53.660> enemies<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.140> ten<00:02:54.380> percent<00:02:54.680> more<00:02:55.010> for

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
your enemies so ten percent more for

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.030 
your enemies so ten percent more for
armor<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.760> calculated<00:02:56.240> it's<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.660> lot<00:02:56.950> 100<00:02:57.950> feet

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
armor is calculated it's a lot 100 feet

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.830 
armor is calculated it's a lot 100 feet
also<00:02:58.220> adds<00:02:58.520> 100<00:02:58.940> for<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.090> armor<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.420> yourself

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
also adds 100 for the armor to yourself

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.600 
also adds 100 for the armor to yourself
so<00:03:00.080> that<00:03:00.470> combine<00:03:00.860> with<00:03:00.980> clubs<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.460> get

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
so that combine with clubs you get

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.910 
so that combine with clubs you get
pretty<00:03:02.090> good<00:03:02.180> armor<00:03:02.660> pretty<00:03:03.470> good<00:03:03.590> protection

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
pretty good armor pretty good protection

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.740 
pretty good armor pretty good protection
to<00:03:04.190> soften<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.640> blow<00:03:04.820> any<00:03:05.180> enemies<00:03:05.570> might

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
to soften the blow any enemies might

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.410 
to soften the blow any enemies might
make<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.370> fighting<00:03:07.370> Knight<00:03:07.550> armor<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:08.030> really

main reason to get a fairy princess

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.150 
main reason to get a fairy princess
because<00:03:43.520> it<00:03:43.940> bypasses<00:03:44.180> all<00:03:44.780> defense<00:03:45.470> or<00:03:45.740> armor

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
because it bypasses all defense or armor

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.280 
because it bypasses all defense or armor
on<00:03:46.310> your<00:03:46.460> opponent<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.030> mean<00:03:47.990> for<00:03:48.170> other

on your opponent I mean for other

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.140 
on your opponent I mean for other
weapons<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:48.770> can<00:03:48.920> add<00:03:49.100> like<00:03:49.340> specializations

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
weapons you can add like specializations

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.700 
weapons you can add like specializations
that<00:03:50.270> like<00:03:50.540> bypasses<00:03:51.170> certain<00:03:51.470> amount<00:03:51.650> of

armor blah blah blah blah blah but

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.330 
armor blah blah blah blah blah but
that's<00:03:53.570> just<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.810> waste<00:03:53.960> of<00:03:54.140> patch<00:03:54.410> when<00:03:55.220> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
that's just a waste of patch when the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.850 
that's just a waste of patch when the
weapon<00:03:55.670> automatically<00:03:56.300> comes<00:03:56.600> with<00:03:56.900> the

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
ability to bypass defense in armor so

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.140 
ability to bypass defense in armor so
you're<00:04:00.350> fighting<00:04:00.620> someone<00:04:00.860> with<00:04:01.010> like<00:04:01.160> 12,000

damage goes straight to their health so

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.540 
damage goes straight to their health so
that's<00:04:08.540> that's<00:04:08.840> up<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.440> unique<00:04:09.920> capability<00:04:10.520> of

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
that's that's up a unique capability of

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.100 
that's that's up a unique capability of
this<00:04:10.940> weapon<00:04:11.150> because<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:11.480> haven't<00:04:11.660> found<00:04:11.900> any

other weapons that do this because the

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
the ability to bypass defense is just so

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.939 
the ability to bypass defense is just so
healthy<00:04:56.449> for<00:04:58.300> a<00:04:59.300> range<00:04:59.660> weapon<00:05:00.080> we<00:05:00.470> have<00:05:00.710> the

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
healthy for a range weapon we have the

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.100 
healthy for a range weapon we have the
lawn<00:05:01.340> dart<00:05:01.729> which<00:05:02.180> again<00:05:02.479> is<00:05:02.659> not<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:02.960> most

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
lawn dart which again is not the most

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.200 
lawn dart which again is not the most
powerful<00:05:03.500> range<00:05:04.250> weapon<00:05:04.639> in<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.819> game<00:05:04.970> but

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
powerful range weapon in the game but

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.059 
powerful range weapon in the game but
definitely<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.870> most<00:05:06.020> useful<00:05:06.349> as<00:05:06.680> far<00:05:06.949> as

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
definitely the most useful as far as

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.670 
definitely the most useful as far as
again<00:05:07.550> bleeding<00:05:08.240> effect<00:05:08.539> just<00:05:08.930> can't<00:05:09.139> the

again bleeding effect just can't the
booty<00:05:09.889> effect<00:05:10.099> is<00:05:10.250> is<00:05:10.490> going<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:10.940> be<00:05:11.000> extremely

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
booty effect is is going to be extremely

bleeding so if an extra ten percent
damage<00:06:03.319> your<00:06:03.710> bleeding<00:06:04.099> then<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:05.030> more<00:06:05.240> when
