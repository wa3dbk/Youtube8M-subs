this also means that the 3ds a slightly
different<00:00:57.930> effect<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.920> listen<00:00:59.250> them<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.460> you

different effect it listen them are you
might<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.850> used<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> images<00:01:00.510> jumping<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.020> at

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
might be used to images jumping out at

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470 
might be used to images jumping out at
you<00:01:01.199> very<00:01:01.440> occasionally<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.670> has<00:01:02.850> made<00:01:03.300> me

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you very occasionally which has made me

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.929 
you very occasionally which has made me
jump<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> few<00:01:03.960> times<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.409> sure<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
jump a few times to be sure but this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.149 
jump a few times to be sure but this
actually<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.780> depth<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
actually has a depth so what I like to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.760 
actually has a depth so what I like to
call<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.460> TARDIS<00:01:08.820> effect<00:01:09.260> this<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> window

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770

3d camera to record this with and it's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
3d camera to record this with and it's
unlikely<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> 3d<00:01:27.090> monitor<00:01:27.240> at<00:01:27.600> home

guys<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.909> pretty<00:01:30.180> impressive<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.930> very

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
guys it is pretty impressive it's very

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.620 
guys it is pretty impressive it's very
similar<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> Nintendo<00:01:32.700> 3ds<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.509> that's

similar to the Nintendo 3ds and that's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.240 
similar to the Nintendo 3ds and that's
obviously<00:01:33.780> dumped<00:01:34.110> very<00:01:34.320> well<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:35.100> think

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
obviously dumped very well and we think

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.390 
obviously dumped very well and we think
the<00:01:35.640> LG<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.329> very<00:01:36.600> similar<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the LG will do very similar now on the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.910 
the LG will do very similar now on the
