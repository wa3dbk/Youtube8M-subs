00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.720 
of resonance why chanting or singing or
me<00:02:03.900> will<00:02:04.350> make<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> difference<00:02:04.830> because<00:02:05.430> we

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
me will make a difference because we

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.300 
me will make a difference because we
