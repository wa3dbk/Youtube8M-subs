had it done dr. glass says results take
about<00:02:54.500> three<00:02:55.010> months<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.910> what<00:02:56.060> happens<00:02:56.420> is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
about three months and what happens is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.690 
about three months and what happens is
once<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.810> graph<00:02:57.110> takes<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.280> actual

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
once the graph takes that the actual

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.150 
once the graph takes that the actual
hair<00:02:59.030> itself<00:02:59.840> will<00:03:00.050> fall<00:03:00.290> out<00:03:00.320> over<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.980> first

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
hair itself will fall out over the first

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.670 
hair itself will fall out over the first
couple<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.700> weeks<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.720> root<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.500> hair

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
couple of weeks but the root of the hair

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.080 
couple of weeks but the root of the hair
is<00:03:03.860> now<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.220> there<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.489> like<00:03:04.610> planting<00:03:04.880> a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
is now in there it's like planting a

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.150 
is now in there it's like planting a
bulb<00:03:05.330> almost

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
bulb almost

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.460

and<00:03:06.280> he<00:03:06.520> says<00:03:06.790> by<00:03:07.000> six<00:03:07.510> months<00:03:07.960> it's<00:03:08.170> long

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
and he says by six months it's long

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.860 
and he says by six months it's long
enough<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:08.980> blend<00:03:09.160> with<00:03:09.460> other<00:03:09.730> hair<00:03:10.090> NeoGraft

enough to blend with other hair NeoGraft

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.830 
enough to blend with other hair NeoGraft
is<00:03:11.230> not<00:03:11.500> just<00:03:11.860> for<00:03:12.130> men<00:03:12.340> it's<00:03:12.790> for<00:03:13.060> women<00:03:13.300> too

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
is not just for men it's for women too

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.480 
is not just for men it's for women too
and<00:03:14.230> we've<00:03:14.470> actually<00:03:14.620> been<00:03:14.890> even<00:03:15.160> doing

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
and we've actually been even doing

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.700 
and we've actually been even doing
higher<00:03:16.180> transplantations<00:03:17.140> which<00:03:17.350> are<00:03:17.500> great

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
higher transplantations which are great

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.830 
higher transplantations which are great
they<00:03:18.040> work<00:03:18.280> really<00:03:18.520> well<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.090> for<00:03:19.510> people<00:03:19.690> who

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
they work really well and for people who

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.750 
they work really well and for people who
fucked<00:03:20.470> or<00:03:20.740> shave<00:03:20.980> their<00:03:21.190> eyebrows<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.670> they
