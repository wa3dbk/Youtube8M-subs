effects I mean you could go to tools
down<00:02:03.310> there<00:02:03.490> but<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:03.939> little<00:02:04.119> button<00:02:04.330> right

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
down there but this little button right

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.350 
down there but this little button right
here<00:02:04.540> works<00:02:04.840> as<00:02:05.049> well<00:02:05.080> go<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.680> that<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.360> the

right now I I can hear it because when

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:51.750 
right now I I can hear it because when
you<00:02:49.900> play<00:02:50.109> the<00:02:50.230> sound<00:02:50.499> it<00:02:50.829> plays<00:02:51.309> through<00:02:51.579> your

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
you play the sound it plays through your

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.789 
you play the sound it plays through your
speakers<00:02:52.029> as<00:02:52.480> well<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.169> you<00:02:53.260> can<00:02:53.409> hear<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
sound but if i was in game no one would

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.280 
sound but if i was in game no one would
hear<00:02:57.639> that<00:02:57.849> because<00:02:58.059> my<00:02:58.389> default<00:02:58.779> microphone

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
hear that because my default microphone

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.280 
hear that because my default microphone
is<00:02:59.559> my<00:02:59.829> headset<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.639> i'm<00:03:00.760> using<00:03:00.790> right<00:03:01.090> now

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
is my headset that i'm using right now

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.409 
is my headset that i'm using right now
so<00:03:02.290> once<00:03:02.829> again<00:03:02.949> make<00:03:03.279> sure<00:03:03.309> you<00:03:03.999> set<00:03:04.299> this

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
so once again make sure you set this

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.179 
so once again make sure you set this
default<00:03:04.989> if<00:03:05.199> you're<00:03:05.349> going<00:03:05.469> to<00:03:05.590> be<00:03:05.739> using<00:03:05.859> it

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
default if you're going to be using it

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:11.819 
default if you're going to be using it
in<00:03:06.309> game<00:03:07.169> now<00:03:08.849> that's<00:03:09.849> pretty<00:03:10.120> much<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.529> but<00:03:11.529> I

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
in game now that's pretty much it but I

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.649 
in game now that's pretty much it but I
mean<00:03:12.159> it<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.819> takes<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.389> lot<00:03:13.629> of

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
mean it just it takes a lot of

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.009 
mean it just it takes a lot of
memorization<00:03:14.499> of<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:15.519> mean<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.359> can<00:03:16.809> imagine

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
memorization of I mean you can imagine

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.899 
memorization of I mean you can imagine
having<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.949> memorize<00:03:18.069> your<00:03:18.249> entire<00:03:18.669> number

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
having to memorize your entire number

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.580 
having to memorize your entire number
pad<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:20.079> know<00:03:20.169> a<00:03:20.199> couple<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.799> control<00:03:21.609> plus

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
pad you know a couple of control plus

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.250 
pad you know a couple of control plus
you<00:03:23.590> know<00:03:23.680> other<00:03:23.859> keys<00:03:24.249> it<00:03:25.169> gets<00:03:26.169> very

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
you know other keys it gets very

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.409 
you know other keys it gets very
cognitive<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.379> know<00:03:29.529> and<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:30.519> there's<00:03:31.180> also

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
cognitive you know and so there's also

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.689 
cognitive you know and so there's also
you<00:03:31.629> can't<00:03:32.169> you<00:03:32.529> can't<00:03:32.739> stop<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.129> sound<00:03:33.489> once

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
you can't you can't stop a sound once

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.879 
you can't you can't stop a sound once
you've<00:03:33.909> started<00:03:34.659> it<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.199> plays<00:03:35.499> all<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.739> way

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
you've started it it plays all the way

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.329 
you've started it it plays all the way
out<00:03:35.919> so<00:03:36.219> what<00:03:36.339> I<00:03:36.370> did<00:03:36.489> was<00:03:36.699> I<00:03:37.029> just<00:03:37.779> recorded

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:38.339 
out so what I did was I just recorded

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:42.989 
out so what I did was I just recorded
you<00:03:39.339> know<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.489> second<00:03:40.059> of<00:03:40.150> silence<00:03:40.359> and<00:03:41.999> made

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:42.999 
you know a second of silence and made

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.179 
you know a second of silence and made
that<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.540> like<00:03:44.049> this<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.379> is<00:03:44.439> always<00:03:44.859> a<00:03:44.889> key

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
that a like this this is always a key

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.189 
that a like this this is always a key
that's<00:03:45.430> bound<00:03:45.639> right<00:03:45.879> here<00:03:45.999> the<00:03:46.150> silence<00:03:46.989> dot

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
that's bound right here the silence dot

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.439 
that's bound right here the silence dot
wave<00:03:47.349> decimal<00:03:48.010> it's<00:03:48.400> always<00:03:48.669> bound<00:03:48.999> as<00:03:49.269> that

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
wave decimal it's always bound as that

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.209 
wave decimal it's always bound as that
so<00:03:49.659> if<00:03:49.779> I<00:03:49.870> ever<00:03:50.019> want<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.319> stop<00:03:50.379> the<00:03:50.680> sound<00:03:50.919> mid

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:51.219 
so if I ever want to stop the sound mid

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.670 
so if I ever want to stop the sound mid
mid<00:03:51.790> go<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.449> just<00:03:52.870> press<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.169> decimal<00:03:53.559> and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
mid go I just press the decimal and

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.769 
mid go I just press the decimal and
it'll<00:03:53.799> stop<00:03:53.979> like<00:03:54.159> this<00:03:59.489> yeah<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.699> so<00:04:01.329> it<00:04:01.569> just

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:01.779 
it'll stop like this yeah and so it just

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.439 
it'll stop like this yeah and so it just
cuts<00:04:02.169> off<00:04:02.319> right<00:04:02.620> there<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:04.150> yeah<00:04:04.269> that's

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
cuts off right there so yeah that's

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.259 
cuts off right there so yeah that's
that's<00:04:04.689> pretty<00:04:04.809> much<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.109> I<00:04:05.469> mean<00:04:06.180> there<00:04:07.180> are

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
that's pretty much it I mean there are

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.309 
that's pretty much it I mean there are
some<00:04:07.449> other<00:04:07.569> things<00:04:07.659> you<00:04:07.930> can<00:04:08.049> do<00:04:08.169> this

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
some other things you can do this

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.189 
some other things you can do this
program<00:04:08.739> like<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:10.209> know<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.479> voices<00:04:10.749> but

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
program like you know the voices but

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.170 
program like you know the voices but
they<00:04:11.349> aren't<00:04:11.669> honestly<00:04:12.669> they<00:04:12.819> aren't<00:04:13.059> too

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
they aren't honestly they aren't too

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.110 
they aren't honestly they aren't too
good<00:04:13.379> I<00:04:14.379> pretty<00:04:15.189> much<00:04:15.249> only<00:04:15.519> use<00:04:15.790> this<00:04:15.909> program

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
good I pretty much only use this program
