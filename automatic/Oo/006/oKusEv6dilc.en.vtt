00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.270
 good youtube and your son is game 55 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.860
 and they have a lot of problems with the ipad and 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.620
 the tail if all that I'm back 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.749
 here to make a new video 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.509
 Minecraft tutorial that you love 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.219
 well this video is dedicated to my 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.840
 colleagues dj place who is a great follower 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.180
 mine and has to give action for his success in 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.130
 the series of that book in which I 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.710
 he played the role of the voices of two 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.260
 characters and if I remember correctly in the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.420
 third season I played another one like that 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.210
 that good 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.500
 let's start with this and today I bring you 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.420
 around here some pretty things 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.670
 interesting as this door of the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.400
 underground shelter 6 game by alfaro 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.620
 car will sound familiar was not so stable 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.050
 from the door but good 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.750
 and it's a pretty thick door with a 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.100
 pretty cool opening too and this is not 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.019
 I know why he stays here but it's that 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.050
 while I was building the door 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.430
 I left something activated wrong and now the piston 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.230
 that was here was supposed to be 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.970
 to go down but if you follow the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.309
 steps of the link that I will leave in the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.340
 description you can get a door 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.220
 perfect more than mine that is also not 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.350
 so bad but good this I know 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.720
 it works in such a way that you have to 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.850
 connect if you want to do it so you can 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.650
 connect the point where he tells you that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.440
 with stage the lever because you will see that 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.450
 the video that I'm going to leave you 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.130
 description tells you that with this is a 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.930
 lever and you can get stones and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.910
 connect it to these two from the way 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.910
 that you have one in the entrance and another 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.990
 on the other side 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.329
 they have to be both turned off to 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.859
 that is open and one the two 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.320
 lit so it's closed so 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.159
 very very important if you do not open later 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.350
 because the other will be on 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.420
 and I leave it to you as you wish 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.890
 personality is what you want, I'm not going 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.649
 explain how it is built but yes 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.799
 I will leave the link I said because this 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.859
 has a lot of things has a lot 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.099
 of pistons torches everything we go 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.990
 well we went to the next machine not 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.470
 I know if this time it will work but if not 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.019
 you believe me 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.970
 is a multiplier of items me here 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.140
 I have had it tested diamond 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.900
 all this I have taken out of a single 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.480
 diamond as you see creates a diamond that 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.849
 is the diamond makes infinite diamonds 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.040
 not stackable good with each other I think that 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.930
 if they can be stacked yes but never 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.340
 the a vÃ©lez in him because he would lose them 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.610
 you can do all the diamond that 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.650
 you want 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.600
 and until you lose this because 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.810
 well it's very complicated to do that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.860
 work will put one why 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.510
 we have to place 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.340
 this you have to make a wall of 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.910
 material that you want I have 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.450
 put composite iron blocks here 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.770
 a little bit sad here two more blocks in 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.740
 this you put a torch in this one 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.040
 repeater to two 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.850
 because then you put these full well 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.680
 everyone looking for here 4 and other 4 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.790
 looking over there 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.860
 well then here a button and in this 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.350
 obsidian box the obsidian goes to 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.480
 be what it has cost us the most 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:23.430
 you put inside you leave a 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.379
 a gap of two let's put 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.549
 this in the background the background is also for 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.280
 well, if I 'm not going to do what 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.600
 break 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.240
 and we put here a dispenser and the item 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.560
 that you want to multiply infinitely in 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.500
 this case the diamond because it is the most 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.780
 loved surely when I pick it up if 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.600
 it works will join me with these 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.340
 then it was not the effect but here 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.560
 I have the proof already in case it does not work anymore 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.209
 of itself that this works because if 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.770
 you will not tell me this does not have 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.319
 no way can I swear to you so I 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:58.569
 more than what you most want has not 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.040
 no way the diamond is a pure bug 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.200
 you have everything you want infinite like 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.410
 you can see there is nothing by my side just 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.040
 that you can stack it if you want like that 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.650
 and well, this infinite diamond all 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.330
 taken from a single mantel so 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.130
 let's try if he feels like it 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.989
 it will work 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.760
 you have to click here and stay 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.560
 looking at the 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.730
 you have to look at the torch when you 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.730
 turn on is when you have to remove 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.960
 to 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.139
 it has not left it never leaves the first 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.480
 let's make one more attempt 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.800
 almost all the diamond 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.800
 raise diamonds 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.570
 you do not have to be very fast either 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.110
 well it's not like that a couple of times 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.950
 plus 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.950
 and step 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.349
 come also to the slow 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.189
 come on, you can juanjo 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.110
 again 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.700
 I do not know at the end 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.729
 I'm going to stay without duplicating another 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.589
 diamond in my life 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.420
 clear what I 'm recording now now 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:29.180
 it does not have to go like no 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.180
 web either come and the last 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.679
 moment 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.110
 if you can not pick up the diamond that 's 

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:37.820
 that there is one inside let me go that 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.500
 I think it's not right 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.560
 not if I had not done it well 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.760
 but good when I know that what 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.640
 you have done well because that is going to 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.610
 be a bug so you will see a 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.840
 diamond that you will not be able to catch that 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.670
 that is supposed to be the one you 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.800
 you have put and then another so 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.950
 general closer to this part to 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.570
 to be in here nearby and that's going to 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.440
 be the good that you can understand how 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.440
 I taught you well 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.860
 and you can do everything infinite 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.120
 come last try 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.120
 and see if it works 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.700
 nothing, well, you do not know either 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:26.300
 you know how you go expect 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.360
 and if it has been that voucher I think it has 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.510
 worked but I was stacked with these 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.510
 diamonds 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.909
 so I could not do it well 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:39.590
 we will never know if it will be good but 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:41.150
 I have demonstrated I think it has been more 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.860
 that enough to show you that this can 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.990
 be infinite 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.449
 good that you enjoy this machine is very 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.830
 difficult to use since I taught it and 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.129
 Now let's move on to an easier 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.420
 use 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.790
 and much more useful 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.760
 because with this you can see the caves 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:00.969
 that you have in the subsoil for the mode 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.240
 survival comes that you flip it 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:06.660
 now how am I in it 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.860
 in an extra flat map when I do so 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.419
 these are two blocks that stay here 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.639
 of invisibility and here you can see 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.740
 all the things that you have below as 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.790
 is extrablando and I said you are not going to 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.150
 see nothing 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.280
 you have to put two pistons the 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.770
 Sticky pistons will then recede 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.690
 the luminous legs and arrange another 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.140
 I will not have to keep the 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.480
 hand and those connected and crush them jce 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.030
 yourselves so you can see this 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.680
 good and until here the video I hope that 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.590
 you have enjoyed that you love 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.620
 man 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.480
 Well I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.300
 we see in the following video tutorial of 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.640
 minecraft and you already know how to like 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:52.020
 subscribe and if you liked the video 

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:54.410
 comment and if not also good until the 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.410
 next
