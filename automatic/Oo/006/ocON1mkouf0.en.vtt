00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:07.910
 to get a good shot 1 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.640
 artistic taste is not enough 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.110
 Exposure accuracy reaction and of course 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.750
 correct equipment 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.240

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.500
 prefers to hit the target with a big

 rubber inserts in grip zones yes and 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.090
 The device is in the hands is very convenient 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.780
 that with such a zoom plays a very important 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.030
 role 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.460
 itâ€™s a pity there are no camouflage options 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.710
 optics lid dried for 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.110

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.989
 There are no thread trophies for the filters 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.540
 there is a backup on the side of the lens 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.140
 zoom lever under his left hand he 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.120
 allows 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.280
 careful not to scale the scene 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.320
 taking your finger off the shutter that 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.110
 especially convenient when shooting video 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.460
 near the range limit button 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.639

 along with it and the built-in flash 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.139
 although it can be raised separately by the second 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.329
 lever sight is a

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:32.569
 collimator which sets on 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.549

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.429
 distances just put a cross on 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.919
 target center and when it got into 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.020
 visibility more accurately crop 

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:50.209
 scene through electronic viewfinder 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.510

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.040
 normal super zoom 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 initially the scope is set to 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.210
 infinity but if you want 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.770
 apply it over short distances 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.960
 have to do parallax correction when 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.120
 the help of this disk otherwise 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.130
 the center of the image in the sight will not be 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.810
 match the picture on the screen for 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.119
 aiming you do not need close 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.250
 approaching the lens it makes shooting easier 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.920
 people with glasses besides this mechanism is not 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.140
 limits the field of view the viewfinder does not 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.080
 too big and not very fast but 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.150
 has a fairly high resolution 920 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.220
 thousand points thanks to quality 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.680
 pictures can be used even for

 Viewfinder button to the right and here at 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.690
 three inch screen resolution by 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.470
 least four hundred sixty thousand 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.360
 points 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.370
 because of which noticeable individual pixels 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.440
 viewing angles are also not very big but in 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.570
 overall for framing it is enough 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.000
 evaluate finished photos anyway 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.830
 management is better than computer 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.200
 different from other compacts on 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.750
 back side joystick 4 standard 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.450
 buttons and 1 soft key fn 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.300
 On the side there are two micro interfaces 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.340
 hdmi and corporate port it also serves 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.280
 for charging the device is powered by 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.890
 1350 milliampere battery 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.260
 hours it was enough for about 400 frames 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.450
 and 10 minutes of video by the standards 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.040
 compacts a good result next to 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.090
 battery is installed card 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.190
 sd memory 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.019
 despite the rather serious external 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.370
 the device looks very simple 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.530
 interface and a small amount 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.750
 settings almost all the necessary 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.720
 parameters are set via the quick menu 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.640
 16 megapixel is used here 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.230
 backlit sensor size 1 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.940

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.640
 image processing deals 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.640
 processor last generation corpse 7 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.110
 sensor sensitivity is in 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.120
 range from 125 to 6400 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.459
 the camera makes noise a little less than competitors 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.680
 similar format but up to devices with 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.260
 larger matrices of course she still 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.600
 far as practice has shown to rise 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.060
 above 700 is only then 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.610
 when another clear frame fails 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.560
 rock world does not support therefore 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.269
 exposure compensation and adjustment 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.580
 white balance is best done 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.610
 just before shooting as we already 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.470
 spoke with pesto and boasts not 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.380
 only the guidance system but also 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.870
 a long-range lens with a magnification of 50 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.030
 short birds squirrels and other animals for 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.859
 such a gun is not a problem at all either 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.200
 trophy for a photo album can be 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.540
 a whole plane ship and even colorful 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.790
 utilities workers in general the camera allows 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.680
 remove almost everything when you 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.080
 approaching trying to escape or 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.360
 fix your hairstyle with a work tool zoom 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.310
 can also be used to obtain 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.919
 beautiful blurred background at portrait 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.919
 and subject shooting wide-angle 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.330
 position high lens aperture 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.520
 avoids noise and other 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.380
 artifacts if you shoot during the daytime 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.479
 lighting quality of shots at 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.460
 maximum focal lengths too 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.479
 quite high although with increasing 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.550
 can see 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.740
 figure glass effect it occurs 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.919
 due to the increase 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.229
 photosensitivity 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.729
 because of the low aperture of the lens but if 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.910
 do not print photos larger than 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.919
 a4 format this disturbance will not eat and 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.020
 macro mode allows you to shoot objects 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.810
 at a distance of one centimeter from 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.979
 Lens with very good detail 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.500
 surely among the audience there 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.270
 lovers hunt for bugs worth 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.039
 also note the presence of effective 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.930
 optical stabilization which 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.419
 provides clear photos even 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.560
 when you shoot with a zoom without a tripod in 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.930
 cloudy weather but evening 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.610
 without fixation device is no longer dispense with 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.850
 hands photos are not very good 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.070
 As this camera is suitable and so the photo 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.930
 hunters who for more reliable 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.510
 result prefers to shoot 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.790
 bursts in burst mode 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.340
 shoot up to 60 frames per second with 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.410
 3 megapixel resolution and 7 frames in 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.270
 maximum quality batch length in 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.810
 the latter case is limited to six 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.030
 frames 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.310
 The camera supports a set of branded 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.620
 features for those who don't like to play with 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.240
 There are seven cool digital editors. 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.010
 filters and panoramic view with 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.979
 automatic and manual 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.380
 gluing photos hey yaran is hardly 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.330
 who will surprise but interval shooting in 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.930
 cameras of this class are very 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.669
 seldom 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.700
 she can shoot up to 100 frames with 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.530
 interval of 10 seconds 1 hour and then 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.400
 from these photos you can create a movie 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.250
 timelapse 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.050
 unless of course you know how to use 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.100
 video editor if in terms of photography 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.020
 and list and 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.970
 keeps up with competitors 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.740
 then by the possibilities of video recording she 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.810
 made a big step forward 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.940
 videos can be recorded full hd with 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.370
 at 60 frames per second and 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.260
 progressive scan hybrid pique 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.150
 axial stabilization is wonderful 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.130
 copes with shaking when shooting with hands 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.910
 even at maximum approximation in 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.910
 general, see for yourself 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.600
 there is also a slow motion mode with 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.240
 120 frames per second with 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:56.680
 resolution in food or 240 frames 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.750
 The size of 432na 324 points is obvious that 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.430
 olympus stylus trailer designed in 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.650
 first place on tourists and lovers 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.690
 outdoor recreation in general is 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.060
 standard hyper zoom but thanks 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.130
 unique aiming system with pes then 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.920
 and surpasses competing models 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.380
 speed and operational shooting a photo 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.690
 hunting is often the deciding factor 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.150
 neither fluff nor feather and do not forget to look
