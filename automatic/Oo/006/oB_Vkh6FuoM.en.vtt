00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.270
Smooth skin is a prerequisite when
you need to show off your legs.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.800
Silk-epil 7 is a cordless and
portable device that is easy to use.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.870
It enables you to get smooth
skin for weeks in a fast way.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.800
The Silk-epil 7 Wet &amp; Dry
comes with an epilator

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.660
and five additional attachments,
a shaver head, a trimmer cap,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.180
a sensitive cap for underarms
and the bikini area,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.192
a facial cap, and then efficiency cap.

00:00:57.672 --> 00:01:01.080
If it is a first epilation,
your hair may be too long.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.922
Ideal length is between
0.5 and 5 millimeters.

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:12.710
To trim it, you can use the
shaver head with the trimmer.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.008
Assembling it is very easy.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.840
Just place the trimmer
cup onto the shaver head.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.640
And slide the trim shave
selector to the trim position.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.601
To epilate, you then just have
to exchange the shaver head

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:26.846
for the epilation head.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:41.420
With Silk-epil 7, you can always select
the speed you prefer, ranging from one,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.872
extra gentle, to two, extra efficient.

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:47.960
This fantastic feature
is extremely useful.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.140
You can be super fast when you
need it, or more gentle, especially

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.310
in sensitive areas.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.550
To get best results, hold your
epilator at a 90 degree angle,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.292
face down, and move the epilator gently
against the direction of hair growth.

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:06.590
If you're afraid of pain, just
use the Silk-epil in your bathtub

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.762
or under the shower.

00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:11.500
Warm water reduces pain
dramatically, opens your pores,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.250
and creates a relaxing environment.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.920
On top, what also helps against
discomfort is the massage system.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.360
It stimulates the skin and makes the
epilation experience much gentler.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.480
The tugging sensation is most
noticeable the first time your epilate,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.290
but it will become less
noticeable each time.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.610
Among its features, the
epilator has also a smart light

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.990
that guides you during epilation.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.198
And now, last but not least, what you'll
really like most about this epilator

00:02:38.198 --> 00:02:41.140
is that it can grab even
the shortest, tiniest hairs,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.030
thanks to the perfect contact
of the tweezers with the skin.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.750
While waxing, for instance,
cannot grab the short hairs,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.517
Silk-epil removes flat-lying hair so
there are no hair in between days.

00:02:52.517 --> 00:02:56.253
With Silk-epil 7 Wet &amp; Dry, you
don't have to wait for the hair

00:02:56.253 --> 00:02:59.490
to grow until it's long enough to wax.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.224
And now free to choose
what you want to wear.

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:06.100
Fashionable dresses and skirts
will always make a perfect outfit.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.220
Smooth legs, a trendy mini-dress, and
you'll be ready to rock the night.
