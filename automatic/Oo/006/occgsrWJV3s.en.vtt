it<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.819> really<00:04:16.680> judge<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.709> well<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:19.109> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
it to really judge that well but the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.430 
it to really judge that well but the
couple<00:04:21.489> times<00:04:21.699> i<00:04:21.940> did<00:04:22.240> use<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:23.080> went<00:04:23.320> on

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
couple times i did use it it went on

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.719 
couple times i did use it it went on
pretty<00:04:23.800> well<00:04:24.070> except<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:25.289> kind<00:04:26.289> of<00:04:26.380> clumped<00:04:27.010> my

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
pretty well except it kind of clumped my

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.290 
pretty well except it kind of clumped my
eye<00:04:27.760> my<00:04:28.389> lower<00:04:29.080> lashes<00:04:29.500> together<00:04:30.060> when<00:04:31.060> i<00:04:31.090> was

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900

I don't know I guess I could have done
it<00:04:38.080> differently<00:04:38.259> but<00:04:39.689> it<00:04:40.689> works<00:04:40.930> pretty<00:04:41.199> well

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319
