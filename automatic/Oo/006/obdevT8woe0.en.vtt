00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.580 
all that other stuff which I don't find
highly<00:05:36.090> unlikely<00:05:36.449> actually<00:05:37.110> because<00:05:37.349> if<00:05:37.470> you

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
highly unlikely actually because if you

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.610 
highly unlikely actually because if you
think<00:05:37.620> about<00:05:37.889> it<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.580> first<00:05:38.849> PSP<00:05:39.620> was

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
think about it the first PSP was

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.379 
think about it the first PSP was
equivalent<00:05:40.949> to<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:41.340> PlayStation<00:05:41.880> 2<00:05:42.060> as<00:05:42.210> far

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
equivalent to the PlayStation 2 as far

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.080 
equivalent to the PlayStation 2 as far
as<00:05:42.479> graphics<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:43.080> power<00:05:43.229> was<00:05:43.500> concerned<00:05:44.090> so

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
as graphics and power was concerned so

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.029 
as graphics and power was concerned so
with<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:45.960> amount<00:05:46.110> of<00:05:46.229> technology<00:05:46.800> that<00:05:46.830> we

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
with the amount of technology that we

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:48.950 
with the amount of technology that we
have<00:05:47.070> nowadays<00:05:47.370> we<00:05:48.210> have<00:05:48.240> new<00:05:48.539> dual-core

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
have nowadays we have new dual-core

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.140 
have nowadays we have new dual-core
processors<00:05:49.620> come<00:05:49.830> into<00:05:50.010> phones<00:05:50.250> here<00:05:50.940> this

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
processors come into phones here this

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.330 
processors come into phones here this
this<00:05:51.419> year<00:05:52.139> stuff<00:05:52.650> like<00:05:52.800> that<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:52.979> think<00:05:53.099> it's

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
this year stuff like that I think it's

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.550 
this year stuff like that I think it's
very<00:05:53.490> likely<00:05:53.909> and<00:05:54.389> possible<00:05:54.870> especially<00:05:55.080> with

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
very likely and possible especially with

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.320 
very likely and possible especially with
now<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:55.830> integrated<00:05:56.460> graphics<00:05:56.639> and<00:05:57.060> a<00:05:57.090> lot<00:05:57.240> of

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
now the integrated graphics and a lot of

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.780 
now the integrated graphics and a lot of
these<00:05:57.419> processors

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
these processors

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.420 
these processors
for<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.420> you<00:05:59.480> guys<00:05:59.630> don't<00:06:00.020> know<00:06:00.170> I'm<00:06:00.380> real<00:06:00.620> big
