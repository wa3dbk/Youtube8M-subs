00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.179
 the idea would be 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.940
 move that spirit a little bit that I 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.519
 want to close to the exhibition of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.039
 utility 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.369
 I analyze why he has done things and 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.329
 how are things I try to find a 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.460
 method that is useful to anyone in 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.869
 reality and then in this 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.210
 in that process what we have to 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.870
 get is a little clear that 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.350
 incognito of if the bulli meant 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.250
 something for a restaurant what 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.250
 it would mean an advertising agency 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.550
 traditional 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.420
 the idea would be that the process that 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.820
 turns the bulli into let's say a 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.220
 research laboratory this is 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.019
 applicable to any type of company 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.399
 but this is at the moment when a 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:00.350
 company decides to start a process of 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.530
 innovation through research 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.590
 with what you have to know if you are capable 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.580
 to do something with what has different 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.990
 what I was doing until that 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.119
 moment and this is what it starts to do 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.119
 bullying at high speed 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.680
 to understand these processes there are 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.390
 a scheme that is drawn from 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.060
 mathematical concepts but that applies 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.570
 out of the mathematical environment that is or 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.340
 of black boxes and white boxes a box 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.100
 Black is a 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.100
 we can do as a device in the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.369
 that between some elements in the box and 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.140
 other elements come out then any 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.329
 manufacturing process we could 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.189
 understand it as a black box is 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.750
 important that what comes in what comes out 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.959
 be different because otherwise there has been 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.450
 a transformation but above all that 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.340
 what happens inside does not require us to take 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.350
 of decisions ie responds to the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.950
 idea of ​​an automatism an algorithm that 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.530
 it says in mathematics algorithm is a 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.740
 series of steps that you can do without 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.840
 need to think 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.270
 one of the examples that I use 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.009
 usually it is precisely that of the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.200
 kitchen because it's a very clear example is 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.270
 say you have to the entrance of the box 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.380
 a series of elements such as can be 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.300
 then eggs salt oil et cetera inside 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.099
 you have some instructions that is the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.569
 key of the box the instructions that 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.590
 they tell you what to do with this is a 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.450
 leave something same 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.849
 that is the algorithm is to say house of the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.890
 recipe kitchen then following the 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.390
 letter of these instructions to the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.390
 On the other side, use a potato omelet 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.990
 the white boxes 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.700
 are the black boxes enter elements and 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.990
 items come out in white boxes 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.400
 enter the information and they are the 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.409
 information explains 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.769
 with the elements that you have in a 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:56.170
 black herbs box the white box 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.689
 it is already a research process in the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.569
 white box and a goal and then 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.920
 can be and that's the decisive thing but what 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.439
 that if there is no objective there is nothing 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.599
 because then you do not know what to do if 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.950
 one was looking for something clear 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.989
 that the white boxes their big 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.220
 knowledge and then the bulli there is a 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.500
 particular moment that is set to 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.750
 generate knowledge is knowledge 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.060
 that is growing and is creating culture 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.129
 ordinary because the culture is going 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.959
 generating with knowledge and intention 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.349
 Of course there is an intention because it has a 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.349
 objective 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.420
 this seems to me to be one of the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.170
 most important messages that you have to 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.650
 give us that especially when you are 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.120
 skimming creativity scenarios because 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.099
 there is a tendency to say that what 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.830
 important is the creative capacity of 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:47.070
 subject or your intelligence 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.880
 then a company would force him to 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.050
 look for that profile when in fact what 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.810
 what you have to give him is the scenario 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.090
 suitable for that to occur said 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.110
 otherwise the creative and intelligent 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.110
 It is the scenario 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.880
 the entrepreneur at this moment is 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.550
 also suffering a crisis he is 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.459
 generating a great tension because it is 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.650
 to months of closing the company and tell him 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.320
 not your solutions the innovator and be 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.109
 creative if you do not tell him anything else you 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.390
 you're bugging because it would be the 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.040
 mirror and he does not even know what 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.430
 it means to be creative you have to 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.160
 give a method is innova I know I have 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.200
 but look I offer you this possibility the 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.280
 problem that I see in the case of the 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.020
 agency is that there is no custom or 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.240
 a tradition of having the data 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.919
 located and I always say that the 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.930
 information that is better what we are 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.419
 speaking we are talking about trafficking 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.980
 with information is not information if not 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.140
 have more access in the person then 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.300
 clear in an advertising agency and a 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.010
 there is a gentleman who is the creative and I 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.960
 I wonder this man gets sick and has 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.590
 left instructions 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.470
 He is a man because I am me 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.040
 and this I think is a concept that 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.129
 starts to start until the obsolete is 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.229
 tell 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.939
 you have to be able to generate the 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.739
 precise instructions so that 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.080
 that group at last and not be able to 

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:18.849
 repeat real bleed should say yes 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.969
 it's possible 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.399
 if it is possible to organize the 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:27.219
 creative process if we do not get the 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:28.660
 method or how to use what 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:31.390
 I need 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.120
 we are in initiation processes because 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.880
 we are trying to define profiles 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.010
 individual 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.170
 well it can work but I think that 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.630
 the future does not go around because we're not going 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.570
 to establish monasteries to get 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.070
 than having creative and innovative people in 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.640
 the companies we have to give them 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.640
 methodology
