00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
save the new name now what we're going

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.100 
save the new name now what we're going
to<00:02:56.459> have<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.700> do<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.910> reboot<00:02:57.300> your<00:02:57.450> device<00:02:57.510> and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
to have to do is reboot your device and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.050 
to have to do is reboot your device and
this<00:02:58.770> this<00:02:59.040> will<00:02:59.280> restore<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.880> its

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
this this will restore it to its

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.510 
this this will restore it to its
original<00:03:00.270> position<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:01.170> clocking<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.430> will

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
original position of clocking so it will

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.070 
original position of clocking so it will
wreak<00:03:02.700> lock<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.060> processor<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.780> what<00:03:03.930> it's

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
wreak lock the processor to what it's

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.840 
wreak lock the processor to what it's
supposed<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:04.860> that's<00:03:05.040> 600<00:03:05.550> megahertz

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
supposed to be so that's 600 megahertz

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.080 
supposed to be so that's 600 megahertz
compared<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.540> 420<00:03:07.290> megahertz<00:03:07.740> I've<00:03:08.459> noticed<00:03:08.940> a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
compared to 420 megahertz I've noticed a

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.840 
compared to 420 megahertz I've noticed a
huge<00:03:09.450> difference<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:10.200> compared<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.920> in

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.910 

processing<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.180> down<00:03:15.450> apps<00:03:16.200> opening<00:03:16.800> is

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
processing so it's down apps opening is

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.890 
processing so it's down apps opening is
really<00:03:17.190> fast<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.730> things<00:03:17.940> like<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.750> even

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
really fast and things like that it even

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.210 
really fast and things like that it even
saves<00:03:19.230> lots<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.590> memory<00:03:19.860> because<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
saves lots of memory because the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.160 
saves lots of memory because the
processor<00:03:20.700> does<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.270> working<00:03:21.630> harder<00:03:21.990> so

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
processor does is working harder so

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.740 
processor does is working harder so
there's<00:03:22.350> less<00:03:22.470> Ram<00:03:22.770> being<00:03:23.040> used<00:03:23.340> for<00:03:23.750> things

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
there's less Ram being used for things

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.930 
there's less Ram being used for things
like<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.230> can<00:03:25.380> open<00:03:25.500> sbsettings<00:03:26.070> can

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
like that so you can open sbsettings can

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.090 
like that so you can open sbsettings can
press<00:03:27.180> power<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.830> don't<00:03:28.980> have

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
press power and if you don't have

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.449 
press power and if you don't have
sbsettings<00:03:29.550> just<00:03:29.940> use<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:31.100> original<00:03:32.100> reboot

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
sbsettings just use the original reboot

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.860 
sbsettings just use the original reboot
so<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.670> can<00:03:32.820> press<00:03:32.940> reboot<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.540> then<00:03:33.720> your

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
so you can press reboot and then your

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.729 
so you can press reboot and then your
your<00:03:34.580> your<00:03:35.580> iPhone<00:03:36.200> iPod<00:03:37.200> will<00:03:37.590> be

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
your your iPhone iPod will be

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.330 
your your iPhone iPod will be
overclocked<00:03:38.730> or<00:03:39.030> clock<00:03:39.959> just<00:03:40.200> 600<00:03:41.100> megahertz

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
overclocked or clock just 600 megahertz

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.449 
overclocked or clock just 600 megahertz
which<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.750> how<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.650> should<00:03:43.800> have<00:03:44.010> came<00:03:44.160> out<00:03:44.340> of

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
which is how it should have came out of

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.600 
which is how it should have came out of
the<00:03:44.519> box<00:03:44.730> but<00:03:45.030> that's<00:03:45.239> not<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.570> case<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.610> yeah

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
the box but that's not the case and yeah

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.590 
the box but that's not the case and yeah
thanks<00:03:48.030> for<00:03:48.060> watching<00:03:48.510> okay<00:03:48.900> all<00:03:49.410> right
