00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.880
 Every year, game developers thrilled with new announcements because of the big ones 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.469
 depth 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.499
 most of them saw the light of day but some are here 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.859
 they will be buried in silence 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.269
 this cemetery of video games 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.499
 we played these games 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.499
 Here you can relax for you 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.940
 second match goal or Captain America 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.360
 it does not matter who but everyone is super 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.690
 In order to please everyone, we should have got it once again 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 Game comes out 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.870
 a lot not known but there are a few moving pictures and 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.920
 Snapshots from which you could open up quite a bit logical 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.720
 First of all not all of them but most of the marvel characters in the game 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.180
 should be present 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.900
 but let's take a closer look at today's title and look back 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.380
 Comic con 2007 the heated cases world of colorful booklets and all that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.640
 As every year in San Diego, this has to be an exchange and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.650
 be the first to hear the latest news in the industry 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.250
 also electronics type locally and had at that time some novelties for the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.190
 around 100,000 visitors in the bag 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.500
 One of them was a new blood game called Mara p 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.180
 clearly the fans were also looking forward to the first comic with a favorite series or 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.750
 Rogue all broken game on a nextgen consoles 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.500
 The corner can be that the direction Cargo will take care of the development 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.170
 they have actually HV with a fist simulation of all the Champ or 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.910
 Fight Night 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.260
 Originally planned was a comic based games in which it exists 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.200
 should be what was missing in the previous title 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.320
 especially at the translation of the comic story to the game should 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.140
 be worked intensively that at least meant Kudu for or at that time boss of EA 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.340
 Ski Cargo in an interview and added that is one of the best too 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.160
 stay games should be 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.140
 so far so good the high standards were already there 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.860
 after Capcom looks great with top titles like x-men TAM Martinszug bei Jurist 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.650
 x-men or Street Fighter and Marcel Wehr as Scherk comes out on top 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.250
 Of course EA wanted to recaptured the license with Pickett com 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.380
 of course then of course lost it 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.050
 A new superhero era ushered all these games in the shade 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.789
 provides 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:26.309
 The developers do not just spit out big sounds because they had to be in 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.989
 spit his hands because it was thick unofficial predecessor Marvel several times 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.609
 Often she knows how to beat her perfectly 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.149
 so seen the mammoth task par excellence but Hey who so big sounds spits the 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:38.769
 Pact too, that's how it was 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.219
 or not just for a few months after said comic-con 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.369
 the marriage stamps her office in Chicago 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.959
 Justification The products delivered simply do not meet the standards 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.519
 Deel requires 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.189
 Kerkrade because then also the newly acquired superhero franchise begins 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:55.269
 Down the stream 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.439
 in the course of the closure of EA Chicagoland, Amore wants to be the same 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.989
 The contract with Didier Ya on and justified the cooperation with 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.319
 Electronics ARZ as a pure «business decision» which auf 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.480
 The portfolio strategy of EA was Sirte at the same time it is also said that the 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.579
 future Martin pull both games from these events 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.970
 In the general fight between Marvel and i-cee, this would be influenced 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.949
 Game certainly has been another asset 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.029
 the chains like ten is the fire favorite to barking game 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.040
 or Puma, or rather, they are the cool heroes and villains
