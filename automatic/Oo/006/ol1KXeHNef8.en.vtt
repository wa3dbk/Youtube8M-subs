now<00:03:34.790> show<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.060> an<00:03:35.239> error<00:03:35.390> message<00:03:35.480> and

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
now show you an error message and

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.780 
now show you an error message and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
you will scratch your heads on this one

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.080 
you will scratch your heads on this one
believe<00:04:09.739> me<00:04:09.769> I<00:04:09.950> did<00:04:10.190> as<00:04:10.310> well<00:04:10.489> when<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:10.790> first

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
believe me I did as well when I first

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.940 
believe me I did as well when I first
diagnosed<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.659> issue<00:04:11.780> but<00:04:12.170> yeah<00:04:12.379> this<00:04:12.620> fixes

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
diagnosed the issue but yeah this fixes

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.789 
diagnosed the issue but yeah this fixes
the<00:04:13.040> problem<00:04:13.810> now<00:04:14.810> take<00:04:15.079> off<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.260> warranty

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
the problem now take off the warranty

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.219 
the problem now take off the warranty

the screw to remove the top cover of the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.960 
the screw to remove the top cover of the
ps4<00:04:20.590> remove<00:04:21.590> this<00:04:21.739> screw<00:04:21.889> and<00:04:22.099> remove<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.789> top

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
ps4 remove this screw and remove the top

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.480 
ps4 remove this screw and remove the top
cover<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.810> top<00:04:24.050> cover<00:04:24.259> on<00:04:24.590> this<00:04:24.919> side<00:04:25.130> is<00:04:25.310> not

cover the top cover on this side is not

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.339 
cover the top cover on this side is not
a<00:04:25.550> slab<00:04:25.970> cover<00:04:26.240> so<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:26.960> will<00:04:27.169> need<00:04:27.289> to

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
a slab cover so you will need to

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.350 
a slab cover so you will need to
actually<00:04:27.560> lift<00:04:28.250> upwards<00:04:28.759> towards<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.180> back

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
actually lift upwards towards the back

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.330 
actually lift upwards towards the back
and<00:04:29.570> toward<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.410> right<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.740> case<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.160> get

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
and toward the right of the case to get

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.890 
and toward the right of the case to get
it<00:04:31.460> removed<00:04:31.550> if<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.419> haven't<00:04:32.660> done<00:04:32.780> this

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
it removed if you haven't done this

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.659 
it removed if you haven't done this
before<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.530> would<00:04:33.650> be<00:04:33.800> best<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.280> view<00:04:34.460> one<00:04:34.639> of

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
before it would be best to view one of

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.029 
before it would be best to view one of
the<00:04:34.760> ps4<00:04:35.240> disassembly<00:04:36.080> videos<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.860> see<00:04:37.010> how

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
the ps4 disassembly videos to see how

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.070 
the ps4 disassembly videos to see how
it's<00:04:37.280> done<00:04:37.430> now<00:04:38.240> once<00:04:38.449> the<00:04:38.539> top<00:04:38.750> cover<00:04:38.990> is

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
it's done now once the top cover is

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.839 
it's done now once the top cover is
removed<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.800> will<00:04:40.250> see<00:04:40.400> there<00:04:40.580> are<00:04:40.669> two

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
removed you will see there are two

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.120 
removed you will see there are two
screws<00:04:41.240> screw<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:41.960> screw<00:04:42.500> down<00:04:42.770> onto<00:04:43.039> the

screws screw to screw down onto the
aluminum<00:04:43.370> metal<00:04:43.849> bracket<00:04:44.330> first<00:04:45.229> try

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
aluminum metal bracket first try

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.260 
aluminum metal bracket first try
tightening<00:04:45.830> those<00:04:45.949> screws<00:04:46.220> little<00:04:46.580> then

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
tightening those screws little then

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.939 
tightening those screws little then
power<00:04:47.510> on<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.780> ps4<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.260> see<00:04:48.530> if<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:48.770> fixes

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
power on the ps4 and see if that fixes

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.670 
power on the ps4 and see if that fixes
your<00:04:49.220> issue<00:04:49.400> if<00:04:49.699> not<00:04:50.690> then<00:04:51.110> loosen<00:04:51.470> them<00:04:51.650> a

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
your issue if not then loosen them a

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.250 
your issue if not then loosen them a
little<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.250> then<00:04:52.729> power<00:04:52.940> on<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.240> ps4<00:04:53.539> and<00:04:54.020> see

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
little and then power on the ps4 and see

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.110 
little and then power on the ps4 and see
if<00:04:54.349> it's<00:04:54.500> solve<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.800> problem<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.849> might<00:04:56.030> need

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
if it's solve the problem you might need

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.659 
if it's solve the problem you might need
to<00:04:56.240> test<00:04:56.449> it<00:04:56.539> out<00:04:56.659> a<00:04:56.720> little<00:04:56.960> bit<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.550> see<00:04:58.550> how

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
to test it out a little bit and see how

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.460 
to test it out a little bit and see how
much<00:04:58.789> tighter<00:04:59.090> or<00:04:59.389> looser<00:04:59.539> it<00:04:59.870> may<00:04:59.990> need<00:05:00.169> to<00:05:00.229> be

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
much tighter or looser it may need to be

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.100 
much tighter or looser it may need to be
but<00:05:01.039> this<00:05:01.220> should<00:05:01.370> solve<00:05:01.729> your<00:05:01.909> problem<00:05:02.210> if<00:05:02.960> it

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
but this should solve your problem if it
