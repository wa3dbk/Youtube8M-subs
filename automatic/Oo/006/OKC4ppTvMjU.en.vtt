an<00:01:31.020> elegant<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.619> alright<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.850> so

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
an elegant one alright and that's in so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.760 
an elegant one alright and that's in so
there<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.509> go<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.170> puts<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.470> nice<00:01:34.650> little

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
like about this is nice and plastic the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.920 
like about this is nice and plastic the
weather<00:01:38.850> stripping<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> little<00:01:39.750> weird

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
weather stripping was a little weird

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.390 
weather stripping was a little weird
because<00:01:40.079> um<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.070> foamy

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
because um you know as a little foamy

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.710 
because um you know as a little foamy
and<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.820> caught<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and it would get caught up and kind of

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.850 
and it would get caught up and kind of
move<00:01:42.869> around<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.290> bit<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
move around a little bit so this is

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
move around a little bit so this is
definitely<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.640> better<00:01:45.149> solution<00:01:45.450> than<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.750> i

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
definitely a better solution than what i

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.660 
definitely a better solution than what i
was<00:01:45.960> using<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.380> let's<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.619> how<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.799> works<00:01:47.040> so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
was using so let's see how this works so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
was using so let's see how this works so
we'll<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.939> put<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> iphone<00:01:48.869> 4<00:01:49.259> right<00:01:49.799> in

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
we'll just put the iphone 4 right in

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.899 
we'll just put the iphone 4 right in
there<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.530> we'll<00:01:53.250> push<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> up

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
there there we go and we'll push it up

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.760 
there there we go and we'll push it up
against<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:54.720> goes<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.140> pushes<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.619> in

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
against and there goes it pushes it in

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.920 
against and there goes it pushes it in
right<00:01:56.070> against<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.210> phone<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
right against the the phone just like it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.600 
right against the the phone just like it
should<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> key<00:01:59.100> part<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.579> there

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
should so this is a key part right there

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.760 
should so this is a key part right there
so<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.360> pushes<00:02:00.540> up<00:02:00.780> against<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> phone<00:02:01.530> so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
so it pushes up against the phone so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.889 
so it pushes up against the phone so
