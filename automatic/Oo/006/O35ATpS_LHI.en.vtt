00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.950 
pretty much expected the field to be
what<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.759> there<00:01:48.479> were<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> few

would<00:01:51.990> show<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.290> okay<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.159> deck<00:01:53.310> we're

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
would show up okay and the deck we're

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.649 
would show up okay and the deck we're
not<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:54.000> certain<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.479> matchup
