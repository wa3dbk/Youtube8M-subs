a<00:00:32.680> look<00:00:32.890> at<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.280> connector<00:00:34.059> we<00:00:34.239> can<00:00:34.510> see<00:00:34.780> that

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
a look at the connector we can see that

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.459 
a look at the connector we can see that
the<00:00:35.140> warrior<00:00:35.679> from<00:00:36.579> their<00:00:37.199> bottom<00:00:38.199> lamp

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
the warrior from their bottom lamp

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.009 
the warrior from their bottom lamp
that's<00:00:38.890> got<00:00:39.160> this<00:00:39.370> green<00:00:39.940> with<00:00:40.239> a<00:00:40.269> red<00:00:40.480> stripe

that's got this green with a red stripe

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.000 
that's got this green with a red stripe
comes<00:00:41.949> down<00:00:42.249> to<00:00:42.609> the<00:00:42.760> middle<00:00:43.239> pin<00:00:44.010> here

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
comes down to the middle pin here

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.700 
comes down to the middle pin here
whereas<00:00:45.999> if<00:00:46.269> I<00:00:46.449> can<00:00:46.780> stretch<00:00:47.170> these<00:00:47.409> two

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
whereas if I can stretch these two

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.209 
whereas if I can stretch these two
together

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
together

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.360 
together
on<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:49.120> UK<00:00:49.539> one<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:50.199> can<00:00:50.379> see<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:51.100> blank

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
on the UK one you can see that the blank

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.220 
on the UK one you can see that the blank
in<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.670> middle<00:00:51.969> and<00:00:52.420> it's<00:00:52.600> moved<00:00:52.839> over<00:00:53.109> to

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
in the middle and it's moved over to

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.169 
in the middle and it's moved over to
where<00:00:53.379> we've<00:00:53.499> got<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.800> blank<00:00:54.069> there<00:00:54.399> so<00:00:54.909> if

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
where we've got the blank there so if

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.680 
where we've got the blank there so if
you<00:00:55.449> have<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.719> light<00:00:56.199> and<00:00:56.469> you<00:00:56.679> want<00:00:56.979> to<00:00:57.309> fit<00:00:58.059> one

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
you have a light and you want to fit one

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.599 
you have a light and you want to fit one
of<00:00:58.839> these<00:00:58.989> European<00:00:59.589> or<00:00:59.739> Asian<00:00:59.890> lights<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.550> a

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
of these European or Asian lights to a

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.479 
of these European or Asian lights to a
UK<00:01:00.789> truck<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:02.170> can<00:01:02.319> do<00:01:02.499> it<00:01:02.649> by<00:01:02.829> changing<00:01:03.159> the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
UK truck you can do it by changing the

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.170 
UK truck you can do it by changing the
bowl<00:01:03.879> you<00:01:04.180> can<00:01:04.870> change<00:01:05.170> this<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.440> a<00:01:05.650> red<00:01:05.920> bowl

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
bowl you can change this to a red bowl

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.600 
bowl you can change this to a red bowl
that's<00:01:07.180> simply<00:01:07.630> swaps<00:01:08.409> out<00:01:08.590> but<00:01:09.219> you<00:01:09.369> will

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
that's simply swaps out but you will

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.120 
that's simply swaps out but you will
also<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:10.570> can<00:01:10.689> either<00:01:10.810> use<00:01:11.259> your<00:01:11.290> old<00:01:11.740> wiring

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
also you can either use your old wiring

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.130 
also you can either use your old wiring
loom<00:01:12.520> just<00:01:13.240> swap<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.600> over<00:01:13.689> from<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.110> old

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
loom just swap it over from the old

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.780 
loom just swap it over from the old
light<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.829> new<00:01:14.979> light<00:01:15.159> everything<00:01:15.670> will

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
light to the new light everything will

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.620 
light to the new light everything will
work<00:01:15.820> or<00:01:16.630> you<00:01:17.560> can<00:01:17.890> move<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.490> pins<00:01:18.759> over<00:01:19.030> so

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
work or you can move the pins over so

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.940 
work or you can move the pins over so
I'll<00:01:19.750> show<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.079> how<00:01:20.259> to<00:01:20.320> do<00:01:20.560> that

I'll show you how to do that
in<00:01:21.039> case<00:01:21.250> that's<00:01:21.399> an<00:01:21.610> option<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.780> need<00:01:23.079> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
in case that's an option you need to

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
follow so if you look into the connector

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.429 
follow so if you look into the connector
here<00:01:28.600> there<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.619> a<00:01:30.070> little<00:01:30.490> plastic<00:01:31.329> pin<00:01:32.079> at

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
here there is a little plastic pin at

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.209 
here there is a little plastic pin at
the<00:01:32.710> top<00:01:33.009> okay<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.789> you<00:01:34.359> can<00:01:34.539> just<00:01:34.930> leave<00:01:35.829> that

the top okay and you can just leave that

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.399 
the top okay and you can just leave that
up<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.789> pull<00:01:37.329> I'll<00:01:37.689> really<00:01:37.899> get<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:38.170> right

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
up and pull I'll really get this right

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
up and pull I'll really get this right
it's<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.710> little<00:01:38.890> bit

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.150 

yeah<00:01:46.180> okay<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.410> you<00:01:47.470> just<00:01:47.500> gotta<00:01:47.740> flip<00:01:48.040> this

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
yeah okay so you just gotta flip this

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.180 
yeah okay so you just gotta flip this
little<00:01:48.490> plastic<00:01:48.700> tab<00:01:49.210> up<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.630> there<00:01:50.190> you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
little plastic tab up in there you

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.000 
little plastic tab up in there you
better<00:01:51.340> see<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.820> there<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:53.110> I'm<00:01:53.170> pushing<00:01:53.890> it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
better see in there so I'm pushing it

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.620 
better see in there so I'm pushing it
towards<00:01:54.760> that<00:01:54.820> it's<00:01:55.030> almost<00:01:55.180> like<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.480> little

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
towards that it's almost like a little

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.080 
towards that it's almost like a little
mini<00:01:55.780> T<00:01:56.170> shape<00:01:56.560> here<00:01:56.800> so<00:01:57.310> I'm<00:01:57.400> just<00:01:57.550> pushing<00:01:57.790> it

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
mini T shape here so I'm just pushing it

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.469 
mini T shape here so I'm just pushing it
up<00:01:58.300> towards<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.380> top<00:01:59.410> of<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.920> T<00:02:00.280> okay<00:02:01.270> and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
up towards the top of that T okay and

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.780 
up towards the top of that T okay and
then<00:02:01.630> what<00:02:01.810> happens<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.500> pulls<00:02:02.800> out<00:02:03.160> the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
then what happens is it pulls out the

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.880 
then what happens is it pulls out the
bottom<00:02:04.150> like<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:04.720> with<00:02:05.200> its<00:02:05.380> little<00:02:05.530> rubber

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
bottom like so with its little rubber

longest screw doors easier and then you

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.840 
longest screw doors easier and then you
can<00:02:47.620> pull<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:47.860> out<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.280> can<00:02:48.430> see<00:02:48.610> there

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.370 
pin out I'm gonna just put the blank
into<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.660> middle<00:02:56.049> one<00:02:56.580> okay<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:58.380> push

into the middle one okay and just push
him<00:02:59.560> down<00:02:59.739> just<00:03:00.310> stops<00:03:00.489> water<00:03:00.790> getting<00:03:01.000> into

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
him down just stops water getting into

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.630 
him down just stops water getting into
the<00:03:01.390> connector<00:03:02.140> through<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.440> back<00:03:02.620> there<00:03:02.890> now

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
the connector through the back there now

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.220 
the connector through the back there now
I'm<00:03:03.790> gonna<00:03:03.970> take<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.630> old<00:03:05.350> connector<00:03:06.100> pin<00:03:06.370> and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
I'm gonna take the old connector pin and

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.840 
I'm gonna take the old connector pin and
right<00:03:08.230> where

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.970 

is<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.030> all<00:03:12.150> right<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.620> think<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.740> goes<00:03:13.860> that

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
is that all right I think it goes that

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.530 
is that all right I think it goes that
way<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:16.250> okay<00:03:17.250> okay<00:03:17.760> I'll<00:03:18.180> put<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.480> in

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
way that's okay okay I'll put that in

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.080 
way that's okay okay I'll put that in
and<00:03:18.990> now<00:03:19.440> when<00:03:19.650> we<00:03:19.680> change<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.190> light<00:03:20.370> that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
and now when we change the light that

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.840 
and now when we change the light that
will<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:22.410> will<00:03:22.470> pick<00:03:22.740> up<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.950> signal<00:03:23.400> for

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
will that will pick up the signal for

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.240 
will that will pick up the signal for
the<00:03:24.030> fog<00:03:24.780> light<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.290> our<00:03:25.440> red<00:03:25.650> bulb<00:03:25.890> will<00:03:26.040> work

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
the fog light and our red bulb will work

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.920 
the fog light and our red bulb will work
fine<00:03:26.490> so<00:03:26.670> that's<00:03:26.760> how<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.030> move<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.450> pins<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.900> a

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
fine so that's how to move the pins on a

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.150 
fine so that's how to move the pins on a
Ford<00:03:28.230> Ranger<00:03:28.470> Maria<00:03:29.400> liking<00:03:30.000> it
