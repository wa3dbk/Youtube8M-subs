00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
used by Sega Genesis and today we are

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.060 
used by Sega Genesis and today we are
fortunate<00:00:59.399> enough<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.600> have<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:01.070> dongles

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
fortunate enough to have little dongles

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.700 
fortunate enough to have little dongles
like<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.969> connect<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.710> this

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
like this that we can connect and this

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.000 
like this that we can connect and this
would<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.100> convert<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:06.470> USB<00:01:07.470> connector

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
would then convert it to a USB connector

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370 
would then convert it to a USB connector
that<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> modern<00:01:09.060> computer<00:01:09.380> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that we can use on a modern computer of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.030 
that we can use on a modern computer of
course<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.950> also<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.369> use<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.880> modern

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
course we can also just use a modern

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
where we covered the fire button these

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.410 
where we covered the fire button these
are<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.140> exact<00:01:57.590> same<00:01:57.619> switches<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.909> work<00:01:59.180> in

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
are the exact same switches that work in

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.680 
are the exact same switches that work in
the<00:01:59.509> fire<00:01:59.750> button<00:02:00.080> they're<00:02:00.800> just<00:02:01.159> actually

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
the fire button they're just actually

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.080 
the fire button they're just actually
screwed<00:02:02.690> on<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.400> bottom<00:02:04.400> of<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.640> joystick

housing so let's take a look at what

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.440 
housing so let's take a look at what
makes<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.289> work<00:02:09.590> basically<00:02:10.429> we've<00:02:11.090> got<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
makes this work basically we've got the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.520 
makes this work basically we've got the
housing<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.380> we've<00:02:12.530> got<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.920> stem<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:14.530> you

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
housing and we've got the stem that you

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.699 
housing and we've got the stem that you
can<00:02:15.709> see<00:02:15.920> goes<00:02:16.610> all<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:16.910> way<00:02:17.030> through<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:18.170> I'm

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
can see goes all the way through and I'm

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.500 
can see goes all the way through and I'm
going<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.860> just<00:02:19.010> take<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.370> apart<00:02:19.670> there<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.360> a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
going to just take it apart there is a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.550 
going to just take it apart there is a
sleeve<00:02:21.050> that<00:02:21.560> covers<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:23.090> stem<00:02:23.989> just<00:02:24.320> for

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
sleeve that covers the stem just for

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.530 
sleeve that covers the stem just for
aesthetics<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.459> looks<00:02:25.640> all<00:02:25.820> uniformed

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
aesthetics so it looks all uniformed

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.810 
aesthetics so it looks all uniformed
black<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.050> then<00:02:27.830> there's<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.100> collar<00:02:28.459> on<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
black and then there's a collar on the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.380 
black and then there's a collar on the
bottom<00:02:29.150> here<00:02:29.480> which<00:02:30.140> would<00:02:30.940> cover<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.150> hole

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
bottom here which would cover the hole

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.660 
bottom here which would cover the hole
on<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.350> control<00:02:33.709> panel<00:02:34.070> of<00:02:34.190> whatever<00:02:34.340> video

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
on the control panel of whatever video

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.850 
on the control panel of whatever video
game<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.300> was<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.050> wouldn't<00:02:36.320> see<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.530> hole

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
game it was so you wouldn't see the hole

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.160 
game it was so you wouldn't see the hole
and<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.760> would<00:02:37.910> sit<00:02:38.150> down<00:02:38.360> there<00:02:38.570> so<00:02:38.750> basically

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
and I would sit down there so basically

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.319 
and I would sit down there so basically
it<00:02:39.890> would<00:02:40.010> be<00:02:40.070> something<00:02:40.489> like<00:02:40.700> this

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
it would be something like this

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.960 
it would be something like this
underneath<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.350> panel<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:43.549> would<00:02:43.790> go

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
underneath the panel this would go

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.259 
underneath the panel this would go
through<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.299> hole<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:46.519> would<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:47.060> would

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
through a hole and that would this would

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.830 
through a hole and that would this would
cover<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.720> hole<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.170> then<00:02:48.620> sit<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.010> there<00:02:49.840> so

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
cover the hole and then sit in there so

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.090 
cover the hole and then sit in there so
now<00:02:50.870> what's<00:02:51.170> happening<00:02:51.560> when<00:02:51.709> we<00:02:51.829> move<00:02:52.010> a

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
now what's happening when we move a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.840 
now what's happening when we move a
joystick<00:02:53.110> basically<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:55.130> stem<00:02:55.780> will<00:02:57.430> push<00:02:58.430> on

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
joystick basically the stem will push on

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.300 
joystick basically the stem will push on
this<00:03:00.730> ring<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:03.260> direction<00:03:03.590> opposite<00:03:04.190> of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
this ring in the direction opposite of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.740 
this ring in the direction opposite of
what<00:03:04.430> you're<00:03:04.549> pushing<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.239> if<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.989> go<00:03:06.200> up<00:03:07.750> this

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
what you're pushing so if I go up this

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.680 
what you're pushing so if I go up this
switch<00:03:09.140> will<00:03:09.380> get<00:03:09.560> pushed<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.190> up<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.510> can

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
switch will get pushed so up and I can

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.650 
switch will get pushed so up and I can
see<00:03:11.980> what's<00:03:12.980> happening<00:03:13.430> there<00:03:13.640> see<00:03:14.630> that

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
see what's happening there see that

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.120 
see what's happening there see that
right<00:03:15.650> here<00:03:16.870> that's<00:03:17.870> pushing<00:03:18.260> this<00:03:18.560> button<00:03:18.769> so

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
right here that's pushing this button so

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.990 
right here that's pushing this button so
when<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.430> wired

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
when it's wired

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.020 
when it's wired
you<00:03:20.600> have<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:21.049> wire<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.860> manner<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.220> up

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
you have to wire it in a manner that up

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.610 
you have to wire it in a manner that up
is<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:25.190> switch<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:26.440> consequently<00:03:27.440> the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
is this switch and consequently the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.949 
is this switch and consequently the
opposite<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.070> true<00:03:28.100> wear<00:03:28.459> down<00:03:28.959> would

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
opposite is true wear down would

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.180 
opposite is true wear down would
activate<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:31.730> switch<00:03:32.120> down<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.890> that's

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
activate this switch down and that's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.710 
activate this switch down and that's
activate<00:03:34.760> now<00:03:34.880> this<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.209> four-way<00:03:35.540> joystick

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
activate now this is a four-way joystick

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.380 
activate now this is a four-way joystick
meaning<00:03:36.590> you've<00:03:37.070> got<00:03:37.310> just<00:03:37.549> four<00:03:37.850> directions

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
meaning you've got just four directions

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.630 
meaning you've got just four directions
to<00:03:38.570> move<00:03:38.780> in<00:03:38.989> games<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.950> used<00:03:40.190> four-way

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
to move in games that used four-way

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.979 
to move in games that used four-way
joysticks<00:03:41.180> were<00:03:41.420> games<00:03:41.900> like<00:03:42.260> pack

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
joysticks were games like pack

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.860 
joysticks were games like pack
the<00:03:44.200> classic<00:03:44.739> original<00:03:45.040> Donkey<00:03:45.790> Kong<00:03:46.030> if<00:03:46.299> you

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
the classic original Donkey Kong if you

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.380 
the classic original Donkey Kong if you
ever<00:03:47.110> tried<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.650> go<00:03:47.769> diagonal<00:03:48.519> on<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:49.120> game<00:03:49.360> like

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
ever tried to go diagonal on a game like

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.699 
ever tried to go diagonal on a game like
Donkey<00:03:49.930> Kong

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
Donkey Kong

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.940 
Donkey Kong
Mario<00:03:51.310> would<00:03:51.579> just<00:03:51.760> stand<00:03:52.030> there<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:53.290> doesn't

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
Mario would just stand there it doesn't

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.589 
Mario would just stand there it doesn't
register<00:03:54.420> now<00:03:56.040> some<00:03:57.040> games<00:03:57.310> work<00:03:57.670> better<00:03:57.939> with

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
register now some games work better with

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.839 
register now some games work better with
a<00:03:58.629> four-way<00:03:59.200> obviously<00:03:59.829> those<00:04:00.400> two<00:04:00.430> games

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
a four-way obviously those two games

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.420 
a four-way obviously those two games
would<00:04:01.209> certainly<00:04:01.569> work<00:04:01.840> better

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
would certainly work better

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.679 
would certainly work better
some<00:04:03.430> games<00:04:03.640> work<00:04:03.849> better<00:04:04.060> with<00:04:04.269> an<00:04:04.390> eight-way

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
some games work better with an eight-way

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.839 
some games work better with an eight-way
a<00:04:04.900> game<00:04:05.170> like<00:04:05.319> Street<00:04:05.739> Fighter<00:04:05.950> uses<00:04:06.730> an

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
a game like Street Fighter uses an

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.000 
a game like Street Fighter uses an
eight-way<00:04:07.209> joystick<00:04:07.439> what's<00:04:08.439> the<00:04:08.620> difference

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
eight-way joystick what's the difference

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.460 
eight-way joystick what's the difference
it's<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.579> same<00:04:09.909> joystick<00:04:10.689> the<00:04:10.989> only

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
it's the same joystick the only

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.160 
it's the same joystick the only
difference<00:04:11.950> is<00:04:12.189> this<00:04:13.150> little<00:04:13.480> ring<00:04:13.810> right

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
difference is this little ring right

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.529 
difference is this little ring right
here<00:04:14.620> would<00:04:15.459> be<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.639> slightly<00:04:16.120> larger

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
here would be a slightly larger

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.569 
here would be a slightly larger
circumference<00:04:17.910> basically<00:04:20.039> two<00:04:21.039> ways<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.430> can

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
circumference basically two ways you can

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.000 
circumference basically two ways you can
do<00:04:21.699> it<00:04:21.850> either<00:04:22.030> there<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.479> a<00:04:22.710> joystick<00:04:23.710> that<00:04:23.740> is

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
do it either there is a joystick that is

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.480 
do it either there is a joystick that is
made<00:04:24.310> slightly<00:04:24.910> bigger<00:04:25.270> here<00:04:25.690> or<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.979> can<00:04:27.250> get

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
made slightly bigger here or you can get

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.420 
made slightly bigger here or you can get
a<00:04:27.669> convertible<00:04:28.330> joystick<00:04:29.020> which<00:04:29.440> means<00:04:29.740> this

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
a convertible joystick which means this

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.939 
a convertible joystick which means this
ring<00:04:30.820> would<00:04:31.000> come<00:04:31.270> out<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:32.380> would<00:04:32.530> swap

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
ring would come out and you would swap

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.529 
ring would come out and you would swap
it<00:04:33.160> for<00:04:33.340> something<00:04:34.000> like<00:04:34.330> this<00:04:35.520> okay<00:04:36.520> as<00:04:36.729> you

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
it for something like this okay as you

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.029 
it for something like this okay as you
can<00:04:37.720> see<00:04:38.580> we've<00:04:39.580> got<00:04:40.380> see<00:04:41.380> if<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.530> can<00:04:41.650> focus

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
can see we've got see if I can focus

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.550 
can see we've got see if I can focus
here<00:04:42.449> this<00:04:43.449> ring<00:04:43.690> has<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.900> slightly<00:04:44.289> larger

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
here this ring has a slightly larger

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.240 
here this ring has a slightly larger
diameter<00:04:45.220> on<00:04:45.639> this<00:04:45.789> side<00:04:46.030> than<00:04:46.270> this<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:47.500> this

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
diameter on this side than this so this

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.029 
diameter on this side than this so this
would<00:04:48.550> go<00:04:48.789> in<00:04:49.180> here<00:04:49.810> remove<00:04:50.139> this<00:04:50.380> ring<00:04:50.710> down

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
would go in here remove this ring down

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.610 
would go in here remove this ring down
below<00:04:51.520> here<00:04:51.940> put<00:04:52.510> this<00:04:52.750> in<00:04:52.930> its<00:04:53.050> place

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
below here put this in its place

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.460 
below here put this in its place
that's<00:04:54.190> your<00:04:54.400> 4-way<00:04:54.840> if<00:04:55.840> you<00:04:55.990> need<00:04:56.229> an

that's your 4-way if you need an
eight-way<00:04:57.010> you<00:04:57.400> would<00:04:57.580> swap<00:04:58.180> it<00:04:58.360> up<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:58.750> drop

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
eight-way you would swap it up and drop

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.200 
eight-way you would swap it up and drop
it<00:04:59.680> in<00:04:59.919> there<00:05:00.099> now<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.610> fact<00:05:00.909> that<00:05:01.030> it's

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
it in there now the fact that it's

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.980 
it in there now the fact that it's
slightly<00:05:01.720> bigger<00:05:02.139> means<00:05:03.039> that<00:05:03.729> when<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:04.599> hit

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
slightly bigger means that when I hit

directions<00:05:10.150> I<00:05:10.949> will<00:05:11.949> activate<00:05:12.310> two<00:05:12.880> switches

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
directions I will activate two switches

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.430 
directions I will activate two switches
simultaneously<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:15.580> for<00:05:15.820> instance<00:05:16.440> this

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
simultaneously so for instance this

direction on a four-way joystick does
nothing<00:05:20.979> if<00:05:21.130> this<00:05:21.729> was<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.000> slightly<00:05:22.570> bigger

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
nothing if this was a slightly bigger

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.540 
nothing if this was a slightly bigger
circle<00:05:24.610> ring<00:05:24.880> it<00:05:25.210> would<00:05:25.449> activate<00:05:26.229> this<00:05:27.190> leaf

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
circle ring it would activate this leaf

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.540 
circle ring it would activate this leaf
and<00:05:28.169> this<00:05:29.169> leaf<00:05:29.229> at<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.979> same<00:05:30.190> time

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
and this leaf at the same time

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.939 
and this leaf at the same time
triggering<00:05:31.539> both<00:05:31.870> of<00:05:32.199> these<00:05:32.349> at<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.800> same

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
triggering both of these at the same

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.610 
triggering both of these at the same
time<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.760> then<00:05:34.479> the<00:05:34.659> controller<00:05:35.169> would<00:05:35.409> get

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
time and then the controller would get

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.520 
time and then the controller would get
the<00:05:35.770> signal<00:05:36.190> and<00:05:36.340> this<00:05:36.580> would<00:05:36.820> meet<00:05:37.030> make<00:05:37.449> a

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
the signal and this would meet make a

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.439 
the signal and this would meet make a
diagonal<00:05:38.849> corresponding<00:05:39.849> diagonal<00:05:40.180> which

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
diagonal corresponding diagonal which

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:41.370 
diagonal corresponding diagonal which
would<00:05:41.020> be

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
would be

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.310 
would be
the<00:05:41.740> opposite<00:05:42.280> on<00:05:42.430> this<00:05:43.000> end<00:05:43.240> you<00:05:43.510> get<00:05:44.110> that

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
the opposite on this end you get that

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.470 
the opposite on this end you get that
does<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:44.680> make<00:05:44.830> sense<00:05:44.970> basically<00:05:45.970> this

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
does that make sense basically this

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.720 
does that make sense basically this
little<00:05:46.720> ring<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.470> size<00:05:47.770> matters<00:05:48.370> if<00:05:48.550> it's

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
little ring the size matters if it's

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.450 
little ring the size matters if it's
this<00:05:49.510> diameter<00:05:49.930> it'll<00:05:50.560> only<00:05:50.830> be<00:05:51.130> able<00:05:51.280> to

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
this diameter it'll only be able to

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.270 
this diameter it'll only be able to
activate<00:05:51.940> one<00:05:52.330> switch<00:05:52.750> at<00:05:52.960> a<00:05:52.990> time<00:05:53.260> if<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:54.130> was

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
activate one switch at a time if it was

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.230 
activate one switch at a time if it was
slightly<00:05:54.880> larger<00:05:55.860> it<00:05:56.860> would<00:05:57.070> activate<00:05:57.430> two

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
slightly larger it would activate two

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.090 
slightly larger it would activate two
switches<00:05:58.600> see<00:05:59.410> if<00:05:59.920> you<00:06:00.130> can<00:06:00.340> hear<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.330> click<00:06:01.570> I

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
switches see if you can hear the click I

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.940 
switches see if you can hear the click I
don't<00:06:03.100> know<00:06:03.160> if<00:06:03.250> you<00:06:03.310> can<00:06:03.460> hear<00:06:03.670> the<00:06:03.760> click<00:06:03.940> I

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
don't know if you can hear the click I

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.230 
don't know if you can hear the click I
can<00:06:05.950> only<00:06:06.070> get<00:06:06.280> one<00:06:06.310> click<00:06:06.640> at<00:06:06.790> a<00:06:06.820> time<00:06:07.030> because

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
can only get one click at a time because

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.800 
can only get one click at a time because
I'm<00:06:07.450> set<00:06:08.050> to<00:06:08.320> a<00:06:08.700> four-way<00:06:09.700> right<00:06:10.030> now<00:06:10.180> slightly

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
I'm set to a four-way right now slightly

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.560 
I'm set to a four-way right now slightly
bigger<00:06:11.110> that<00:06:11.860> would<00:06:12.070> hit<00:06:12.430> them<00:06:12.640> both<00:06:12.850> and<00:06:13.150> then

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
bigger that would hit them both and then

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.370 
bigger that would hit them both and then
you've<00:06:13.750> got<00:06:13.990> an<00:06:14.400> eight-way<00:06:15.930> pretty<00:06:16.930> simple

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
you've got an eight-way pretty simple

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.700 
you've got an eight-way pretty simple
