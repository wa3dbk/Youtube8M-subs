 the important thing is that I'm happy not 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.300
 I want to talk more about the subject because I want 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 keep them private and I want it to be 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.659
 only a couple relationship 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.190
 a ratio of two a relationship of 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.140
 partner 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.820
 and have something with only those 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.180
 people I do not want others to know 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.180
 of 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.250
 I understand clearly that he does not want this 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.820
 let 's say it's a snowball but 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.820
 you said 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.400
 are you with this person with this person 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:40.800
 that we still do not know who speaks 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:43.580
 on the subject that person that person 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.580
 what are you dating 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.380
 he has not left before with that person 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.380
 today leave new 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.010
 that visit could not be someone 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:02.890
 new could be someone who has already gone through 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.350
 there someone from the past 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.940
 very happy very happy 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.810
 that giggle 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.700
 in the interview he makes out that 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.010
 could be 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.769
 that could be nor with the standard dijese 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.010
 I started or you did not say it was 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.830
 known that it was ahead is that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.890
 he loves you so much that he has marked you in 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.690
 the life that has been reborn that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:42.190
 love I do not know to me it sounds to me nor with the 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:43.630
 porsche the tail but neither has said 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.450
 not 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.450
 they asked you why 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.310
 possibly but the truth 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.599
 it is not telling you that it does not however 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.860
 the team 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:22.409
 we listen to this song 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.409
 and for me yes 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.090
 so also refresh the memory of life 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.090
 and maybe 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.090
 details 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.379
 it could be 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.550
 look 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.530
 look 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.050
 thank you for crossing 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.659
 from the camera I love 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.820
 good we saw in the images that you have 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:39.820
 to tell us about it there 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.440
 It is ok to explain that it explains no 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.860
 please what happens is that 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.669
 but not 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.060
 they had told me to sing a song and 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.009
 it did not come to my mind more than that 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.349
 song I love you so much but it's 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.000
 simple chance nothing more sing 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.159
 because it was the first thing that came to me 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.930
 the mind and nothing else 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:05.580
 let's say that like the first song 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:08.129
 present generally that is afloat 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.080
 in the unconscious that little song to 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:13.910
 through a song that I think 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.820
 by chance 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.500
 and I think we only want and 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.870
 you know and that you are very happy 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.200
 that you are very very very happy and with 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.440
 iconic nicholas the cutest spoon 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.060
 still but really only 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.780
 We want you to be a Disney and you are 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.780
 precious
