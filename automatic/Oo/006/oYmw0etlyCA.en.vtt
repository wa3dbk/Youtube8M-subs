a<00:01:03.749> semi<00:01:04.260> charged<00:01:04.559> shot<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:05.010> deal<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.220> bit<00:01:05.549> more

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
a semi charged shot can deal a bit more

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640 
a semi charged shot can deal a bit more
damage<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.420> I'd<00:01:06.540> say<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> fully<00:01:07.080> charged<00:01:07.380> shot

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
damage but I'd say a fully charged shot

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.900 
damage but I'd say a fully charged shot
is<00:01:07.770> probably<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.160> best<00:01:08.370> way<00:01:08.550> to<00:01:08.580> make<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
most out of this ability if you can land

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.620 
most out of this ability if you can land
one<00:01:11.190> of<00:01:11.280> these<00:01:11.400> fully<00:01:11.670> charged<00:01:12.060> shots<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.510> an

enemy you can deal up to about 70 damage
which<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.510> slightly<00:01:15.720> less<00:01:16.020> than<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.290> future

hitting an enemy directly it sometimes

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.660 
hitting an enemy directly it sometimes

enemy will walk into the explosion and
at<00:01:51.360> least<00:01:51.480> take<00:01:51.750> some<00:01:52.080> damage<00:01:52.260> rather<00:01:52.890> than

pea can deal quite a bit of damage but

pea can deal quite a bit of damage but
mastering<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.750> character<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.620> matter<00:01:59.070> of

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
mastering this character is a matter of

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.810 
mastering this character is a matter of
timing<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.970> practice<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.200> matter

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
timing and practice can get it matter

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
timing and practice can get it matter
okay<00:02:02.820> well<00:02:03.030> anyway<00:02:03.450> I'd<00:02:03.690> say<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.050> plasma<00:02:04.380> pea

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
okay well anyway I'd say the plasma pea

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
okay well anyway I'd say the plasma pea
seems<00:02:04.770> fairly<00:02:05.040> balanced<00:02:05.550> overall<00:02:05.909> plus

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
seems fairly balanced overall plus

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.880 
seems fairly balanced overall plus
considering<00:02:06.990> there's<00:02:07.170> already<00:02:07.320> electric

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
considering there's already electric

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
considering there's already electric
variants<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.519> other<00:02:08.640> plant<00:02:08.940> classes<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
variants for the other plant classes the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.149 
variants for the other plant classes the
plasma<00:02:09.869> pea<00:02:10.019> actually<00:02:10.470> fills<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> quota<00:02:11.039> for

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
plasma pea actually fills the quota for

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.589 
plasma pea actually fills the quota for
the<00:02:11.370> pea<00:02:11.489> shooter<00:02:11.519> class<00:02:11.969> pretty<00:02:12.299> well

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
the pea shooter class pretty well

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.390 
the pea shooter class pretty well
however<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:13.499> do<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:13.739> it's<00:02:13.980> about<00:02:14.129> time<00:02:14.340> we

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
however I do think it's about time we

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.949 
however I do think it's about time we
see<00:02:14.639> some<00:02:14.819> new<00:02:14.999> zombie

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
see some new zombie

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.539 
see some new zombie
since<00:02:16.379> the<00:02:16.530> last<00:02:16.650> ones<00:02:16.860> were<00:02:16.950> added<00:02:17.250> back<00:02:17.400> with

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
since the last ones were added back with

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.360 
since the last ones were added back with
