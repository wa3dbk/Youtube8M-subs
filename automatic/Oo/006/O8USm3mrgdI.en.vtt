00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 and this is what I'll teach them 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.150
 prepare today a basket of 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.700
 chocolate or a chocolate coke 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.880

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.949
 to need just and only this 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.010
 chocolate chocolate to melt in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.990
 pasta I'm going to use one of these one 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 of these soccer bowls set of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.390
 Kirchner who also sell at home 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.609
 magna and a bomb a balloon to which he 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.929
 sharpened and more or less this size and 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.250
 and I'll show you exactly 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.160
 that of course you can do it 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.410
 the size they want as they will have 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 realized I'm at home magna this 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.969
 warehouse that is the storage of the objects 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.649
 of the desire of all those who love to cook 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.329
 you already know that this section is 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.579
 called kitchen for those who do not cook in 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.989
 kitchen of a minute nothing more so 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.840
 The first thing I will do then is 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.910
 Take this chocolate to the microwave and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.160
 let's melt it there 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.890
 once our chocolate is ready 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.340
 let's look at it perfect very well very 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.030
 well let's put it here we will revolve 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.850
 very well for it to be released and a 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.260
 homogeneous pasta is what we are going to do 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.060
 It is to take the balloon and put callus 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.890
 let's of course cool down a 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.780
 little chocolate so we do not miss 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.700
 the balloon is going to explode and we give it 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.370
 turns there inside the chocolate until 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.860
 let our globe be like this 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.850
 next we put it on a plate and what 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.850
 we take to the fridge 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.430
 after a while we will see how 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.400
 it was our chocolate coke looks 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.550
 pretty pretty good over here we're going to 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.550
 watch 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.780
 and this is our chocolate coke what 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.020
 what we are going to do at this moment is 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.670
 release the pump let's cut it or 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.909
 let's pop it with a pin 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.110
 it would also be quite easy but with 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.830
 this is removed and very gently 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.740
 let's break the walls 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.160
 of the chocolate without it going to break and 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.590
 once we have finished extracting by 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.260
 complete our pump this is what 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.960
 we will have a plate of chocolate 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.940
 Fantastic very nice to look outside 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.880
 a perfect structure to serve there 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.590
 within the sweet that we want in this 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.800
 I'm going to put a white cake 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.550
 a little bit of equipment 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.550
 over 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.830
 some strawberries 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.340
 and we are going to put here 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.450
 and to give it a final touch I'm going to put 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.569
 the side 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.569
 and look exactly what we have 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.760
 obtained to surprise our 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.569
 physical a little chocolate or a 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.569
 chocolate basket
