00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.980
 very good morning people welcome in the 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.590
 last video tutorial in this tutorial 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.510
 let's do one thing when the 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.290
 comunitat and machine which is a machine 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.500
 of knight box in I have it here 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.480
 here I have an armed fence and list here 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.540
 first it goes to show how it works will 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.510
 teach them how to become first 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.340
 own are empty 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.500
 As you can see, this is going to sort out wool 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.619
 colors and an original extra game for 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.210
 pick up garbage here I have a cost with 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.770
 all these things there are some sites that 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 it has nothing to do 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.570
 and proceed to use the chest 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.600
 as well 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.850
 and then it is not stopped 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.170
 here 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.170
 if there is art 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:01.300
 It is garbage to teach how it works 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.300
 well first we have the cost 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.870
 this chest 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.020
 here like this 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.710
 with this all Persian 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.710
 now 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.580
 this 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.580
 since this works 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.920
 Not that much 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.030
 repeat here and here at this point 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.520
 a torch the palm down to come out and 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.460
 everyone here also passed one let's say 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.509
 that this one that were diamonds we put a 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.509
 whole stack diamonds 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.689
 buttons 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.440
 in their buttons are item garbage are equal 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.080
 easier to get the game in the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.790
 wood 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.740
 up here we worry 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.080
 another is in trash that makes different 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.080
 the buttons in this case the grass is 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.289
 like this we give you all our 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.289
 video 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.819
 I saw a diamond here 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.430
 we have a diamond 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.530
 and here what happens is that I have a 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.239
 diamond lights up is the second here 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.700
 for the declaration to shut down and that 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.500
 this can let me pass I have to leave 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.420
 pass an item 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.200
 the diamond that is here is work can 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.090
 go down here we are going to put more 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.760
 here as you can see is not happening 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.040
 nothing but if something is happening this is 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.349
 giving rally here we know time that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.140
 I've been another item I do not know but there it is 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.380
 working 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.950
 and the thing 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.760
 and if we repeat this many times 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.860
 we will get something like this 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.520
 as you can see here we have the hot 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.850
 bears 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.850
 as we want to stake and 64 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.880
 well done and here 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.090
 this me I have done to collect items 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.760
 This makes it all happen over here 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.380
 from me the ice comes the hardest part of 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.720
 get you have to get that tokyo 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.720
 we want to do this in survival 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.730
 anyone 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.110
 well here is the other method here as 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.129
 can see we have a cart with hopper 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.520
 he can distribute the different 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.770
 down 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.770
 here if I had dana 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:48.380
 quintana 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.330
 and the broth takes it 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.420
 and this with little patience is distributing 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:58.420
 items does everything makes all the chests 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.420
 ah 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.140
 against espanyol and chance 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.849
 two 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.160
 well here I have a one this machine 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.430
 iter computer that is a bit different 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.769
 to the other 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.090
 is the one that planned we will be survival 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.759
 have the changes that I have made there 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.230
 to improve it can not work with 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.230
 Water 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.689
 with 300 already and in one one tension and another 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:36.389
 put in iron peak the happiness 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:36.389
 the differences are not the same 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.919
 because I say 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.430
 gold 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.210
 because these items are these things 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.610
 that one talks about the mine one is going to 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.420
 mine and bring all things in inventory 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.180
 a hollow breath and 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.130
 is already being left alone some will say that 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.030
 it's very practical but instead of this 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.170
 chest 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.170
 we put an oven 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.259
 I tell them 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.129
 well it 's another different type and that's going to 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.999
 be also 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.999
 Here we go 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.979
 here as you can see it is almost the same 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.090
 i 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.800
 do not lose 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.289
 has one thing that I like that is what 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.939
 what am I going to do 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.939
 let's find a diamond 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.460
 and they are 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.460
 we have this here 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.070
 we put a diamond and if we put another 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.940
 Diamond 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.940
 what will he do 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.400
 reasons why I like 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.380
 because in this other model if we want 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.260
 highlight something first we occupy a stack 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.150
 whole of something the survival mode 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.150
 here you will have 64 diamonds 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.900
 and its own dome this is the 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.110
 simpler and that I think is more 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:18.050
 practical because we do not have to be 64 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.270
 of diamond to get blankets 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.240
 this malova we will be survival to see 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.539
 after 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.490
 and no cheating good this is all with the 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.490
 Spanish verbs goodbye
