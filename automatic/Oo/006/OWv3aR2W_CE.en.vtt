00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.790 

this<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.780> my<00:00:00.930> car<00:00:01.199> with<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.589> standard<00:00:02.460> halos

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.230 

and<00:00:18.800> here<00:00:19.430> is<00:00:19.900> my<00:00:20.900> car<00:00:21.110> looks<00:00:21.290> like<00:00:21.500> with<00:00:21.830> the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
and here is my car looks like with the

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.130 
and here is my car looks like with the
new<00:00:23.240> LED<00:00:23.720> bulbs<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:25.910> can<00:00:26.060> see<00:00:26.330> hopefully

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
new LED bulbs and you can see hopefully

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.800 
new LED bulbs and you can see hopefully
that<00:00:27.860> they<00:00:28.040> are<00:00:28.190> much<00:00:28.750> wire<00:00:30.250> than<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.810> factory

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
that they are much wire than the factory

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.900 
that they are much wire than the factory
bulbs<00:00:32.989> work

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.760 

and<00:00:37.150> there<00:00:37.450> it<00:00:37.540> is<00:00:37.600> with<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.930> headlights<00:00:38.440> turn

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
and there it is with the headlights turn

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:55.080 
and there it is with the headlights turn
on

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.650 

and<00:00:55.570> again<00:00:55.870> as<00:00:56.290> you<00:00:56.440> can<00:00:56.650> hopefully<00:00:57.130> see

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
and again as you can hopefully see

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.540 
and again as you can hopefully see
the<00:00:59.310> color<00:01:00.310> of<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:01.300> halos<00:01:01.800> matches<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
the color of the halos matches the

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.230 
the color of the halos matches the
pretty<00:01:05.180> much<00:01:05.360> exactly

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
pretty much exactly

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.139 
pretty much exactly
so<00:01:07.360> it's<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.689> much<00:01:07.869> more<00:01:08.110> unified<00:01:08.560> Lord

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.810 

the<00:01:15.409> only<00:01:16.409> thing<00:01:16.649> and<00:01:16.829> I<00:01:16.860> don't<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.460> I

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the only thing and I don't know if I'm I

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.760 
the only thing and I don't know if I'm I
don't<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:18.869> disappointed<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.649> this

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
don't know if I'm disappointed with this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.620 
don't know if I'm disappointed with this
or<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.299> but<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:22.170> brightness<00:01:22.679> of<00:01:22.860> these

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
or not but the brightness of these

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.719 
or not but the brightness of these
they're<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.780> any<00:01:24.990> brighter<00:01:25.289> than<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
they're not any brighter than the the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.719 
they're not any brighter than the the
factory<00:01:27.149> bulbs<00:01:27.659> were<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.229> fact<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.490> may<00:01:29.670> be

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
factory bulbs were in fact they may be

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.870 
factory bulbs were in fact they may be
very<00:01:30.119> slightly<00:01:30.960> dimmer<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:34.159> I<00:01:35.159> don't<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
very slightly dimmer and I don't know I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.050 
very slightly dimmer and I don't know I
don't<00:01:36.780> know<00:01:36.899> if<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.649> not<00:01:38.060> I'm

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
don't know if I like that or not I'm

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.139 
don't know if I like that or not I'm
considering<00:01:40.049> getting<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.039> a<00:01:41.460> set<00:01:41.789> of<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.969> 10

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
considering getting a a set of the 10

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.169 
considering getting a a set of the 10
watt<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.770> look<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.179> because

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
watt and see what they look like because

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.779 
watt and see what they look like because
I<00:01:45.299> would<00:01:45.569> like<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.049> him<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.649> little<00:01:47.610> bit

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
I would like for him to be a little bit

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.419 
I would like for him to be a little bit
brighter<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.179> think<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.069> don't<00:01:50.069> want<00:01:50.189> them<00:01:50.280> too

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
brighter I think I don't want them too

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.120 
brighter I think I don't want them too
bright<00:01:50.720> personally<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.349> ones

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
bright personally I think that the ones

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.339 
bright personally I think that the ones
that<00:01:53.220> come<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.459> the<00:01:53.549> new<00:01:53.899> BMWs<00:01:54.899> are<00:01:54.990> too<00:01:55.140> bright

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
that come on the new BMWs are too bright

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.499 
that come on the new BMWs are too bright
now<00:01:56.099> my<00:01:56.280> camera's<00:01:56.610> adjusted<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> exposure

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
now my camera's adjusted the exposure

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.160 
now my camera's adjusted the exposure
now<00:01:59.209> but<00:02:00.209> i<00:02:00.239> think<00:02:00.599> the<00:02:00.689> ones<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.959> come<00:02:01.079> on

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
now but i think the ones that come on

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.529 
now but i think the ones that come on
the<00:02:01.259> new<00:02:01.380> cars<00:02:01.619> are<00:02:01.799> too<00:02:01.950> bright<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.539> know

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
the new cars are too bright you know

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.850 
the new cars are too bright you know
they're<00:02:03.750> supposed<00:02:03.959> to<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:04.289> for<00:02:04.439> accent

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
they're supposed to be more for accent

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.069 
they're supposed to be more for accent
lighting<00:02:05.069> and<00:02:05.399> i<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:06.479> stand<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:06.899> too

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
lighting and i think they stand out too

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.169 
lighting and i think they stand out too
much<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.500> new<00:02:07.619> ones<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.640> I'm<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.119> sure

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
much on the new ones so I'm not sure

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.479 
much on the new ones so I'm not sure
what<00:02:09.299> I'll<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:10.019> like<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.069> said<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.250> really

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
what I'll do but like I said I really

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:21.030 
what I'll do but like I said I really
like<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.819> way<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.329> way<00:02:12.480> these<00:02:12.599> things<00:02:12.660> look

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.099 

you
