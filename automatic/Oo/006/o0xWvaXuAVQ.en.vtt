00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:10.080
 these are are the boots that I use 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.980
 regardless of the brand these are the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.020
 of eight are really fabulous boots 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.699
 for those who go hunts a little 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 extreme in the stones are really 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.849
 excellent but what I wanted to show 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.119
 me that are not extremely boots 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.610
 because the boots one there so many 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.770
 types of ox brands steps from beretta 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.469
 of eight mead so many others as to way 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.300
 talking about the newborn to his but that 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.510
 that while he was showing more than that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.829
 more to my friends from cacia 7 and this one 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.489
 which we found out that I don't 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.809
 I knew 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:59.699
 honestly these these are nails or 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.340
 make only one of the small nails that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.700
 are car nails for tires like 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.979
 of the machines that reproduce them one 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.110
 firm on the high italy the beast in 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.869
 grip that does not sell them will only sell them 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.350
 that mounts tires and some armory 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.430
 a few days boots dealers 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.330
 and you find it through a gunsmith 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.659
 the almeria moreno which I will later show you 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.119
 how montani is but i really am 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.619
 exceptional something really not 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.259
 believe I did not believe 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.119
 these once mounted on any 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.500
 terrain that you hardly see are others 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.710
 two millimeters 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.890
 these in the stones are really a thing 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.899
 truly truly exceptional is not 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.479
 slides no longer possible 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.060
 slipping I have had proofs are 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.100
 you are neither in the small full mountains 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.840
 of stones and type montenegro 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.430
 here you climb like a cat indeed 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.030
 they are nails that use a lot of 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.909
 mountaineers and these nails here which is a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.800
 kit consisting of a small key from 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:11.160
 a small key et al 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:13.650
 and from 49 from 18 nails it costs about 40 euros 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.770
 35 40 euro 45 the second where i 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.660
 contracts and these would be here is 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:30.360
 This I found that this is 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:34.260
 the kit the kits are made so it's a 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.790
 key to matthew rees and better one 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.780
 always key to put the nail with 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.780
 these little nails 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.380
 I try to zoom 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.750
 small, easy to assemble then 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.180
 I 'll do you in two seconds this year 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.450
 mount them or take them apart for a moment 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.450
 patience 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.200
 this is the boot you take the nail 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.930
 you put there a little towards a system 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.110
 from being put inside the key so inside 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.170
 that you have so and then it must be screwed of the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.450
 boot in strategic points where where 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.019
 one considers it appropriate or where it comes from 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.360
 said by the firm in the four corners 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.110
 in the lateral sounds 1 in the center of the 2 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.180
 for climbing 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.220
 this is a clear that mounts so then 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.170
 I do that then you can yes to mount and 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.730
 dismantle one of these that can be counted 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.340
 when ice and snow comes and 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.980
 then and rescheduling very well why not 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.780
 hole points tragic tips like one that 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.130
 can mount on a pair of boots and 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:02.819
 leave there throughout the winter 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:02.819
 this mounts itself so it rests turns 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:13.269
 a little pressure when on the nail 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:15.570
 goes down to the established point there is 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.570
 a 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.600
 that's a lot by chance 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.010
 a really really fabulous thing to 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.830
 end of season if you can't 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.660
 allow two pairs of boots 1 for a 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.380
 territory for another puts the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.340
 key inside where the nail turns 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.500
 on the contrary, simple retirement runs away 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.540
 nail 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:59.520
 here at the top where and of the boot 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:05:01.190
 this one does not even leave the hole 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.840
 that I said today that today 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.980
 I will put it online on the site 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.980
 Hi everyone
