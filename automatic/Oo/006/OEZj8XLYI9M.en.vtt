00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.919
 then I through two and against as one 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.960
 won the competition 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.000
 yes it was a bit weird at first 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.740
 That goal I think you think is it 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.100
 goal is ultimately no 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.980
 goal penalty exclusion come that 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.789
 in we push control for the much 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.650
 2000 still be with 11 against 10 we 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.960
 two now that exclusion comes from 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.400
 shoot 10 to 10 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.380
 you will come so they come back on 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.690
 penalty I do n't have that vase how and not 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.140
 well considering i can say or compacted 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.700
 was stuff or not I think and then 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.210
 then they make the two 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.850
 then they still have excluded from that 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.460
 yes indeed very difficult for the heart 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.960
 delicious such a max mara but ultimately 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.239
 we grab the three points and that was it 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.620
 most important in such 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.300
 it was there that he own Forum 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.350
 quarterfinal and you have to go to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.140
 just inside 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.510
 we did that now we will go half the time 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.309
 final play in open to hopefully the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.719
 final technical petri had to could 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.830
 becomes a crucial match against 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.689
 call without 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.189
 no yes it is if every match is 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.810
 social I go to the not at six 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.659
 we thought ok we must now first it is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.439
 on 6 suits and and yes so every match 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.750
 Up until now he was just social in 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.759
 so confused you today won the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.070
 next is crucial again 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.390
 we are and how we are going we are going until then 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.040
 until our last breath 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.350
 keep fighting and stay and stay 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.299
 try to keep working and counter him 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.689
 and hopefully we get the promotion 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.689
 in the end 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.330
 caps 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.980

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.960

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.010

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.580
