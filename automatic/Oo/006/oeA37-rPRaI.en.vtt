avocado on here now avocado is a great

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.360 
avocado on here now avocado is a great
choice<00:02:43.730> um<00:02:44.260> cool<00:02:45.260> instead<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.709> cheese<00:02:46.099> for

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
choice um cool instead of cheese for

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.520 
choice um cool instead of cheese for
example<00:02:46.879> because<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.659> does<00:02:47.840> have<00:02:48.049> fat<00:02:48.319> in<00:02:48.349> it

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
example because it does have fat in it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.780

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
haven't seen one before you're going to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.399 
haven't seen one before you're going to
cut<00:03:05.239> all<00:03:05.359> the<00:03:05.510> way<00:03:05.599> around<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:06.909> and<00:03:07.909> then<00:03:08.629> after

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
you're done cutting around it you'll be

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.000 
you're done cutting around it you'll be
able<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.939> kind<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.150> just<00:03:11.299> twist<00:03:11.689> it<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.139> then

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
able to kind of just twist it and then

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.550 
able to kind of just twist it and then
you<00:03:13.129> have<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.400> open<00:03:13.669> like<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.349> thing

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
you have it open like this so the thing

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.319 
you have it open like this so the thing
about<00:03:15.709> an<00:03:15.829> avocado<00:03:16.250> as<00:03:16.519> I<00:03:16.669> said<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.180> has

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
about an avocado as I said it has

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.270 
about an avocado as I said it has
healthy<00:03:17.750> fat<00:03:17.989> but<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.379> does<00:03:18.560> still<00:03:18.739> have<00:03:19.010> a

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
healthy fat but it does still have a

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.879 
healthy fat but it does still have a
fair<00:03:20.090> amount<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.450> fat<00:03:20.629> in<00:03:20.659> it<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.409> today<00:03:21.680> we're

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
fair amount of fat in it so today we're

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.020 
fair amount of fat in it so today we're
going<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.040> use<00:03:22.189> about<00:03:22.430> an<00:03:22.579> eighth<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.909> an

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
going to use about an eighth of an

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.509 
going to use about an eighth of an
avocado<00:03:23.150> which<00:03:24.109> is<00:03:24.260> about<00:03:24.439> five<00:03:24.739> grams<00:03:25.099> of<00:03:25.340> fat

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
avocado which is about five grams of fat

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.319 
avocado which is about five grams of fat
so<00:03:25.900> this<00:03:26.900> would<00:03:27.049> be<00:03:27.079> about<00:03:27.349> a<00:03:27.409> fourth<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:30.159> then

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
so this would be about a fourth and then

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.819 
so this would be about a fourth and then
this<00:03:32.329> would<00:03:32.780> be<00:03:32.900> about<00:03:33.079> an<00:03:33.260> eighth<00:03:35.379> ok<00:03:36.379> so<00:03:36.440> what

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
this would be about an eighth ok so what

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.199 
this would be about an eighth ok so what
we're<00:03:36.949> going<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.129> do<00:03:37.310> is<00:03:37.790> you're<00:03:37.879> just<00:03:37.970> going
