that<00:00:22.980> some<00:00:23.310> size<00:00:23.609> we're<00:00:23.880> turning<00:00:24.240> better<00:00:24.420> than

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
that some size we're turning better than

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.349 
that some size we're turning better than
others<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.740> still<00:00:26.070> felt<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.580> needed<00:00:27.090> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
others but I still felt like I needed to

like it's turning equally on every side
the<00:00:49.500> size<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.309> puzzle<00:00:50.840> this<00:00:51.840> puzzle<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the size of this puzzle this puzzle is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
the size of this puzzle this puzzle is
actually<00:00:53.309> bigger<00:00:54.300> than<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.600> Diane<00:00:55.199> +<00:00:55.620> M<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.480> this

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
actually bigger than a Diane + M if this

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.880 
actually bigger than a Diane + M if this
puzzle<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.870> actually<00:00:58.260> bigger<00:00:58.440> than<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.680> MF

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
puzzle is actually bigger than a MF

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.579 
puzzle is actually bigger than a MF
eight<00:00:59.219> megaminx<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.539> bigger<00:01:00.989> than<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.289> QJ

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
eight megaminx and it's bigger than a QJ

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
eight megaminx and it's bigger than a QJ
see<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.600> bit<00:01:06.750> hard<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
see it's so a little bit hard to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.649 
see it's so a little bit hard to
show<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.530> maybe<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.890> could<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
show but maybe you could see that and

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.640 
show but maybe you could see that and
these<00:01:09.659> are<00:01:09.720> tiled<00:01:10.170> too<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.350> bigger

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
these are tiled too so it's a bigger

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.320 
these are tiled too so it's a bigger
megaminx<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> actually<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
megaminx and I actually like that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.679 
megaminx and I actually like that
because<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.409> wasn't<00:01:17.250> comfortable<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.060> QJ

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
because I wasn't comfortable with the QJ

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.130 
because I wasn't comfortable with the QJ
sighs<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.280> felt<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.299> small<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.080> my

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
sighs it just felt a little small in my

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.010 
sighs it just felt a little small in my
hands<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.270> better<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
hands so I like this better I like that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.899 
hands so I like this better I like that
it's<00:01:25.200> bigger<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.530> feel<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> better

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it's bigger I feel like I have a better

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.140 
it's bigger I feel like I have a better
grip<00:01:27.210> better<00:01:27.930> control<00:01:28.439> over<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.920> puzzle<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
grip better control over the puzzle the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.480 
grip better control over the puzzle the
way<00:01:30.360> I'm<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.500> sure<00:01:31.710> about<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> way<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.159> feels

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
way I'm not sure about the way it feels

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.539 
way I'm not sure about the way it feels
the<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.299> great<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.650> let's<00:01:35.250> talk<00:01:35.400> about

the way it's great the let's talk about
let's<00:01:35.970> talk<00:01:36.090> about<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.509> ridges<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.049> this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
let's talk about the ridges of this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.710 
let's talk about the ridges of this
puzzle<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.890> actually<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> ridges<00:01:39.450> on

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
puzzle I actually like the ridges on

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.649 
puzzle I actually like the ridges on
this<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.350> feel<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.700> gives<00:01:42.119> me<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
this I feel like it just gives me just a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.319 
this I feel like it just gives me just a
better<00:01:42.869> hold<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.009> better<00:01:44.189> better<00:01:44.759> grip<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
better hold and a better better grip of

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.770 
better hold and a better better grip of
this<00:01:45.869> puzzle<00:01:46.909> I've<00:01:47.909> actually<00:01:48.060> tried<00:01:48.479> without

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
this puzzle I've actually tried without

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.149 
this puzzle I've actually tried without
ridges<00:01:49.579> well<00:01:50.579> let<00:01:50.790> me<00:01:50.880> explain<00:01:50.970> better<00:01:52.130> when<00:01:53.130> I

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
ridges well let me explain better when I

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.550 
ridges well let me explain better when I
first<00:01:53.610> got<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.090> one<00:01:54.329> there<00:01:55.079> were<00:01:55.290> three

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
first got this one there were three

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.389 
first got this one there were three
corners<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.610> came<00:01:56.939> without<00:01:57.329> ridges<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
corners that came without ridges so I I

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.130 
corners that came without ridges so I I
was<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.820> testing<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.299> out<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> noticed

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
was just testing it out and I noticed

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.109 
was just testing it out and I noticed
that<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.979> parts<00:02:02.280> without<00:02:02.460> ridges<00:02:02.939> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that the one the parts without ridges I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.569 
that the one the parts without ridges I
wasn't<00:02:03.750> gripping<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.409> well<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.890> my

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
wasn't gripping it as well and my

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.240 
wasn't gripping it as well and my
fingers<00:02:05.939> would<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.689> more<00:02:07.290> most<00:02:07.799> likely<00:02:08.009> just

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
fingers would just more most likely just

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.880 
fingers would just more most likely just
slip<00:02:08.520> off<00:02:08.729> more<00:02:09.090> than<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:09.690> ridges<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.860> I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
slip off more than just with ridges so I

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.090 
slip off more than just with ridges so I
think<00:02:11.129> with

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
think with

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.720 
think with
bridges<00:02:12.400> it's<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:12.910> better<00:02:13.450> grip<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.730> less

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
bridges it's just better grip and less

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.660 
bridges it's just better grip and less
chance<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.480> me<00:02:16.690> like<00:02:16.960> slipping<00:02:17.860> away<00:02:17.980> making

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
chance of me like slipping away making

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.130 
get into corner cutting off this puzzle
let's<00:03:21.760> just<00:03:22.110> immediately<00:03:23.110> go<00:03:23.440> for<00:03:23.740> 36<00:03:24.370> degrees

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
let's just immediately go for 36 degrees

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.580 
let's just immediately go for 36 degrees
and<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.800> does<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.370> was<00:03:28.000> nice<00:03:28.540> let's<00:03:29.350> try<00:03:29.530> a

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
and it does it I was nice let's try a

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.640 
and it does it I was nice let's try a
little<00:03:29.710> bit<00:03:29.860> more<00:03:30.310> maybe<00:03:30.550> maybe<00:03:31.300> they're<00:03:31.780> just

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
little bit more maybe maybe they're just

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.650 
little bit more maybe maybe they're just
a<00:03:32.830> little<00:03:33.100> bit<00:03:33.190> more<00:03:33.400> that's<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.300> little<00:03:34.540> bit

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
a little bit more that's a little bit

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.710 
a little bit more that's a little bit
more<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:36.130> does<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.460> let's<00:03:37.120> try<00:03:37.300> reverse

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
more and it does it let's try reverse

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.020 
more and it does it let's try reverse
cut<00:03:38.080> let's<00:03:38.770> just<00:03:38.830> immediately<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:39.670> go<00:03:39.850> for

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
cut let's just immediately just go for

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.740 
cut let's just immediately just go for
there<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.410> does<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.740> let's<00:03:41.950> go<00:03:42.130> for<00:03:42.370> more

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
there and it does it let's go for more

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.170 
there and it does it let's go for more
and<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.840> doesn't<00:03:44.050> so<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:44.800> puzzle<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.490> really

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
and it doesn't so this puzzle is really

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.210 
and it doesn't so this puzzle is really
nice<00:03:46.330> for<00:03:46.470> corner<00:03:47.470> cutting<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.950> reverse

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
nice for corner cutting and reverse

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.210 
nice for corner cutting and reverse
corner<00:03:48.550> cutting<00:03:49.350> if<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.500> compare<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.130> you

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
corner cutting if you compare it to you

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.300 
corner cutting if you compare it to you
like<00:03:51.460> a<00:03:51.490> QJ<00:03:52.060> if<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.900> corner<00:03:53.260> cut<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.800> can<00:03:54.040> do<00:03:54.190> it

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
like a QJ if you corner cut it can do it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.400 
like a QJ if you corner cut it can do it
that's<00:03:54.670> nice<00:03:54.910> but<00:03:55.570> if<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.810> reverse<00:03:56.050> cut<00:03:56.260> this

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
that's nice but if you reverse cut this

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.400 
that's nice but if you reverse cut this
thing<00:03:56.470> can<00:03:56.770> just<00:03:56.950> explode<00:03:57.580> or<00:03:57.850> pop<00:03:58.360> okay<00:03:59.200> let's

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
thing can just explode or pop okay let's

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.730 
thing can just explode or pop okay let's
go<00:03:59.560> over<00:03:59.770> pops<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.250> lock<00:04:00.370> up<00:04:01.470> lockups<00:04:02.470> I

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
go over pops and lock up lockups I

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.770 
go over pops and lock up lockups I
wouldn't<00:04:03.250> say<00:04:03.460> that<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:03.790> puzzle<00:04:04.330> have

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
wouldn't say that this puzzle have

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.960 
wouldn't say that this puzzle have
lockups<00:04:05.320> maybe<00:04:06.070> when<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.370> make<00:04:06.610> little

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
lockups maybe when I make little

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.600 
lockups maybe when I make little
mistakes<00:04:07.110> here<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.140> there<00:04:08.290> but<00:04:08.620> that's

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
mistakes here and there but that's

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.040 
mistakes here and there but that's
really<00:04:10.620> mostly<00:04:11.620> just<00:04:11.860> me<00:04:12.870> overall<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
really mostly just me overall the

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.050 
really mostly just me overall the
suppose<00:04:14.320> it<00:04:14.440> really<00:04:14.710> doesn't<00:04:15.160> lock<00:04:15.610> up<00:04:15.820> it's

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
suppose it really doesn't lock up it's

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.800 
suppose it really doesn't lock up it's
just<00:04:16.420> really<00:04:16.810> nice<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.940> really<00:04:19.450> nice<00:04:19.600> the

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
just really nice just really nice the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:20.810 
just really nice just really nice the
way<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:19.930> is

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
way it is

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.689 
way it is
this<00:04:21.820> never<00:04:22.180> ever<00:04:22.539> pops<00:04:23.080> on<00:04:23.380> me<00:04:23.590> I've<00:04:24.430> never

this never ever pops on me I've never

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.420 
this never ever pops on me I've never
received<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.330> pop<00:04:25.539> on<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:25.870> caps<00:04:26.500> don't<00:04:27.190> pop

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
received a pop on this caps don't pop

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.659 
received a pop on this caps don't pop
off<00:04:27.639> nothing<00:04:28.539> ever<00:04:28.840> pops<00:04:29.320> on<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.680> puzzle<00:04:29.919> so

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
probably a little bit dirty but you can

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.540 
probably a little bit dirty but you can
just<00:04:49.419> see<00:04:49.630> how<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:49.960> looks<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.620> I'll<00:04:51.340> show

be<00:05:31.000> a<00:05:31.120> problem<00:05:31.419> because<00:05:31.690> my<00:05:32.199> other<00:05:32.590> behind

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490
