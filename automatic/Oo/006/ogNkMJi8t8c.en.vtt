in my last video I discussed how saints
row<00:00:15.630> 4<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.080> state<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.470> decay<00:00:16.710> have<00:00:16.890> both<00:00:17.070> been

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
row 4 and state of decay have both been

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.790 
row 4 and state of decay have both been
refused<00:00:17.730> classification<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.630> Australia<00:00:19.199> so

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
refused classification in Australia so

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.080 
refused classification in Australia so
today<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> figured<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> first<00:00:20.730> thing<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.970> would

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
today I figured the first thing I would

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.429 
today I figured the first thing I would
do<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.420> news<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.660> give<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> quick<00:00:22.320> update

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
do for news is give you a quick update

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.980 
do for news is give you a quick update
on<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.890> situation<00:00:23.609> firstly<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> modified

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
on that situation firstly a modified

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.599 
on that situation firstly a modified
version<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.470> state<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.980> decay<00:00:26.220> has<00:00:26.430> been

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
version of state of decay has been

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.880 
version of state of decay has been
resubmitted<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.390> classification<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.710> game

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
resubmitted for classification the game

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.800 
resubmitted for classification the game
was<00:00:29.070> originally<00:00:29.189> denied<00:00:29.849> classification<00:00:30.630> due

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
was originally denied classification due

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.209 
was originally denied classification due
to<00:00:30.929> its<00:00:31.050> incentivized<00:00:31.710> drug<00:00:32.009> use<00:00:32.189> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
to its incentivized drug use of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.700 
to its incentivized drug use of
real-world<00:00:32.640> drugs<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.480> game<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.500> likely

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
real-world drugs in game so it's likely

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.350 
real-world drugs in game so it's likely
that<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.070> modified<00:00:35.399> version<00:00:35.790> has<00:00:35.969> probably

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
that the modified version has probably

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
that the modified version has probably
just<00:00:36.540> changed<00:00:36.989> those<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.469> either<00:00:37.559> fake<00:00:37.920> names

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
just changed those to either fake names

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
just changed those to either fake names
or<00:00:38.460> maybe<00:00:39.030> change<00:00:39.360> them<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:39.960> real-world

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
or maybe change them from real-world

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740 
or maybe change them from real-world

drugs names to things like vitamins the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.299
