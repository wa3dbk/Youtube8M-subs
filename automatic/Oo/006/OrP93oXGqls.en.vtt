button<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.630> go<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.170> uh<00:03:58.640> you<00:03:59.640> know<00:03:59.760> you'll

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
button and you go and uh you know you'll

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.940 
button and you go and uh you know you'll
get<00:04:00.480> improvement<00:04:01.049> this<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.350> one<00:04:01.530> where<00:04:01.769> it's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
get improvement this is one where it's

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.460 
get improvement this is one where it's
actually<00:04:02.070> hands<00:04:02.640> on<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.660> get<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.930> go<00:04:04.049> in<00:04:04.230> and

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
actually hands on you get to go in and

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.349 
actually hands on you get to go in and
work<00:04:04.560> on<00:04:04.769> your<00:04:04.829> tackling<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.760> strafing<00:04:06.120> and

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
work on your tackling and strafing and

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.110 
work on your tackling and strafing and
something<00:04:07.320> new<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.980> Madden<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.640> think<00:04:08.970> its<00:04:09.090> new

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
something new to Madden I think its new

this year I'm played Madeline two years

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.910 
this year I'm played Madeline two years
but<00:04:11.220> if<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.630> hit<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.079> left<00:04:13.470> white

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
but if you hit the left white

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.509 
but if you hit the left white
we<00:04:15.040> I<00:04:16.260> had<00:04:17.260> him<00:04:17.410> right<00:04:17.530> there<00:04:17.709> if<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.250> hit<00:04:18.370> the

we I had him right there if you hit the
left<00:04:18.760> trigger<00:04:19.060> then<00:04:19.900> we'll<00:04:20.019> kind<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.260> straight

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
left trigger then we'll kind of straight

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.640 
left trigger then we'll kind of straight
and<00:04:20.859> square<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.280> up<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.639> then<00:04:22.050> hit<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.230> it's

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
called a precision tackle they both left

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.159 
called a precision tackle they both left
in<00:04:27.280> which<00:04:27.669> I<00:04:27.850> tried<00:04:28.090> on<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.450> last<00:04:28.630> one<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:29.080> the

me and shady Connor ran over me I think
obviously<00:05:00.000> we're<00:05:01.000> gonna<00:05:01.150> need<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:01.450> improve

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
obviously we're gonna need to improve

our<00:05:02.020> strength<00:05:02.710> oh<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:04.030> did<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.270> again<00:05:04.600> I'm

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
our strength oh it did it again I'm

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.570 
our strength oh it did it again I'm
right<00:05:05.860> there<00:05:06.130> I'm<00:05:06.460> making<00:05:06.639> a<00:05:06.880> tackle<00:05:07.150> ah<00:05:08.580> this

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
right there I'm making a tackle ah this

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.210 
right there I'm making a tackle ah this
isn't<00:05:09.790> good<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:11.139> know<00:05:11.229> Baris<00:05:11.710> out<00:05:11.889> here<00:05:12.100> on

isn't good you know Baris out here on

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.540 
isn't good you know Baris out here on
the<00:05:12.280> practice<00:05:12.430> field<00:05:14.070> you<00:05:15.070> know<00:05:15.190> we<00:05:15.340> got<00:05:15.460> to

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
the practice field you know we got to

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.310 
the practice field you know we got to
work<00:05:15.669> on<00:05:15.820> that<00:05:15.880> we<00:05:16.240> can<00:05:16.510> you've<00:05:16.810> also<00:05:16.990> hit<00:05:17.290> the

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
work on that we can you've also hit the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.890 
work on that we can you've also hit the
air<00:05:17.919> we<00:05:18.190> go<00:05:18.340> here<00:05:18.880> i<00:05:18.910> say<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.390> hit<00:05:19.720> the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
air we go here i say to you hit the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.969 
air we go here i say to you hit the
right<00:05:20.770> stick<00:05:21.100> just<00:05:21.490> like<00:05:21.610> you<00:05:21.729> could<00:05:22.229> i<00:05:23.229> oh<00:05:23.740> no

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
right stick just like you could i oh no

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.500 
right stick just like you could i oh no
I<00:05:24.220> guess<00:05:24.400> last<00:05:24.669> year<00:05:24.850> and<00:05:25.120> ever<00:05:25.270> since

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
I guess last year and ever since

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.710 
I guess last year and ever since
probably<00:05:25.870> 05<00:05:26.350> you<00:05:26.620> know<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.830> hit<00:05:26.979> stick<00:05:27.720> which

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
probably 05 you know the hit stick which

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.390 
probably 05 you know the hit stick which
is<00:05:28.870> awesome<00:05:29.110> that's<00:05:29.530> a<00:05:29.620> great<00:05:29.830> feature<00:05:30.039> to

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
is awesome that's a great feature to

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.510 
is awesome that's a great feature to
have<00:05:31.030> and<00:05:31.450> it's<00:05:32.020> just<00:05:32.260> a<00:05:32.350> matter<00:05:32.500> of<00:05:32.620> are<00:05:33.070> you

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
have and it's just a matter of are you

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.430 
have and it's just a matter of are you
lined<00:05:33.820> up<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:34.300> are<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.050> going<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.200> hit<00:05:35.410> the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
lined up and are you going to hit the

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.130 
lined up and are you going to hit the
ball<00:05:36.370> carrier<00:05:36.789> square<00:05:37.210> see<00:05:37.690> that<00:05:37.870> was<00:05:38.020> the

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
ball carrier square see that was the

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.600 
ball carrier square see that was the
precision<00:05:38.620> tack<00:05:38.800> well<00:05:39.010> it's<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.220> pretty<00:05:39.430> cool

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
precision tack well it's a pretty cool

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.909 
precision tack well it's a pretty cool
animation<00:05:40.210> whether<00:05:40.360> you<00:05:40.510> go<00:05:40.690> low<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:40.960> take

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
animation whether you go low and take

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.230 
animation whether you go low and take
the<00:05:42.070> feet<00:05:42.280> out<00:05:43.080> but<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.530> know<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:44.650> really<00:05:44.979> think

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
the feet out but you know I really think

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.000 
the feet out but you know I really think
they've<00:05:46.240> really<00:05:46.600> made<00:05:46.630> an<00:05:46.960> effort<00:05:47.140> to<00:05:47.620> reduce

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
they've really made an effort to reduce

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.600 
they've really made an effort to reduce
people<00:05:48.850> just<00:05:49.090> fly<00:05:49.330> around<00:05:50.070> almost<00:05:51.070> like<00:05:51.490> if

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
people just fly around almost like if

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.010 
people just fly around almost like if
you<00:05:51.700> guys<00:05:51.820> play<00:05:52.030> fifa<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.450> same<00:05:52.660> there<00:05:52.870> maybe

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
you guys play fifa the same there maybe

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.719 
you guys play fifa the same there maybe
if<00:05:53.410> you're<00:05:53.590> on<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:53.830> sprint<00:05:54.160> button<00:05:54.400> all<00:05:54.610> the
