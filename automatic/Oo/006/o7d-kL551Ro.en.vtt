 hello with you dimon in this issue 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.659
 I decided to show how to do 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.410
 big house modern style now i will show 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.820
 which will go down in this video lesson 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.369
 this is the first part 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.369
 and the first release on my new channel 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.950
 so let's start a house like this should 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.280
 be big so beautiful here with 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.590
 road comrades with a pool he's inside 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.540
 simple ugly now i will show how we 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.780
 we will do as it should 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.780
 so take blue and not white 6 as 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:45.080
 beautiful set our first year set 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:49.890
 its height is 5 counting the site at 41234 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:54.330
 it turns out so 5 retreat three four 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.300
 block and salt and count blocks 1 2 3 4 5 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.620
 Further on this will be inserted like this 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.380
 here we take the oak far oak 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.990
 survey boards oak and set like this to 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.970
 they turned over so they 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.610
 turned over of course in the army latex from 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.460
 my savings though what's my channel for 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 Acceptance is necessary if those who build 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.360
 survival respect it is very difficult so 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.320
 what can under the material be saved 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.320
 need a lot 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.880
 my need a lot of dinner so 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.790
 will do 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.420
 that doesn't work 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.450
 listen to some 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.450
 and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.079
 gut beetles 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.079
 the performance turned out 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.780
 so then we take oak boards 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.060
 her we and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.060
 not that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.010
 we take oak boards 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.140
 it was the boards two and the steelmakers 2 and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.760
 height is also 5 days 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.410
 nothing is 59 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.280
 34 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:35.130
 Then take the same snow again and Stalin also 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.130
 strand and height further we take 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.180
 glass 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.410
 I remind May I have such a resource 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.620
 pak that 's true to me 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.310
 generally 1721 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.550
 at 34 so we insert 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:59.720
 miss 2 here and also became 14 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.320
 Then we take the snow again and gave it themselves 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.320
 on top of 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.340
 insert a delay here is my door and 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.650
 ordinary noticeable same glass by the way 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.540
 then in power mod 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.090
 swing this resource and so 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.580
 it turns out and almost imperceptibly further 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.380
 what 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.020
 just need to put a balcony 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.450
 a small one near the front door 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.900
 a small balcony from here 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.760
 we start one two three four and once again 1 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:36.630
 2 3 4 then take the usual fence is not aske 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.160
 ordinary fence set here so on 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.490
 Now I will see what is needed next 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.960
 do we take oak boards now 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.960
 I'll show you how much you need to retreat 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.300
 and 455 retreat 6 didnâ€™t 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.110
 like this 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.110

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.320
 234 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.389
 Stalin is such a wall 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.860
 general survival is build very 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:40.080
 difficult to do next here 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.130
 small pool come on like this not here

 further down part of the block 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.460
 itself should be six blocks 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.529
