00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:07.649
 tip more beauty for the planet in 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.420
 this time we are going to make a pretty 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.730
 giraffe with materials that you're going to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.790
 find surely first we're going to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.260
 need or my yellow paint coffee 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.470
 dark hot chocolate coffee without 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.470
 chocolate or café marc and also some 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.780
 West agujeta handle pockets 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.850
 good gifts I have this bike 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.870
 that be coffee and if not good with ate and 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.660
 he cuts his people 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.460
 and the very famous wooden clamps that 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.900
 we do not use them anymore, so you have to 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.150
 take advantage of all that remained there 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.390
 restored in the house and with those 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.920
 we have more 7 with 3 ready we do not need 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.600
 plus an indelible down black brush and 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.059
 maybe some pencil or pen and 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.430
 you have to mark and of course not 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.650
 we can jump the scissors and the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.750
 white glue good first thing 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.940
 let's make our comic we're going to 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.700
 mark an oval in this way 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.150
 we mark and then we're going to do the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.390
 famous head of the tour since what 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.790
 we ready we will cut as 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.930
 it is cut very easy with 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 our 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.680
 brush let's take some paint 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.710
 bitter dark chocolate and let's 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.720
 flip it sideways we mark it and go to 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.090
 make the famous little spots we're going to 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.010
 I recommend doing a lot of circulitos 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.610
 be a thin brush 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.070
 already with her little princess without the cat 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.860
 obviously this is the body of your life 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.590
 and this is very father if you have children 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.380
 good is great because with your finger 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.240
 they can go putting the little spots 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.700
 then that is his famous and good 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.380
 collaboration then that's very father 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.750
 because they are also putting their 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.430
 spots are the fingerprints that 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.870
 they are the famous signatures of babies 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.210
 then it's great because it 's 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.790
 full of signatures and it's a good memory of 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.300
 your next good we're going to put all the 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.300
 stains 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.310
 then we will stay like this 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.250
 since we have it that way we're going to leave it 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.170
 dry and meanwhile we will grab 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.420
 our wooden clamp and let's 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.160
 put the speckles also if we are going to 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.560
 do the legs this is going to be the part 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.970
 from below the legs then here you go 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.470
 to eat 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.470
 all this dark coffee 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.150
 and well you have to let it dry then 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.700
 let's leave it like that but then what 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.659
 we do it differently and we're going to 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.659
 put the stains 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.670
 circuits or fingers of our 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.670
 little one in this parents 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.660
 because look is the first job that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.349
 do together and apart from all these 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.349
 firms 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.819
 and so you will mark it in the case of 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.150
 well, just put a bunch of 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.150
 stain 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.220
 ready since what we have like that we're going to 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.890
 cut the face while all this is 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.320
 is drying we trimmed the face and with the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.560
 black down we're going to mark the eyes the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.320
 mouth and well we leave it there a little while 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.390
 it does not have to be removed and with what we 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.300
 it is there of bits we make the tail 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.630
 you just have to mark well and 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.780
 we do the speck ready now what 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.540
 let's do first let's grab the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.030
 neck because we have here the neck by 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.450
 the most important part of the neck will go 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.450
 A) Yes 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:50.030
 then for this part we are going to put you 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.000
 Well, the famous hair 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.770
 and we put some white glue and 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.959
 the famous hair, what do you think is going 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.959
 to be a piece of agujeta what to say 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.049
 let's put it that way until 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.049
 I know that 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.110
 it does not leave face 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.209
 I no longer say he is alive because then he 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.209
 they take 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.970
 and since it is there we let it dry and 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.420
 how dry will it be this way 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.660
 since we have it that way we put it to the 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.560
 head to your neck and here we are going to put 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.560
 a little bit of white glue 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.740
 and this we are going to hit 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.319
 very well 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.319
 while this is drying 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:52.590
 you realize here was where I made all 

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:55.840
 the brands 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.880
 so we are all wrong 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.410
 and now we are going to take advantage and we hit 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.410
 cabbage and also 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:07.270
 I'm not putting like that so it sticks 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:09.600
 because below is the glue there 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.710
 and we let it hit that I stuck 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.160
 Meanwhile, the 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.160
 legs 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.460
 I will not take advantage while you are 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.030
 drying 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.030
 I 'm going to hit him 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.600
 someone is going to put them 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.610
 good legs with the area 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.139
 so that it stays this way 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.390
 to 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.340
 what would be left without our 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.340
 being more 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.960
 and we already have a nice giraffe I remember 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.210
 of our little one while growing up in 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.070
 your first steps to the side I am 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.060
 natalia pérez and this was a theme of 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.060
 beauty for the planet
