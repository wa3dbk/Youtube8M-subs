sample you can call it a test production

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.770 
sample you can call it a test production
and<00:01:10.740> what's<00:01:11.220> what's<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.939> neat<00:01:12.210> about<00:01:12.240> this

and what's what's really neat about this
is<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.799> rubber<00:01:14.100> molding<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.210> on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
is that the rubber molding right here on

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.590 
is that the rubber molding right here on
the<00:01:15.450> head<00:01:15.810> tail<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> handle<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the head tail and handle is actually a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.390 
the head tail and handle is actually a
special<00:01:20.960> plastic<00:01:21.960> rubber<00:01:22.229> compound<00:01:22.830> okay

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
special plastic rubber compound okay

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.320 
special plastic rubber compound okay
injected<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.330> carbon<00:01:24.869> fiber<00:01:25.759> yeah<00:01:26.790> it's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
injected with carbon fiber yeah it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.880 
injected with carbon fiber yeah it's
about<00:01:27.509> 60%<00:01:27.960> carbon<00:01:28.560> fiber

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
about 60% carbon fiber

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.590 
about 60% carbon fiber
okay<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.400> there's<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.150> very

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600

rigid<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.409> know

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
rigid you know

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.710 
rigid you know
you<00:01:32.820> probably<00:01:33.000> saw<00:01:33.240> last<00:01:33.420> year<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
you probably saw last year the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.569 
you probably saw last year the
prototypes<00:01:34.140> are<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.100> rubbery

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
prototypes are a little you know rubbery

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.219 
prototypes are a little you know rubbery
sure<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> great<00:01:36.990> stuff

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
sure but this is this is great stuff

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.640 
sure but this is this is great stuff
it's<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.740> it'll<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:38.939> design

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
it's it it'll be good for design

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.630 
it's it it'll be good for design
protecting<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> light<00:01:40.860> from<00:01:41.009> impact<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
protecting the light from impact and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.120 
protecting the light from impact and
such<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.799> puts<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:45.740> they<00:01:46.740> may<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
such so this puts out they may have to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
such so this puts out they may have to
correct<00:01:47.310> me<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.729> think<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.030> about<00:01:48.140> 5,000

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
correct me I think it's about 5,000

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.520 
correct me I think it's about 5,000
lumens<00:01:49.500> okay<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> front<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.530> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
lumens okay out the front and the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.859 
lumens okay out the front and the
pattern<00:01:52.829> pack<00:01:53.009> has<00:01:53.549> also<00:01:53.850> been<00:01:54.149> improved<00:01:54.450> it's

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
pattern pack has also been improved it's

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.910 
pattern pack has also been improved it's
a<00:01:55.219> 20%<00:01:56.219> lighter<00:01:56.369> 30%<00:01:57.299> more<00:01:57.450> power<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:58.020> wow

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
a 20% lighter 30% more power with wow

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.100 
a 20% lighter 30% more power with wow
that<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.909> battery<00:02:00.180> pack<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.960> I'm

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that the battery pack is know I'm

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.600 
that the battery pack is know I'm
feeling<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.500> light<00:02:01.649> how<00:02:01.829> light<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.369> that's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
feeling the light how light it is that's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.209 
feeling the light how light it is that's
Wow<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> whole<00:02:04.200> idea<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.680> separate

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
Wow so the whole idea was to separate

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.859 
Wow so the whole idea was to separate
the<00:02:05.369> two<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.759> know<00:02:05.909> put<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.719> hip

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the two you know put this on your hip

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.279 
the two you know put this on your hip
and<00:02:07.049> then<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:08.009> very<00:02:08.479> agile<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and then you can be very agile with the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.900 
and then you can be very agile with the
with<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.619> light<00:02:10.890> source

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
with this light source

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.120 
with this light source
so<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> battery<00:02:13.290> pack<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.860> kind<00:02:14.040> of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
so the battery pack what kind of

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.470 
so the battery pack what kind of
batteries<00:02:14.520> are<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:14.730> looking<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.300> we

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
batteries are we looking at in here we

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.570 
batteries are we looking at in here we

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
that is obnoxious this is so the whole

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.790 
that is obnoxious this is so the whole
idea<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.970> could<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.630> can<00:03:18.810> point<00:03:19.590> it

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
idea is that you could you can point it

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.620 
idea is that you could you can point it
wherever<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.460> want<00:03:20.490> right<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.240> also<00:03:21.360> be<00:03:21.570> able

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
sure a couple other things it's got a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.930 
sure a couple other things it's got a
tripod<00:03:55.260> mount<00:03:55.530> at<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.040> very<00:03:56.250> bottom<00:03:56.370> that's

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
tripod mount at the very bottom that's

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.550 
tripod mount at the very bottom that's
just<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.209> standard<00:03:57.450> right<00:03:57.930> now<00:03:58.140> yeah

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
just the standard right now yeah

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.920 
just the standard right now yeah
approximately<00:03:59.340> at<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.490> center<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.570> gravity

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
approximately at the center of gravity

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.460 
approximately at the center of gravity
over<00:04:01.080> here<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.150> can<00:04:03.240> mount<00:04:03.570> it<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.050> point

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
over here so you can mount it and point

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.620 
over here so you can mount it and point
it<00:04:04.560> wherever<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.920> want<00:04:04.950> right<00:04:05.490> you<00:04:05.640> know<00:04:05.730> one

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
it wherever you want right you know one

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.449 
it wherever you want right you know one
more<00:04:06.780> thing<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:07.170> we've<00:04:07.320> got<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:07.470> little<00:04:08.070> mount

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
more thing is we've got a little mount

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.880 
more thing is we've got a little mount
system<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.120> we're<00:04:10.110> developing<00:04:10.350> various

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
system and we're developing various

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.190 
system and we're developing various
mounts<00:04:11.310> for<00:04:11.459> this<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.990> that'll<00:04:12.990> come<00:04:13.140> later

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
mounts for this and that'll come later

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.260 
mounts for this and that'll come later
okay<00:04:13.920> well<00:04:14.100> we've<00:04:14.250> got<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.459> prototype<00:04:14.760> here

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
okay well we've got a prototype here

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.039 
okay well we've got a prototype here
that<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:16.020> magnetic<00:04:16.650> mount<00:04:16.890> for<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.670> car<00:04:18.049> so

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
that is a magnetic mount for a car so

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.380 
that is a magnetic mount for a car so
pop<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.919> theoretically<00:04:20.520> you<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.090> put<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.359> on

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
pop so theoretically you can put it on

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.580 
pop so theoretically you can put it on
your<00:04:21.570> car

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
your car

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.010 
your car
and<00:04:22.680> then<00:04:22.950> snap<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:23.880> thing<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.330> like<00:04:24.780> this

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
and then snap this thing in like this

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.740 
and then snap this thing in like this
yay

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
yay

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.210 
yay
snap<00:04:27.750> there<00:04:27.990> we<00:04:28.080> go<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.889> then<00:04:28.980> you<00:04:29.070> got<00:04:29.190> a

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
snap there we go and then you got a

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.460 
snap there we go and then you got a
little<00:04:29.400> car<00:04:30.090> light<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.450> mounted<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.840> nice<00:04:31.050> so

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
little car light you mounted a nice so

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.770 
little car light you mounted a nice so
and<00:04:31.680> then<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.550> pinch<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.150> get<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.419> car

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
and then in the pinch so you get a car

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.780 
and then in the pinch so you get a car
you<00:04:33.990> say<00:04:34.139> hey<00:04:34.230> I<00:04:34.290> want<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.590> yeah<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.460> want<00:04:35.700> a

releasing<00:04:54.960> this<00:04:55.110> year<00:04:55.350> is<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:56.510> SAT<00:04:57.510> and

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
releasing this year is the SAT and

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.440 
releasing this year is the SAT and
you're<00:04:58.860> familiar<00:04:58.979> with<00:04:59.190> s<00:04:59.460> 35<00:04:59.880> yet<00:05:00.300> the

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
you're familiar with s 35 yet the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.600 
you're familiar with s 35 yet the
double-a<00:05:00.870> powered<00:05:01.169> lights<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.770> S<00:05:01.860> 65<00:05:02.160> yep

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
double-a powered lights and the S 65 yep

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.870 
double-a powered lights and the S 65 yep
and<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:04.169> 80<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:05.419> unique<00:05:06.419> in<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:07.310> it's<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.490> it's

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
and the 80 is unique in that it's a it's

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.930 
and the 80 is unique in that it's a it's
an<00:05:09.000> integrated<00:05:10.250> rechargeable<00:05:11.250> solution<00:05:11.669> you

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
an integrated rechargeable solution you

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.850 
an integrated rechargeable solution you
plug<00:05:12.479> it<00:05:12.780> in<00:05:12.900> plug<00:05:13.530> it<00:05:13.650> in<00:05:13.740> here<00:05:13.889> to<00:05:14.070> power<00:05:14.460> and

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
plug it in plug it in here to power and

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.830 
plug it in plug it in here to power and
we're<00:05:16.860> using<00:05:17.070> actually<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.639> specialized<00:05:18.510> cell

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
we're using actually a specialized cell

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.800 
we're using actually a specialized cell
to<00:05:19.380> maximize<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.130> energy<00:05:20.330> content<00:05:21.330> but<00:05:21.720> the

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
to maximize the energy content but the

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.990 
to maximize the energy content but the
interface<00:05:21.990> is<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:22.320> same<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:23.160> SAT<00:05:23.639> has<00:05:23.820> an

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
interface is the same the SAT has an

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.920 
interface is the same the SAT has an
integrated<00:05:24.210> battery<00:05:24.570> pack<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:27.030> it's<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.390> the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
integrated battery pack so it's a the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.610 
integrated battery pack so it's a the
next<00:05:28.320> after<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.550> S<00:05:29.669> series<00:05:30.090> okay<00:05:30.479> and<00:05:30.690> it

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
next after the the S series okay and it

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.840 
next after the the S series okay and it
operates<00:05:32.100> just<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.370> same<00:05:33.950> so<00:05:34.950> this<00:05:35.130> is<00:05:35.280> a<00:05:35.310> this

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
operates just the same so this is a this

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.950 
operates just the same so this is a this
would<00:05:36.000> be<00:05:36.120> ideal<00:05:36.390> for<00:05:36.450> a<00:05:36.690> kind<00:05:37.620> of<00:05:37.650> police<00:05:38.039> or

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
would be ideal for a kind of police or

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.170 
would be ideal for a kind of police or
security<00:05:39.960> where<00:05:40.530> you<00:05:41.250> would<00:05:41.460> use<00:05:41.700> it<00:05:41.880> every

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
security where you would use it every

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.680 
security where you would use it every
night<00:05:42.210> you<00:05:42.660> know<00:05:42.750> go<00:05:43.560> check<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:45.180> perimeters

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
night you know go check the perimeters

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.990 
night you know go check the perimeters
every<00:05:45.960> hour<00:05:46.140> so<00:05:46.590> you're<00:05:47.160> using<00:05:47.400> it<00:05:47.640> every<00:05:47.850> day

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
every hour so you're using it every day

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.930 
every hour so you're using it every day
so<00:05:48.060> there's<00:05:48.330> a<00:05:48.390> cycle<00:05:48.720> every<00:05:48.900> day<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:49.940> all

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
so there's a cycle every day and all

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.070 
so there's a cycle every day and all
they<00:05:51.090> would<00:05:51.240> do<00:05:51.389> is<00:05:51.419> just<00:05:51.570> charge<00:05:51.930> it

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
they would do is just charge it

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.540 
they would do is just charge it
overnight<00:05:52.289> and<00:05:52.620> be<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:52.919> be<00:05:53.070> ready<00:05:53.280> for<00:05:53.460> the

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
overnight and be it be ready for the

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.740 
overnight and be it be ready for the
next<00:05:53.729> day<00:05:55.490> kind<00:05:56.490> of<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.610> daily<00:05:56.820> duty<00:05:57.240> type<00:05:57.479> fly

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
next day kind of a daily duty type fly

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.270 
next day kind of a daily duty type fly
it's<00:05:57.930> a<00:05:57.990> nice<00:05:58.139> little<00:05:58.320> light<00:05:58.590> it's<00:05:58.800> pretty

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
it's a nice little light it's pretty

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.070 
it's a nice little light it's pretty
compact<00:05:59.700> still<00:06:00.000> with<00:06:00.240> especially

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
compact still with especially

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.659 
compact still with especially
considering<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.650> output<00:06:02.010> it's<00:06:02.490> really

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
considering the output it's really

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:03.860 
considering the output it's really
comfortable<00:06:03.090> in<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.270> hand<00:06:03.389> it'd<00:06:03.570> be<00:06:03.660> a<00:06:03.690> good

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
comfortable in the hand it'd be a good

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.620 
comfortable in the hand it'd be a good
medium<00:06:04.710> range<00:06:05.100> kind<00:06:05.340> of<00:06:05.400> light<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:06.389> the<00:06:06.510> whole

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
medium range kind of light so the whole

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.580 
medium range kind of light so the whole
baton<00:06:06.990> series<00:06:07.470> the<00:06:07.680> baton<00:06:08.100> S<00:06:08.280> series<00:06:08.669> I

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
baton series the baton S series I

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.659 
baton series the baton S series I
mentioned<00:06:10.590> it<00:06:10.680> last<00:06:10.800> year<00:06:11.070> but<00:06:11.250> I<00:06:11.340> mentioned

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
mentioned it last year but I mentioned

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.650 
mentioned it last year but I mentioned
again<00:06:11.729> is<00:06:12.120> that<00:06:12.590> the<00:06:13.590> design<00:06:14.039> is<00:06:14.430> inherently

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
again is that the design is inherently

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.330 
again is that the design is inherently
very<00:06:15.660> very<00:06:15.930> strong<00:06:16.289> because<00:06:16.560> it's<00:06:16.770> a<00:06:16.860> single

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
very very strong because it's a single

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.279 
very very strong because it's a single
tube<00:06:17.729> of<00:06:17.940> aluminum<00:06:18.389> okay<00:06:18.840> there's<00:06:19.139> no

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
tube of aluminum okay there's no

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.100 
tube of aluminum okay there's no
connection<00:06:19.590> to<00:06:19.770> the<00:06:20.070> head<00:06:20.280> or<00:06:20.760> you<00:06:21.750> know<00:06:21.870> body

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
connection to the head or you know body

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.469 
connection to the head or you know body
parts<00:06:22.650> it's<00:06:22.830> just<00:06:22.979> one<00:06:23.280> tube<00:06:23.669> that<00:06:23.940> we<00:06:24.060> cut<00:06:24.300> out

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
parts it's just one tube that we cut out

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.420 
parts it's just one tube that we cut out
so<00:06:24.810> from<00:06:24.960> here<00:06:25.110> to<00:06:25.169> here<00:06:25.289> I<00:06:25.740> was<00:06:25.950> all<00:06:26.100> one<00:06:26.280> piece

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
so from here to here I was all one piece

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.370 
so from here to here I was all one piece
one<00:06:26.669> piece<00:06:26.700> oh<00:06:27.180> yeah<00:06:27.419> and<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:28.050> head<00:06:28.200> is

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
one piece oh yeah and the head is

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.000 
one piece oh yeah and the head is
reinforced<00:06:28.889> with<00:06:28.950> stainless<00:06:29.400> steel<00:06:29.580> okay<00:06:30.000> so

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
reinforced with stainless steel okay so

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.130 
reinforced with stainless steel okay so
that<00:06:32.010> reduces<00:06:32.789> the<00:06:32.940> mass<00:06:33.180> needed<00:06:33.539> when<00:06:33.870> every

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
that reduces the mass needed when every

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.980 
that reduces the mass needed when every
time<00:06:34.289> you<00:06:34.380> have<00:06:34.500> threads<00:06:35.039> you<00:06:35.340> need<00:06:35.520> some

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
time you have threads you need some

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.809 
time you have threads you need some
you<00:06:36.500> know<00:06:36.620> on<00:06:36.680> both<00:06:36.860> sides<00:06:37.160> to<00:06:37.430> make<00:06:37.550> it<00:06:37.669> work

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819 
you know on both sides to make it work

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.640 
you know on both sides to make it work
well<00:06:38.389> this<00:06:38.569> is<00:06:38.690> not<00:06:38.780> only<00:06:38.900> strong<00:06:39.139> it's<00:06:39.470> also

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
well this is not only strong it's also

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.559 
well this is not only strong it's also
lighter<00:06:40.009> weight<00:06:40.340> right<00:06:40.669> giving<00:06:41.479> the

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:41.569 
lighter weight right giving the

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.350 
lighter weight right giving the
equivalent<00:06:42.020> light<00:06:42.199> so<00:06:42.530> just<00:06:43.310> now<00:06:43.699> we're

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
equivalent light so just now we're

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.600 
equivalent light so just now we're
excited<00:06:44.630> about<00:06:44.720> this<00:06:44.960> one<00:06:45.110> all<00:06:45.500> right<00:06:46.370> David

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
excited about this one all right David

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.499 
excited about this one all right David
thank<00:06:46.729> you<00:06:46.759> for<00:06:46.910> your<00:06:47.000> time<00:06:47.180> Thank<00:06:47.479> You
