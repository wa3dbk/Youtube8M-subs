00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
boy Jeff Demps he is still doing it I

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.159 
boy Jeff Demps he is still doing it I
think<00:04:55.389> Jeffrey<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.620> most<00:04:57.039> underrated

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
think Jeffrey is the most underrated

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.920 
think Jeffrey is the most underrated
back<00:04:59.169> in<00:04:59.439> the<00:04:59.949> game<00:05:00.310> he's<00:05:00.969> a<00:05:01.000> bronze<00:05:01.479> I<00:05:01.750> think

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
back in the game he's a bronze I think

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.119 
back in the game he's a bronze I think
it's<00:05:02.020> like<00:05:02.639> 4500<00:05:04.199> 54<00:05:05.199> overall<00:05:05.740> rating<00:05:06.069> or

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
it's like 4500 54 overall rating or

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.760 
it's like 4500 54 overall rating or
