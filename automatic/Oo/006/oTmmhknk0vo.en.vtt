00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.340
 to 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.199
 hello how are you good morning 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.449
 spring I am that I am a bat and everything 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 autumn like this involution my ring 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.640
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.860
 take advantage of what comes out everything falls 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.620
 in this video I will show you how to take advantage 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.780
 the remains of the pumpkin when the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.190
 clean inside because they just go from 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.790
 the food of people who die in the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.409
 world for not eating so we're going to 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.750
 take advantage of what we get from within 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.850
 the pumpkin to make some pancakes 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.460
 pumpkin 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.800
 If you have a Halloween party and do not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.600
 you know how to decorate the house or how to give it 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.210
 Listen to the children pass by the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.210
 rest of the channel and review it 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:13.760
 and review this evil 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.860
 and what are you saying to check the other idea 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.860
 for this halloween mathematician 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.960
 to make our pumpkin pancakes 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.210
 we need of course pumpkin but 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.040
 not so if not well in taquitos this 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.200
 about size we will use 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.820
 half a kilo of pumpkin 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.820
 300 grams of flour 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.439
 250 grams of sugar 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.740
 150 grams of margarine at temperature 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.830
 you can replace it with 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.270
 Butter 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.270
 the tip of the trough 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.060
 a whole egg 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.670
 a lemon I adopted the ugliest 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.899
 Supermarket 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.899
 a little cinnamon 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.579
 and a house 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.700
 in a pot we're going to put our 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.400
 pumpkin cut into taquitos 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.830
 and we are going to add water to cover it 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.640
 almost almost completely like three 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.640
 quarters 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.060
 arrange it so that the whole pumpkin 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.920
 this case- and submerged and once 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.750
 start boiling you will need about 15 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.680
 or 20 more minutes to have the texture 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.019
 What are we searching for 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.620
 meanwhile in another pot we go to 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.620
 sift the flour 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.750
 let's put the salt 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.750
 the sugar 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.430
 and cinnamon 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.130
 we are going to move everything very well 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.420
 i 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.330
 and then we will add the yolk 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.430
 of the eggs 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.430
 and margarine at room temperature 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.240
 and we are going to remove it very well until 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.590
 have a compact mass as I am at 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.590
 end up putting your hand 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.030
 20 minutes have already passed and our 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.970
 Pumpkin has a perfect texture 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.800
 I'm already seeing how easy it gets 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.190
 so let's add the rest of the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.190
 sugar 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.680
 we are going to remove it very well 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.680
 ah 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.830
 and we're going to add the lemon zest 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.930
 and let's recap for 5 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.830
 minutes so that it ends of vapors almost 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.830
 completely water 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.220
 that's perfect 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.479
 we take it out with a comfort to not 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.479
 have too much water 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.470
 and with a fork we make a puree 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.500
 pumpkin as you are seeing now 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.500
 same 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.880
 and more 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.400
 let's add that mash to our dough 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.400
 with pasta 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.730
 besides adding the whole egg 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.350
 and if you like you can add a 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.710
 error scoop if you have it not the 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.710
 put 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.850
 and we are going to move everything very well 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.900
 until it is so I promise that 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.900
 it stays like this 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:41.129
 and now ready to knead we are going to put a 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.999
 little butter and our mixture 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.999
 for the pancakes 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.280
 we do on both sides there I am 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.460
 sure they have higher than me for 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.460
 this so do not notice much 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.730
 two 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.700
 double 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.390
 and lists do not need anything else but if 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.889
 you are very chocolatiers like I could 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.900
 add them cloth or whatever you want 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.360
 and on top of that we sprinkle a little 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.249
 sugar to the side and we put an ounce of 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.349
 our favorite chocolate a 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.349
 banderilla and ready 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.030
 Now the best part 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.370
 sometimes 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.330
 and this has been all in today's video 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.330
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:54.680

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.780
