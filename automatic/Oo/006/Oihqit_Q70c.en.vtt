00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.480
 Paris advises it is if ever I 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.940
 had the opportunity on all these young people 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.379

 write them in your age and from 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.740
 the hexagon in nothing so through the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.090
 morbid I say any team that this 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.500
 maybe already because after this 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.689
 sometimes it can be harder it's for sure 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.040
 that the like me my arrival i 'm going 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.900
 have the day of ancient art what 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.610
 I find it really practical but 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.950
 according to her do as fast as possible 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.380
 then be welded to take the bus 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 I advise you to do well your 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.250
 bus stop the city ​​to be sure 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.549
 that they have been few changes that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.110
 happen sometimes it happens that he 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.150
 change of horror that it did not review the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.890
 verendrye of but you never know when 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.630
 I advise to watch these turnips and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
 the same morning cindy billaud typically 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.420
 Catalan but for that you will be 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.250
 500 are thoroughly the stm 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.509
 so that tells you when I brush them 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.670
 exposed the beginning that's what happened 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.920
 and who will actually happen so his 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.939
 lover leaving to get up to what 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.740
 is really this application 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.540
 it may be that I advise you 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.580
 to go and sort with your mother 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.659
 your father your fate very strong with 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.310
 people who were doing with whom 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.799
 you live or you even if you opt 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.280
 I am not alone fixed for 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.460
 lunch 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.269
 because we need the tracks 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.650
 is more vague and laugh in blue but that 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.330
 really gets lots of snacks from 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.580
 the team so I think we almost failed 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.200
 6-1 7-6 6 weeks that but a form 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.930
 nothing in the pockets of the council of the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.190
 nation before towards the clothes that you 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.600
 want we showed tonight that it's 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.430
 better missteps the witnesses advance 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.680
 another seven the week but just like 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.390
 a newspaper in sorting and were torn off 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.760
 but if necessary especially eight years 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.380
 that they spent and a few months in 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.940
 the three months I still love you better 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.739
 wash them before starting the year 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.880
 then if I know maybe it's okay 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.970
 that we know that it is less easy to 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.489

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.620

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.140

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.180

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.549
