00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
the opposing 13 all he has to do is just

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.620 
the opposing 13 all he has to do is just
chuck<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.400> his<00:02:29.549> receiver<00:02:30.000> as<00:02:30.209> quickly<00:02:30.420> as

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
possible if you'll see the clock is now

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.090 
possible if you'll see the clock is now
at<00:02:33.060> 14<00:02:33.660> minutes<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.140> 15<00:02:34.440> seconds<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.070> means

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
at 14 minutes and 15 seconds that means

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.780 
at 14 minutes and 15 seconds that means
that<00:02:35.820> whole<00:02:36.120> sequence<00:02:36.390> took<00:02:37.380> about<00:02:37.980> six<00:02:38.580> or

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
that whole sequence took about six or

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.539 
that whole sequence took about six or
six<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.450> half<00:02:39.480> seconds<00:02:40.170> all<00:02:40.799> that's<00:02:41.340> left

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
six and a half seconds all that's left

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.580 
six and a half seconds all that's left
to<00:02:41.610> do<00:02:41.760> from<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.090> point<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:42.989> chip<00:02:43.440> in

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
to do from this point on is just chip in

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.440 
to do from this point on is just chip in
the<00:02:43.739> field<00:02:44.010> goal<00:02:44.250> or<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.519> extra<00:02:44.880> point<00:02:45.150> which

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
the field goal or the extra point which

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.150 
the field goal or the extra point which
doesn't<00:02:46.140> take<00:02:46.290> any<00:02:46.440> time<00:02:46.680> off<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.950> clock

doesn't take any time off the clock

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.580 
doesn't take any time off the clock
obviously<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:48.380> we<00:02:49.380> are<00:02:49.680> back<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.930> kickoff

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
obviously and we are back to the kickoff

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.490 
obviously and we are back to the kickoff
sequence<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.670> starts<00:02:54.000> all<00:02:54.150> over<00:02:54.180> again

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.930 

okay<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.709> whole<00:02:58.920> sequence<00:02:59.280> took<00:02:59.580> about<00:02:59.880> a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
okay that whole sequence took about a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.060 
okay that whole sequence took about a
minute<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.600> 20<00:03:00.900> seconds<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.470> your<00:03:01.620> time<00:03:01.680> out

we're barely gonna fit it in and that's

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.309 
we're barely gonna fit it in and that's
only<00:03:22.150> if<00:03:22.420> I'm<00:03:22.540> perfect<00:03:22.989> every<00:03:23.380> single<00:03:23.410> time<00:03:25.319> so
