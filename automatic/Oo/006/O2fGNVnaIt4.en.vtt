00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
is going by more than half of that

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.089 
is going by more than half of that

process so when these line highlights at

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.949 
process so when these line highlights at
the<00:03:32.250> very<00:03:32.550> end<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.360> phone<00:03:33.569> will<00:03:33.720> power
