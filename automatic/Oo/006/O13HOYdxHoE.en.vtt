00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.160
 The fat supplies some markets golden 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.210
 reversal signals and thus cordially 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.130
 Welcome my ladies and gentlemen to 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.230
 Outlook on the markets today yesterday 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 was actually relatively little going on we 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.949
 had some pretty lousy ones 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
 economic data once again from the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.779
 usa has no really interested because 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.369
 Everything was basically waiting for this letter 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.230
 from greece who did not come then 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.029
 but only this morning should come 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.430
 and one waited for the fed protocol 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.360
 and it came and it was much less 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.879
 relaxed as you might think 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.360
 the notary bankers had thought that 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.340
 they are seriously worried that the 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.879
 Issues that come from abroad 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.020
 speak into the usa speak speak 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.460
 Economic downturn in some countries 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.079
 above all, inflation is not 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.660
 can attract because just the price 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.739
 low is all that stays open 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.239
 I here the fed members of the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.270
 Worry wrinkles on the forehead look 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.739
 strong as never before 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.260
 and that shows that you are here 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.880
 is much skeptical in things 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.799
 interest-raising many have said well 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.540
 we can now badly interest 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.920
 lift and that just seems to be 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.710
 slow to enforce that hardly 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.360
 is possible and that drives some 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.189
 markets we'll take a look at 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.409
 being in asia is doing relatively well 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.710
 Little is China's New Year celebration 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.119
 therefore hangang and hongkong and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.820
 Shanghai closed the opponents up 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.360
 half percent in the plus and slightly in the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.520
 minus 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.799
 the market in australia what do we have 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.630
 today on dates on the agenda there 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.869
 it's not that crazy either 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.490
 us first applications and 16 o'clock of the us 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.680
 philadelphia fed index but today 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.540
 interesting is the first protocol of 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.120
 ezb session published 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.280
 That's 13:30 central european time 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.020
 14.30 our time will be log 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.790
 published anonymized that will 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.820
 so not clear that was mr 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.130
 Weidmann that was Mr. Draghi but it 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.170
 is just anonymized just as a comment 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.790
 So today , just introduce one 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.860
 that will certainly be interesting and you 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.650
 will have to pay attention to how the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.540
 letter from greece looks like 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.869
 in it stands like above all then the 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.640
 euro group in first reactions itself 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.740
 Behave here and they will learn 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.200
 course again at www financial market in 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.780
 the etsch look what is doing what I am 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.200
 because he turns and then we start right away 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.390
 here with the dax 10 1954 we are 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.800
 the little changes well too 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.720
 Trading start does not work that way 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.530
 a lot 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.440
 also just decided that 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.640
 holiday is or full time week that 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.670
 will drag on for a long time 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.080
 we are likely to be around this level with the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.750
 We closed here on extras basis 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.850
 have come back in 10 1950 about that 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.730
 shows again a look at the dow 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.830
 jones here as a future again 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.239
 Water based TAXED there we see it does 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.489
 Do not know an awful lot 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.750
 come down a bit but not because 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.760
 sustainable it is a bit 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.310
 relief with the wise will the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.019
 Fed did not raise interest rates 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.940
 certainly not in june what we here 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.500
 this is the euro / dollar that is 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.480
 We have also completed a turnaround 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.489
 were weak before the protocol 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.720
 then shot up well and can 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.680
 defend those profits that sees 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.540
 not so bad now we expect 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.100
 a bit of dollar weakness in 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.769
 next time we see this 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.970
 American culture 51 33 was too 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.130
 already come much worse today 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.930
 the inventory is the stock data that 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.320
 will be strong to note and now 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.900
 interesting here is the gold price and here 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.130
 we will see this reverse after we 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.700
 yesterday just under the 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.650
 Support at 1300 points has fallen 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.090
 were it now up in the 4th 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.360
 hours chart you can see it a bit 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.130
 better 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.630
 there we have this outbreak after 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.890
 below and we now expect courses 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.959
 they go to area 1235 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.599
 1240 possibly even in perspective 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.250
 until 1255 age a golden one 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.930
 reversed signals make it possible for me 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.650
 wish the very best for today 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.650
 See what very day
