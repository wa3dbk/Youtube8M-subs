00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
try so you may ask what's the point of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.039

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
having a bow and a rope arrow you can

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.350 
having a bow and a rope arrow you can
just<00:01:04.439> use<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.619> grappling<00:01:04.949> hook<00:01:05.159> well<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
just use a grappling hook well to use a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
just use a grappling hook well to use a
grappling<00:01:06.720> hook<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.380> throw<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.830> here

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
grappling hook you can throw it up here

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.940 
grappling hook you can throw it up here
but<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.970> doesn't<00:01:09.479> work<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:09.840> well<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.770> need

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
but it doesn't work very well you need

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
but it doesn't work very well you need
to<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.640> over<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:12.119> edge<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.170> simply

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
to have it over an edge and that simply

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.480 
to have it over an edge and that simply
can't<00:01:13.979> catch<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.270> edge<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.110> what<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.920> arrow

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
can't catch on the edge so what a arrow

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.170 
can't catch on the edge so what a arrow
does<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.540> rope<00:01:19.409> arrow<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.189> shoot<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
does a rope arrow you shoot it up in the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.539 
does a rope arrow you shoot it up in the
air<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.229> has<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> distance<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.009> thirty

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
air and it has the distance of thirty

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.499 
air and it has the distance of thirty
five<00:01:24.409> blocks<00:01:25.409> high<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.100> drops<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:27.210> of

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
five blocks high and it drops a kind of

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.260 
five blocks high and it drops a kind of
rope<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:29.009> climb<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.520> there<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.210> uh

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
rope and you can climb up there so uh

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.780 
rope and you can climb up there so uh
once<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> reaches<00:01:31.470> down<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.009> me<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.430> climb

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
once it reaches down to me I can climb

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.499 
once it reaches down to me I can climb
up<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.540> ladder<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:35.030> take<00:01:36.030> some<00:01:36.270> time

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
up just like a ladder and take some time

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.170 
up just like a ladder and take some time
to<00:01:36.689> fall<00:01:36.930> down<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.490> it's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
to fall down and there we go and it's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.800 
to fall down and there we go and it's
you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.619> site<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.810> always

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you can go around all site all always

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.440 
you can go around all site all always
around<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.380> whoa<00:01:43.680> nearly<00:01:44.369> fell<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.329> do

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
around it whoa nearly fell so you can do

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.920 
around it whoa nearly fell so you can do
like<00:01:45.600> 360s<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:48.000> kind<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.390> felt<00:01:48.780> there

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
like 360s here and I kind of felt there

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.280 
like 360s here and I kind of felt there
we<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.880> here<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.570> break<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
we go and so here and you can break the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.520 
we go and so here and you can break the
rope<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.490> die<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.990> get<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
rope and if I don't die you get all the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.830 
rope and if I don't die you get all the
pieces<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.490> took<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.790> create<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
pieces that it took to create and the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.550 
pieces that it took to create and the
rope<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.189> no<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> create<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> arrow<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.930> it's

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
rope so no to create the arrow so it's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.950 
rope so no to create the arrow so it's
fairly<00:02:02.189> inexpensive<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
fairly inexpensive but you have to

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.899 
fairly inexpensive but you have to
collect<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> back<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.219> let's<00:02:05.369> put<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
collect it back so let's put it to the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.050 
collect it back so let's put it to the
