of a rust on the bottom it almost gives
a<00:03:36.740> little<00:03:36.860> bit<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.400> vulnerable<00:03:38.300> raw<00:03:38.540> look

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
a little bit of a vulnerable raw look

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.690 
a little bit of a vulnerable raw look
under<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.200> eye<00:03:39.250> especially<00:03:40.250> against<00:03:40.610> the

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
contrast if a blue eyes is gonna be

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.570 
contrast if a blue eyes is gonna be
stunning<00:03:42.410> especially<00:03:42.620> once<00:03:43.010> over<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.280> lashes

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
stunning especially once over the lashes

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.910 
stunning especially once over the lashes
