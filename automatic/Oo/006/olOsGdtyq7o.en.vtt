somewhat disturbing painting and I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
somewhat disturbing painting and I
didn't<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.079> Madonna<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.789> really

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
didn't know Madonna so I was really

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.139 
didn't know Madonna so I was really
surprised<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.320> taste<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.399> art

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
surprised that that was for taste in art

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.029 
surprised that that was for taste in art
because<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.899> until<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.350> she<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.739> sort<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
because up until then she was sort of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.720 
because up until then she was sort of
you<00:00:50.850> know<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.239> material<00:00:52.230> girl<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:52.739> vogue<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.460> a

you know the material girl or vogue or a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.439 
you know the material girl or vogue or a
lot<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.300> retro<00:00:54.480> stuff<00:00:55.670> for<00:00:56.670> whatever<00:00:56.850> reason<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
lot of retro stuff for whatever reason I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.150 
lot of retro stuff for whatever reason I
had<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.899> made<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.289> wrong<00:00:58.469> assumption

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
had you know made the wrong assumption

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.880 
had you know made the wrong assumption
about<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.480> her<00:01:00.629> tastes<00:01:01.020> might<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.649> art

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
about what her tastes might be in art

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.250 
about what her tastes might be in art
and<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.760> found<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.449> interesting<00:01:03.719> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and I found it really interesting that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.830 
and I found it really interesting that
that's<00:01:04.530> something<00:01:05.220> she<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.580> drawn<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.720> I

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
that's something she was drawn to and I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.750 
that's something she was drawn to and I
just<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.560> put<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> back<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.670> my

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
just kind of put that in the back of my

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.070 
just kind of put that in the back of my
head<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> might<00:01:09.240> even<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.540> sent<00:01:09.810> her<00:01:09.900> awhile

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
head I might even have sent her awhile

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.240 
head I might even have sent her awhile
would<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.380> great<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> few<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.979> could<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
would be great a few and I could do a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.950 
would be great a few and I could do a
video<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.549> looked<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:12.390> day<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
she said yeah and it wasn't really

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.609 
she said yeah and it wasn't really
appropriate<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.270> bad<00:01:15.509> girl<00:01:15.750> song<00:01:16.049> and

appropriate for that bad girl song and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.320 
appropriate for that bad girl song and

that<00:01:20.820> Madonna<00:01:21.150> has<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.080> sort<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.320> taste<00:01:23.210> so

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that Madonna has that sort of taste so

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.969 
that Madonna has that sort of taste so
then<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.840> track<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.290> Madonna<00:01:25.619> which

is bedtime story which I think was a
track<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.960> was<00:01:28.080> written<00:01:28.259> by<00:01:28.439> Bjork<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:29.610> soon

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
track that was written by Bjork as soon

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.640 
track that was written by Bjork as soon
as<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.119> heard<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.329> song<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.930> knew<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.470> could

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
as I heard the song I knew that I could

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.929 
as I heard the song I knew that I could
finally<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:33.090> surreal<00:01:33.780> dark<00:01:34.350> disturbing

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
finally do this surreal dark disturbing

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
finally do this surreal dark disturbing
strange<00:01:36.140> aesthetic<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.560> seen<00:01:37.860> in

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
strange aesthetic that I had seen in

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.620 
strange aesthetic that I had seen in
that<00:01:38.130> painting<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.729> she<00:01:38.880> had<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.329> Hotel

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that painting that she had at that Hotel

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.450 
that painting that she had at that Hotel
in<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> hotel<00:01:40.140> room<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
in the hotel room and it was just the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.630 
in the hotel room and it was just the
perfect<00:01:42.030> song<00:01:42.500> for<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.829> aesthetic<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.549> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
perfect song for that aesthetic and it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.770 
perfect song for that aesthetic and it
was<00:01:44.729> something<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.000> she<00:01:45.180> had<00:01:45.210> never<00:01:45.329> done

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
was something that she had never done

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.760 
was something that she had never done
Madonna<00:01:46.200> never<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:47.270> delved<00:01:48.270> into<00:01:48.710> sort<00:01:49.710> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
Madonna never really delved into sort of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.389 
Madonna never really delved into sort of
painter<00:01:50.250> release<00:01:50.549> realism<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:53.130> able<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
painter release realism so I was able to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.539 
painter release realism so I was able to
really<00:01:53.579> indulge<00:01:54.320> myself<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.710> making<00:01:56.340> just

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
really indulge myself in making just

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.639 
really indulge myself in making just
purely<00:01:56.939> surreal<00:01:57.240> video<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.020> idea<00:01:58.560> of

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
purely surreal video because the idea of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.289 
purely surreal video because the idea of
the<00:01:58.740> song<00:01:58.950> his<00:01:59.189> words<00:01:59.399> are<00:01:59.579> useless<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.180> was

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the song his words are useless so it was

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
the song his words are useless so it was
really<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.200> about<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> imagery

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
really going to be all about the imagery

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.850 
really going to be all about the imagery
and<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:03.360> knew<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.540> Madonna<00:02:03.960> had<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> vast

went at crazy frankly he's doing

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.670 
went at crazy frankly he's doing
reference<00:02:10.530> research<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:12.140> surrealism<00:02:13.140> but

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
reference research on on surrealism but

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
reference research on on surrealism but
I<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.799> avoid<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.579> kind<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.269> cliche

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
I to avoid the kind of the cliche

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.449 
I to avoid the kind of the cliche
surrealist<00:02:16.439> that<00:02:16.769> are<00:02:16.859> always<00:02:17.040> touched<00:02:17.280> upon

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
surrealist that are always touched upon

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.030 
surrealist that are always touched upon
like<00:02:17.790> dolly<00:02:18.060> or<00:02:18.480> man-ray<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.409> something<00:02:19.799> and<00:02:19.950> I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
like dolly or man-ray or something and I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.069 
like dolly or man-ray or something and I
i<00:02:20.250> searched<00:02:20.819> out<00:02:21.030> very<00:02:21.239> specifically<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.870> lot

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
i searched out very specifically a lot

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.080 
i searched out very specifically a lot
of<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> female<00:02:22.829> surrealist<00:02:23.310> painters<00:02:23.849> at<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
of the female surrealist painters at the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.380 
of the female surrealist painters at the
time<00:02:24.269> there<00:02:24.540> was<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.659> quite<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> strong<00:02:25.799> group<00:02:26.010> of

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
time there was a quite a strong group of

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.000 
time there was a quite a strong group of
female<00:02:27.390> Surrealists<00:02:28.109> you<00:02:28.680> know<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:28.799> thought<00:02:28.920> it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
female Surrealists you know I thought it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.640 
female Surrealists you know I thought it
was<00:02:29.099> important<00:02:29.609> that<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.269> video<00:02:30.900> had<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> very

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
was important that the video had a very

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.240 
was important that the video had a very
feminine<00:02:33.230> attitude<00:02:34.230> towards<00:02:34.650> these<00:02:34.859> artistic

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
feminine attitude towards these artistic

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.209 
feminine attitude towards these artistic
images<00:02:35.849> there<00:02:36.569> was<00:02:36.659> also<00:02:36.780> all<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.769> references

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
images there was also all the references

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.429 
images there was also all the references
in<00:02:38.400> there<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.760> some<00:02:39.030> Tarkovsky<00:02:39.629> films<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
in there to some Tarkovsky films and the

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.740 
in there to some Tarkovsky films and the
imagery<00:02:40.859> influenced<00:02:41.370> by<00:02:41.459> Lucian<00:02:41.849> Freud<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.629> it

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
imagery influenced by Lucian Freud so it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.330 
imagery influenced by Lucian Freud so it
was<00:02:42.840> kind<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.230> all<00:02:43.349> over<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.590> map<00:02:43.799> again<00:02:44.010> much

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
was kind of all over the map again much

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.069 
was kind of all over the map again much
the<00:02:44.489> way<00:02:44.609> closer<00:02:44.939> was<00:02:45.269> later<00:02:45.569> we're<00:02:45.810> closer

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
the way closer was later we're closer

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.280 
the way closer was later we're closer

this enormous reference book and I

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.940 
this enormous reference book and I
started<00:03:02.760> showing<00:03:03.209> these<00:03:03.389> images<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.169> effects

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
started showing these images to effects

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.679 
started showing these images to effects
house<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.430> saying<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.239> something<00:03:06.659> like

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
cutting and pasting collages like Max

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.729 
cutting and pasting collages like Max
Ernst<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.209> they<00:03:15.689> said<00:03:15.870> yeah<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.109> can<00:03:16.230> do<00:03:16.590> it

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
Ernst and they said yeah you can do it

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.189 
Ernst and they said yeah you can do it
but<00:03:16.919> making<00:03:17.219> it<00:03:17.280> all<00:03:17.459> move<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.449> having<00:03:19.109> the

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
but making it all move and having the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.469 
but making it all move and having the
camera<00:03:19.650> move<00:03:19.859> if<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.940> want<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.239> do<00:03:21.329> this

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
camera move if you want to do this

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.119 
camera move if you want to do this
starts<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.930> become<00:03:22.049> trickier<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:22.859> said

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
starts to become trickier and I said

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.659 
starts to become trickier and I said
well<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.579> do<00:03:24.449> and<00:03:25.019> so<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:26.129> know<00:03:26.220> some<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.489> it

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
well I do and so you know some of it

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.360 
well I do and so you know some of it
became<00:03:27.109> you<00:03:28.109> know<00:03:28.229> writing<00:03:28.500> new<00:03:28.769> software<00:03:29.340> to

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
became you know writing new software to

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.219 
became you know writing new software to
make<00:03:29.669> new<00:03:29.849> things<00:03:29.879> happen<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.659> weren't

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
make new things happen that weren't

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.860 
make new things happen that weren't
previously<00:03:31.439> possible<00:03:31.909> this<00:03:32.909> was<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.419> early

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
previously possible this was just early

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.539 
previously possible this was just early
without<00:03:34.439> getting<00:03:34.680> too<00:03:34.829> technical<00:03:34.859> but<00:03:35.459> this

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
without getting too technical but this

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.610 
without getting too technical but this
was<00:03:35.729> just<00:03:35.760> early<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.329> this<00:03:36.479> point<00:03:37.260> at<00:03:37.470> which

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
was just early in this point at which

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.339 
was just early in this point at which
you<00:03:38.010> could<00:03:38.189> track<00:03:38.629> pixels<00:03:39.629> on<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> computer

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
you could track pixels on the computer

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.379 
you could track pixels on the computer
meaning<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.680> could<00:03:40.859> fix<00:03:41.159> a<00:03:41.430> certain<00:03:42.000> part<00:03:42.299> of

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
meaning you could fix a certain part of

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.659 
meaning you could fix a certain part of
the<00:03:42.449> frame<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.109> if<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> person<00:03:44.099> moved<00:03:44.310> around

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
the frame and if the person moved around

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.599 
the frame and if the person moved around
you<00:03:45.419> could<00:03:45.629> track<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.319> movement<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:46.979> apply

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
you could track that movement and apply

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.360 
you could track that movement and apply
whatever<00:03:48.120> effect<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:48.959> pixel<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.040> you

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
whatever effect to that pixel and you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.429 
whatever effect to that pixel and you
could<00:03:50.519> which<00:03:50.849> is<00:03:50.970> called<00:03:51.180> pixel<00:03:51.540> tracking<00:03:51.750> now

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
could which is called pixel tracking now

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.050 
could which is called pixel tracking now
it's<00:03:52.680> unbelievably<00:03:53.280> calm<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.729> then<00:03:53.819> it<00:03:53.939> was

or something it was something that we

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.740 
or something it was something that we
weren't<00:04:02.310> quite<00:04:02.639> sure<00:04:02.669> was<00:04:03.060> going<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.239> work<00:04:03.419> and

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
weren't quite sure was going to work and

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.619 
weren't quite sure was going to work and
it<00:04:03.840> took<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.259> digital<00:04:05.069> artist<00:04:05.909> his<00:04:06.359> name<00:04:06.540> was

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
it took the digital artist his name was

it took the digital artist his name was
Ashley<00:04:07.019> back<00:04:07.259> it<00:04:07.709> took<00:04:07.859> him<00:04:08.040> days<00:04:08.519> actually<00:04:09.060> to

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
Ashley back it took him days actually to

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.670 
Ashley back it took him days actually to
do<00:04:09.569> something<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:09.959> now<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.109> think<00:04:10.199> probably

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
do something that now I think probably

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.140 
do something that now I think probably
someone<00:04:10.889> could<00:04:10.979> do<00:04:11.069> in<00:04:11.159> about<00:04:11.250> 20<00:04:11.639> minutes<00:04:11.790> a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
someone could do in about 20 minutes a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.089 
someone could do in about 20 minutes a
lot<00:04:12.629> of<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.959> was<00:04:13.109> on<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.409> edge<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.769> what<00:04:13.979> was

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
lot of it was on the edge of what was

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.640 
lot of it was on the edge of what was
really<00:04:14.250> possible<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.540> do

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
really possible to do

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.709 
really possible to do
