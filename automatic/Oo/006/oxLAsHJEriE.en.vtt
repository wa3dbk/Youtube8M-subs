00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.839
 bars apparently without light 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.190
 being attentive tonic to the exploration of the pentatonic creek 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.200
 to go 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.330
 I'm going to put a base to sound 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.570

 always using photos notes 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.350

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.060
 percent men the baby so and I want to share with you 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.900
 is that

 the least common in music as well as other genres 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.940
 it's a language 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.350
 This genre has given rise to many other genres such as rock-and-roll 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.720
 the Jazz 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.490

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.350
 it is common 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.280
 a genre and in peace and that we all have to learn 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.200
 Mengual that everyone should know even a little bit even if it's a couple 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.140
 of phrases 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.090
 just as Spanish has 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.090
 have phrases or sentences that allow us to communicate 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.910

 do not fall behind like for example 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.979
 oo 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.209

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.859

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.590
 precious gender language that send staff I like a lot maybe not 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:31.999

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.689
 You tell me 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.699

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.109

 let's go a little down 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.349
 well let's go improvisation 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.340
 the statist trainer with drums and a more accompanying guitar does not have 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.139
 under a foreground does not have much more only it is like for this bridge 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.439
