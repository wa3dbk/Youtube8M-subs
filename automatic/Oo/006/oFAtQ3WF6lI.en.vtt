00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
below but it looks like guys this is the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.710 
below but it looks like guys this is the
last<00:01:13.640> snapshot<00:01:14.640> i<00:01:14.790> can't<00:01:15.000> say<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.330> freaking

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
last snapshot i can't say this freaking

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.719 
last snapshot i can't say this freaking
word<00:01:15.840> today<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> last<00:01:17.119> snapshot<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.410 
word today it's the last snapshot for a
minecraft<00:01:20.729> prior<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.509> 1.8<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.409> i'm<00:01:22.650> guessing

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
minecraft prior to 1.8 so i'm guessing

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.149 
minecraft prior to 1.8 so i'm guessing
my<00:01:24.420> professional<00:01:25.080> opinion<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.799> we're

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
my professional opinion is that we're

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
my professional opinion is that we're
gonna<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.549> minecraft<00:01:27.030> 1.8<00:01:27.509> launch<00:01:27.780> either

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
gonna see minecraft 1.8 launch either

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
gonna see minecraft 1.8 launch either
next<00:01:28.470> week<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.220> following<00:01:29.250> week<00:01:29.820> after

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
next week or the following week after

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.609 
next week or the following week after
that<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.479> i<00:01:30.540> would<00:01:30.659> say<00:01:30.810> probably<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> two

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that so i would say probably one to two

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.429 
that so i would say probably one to two
weeks<00:01:31.820> before<00:01:32.820> minecraft<00:01:33.420> 1.8<00:01:33.869> comes<00:01:34.110> out<00:01:34.259> if

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
weeks before minecraft 1.8 comes out if

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.569 
weeks before minecraft 1.8 comes out if
it<00:01:34.590> goes<00:01:34.710> any<00:01:34.799> longer<00:01:35.159> than<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.369> i'm<00:01:35.490> gonna

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
it goes any longer than that i'm gonna

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.950 
it goes any longer than that i'm gonna
