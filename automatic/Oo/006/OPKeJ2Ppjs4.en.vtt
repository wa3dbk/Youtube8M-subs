so let's get started so you're probably

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.470 
so let's get started so you're probably
wondering<00:00:10.019> why<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.620> chose<00:00:11.010> line<00:00:11.550> paper<00:00:11.849> instead

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
wondering why I chose line paper instead

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.400 
wondering why I chose line paper instead
of<00:00:12.599> some<00:00:12.990> other<00:00:13.230> professional<00:00:14.070> paper<00:00:14.370> well

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
of some other professional paper well

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.000 
of some other professional paper well

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
you guys might not know how to draw Pony

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.700 
you guys might not know how to draw Pony
bases<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.449> easier<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.900> draw<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.439> line

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
bases so it's easier to draw on line

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.980 
bases so it's easier to draw on line
paper<00:00:23.039> than<00:00:23.910> ordinary<00:00:24.660> paper<00:00:25.760> so<00:00:26.869> just<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
paper than ordinary paper so just a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.519 
paper than ordinary paper so just a
little<00:00:28.140> tip<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.660> want<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> draw<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
little tip so first you want to draw a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.229 
little tip so first you want to draw a
three<00:00:32.430> line<00:00:32.969> circle<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.860> go<00:00:35.610> two<00:00:35.670> lines

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
three line circle and then go two lines

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
three line circle and then go two lines
or<00:00:36.860> three<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.960> make<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.200> circle<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:40.860> not

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
or three and make a circle but not

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.369 
or three and make a circle but not
touching<00:00:41.579> another<00:00:42.059> circle<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:42.719> not<00:00:42.930> touching

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
touching another circle but not touching

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.040 
touching another circle but not touching
either<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.340> lines<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.840> you're

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
either of the lines and then you're

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
either of the lines and then you're
gonna<00:00:46.170> make<00:00:46.440> another<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.219> little<00:00:48.059> bit<00:00:48.210> far

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
gonna make another one a little bit far

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.549 
gonna make another one a little bit far
from<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:50.360> make<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.870> by<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
from it and then make it like by the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.020 
from it and then make it like by the
lines<00:00:52.920> something<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:56.030> you

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
lines something like that so that you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
lines something like that so that you
make<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> ears<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
make the ears go like that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.439 
make the ears go like that
and<00:00:58.949> then<00:00:59.219> all<00:00:59.600> up<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:02.160> another<00:01:02.820> circle<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and then all up to another circle and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.899 
and then all up to another circle and
then<00:01:03.660> down<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:05.489> one

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
then down to that one

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.399 
then down to that one
I<00:01:05.939> mean<00:01:06.659> line<00:01:07.189> my<00:01:08.189> head<00:01:08.400> today<00:01:09.229> you're<00:01:10.229> gonna

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I mean line my head today you're gonna

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.359 
I mean line my head today you're gonna
make<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:12.390> line<00:01:13.200> right<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.070> then

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
make one a line right there and then

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.410 
make one a line right there and then
make<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.939> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
make it like that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.320 
make it like that
you<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:16.350> want<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.890> too<00:01:17.280> close<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
you don't want it to be too close to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.780 
you don't want it to be too close to
that<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:19.860> bit<00:01:19.979> far<00:01:20.310> from<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that one just a little bit far from it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.280 
that one just a little bit far from it
like<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.720> start<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:24.170> you're<00:01:25.170> gonna

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
like the start of this one you're gonna

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.499 
like the start of this one you're gonna
make<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> curve<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.430> how<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.759> normally<00:01:27.090> do

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
make a curve this is how I normally do

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.440 
make a curve this is how I normally do
it<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.930> anyone<00:01:28.380> elses<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.729> curve<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it not anyone elses but I do a curve and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
it not anyone elses but I do a curve and
then<00:01:30.810> go<00:01:31.110> into<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
then go into it like that for like the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.219 
then go into it like that for like the
chest<00:01:35.610> part<00:01:35.930> for<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:38.000> for<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> back<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
chest part for the for the back or the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.429 
chest part for the for the back or the
but<00:01:40.670> either<00:01:41.670> way<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.479> same<00:01:42.540> you're

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
but either way it's the same you're

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.130 
but either way it's the same you're
gonna<00:01:44.570> apply<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.409> curve<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.990> stop<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
gonna apply the curve and then stop the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.880 
gonna apply the curve and then stop the
feet<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.770> middle<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.369> two<00:01:50.970> lines

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
feet in the middle of two lines

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.819 
feet in the middle of two lines
something<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:58.320> when<00:01:58.710> you're

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
something like that so when you're

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.370 
something like that so when you're
making<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.219> feet<00:01:59.460> you're<00:01:59.850> gonna<00:02:00.090> want<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.540> put

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
making the feet you're gonna want to put

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.149 
making the feet you're gonna want to put
a<00:02:01.649> little<00:02:02.189> line<00:02:02.670> over<00:02:03.049> lake<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> middle<00:02:04.920> of

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
a little line over lake in the middle of

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.350 
a little line over lake in the middle of
it<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.930> looks<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:08.069> normal<00:02:08.550> feet<00:02:08.970> for

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
it so it looks like a normal feet for

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.980 
it so it looks like a normal feet for
ponies<00:02:11.030> you're<00:02:12.030> gonna<00:02:12.209> do

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
ponies you're gonna do

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.980 
ponies you're gonna do
three<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.470> two<00:02:13.500> or<00:02:13.890> two<00:02:14.250> lines<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.000> put<00:02:15.870> it

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
three to two or two lines and put it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.920 
three to two or two lines and put it
that<00:02:16.740> down<00:02:20.360> like<00:02:21.360> that

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
that down like that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.500 
that down like that
something<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:23.040> little<00:02:23.370> ordinary<00:02:24.060> but

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
something a little ordinary but

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.890 
something a little ordinary but
different<00:02:24.960> you're<00:02:25.500> gonna<00:02:25.650> wanna<00:02:26.480> erase<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
different you're gonna wanna erase the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.410 
different you're gonna wanna erase the
sketch<00:02:28.170> lines<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:31.040> if<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.790> erase<00:02:33.120> anything

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
sketch lines and if you erase anything

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.730 
sketch lines and if you erase anything
else<00:02:33.840> from<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.730> you're<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.970> gonna<00:02:36.620> draw<00:02:37.620> it

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
else from it you're just gonna draw it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.070 
else from it you're just gonna draw it
back<00:02:40.670> now<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.450> hand<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.560> doing<00:02:44.190> me

teardrop don't close that one make a
teardrop<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:04.080> then<00:05:04.680> start<00:05:04.980> from<00:05:05.130> here<00:05:05.460> make<00:05:06.150> a

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
teardrop and then start from here make a

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.960 
teardrop and then start from here make a
little<00:05:06.660> stub<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.520> make<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.790> little

little stub so you make a little

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.320 
little stub so you make a little
teardrop<00:05:09.330> sorry<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.470> video<00:05:11.280> paused<00:05:11.640> a<00:05:11.970> little

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
teardrop sorry the video paused a little

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.290 
teardrop sorry the video paused a little
to<00:05:13.200> drop<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.680> then<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:13.890> stub<00:05:14.160> there<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.670> then<00:05:15.060> a

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
to drop and then a stub there and then a

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.110 
to drop and then a stub there and then a
bigger<00:05:15.570> stub<00:05:15.990> like<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.710> longer<00:05:17.220> stub<00:05:17.490> there<00:05:17.790> and

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
bigger stub like a longer stub there and

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.020 
bigger stub like a longer stub there and
then<00:05:18.420> small<00:05:19.170> step<00:05:19.530> again<00:05:19.830> then<00:05:20.580> you're<00:05:20.910> gonna

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
then small step again then you're gonna

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.980 
then small step again then you're gonna
do<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.360> from<00:05:21.480> the<00:05:21.690> outside<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.380> then<00:05:23.810> from<00:05:24.810> big

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
do it from the outside and then from big

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.770 
do it from the outside and then from big
to<00:05:25.020> small<00:05:25.170> like<00:05:25.560> that<00:05:26.120> so<00:05:27.120> that's<00:05:27.600> how<00:05:27.720> you

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
to small like that so that's how you
