to the studio in the morning I asked the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.530 
to the studio in the morning I asked the
models<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.739> into<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.159> position<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.970> did

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
models to get into that position I did

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.350 
models to get into that position I did
like<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.960> roll<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.290> film<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.180> whole

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
like one roll of film and and the whole

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.420 
like one roll of film and and the whole
time<00:01:09.600> he<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:09.780> standing<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.590> his<00:01:11.010> feet

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
time he was standing on on his feet

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.760 
time he was standing on on his feet
normally<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> then<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.049> looked<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.740> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
normally and then I looked there and I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.230 
normally and then I looked there and I
thought<00:01:13.890> something's<00:01:14.430> missing<00:01:14.670> something

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
thought something's missing something

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240 
thought something's missing something
littles<00:01:15.540> missing<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> was

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
littles missing and and so I was

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.429 
littles missing and and so I was
screaming<00:01:17.759> at<00:01:17.850> him<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.240> Gowanus<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.229> your

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
screaming at him like Gowanus on your

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
screaming at him like Gowanus on your
toes<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.280> he<00:01:20.369> was<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> moment<00:01:21.299> for

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
toes and so he was like for a moment for

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.440 
toes and so he was like for a moment for
fraction<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.220> like<00:01:23.220> first<00:01:23.369> second<00:01:23.850> he<00:01:23.939> came<00:01:24.210> up

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
fraction of like first second he came up

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.380 
fraction of like first second he came up
he<00:01:24.689> pushed<00:01:25.170> himself<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.090> his<00:01:27.180> toes

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
he pushed himself up and was on his toes

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.730 
he pushed himself up and was on his toes
and<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.630> took<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> picture<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> only

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and I took the picture this is the only

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.260 
and I took the picture this is the only
shot<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.070> looks<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> other

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
shot that looks like that all the other

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.230 
shot that looks like that all the other
ones<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.630> did<00:01:31.400> with<00:01:32.400> his<00:01:32.520> feet<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.150> they're

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
ones I did with his feet on and they're

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.750 
ones I did with his feet on and they're
not<00:01:33.270> as<00:01:33.479> balanced<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.290> one

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.360 

I<00:01:42.880> look<00:01:43.540> for<00:01:43.810> balance<00:01:44.260> within<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.920> frame<00:01:45.190> I'm

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
I look for balance within the frame I'm

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.970 
I look for balance within the frame I'm
working<00:01:45.760> it<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:47.050> that<00:01:47.320> that's<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.770> think

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
working it and and that that's I think

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.170 
working it and and that that's I think
that's<00:01:48.130> what<00:01:48.280> all<00:01:48.400> my<00:01:48.550> pictures<00:01:48.730> are<00:01:49.000> about

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.630 
that's what all my pictures are about
and<00:01:49.650> probably<00:01:50.650> that's<00:01:50.980> what<00:01:51.160> I'm<00:01:51.280> looking<00:01:51.550> in

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
and probably that's what I'm looking in

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.220 
and probably that's what I'm looking in
my<00:01:51.730> life<00:01:51.910> as<00:01:52.060> well<00:01:52.240> I'm<00:01:52.360> looking<00:01:52.660> for<00:01:52.840> balance

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
my life as well I'm looking for balance

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.460 
my life as well I'm looking for balance
I'm<00:01:53.440> looking<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:54.010> sort<00:01:54.910> of<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.180> good<00:01:56.610> even

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
I'm looking for sort of a good even

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.980 
I'm looking for sort of a good even
energy<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.790> this<00:02:00.970> picture<00:02:01.300> that<00:02:01.330> we<00:02:01.480> have<00:02:01.720> here

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
energy in this picture that we have here

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.890 
energy in this picture that we have here
is<00:02:02.110> quite<00:02:02.980> good<00:02:03.100> example<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.790> shows<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.360> on

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
is quite good example it shows that on

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.980 
is quite good example it shows that on
the<00:02:05.440> one<00:02:05.620> hand<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:07.120> face<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:07.570> don't<00:02:07.750> see<00:02:07.900> the

the one hand the face you don't see the
face<00:02:08.200> it's<00:02:08.649> kind<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:08.950> an<00:02:09.100> abstract<00:02:09.610> picture

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
face it's kind of an abstract picture

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.340 
face it's kind of an abstract picture
you<00:02:10.060> have<00:02:10.210> the<00:02:10.360> form<00:02:10.660> we<00:02:10.810> have<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.080> shape<00:02:11.320> of

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
you have the form we have the shape of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.910 
you have the form we have the shape of
the<00:02:11.620> body<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.450> way<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.170> body<00:02:14.560> sits

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the body and and the way the body sits

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.010 
the body and and the way the body sits
within<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.520> frame<00:02:15.760> has<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.660> certain

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
within the frame has this certain

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.960 
within the frame has this certain
balance<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.560> I'm<00:02:17.680> looking<00:02:17.830> for<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.460> this<00:02:18.850> is

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
balance that I'm looking for and this is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.750 
balance that I'm looking for and this is
why<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.440> probably<00:02:20.440> chose<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:21.040> one<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.340> be<00:02:21.460> to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
why I probably chose this one to be to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.230 
why I probably chose this one to be to
be<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:21.970> one<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.600> my<00:02:22.690> last<00:02:22.810> latest<00:02:23.560> books<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:25.150> of

images<00:03:39.640> there's<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.910> lot<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.180> post-production

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
images there's a lot of post-production

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.660 
images there's a lot of post-production
going<00:03:41.110> on<00:03:41.230> so<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.440> manipulate<00:03:42.100> my<00:03:42.280> pictures<00:03:42.640> a

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670

going on so I manipulate my pictures a
lot<00:03:42.820> you<00:03:43.060> know<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.180> make<00:03:43.420> things<00:03:43.930> darker<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.620> make

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
lot you know I make things darker I make

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.460 
lot you know I make things darker I make
things<00:03:44.950> lighter<00:03:45.220> afterwards<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:47.350> is

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
things lighter afterwards and so this is

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.599 
things lighter afterwards and so this is
a<00:03:47.500> this<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:50.560> is<00:03:50.859> an<00:03:51.040> exception<00:03:51.519> in

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
a this is a and this is an exception in

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.340 
a this is a and this is an exception in
that<00:03:51.639> sense<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.420> image<00:03:52.690> is<00:03:52.750> printed<00:03:53.079> as

scarf on with a little fur and I wanted

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.400 
scarf on with a little fur and I wanted
to<00:05:05.910> have<00:05:06.030> it<00:05:06.150> very<00:05:06.330> simple<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:07.080> think<00:05:07.290> this

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
to have it very simple and I think this

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.960 
to have it very simple and I think this
is<00:05:07.530> all<00:05:07.650> my<00:05:07.770> potters<00:05:08.160> are<00:05:08.280> quite<00:05:08.460> simple<00:05:08.910> and

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
is all my potters are quite simple and

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.190 
is all my potters are quite simple and
quite<00:05:09.060> strong<00:05:09.360> they're<00:05:09.930> not<00:05:10.050> really

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
quite strong they're not really

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.140 
quite strong they're not really
flattering<00:05:10.770> but<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:11.340> think<00:05:11.580> they<00:05:11.669> catch<00:05:11.940> the

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
flattering but I think they catch the
