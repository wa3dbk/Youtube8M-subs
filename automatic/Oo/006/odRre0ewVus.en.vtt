00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.270
 Good day, dear friends with 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.210
 you again perpetuum or alexander and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.690
 today we will play mario in mario 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.320
 21st century now our mario has turned from 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.730
 plumber of course in auto mechanics 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
 who else could he turn into 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.580
 Of course, look at the mechanic 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.910
 Apparently in our character, he stared at 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.560
 he grew a mustache and began to move 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.359
 now he has mutant whiskers and for some reason he 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.239
 dancing apparently he is very pleased that I 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.309
 Well, well, the game is called for other 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.649
 brothers which is kind of like 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.680
 translated other brothers, I in general that have 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.950
 we, too, there will be a brother above us by 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.730
 Growth, but I saw the same here on the screenshot 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.370
 we need to jump 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.140
 enemies on the head kill them but the game 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 much harder to be honest i'm not 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.690
 I already played a little bit and understood that she 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.969
 complicated enough when we will 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
 we will pick up these boxes here 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.180
 give weapons you see ki giving 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.670
 throw up on weapon 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.850
 let's throw a dog he will stun and and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.540
 all the dog died everything is very simple well 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.299
 what are we now 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.170
 plunge into this world of dirt and corruption 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.900
 take a look 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.689
 apparently our world mario mario world is no longer 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.850
 the one here is constantly built everywhere 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.090
 refueling you see refueling some 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.640
 plants still mired rusted 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.500
 weapons we have become and no yes run 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.869
 some strange monsters in the rain 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.200
 darkness right some city of sins now 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.540
 we have 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.150
 where is our castle where is our princess apparently 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.420
 she is no longer so this boss he wants us 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.790
 eat kill so we have pancakes now on 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.360
 weapons for some reason okay apparently she is given 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.119
 for a while 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.979
 okay okay okay throw year pigeons 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.950
 can kill look when we 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.320
 jump on the pigeon we crush the epic blue 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.200
 I feel sorry for the dove oh oh the dog pooch 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.610
 tisha tisha tisha tisha need a little 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.610
 be quieter 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.320
 so here it is necessary to go down and this one 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.480
 man is very scary in fact he 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.730
 smokes and he can give us upper code 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.800
 fine so everything is just fine 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.320
 you turned this thing on and now itâ€™s spinning 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.490
 6 well, we don't need it anymore 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.200
 can move on to the factory yes yes 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.160
 robotics perfectly visible some robots 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.810
 yes yes there will be done 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.540
 prepare to be made 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.160
 So it is very long and the pit 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.760
 to jump over i would not personally jump over and 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.890
 and mari will fly away yes so now dude grove 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.290
 cocaine cutting look what's interesting 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.120
 that the press does not crush the monsters the monster they 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.150
 cooler than with excellent on Ali Kaki 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.489
 giving the weapon once, so here 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.090
 it looks all 2 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.920
 literally kidka and our monster 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.360
 dying great weapons disappeared 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.150
 for some reason when I get to a certain 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.590
 points the weapon disappears it is honest 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.280
 a little frustrating but like a little 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.350
 very much 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.050
 fine i just jumped on his head and 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.910
 got damage this is not the case this is not the case 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.540
 stop stop stop without me no payment 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.489

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.049

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.670
 and palin second jump failed 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.340
 make beats on the bars goes wave to him 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.260
 we die it of course so we have 4 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.090
 life and two blows we can still get 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.390
 before we die before we 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.130
 die let's go here we have here here 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.310
 we have a fan gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.410
 and this man come on let's not the main thing 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.410
 come down here fuh somehow 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.540
 offend his golden dove golden 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.780
 Dove now our otlichnenko honors 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.250
 they gave us life health we all have five 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.930
 blows we can get come on here 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.459
 wait for him to come down then 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.989
 all of them here this peasant let's excellent 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.370
 the game may seem from the first time that 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.159
 not really complicated but in fact 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.670
 she is very complex and hardcore 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.890
 That's when I still got a piece 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.590
 damage look they just swim to 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.370
 they kill me so me another blow and 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.730
 i die it will be bad home from check 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.170
 point 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.439
 the main thing that these guys are not 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.719
 went down there waiting for me so how would 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.609
 do not rise so as not to hurt him op op 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:14.019
 here's another such moment they look from 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.919
 two sides if I just jumped 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.400
 take it damage 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:22.870
 under happened but still overcome 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.610
 trick them a little bit so and then if i 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.139
 jump I can take damage from the dog to 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.199
 example, yes, therefore, you have to somehow 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:34.960
 to excel to turn out and just a 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:37.900
 by doggy died of 93 seconds if they 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.550
 will pass and I will lose another golden 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.840
 pigeon it will be bad i will lose i 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.360
 I do not want to lose clearly 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.849
 about the account of a man why and then rose 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.180
 up if not there is not even necessary 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.590
 move 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.720
 oh immediately give a look what they are doing to me 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.330
 two more hits and i die weird what else i 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.190
 never died last time I literally 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.310
 spent all my lives right away to me 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.090
 had to start again amazing 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.130
 so the first time I record first 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.110
 he played the usual immediately 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.360
 The first time I play and record that is 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.470
 peylin what nonsense i just put on 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.470
 about dovecote 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.669
 all dna ended dna 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:25.500
 thank you for going through this 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:30.110
 part of the brothers of others and it's small 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.850
 a piece of your adventure the whole game 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:37.320
 will have more worlds and will have 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.669
 co-op mode damn ok let's 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.100
 go back to the places where we were not 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.860
 let's see that there is haze so fast 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.289
 passed honestly i'm disappointed i 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.990
 disappointed admit honest need that 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.880
 I am very disappointed the game seems to be 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.060
 not bad given dna she is too 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.220
 short and does it think in my place 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.639
 would upset any self-respecting 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.240
 a person could not be here for the first time in 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:05.759
 him waha back buy to buy add 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.259
 everything is so important not to lose the bolts why 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.539
 they will lose now just lose them 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:14.729
 let's hit it and here I am lost 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:16.380
 bolts all powerup over well not good 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.789
 my fault I even know where to go now 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.330
 where I have not been and have not been 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:24.560
 here there now yes it's interesting what's there 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.560
 we have a box here by 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:33.720
 It was all over . I didn't expect that 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:38.550
 there will be this turd come pigeon 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.510
 dove take a can before fly these 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.020
 righteous 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.060
 and still literally a piece of a mustache 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.610
 slice have I passed this segment 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.169
 small as we say site authors 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.389
 of course it's a small segment 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.190
 I would play it more though the game is me 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.280
 not really honestly liked it but I 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.470
 love such arcade games 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.020
 platformers and in den especially with good 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.479
 beautiful sprite it play it yourself 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.340
 taking for granted things so we are not yet 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:09.000
 We went out to see what's out there and 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.849
 no we were here were okay 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.699
 Okay, everything went I get well 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:16.040
 guys think on this you can finish 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:18.350
 our little 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.570
 pseudo passing because you see 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.090
 dude already hit us he thinks we 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.610
 must round out and yes this one too 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:27.320
 giant chubby healthy fluff giant he 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.290
 look like you don't remember my name 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:33.710
 this actor but the actor is so cool 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:35.270
 so he says that we have to go 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.070
 Yes, and the pigeons are not quite 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.320
 happy that they are constantly up to black 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.000
 apparently we need to save the pigeons here 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.950
 something strange game 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.130
 we reached dovecote and then the game 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.940
 apparently ended the essence of saving pigeons 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.360
 is 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.830
 but since it is so it is so possible 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.130
 just run away from the monsters and just 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:58.940
 run through this level for speed here 

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.490
 here about and everything went 

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.410
 in a minute too small 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.240
 haze i can't believe but the game 

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.190
