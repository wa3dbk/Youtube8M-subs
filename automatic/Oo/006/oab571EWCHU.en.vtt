rainy days so let's get started first

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.220 
rainy days so let's get started first
you<00:00:11.849> need<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.030> take<00:00:12.179> some<00:00:12.389> yellow<00:00:12.540> clay<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
you need to take some yellow clay and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.730 
you need to take some yellow clay and
flatten<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:14.070> into<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> kind<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.540> domed<00:00:15.809> circle

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
flatten this into a kind of domed circle

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.779 
flatten this into a kind of domed circle
shape<00:00:17.930> then<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.080> want<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.470> take<00:00:19.770> six<00:00:20.340> pieces

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
shape then you want to take six pieces

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.140 
shape then you want to take six pieces
of<00:00:20.970> orange<00:00:21.449> clay<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.619> make<00:00:23.490> these<00:00:23.640> into

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
of orange clay and just make these into

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.740 
of orange clay and just make these into
isosceles<00:00:24.630> triangles<00:00:25.500> kind<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.750> just

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
isosceles triangles kind of and just

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.210 
isosceles triangles kind of and just
repeat<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.769> these<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.160> these

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
repeat this for all of these and these

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:38.360 
repeat this for all of these and these
are<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> rays<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.300> Sun<00:00:37.129> then<00:00:38.129> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
are going to be the rays of Sun then you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.920 
are going to be the rays of Sun then you
can<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:38.730> put<00:00:38.940> these<00:00:39.059> around<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> edge<00:00:39.690> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
can just put these around the edge of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.770 
can just put these around the edge of
the<00:00:40.320> main<00:00:40.739> part<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.309> Sun<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the main part of the Sun and you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.590 
the main part of the Sun and you
probably<00:00:42.989> will<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.469> shape<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.100> before<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
probably will have to shape it before to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.959 
probably will have to shape it before to
make<00:00:45.719> sure<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:46.079> all<00:00:46.110> fit<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.399> keep

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
make sure they all fit but just keep

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.360 
make sure they all fit but just keep
trying<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.350> work<00:00:52.070> then<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.219> can

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
trying and it will work then you can

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.860 
trying and it will work then you can
just<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.670> define<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.420> points<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.289> need<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.119 

then<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.020> should<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
then you should all like this then you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.160 
then you should all like this then you
can<00:01:02.219> take<00:01:02.579> some<00:01:02.850> colors<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.449> clay<00:01:03.629> I'm<00:01:03.899> using

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
can take some colors of clay I'm using

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.910 
can take some colors of clay I'm using
mint<00:01:04.559> pink<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.610> light<00:01:06.420> blue<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.770> is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
mint pink and light blue and this is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.289 
mint pink and light blue and this is
fully<00:01:08.159> unfurl<00:01:08.549> oh<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.060> use

whatever you want and just shape these
into<00:01:10.680> kind<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.340> rounded<00:01:12.270> triangles<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.080> one

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
into kind of rounded triangles with one

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.859 
into kind of rounded triangles with one
end<00:01:13.770> being<00:01:14.180> rounded<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> other<00:01:15.570> being

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
end being rounded and the other being

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.390 
end being rounded and the other being
more<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> point<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.280> put

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
more a point and then you can just put

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460 
more a point and then you can just put
these<00:01:17.520> together<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.570> start<00:01:18.840> creating<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
these together to start creating the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.170 
these together to start creating the
umbrella<00:01:19.830> shape<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.340> make<00:01:20.490> sure<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.880> top<00:01:21.030> is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
umbrella shape and make sure the top is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.350 
umbrella shape and make sure the top is
smooth<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> bottom<00:01:23.070> has<00:01:23.360> defined

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
smooth and that the bottom has defined

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.580 
smooth and that the bottom has defined
edges<00:01:26.150> like<00:01:27.150> an<00:01:27.360> umbrella<00:01:30.140> then<00:01:31.140> take<00:01:31.409> some

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
edges like an umbrella then take some

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.590 
edges like an umbrella then take some
black<00:01:31.740> clay<00:01:31.920> mold<00:01:32.310> us<00:01:32.430> into<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.820> fairly<00:01:33.299> thick

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
black clay mold us into a fairly thick

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.899 
black clay mold us into a fairly thick
snake<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:35.040> cut<00:01:35.220> off<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.430> piece<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
snake and then just cut off a piece and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.260 
snake and then just cut off a piece and
curve<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.259> end<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> look<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
curve out the end to make it look like a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
curve out the end to make it look like a
handle<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.829> put<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.280> end

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
handle and then just put this on the end

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.970 
handle and then just put this on the end
of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.909> umbrella

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.340 

then<00:01:45.980> you<00:01:46.250> can<00:01:46.460> attach<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.120> to<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.570> Sun<00:01:47.810> to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
then you can attach this to the Sun to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.660 
then you can attach this to the Sun to
look<00:01:48.500> like<00:01:48.680> it's<00:01:49.040> holding<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.460> umbrella

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
look like it's holding the umbrella

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.620 
look like it's holding the umbrella
cause<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:50.210> raining<00:01:52.000> then<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.090> can<00:01:53.240> take<00:01:53.390> two

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
cause it's raining then you can take two

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.990 
cause it's raining then you can take two
pieces<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.930> clay<00:01:54.230> for<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.740> eyes<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.370> just

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
pieces of clay for the eyes and just

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.880 
pieces of clay for the eyes and just
place<00:01:56.210> these<00:01:56.420> on<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.140> main<00:01:57.320> part<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:57.770> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
place these on to the main part of the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.250 
place these on to the main part of the
Sun<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.850> then<00:01:59.120> roll<00:01:59.360> out<00:01:59.510> some<00:01:59.720> black<00:01:59.960> clay

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
Sun and then roll out some black clay

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.310 
Sun and then roll out some black clay
and<00:02:00.530> cut<00:02:01.490> off<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.640> very<00:02:01.940> two<00:02:02.510> very<00:02:02.780> small<00:02:03.050> pieces

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
and cut off a very two very small pieces

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.980 
and cut off a very two very small pieces
for<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.040> eyebrows<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.880> kind<00:02:05.120> of<00:02:05.240> just

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
for the eyebrows and this kind of just

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.499 
for the eyebrows and this kind of just
makes<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.890> have<00:02:07.220> more<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.520> an<00:02:07.610> expression<00:02:08.090> as

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
makes it have more of an expression as
