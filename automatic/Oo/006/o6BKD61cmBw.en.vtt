00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
straight on into the con now the first

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.360 
straight on into the con now the first
con<00:02:36.330> isn't<00:02:36.780> necessarily<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.440> con<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.070> really

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
con isn't necessarily a con but I really

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.040 
con isn't necessarily a con but I really
don't<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:38.760> how<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.060> cutout<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.780> fully

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
don't like how the cutout is in fully

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.170 
don't like how the cutout is in fully
accurate<00:02:40.350> for<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> apple<00:02:41.400> logo<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.150> zoom

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
accurate for the apple logo if we zoom

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.330 
accurate for the apple logo if we zoom
in<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.570> little<00:02:42.810> bit<00:02:42.960> more<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.070> see<00:02:44.310> that

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
in a little bit more you can see that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.190 
in a little bit more you can see that
part<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.030> Apple<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.480> actually<00:02:45.810> going<00:02:45.990> in

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
part of the Apple is actually going in

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.960 
part of the Apple is actually going in
the<00:02:46.290> circle<00:02:46.710> area<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.400> thought<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:47.820> you're

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the circle area and I thought if you're

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.370 
the circle area and I thought if you're
going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.210> do<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.510> cutout<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.960> must<00:02:49.170> as<00:02:49.350> well

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
going to do the cutout you must as well

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.470 
going to do the cutout you must as well
do<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.740> correctly<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> didn't<00:02:51.210> like<00:02:51.330> that

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
do it correctly so I didn't like that

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.110 
do it correctly so I didn't like that
about<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.900> case<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.380> also<00:02:53.160> didn't<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:53.940> you

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
about the case I also didn't like as you

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.480 
about the case I also didn't like as you
can<00:02:54.270> see<00:02:54.540> there's<00:02:54.900> kind<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.470> watermark<00:02:56.190> like

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
can see there's kind of watermark like

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.130 
can see there's kind of watermark like
material<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.270> when<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.420> got<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.960> actually

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
material and when I got it it actually

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.690 
material and when I got it it actually
looked<00:02:58.560> like<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.100> I'm<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.310> sure<00:02:59.370> if<00:02:59.550> it's

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
looked like this so I'm not sure if it's

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.420 
looked like this so I'm not sure if it's
used<00:03:00.150> or<00:03:00.450> new<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:01.290> if<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.560> new<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.890> really

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
used or new but if it's new I really

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.280 
used or new but if it's new I really
wouldn't<00:03:02.670> want<00:03:03.000> my<00:03:03.240> case<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.690> look<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.080> that

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
wouldn't want my case to look like that

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.070 
wouldn't want my case to look like that
and<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> last<00:03:05.280> con<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.520> had<00:03:05.640> was<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.450> actually

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
and the last con I had was I actually

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.990 
and the last con I had was I actually
had<00:03:07.530> some<00:03:07.770> lifting<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.370> screen<00:03:08.790> which

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
had some lifting of the screen which

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.300 
had some lifting of the screen which
I've<00:03:09.180> never<00:03:09.210> had<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.200> silicone<00:03:10.740> case<00:03:11.010> I

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
I've never had with this silicone case I

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.550 
I've never had with this silicone case I
guess<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.120> just<00:03:12.150> scripts<00:03:12.660> your<00:03:12.960> phone<00:03:13.200> so

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
guess it just scripts your phone so

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.800 
guess it just scripts your phone so
tight<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.220> actually<00:03:14.490> forms<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.570> little

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
tight that it actually forms a little

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.620 
tight that it actually forms a little
bit<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.050> bubbles<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:17.790> had<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.300> issue<00:03:18.480> with

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
bit of bubbles and I had the issue with

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.690 
bit of bubbles and I had the issue with
this<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.200> believe<00:03:19.560> because<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.460> very

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
this I believe because this is a very

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.790 
this I believe because this is a very

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
bubbles from the lifting which I didn't

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.540 
bubbles from the lifting which I didn't
appreciate<00:03:30.210> it<00:03:30.660> all<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.560> neither<00:03:31.920> than<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.370> I

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
appreciate it all so neither than that I

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.160 
appreciate it all so neither than that I
didn't<00:03:32.820> really<00:03:32.910> have<00:03:33.030> any<00:03:33.420> cons<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.990> let's

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
didn't really have any cons and let's

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.690 
didn't really have any cons and let's
just<00:03:34.380> go<00:03:34.500> ahead<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.770> get<00:03:35.100> straight<00:03:35.370> on<00:03:35.430> into

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
just go ahead and get straight on into

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.270 
just go ahead and get straight on into
the<00:03:36.000> pros<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:37.110> first<00:03:37.410> pro<00:03:37.650> boat<00:03:37.860> this<00:03:37.980> case

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
the pros the first pro boat this case

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.190 
the pros the first pro boat this case
are<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.700> looks<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.120> really<00:03:39.570> liked<00:03:39.810> how<00:03:40.050> they

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
are the looks I really liked how they

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.020 
are the looks I really liked how they
emphasized<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:40.890> apple<00:03:41.250> logo<00:03:41.280> by<00:03:41.700> having

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
emphasized the apple logo by having

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.670 
emphasized the apple logo by having
circle<00:03:42.450> surrounding<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.560> thought

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
circle surrounding it I just thought

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.860 
circle surrounding it I just thought
that<00:03:43.740> was<00:03:43.950> really<00:03:44.190> creative<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:45.000> them<00:03:45.150> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
that was really creative of them the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.600 
that was really creative of them the
second<00:03:46.290> thing<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.530> like<00:03:46.740> about<00:03:46.770> this<00:03:47.010> case<00:03:47.400> is

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
second thing I like about this case is

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.420 
second thing I like about this case is
how<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.300> material<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.320> really<00:03:50.040> like<00:03:50.220> how

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
how the material is I really like how

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.340 
how the material is I really like how
you<00:03:50.490> have<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.850> silicone<00:03:51.360> like<00:03:51.600> effect<00:03:52.080> for

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
you have the silicone like effect for

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.380 
you have the silicone like effect for
protection<00:03:52.980> but<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.700> don't<00:03:53.850> have<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.180> worry

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
protection but you don't have to worry

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.030 
protection but you don't have to worry
about<00:03:54.510> all<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.810> things<00:03:54.960> that<00:03:55.350> silicone<00:03:55.800> cases

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
about all the things that silicone cases

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.100 
about all the things that silicone cases
aren't<00:03:56.490> good<00:03:56.760> for<00:03:56.790> such<00:03:57.270> as<00:03:57.450> having<00:03:57.870> lynn

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
aren't good for such as having lynn

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.960 
aren't good for such as having lynn

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
earlier on I also like the protection as

you can see you have a small little lay

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.470 
you can see you have a small little lay
on<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.380> table<00:04:22.410> design<00:04:23.040> but<00:04:23.640> it's<00:04:23.790> still
