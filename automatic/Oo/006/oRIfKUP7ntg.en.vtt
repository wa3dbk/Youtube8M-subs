00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.810
 the sides of the departure lines of Moscow 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.340
 the number of wrecked cars is growing 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.019
 cemeteries cars forced reckless captivity 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.120
 slowing down so frightening 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.369
 look like a pile of metal that has been in 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.719
 Accidents are waiting for gbdd collecting terrible 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.549
 collection does not set itself 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.480
 the goal is to create new benefits according to the rules 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.100
 road traffic 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.560
 so why tons of scrap metal 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.720
 many posts DPS and than not threaten 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.040
 motorists understand anastasia 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.230
 shakhovskaya often 10 kilometers from 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.300
 ring highway but on this 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.460
 the plot is slowed down even the most 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.810
 notorious racers because it is clear that 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.510
 speeds without 1 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.540
 and can kill right on the side of the graveyard 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.250
 broken cars made up in rows 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.040
 machines and more precisely what is left of them 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.440
 piles of metal everyone who drives by like one 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:54.300
 harness to brake or guchkov lace what 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.180
 seriously seriously enough 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.880
 Now the product here is very 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.040
 sad 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.650
 but not even 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.870
 trouble we'll see 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.480
 if so impressive at speed then 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.760
 near frost on the skin hung helplessly 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.160
 no one needs an airbag 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.200
 first aid kit whose things are but most importantly 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.630
 many cars are literally turned out 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.910
 inside out engines scary 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.520
 imagine what was the speed and what was 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.710
 that day happened on the road if 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 somewhere else you can guess what was herself 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.180
 the car then many cars are tattered 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.790
 beyond recognition for example understand what 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.040
 here it was nissan can only 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.340
 the surviving icon on the wheel 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.710
 half a hundred twisted cars even more 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.510
 mutilated or ragged lives during 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 Varys and this fast two people died 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.330
 and hit 9 and almost all cars 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.950
 collided into a frightening frontal visual 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.960
 illustration of what happens when not 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.580
 follow the rules of the road 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.650
 here most likely there was a frontal 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.600
 the collision driver was obviously not 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.020
 fastened and struck like a head 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.860
 windscreen already the second chaesh 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.810
 already have rest of us 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.710
 Well 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.790
 It happens within 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.800
 the fact that at 66 and exceed grow such 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.140
 auto cemetery not only for edification but also 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.970
 from despair sometimes take the broken 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.310
 car to anyone for example in this on 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.530
 the stamp killed all the inspectors 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.870
 less required to keep these machines special 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.720
 parking for them is not enough here and dumped 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.910
 scrap dps posts is a problem 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.280
 nobody did it because she didn't 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.140
 wore such a large scale so far 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.069
 she didnâ€™t look out for the same example 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.230
 was in the hood not 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.000
 where is the dump of these cars 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.340
 so overgrown that it became borrow 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.290
 even one and a half lane for traffic in 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.910
 as a result, large 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.620
 traffic jams on the outskirts of the kapotnya 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.290
 according to experts, separate 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.660
 car cemetery sites arrange them 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.120
 on the verges can effectively but also 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.970
 dangerous because jumped into such a ditch 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.670
 the machine itself will replenish the terrible collection
