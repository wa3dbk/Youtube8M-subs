00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
beat fanatic but then I lost SKT so what

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950 
beat fanatic but then I lost SKT so what
do<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.890> think<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.130> means<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.520> them<00:01:23.960> doesn't

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
do you think that means for them doesn't

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.270 
do you think that means for them doesn't
mean<00:01:24.990> anything<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.619> still<00:01:25.799> beat<00:01:25.950> epi

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
mean anything they can still beat epi

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
mean anything they can still beat epi
and<00:01:26.460> OMG<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.840> mean<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.380> obvious<00:01:28.680> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and OMG and I mean it's obvious that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.190 
and OMG and I mean it's obvious that
they<00:01:28.860> lose<00:01:29.009> against<00:01:29.310> SKT<00:01:29.700> t1<00:01:29.790> because<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.630> think

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
they lose against SKT t1 because I think

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.510 
they lose against SKT t1 because I think
they<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:31.560> pretty<00:01:31.770> much<00:01:31.860> win<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> tournament

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
they will pretty much win the tournament

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.780 
they will pretty much win the tournament
but<00:01:33.290> am<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.560> think<00:01:35.280> they<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.640> fine

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
but am I think they will do fine

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
but am I think they will do fine
