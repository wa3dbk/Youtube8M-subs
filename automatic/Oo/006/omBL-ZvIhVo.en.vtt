 pellet stoves this is canaliza blÃ© 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.380
 the model of this 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.810
 Efe 125 12 5 kilowatts of power or 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.910
 be local up to 125 meters 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.020
 squares with the particularity that 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.849
 apart install it in the living room 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.070
 normally in the place where there is more 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.900
 comfort leaves the hot air over here 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.759
 hot to the stay but by the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.590
 back exit I will show you there are some 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.730
 holes with fans that 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.700
 you can supply with some 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.620
 canalizations until a few stays two 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.750
 stays or three according to those that 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.810
 do with very powerful engines 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.750
 Up to 10 meters is a pellet stove 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.630
 which has easy access here 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.370
 Ashtray for easy cleaning pass the 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.020
 vacuum cleaner that you have your drawer in three 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.800
 Ashes to pull or pass the vacuum cleaner 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.370
 directly and has a maximum consumption 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.040
 of 25 kilos per hour and a minimum of 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.810
 about 800 grams therefore you have 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.720
 many hours of comfort with a 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.649
 23 pellet deposit capacity 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.439
 kilos 23 kilos comes here the pellet is 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.600
 I would throw here here you have come follow in 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.820
 this presentation strips the pellet comes 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.640
 with his gloves to be able to do 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.829
 maintenance the cable and this cap that 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.539
 is in case jce requests the exit of 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.399
 Right side fumes 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.770
 all these stoves except the slim model 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.499
 They have rear output smoke ie 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.969
 posterior or right side then 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.439
 right side you ask us because the 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.479
 we leave die of prepared already for 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.950
 You can also request this separately 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.450
 for convenience the command to 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.100
 distance where you have the digital panel 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.929
 Easy to access but good for more 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.440
 comfort you have the remote control 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.830
 that you can also request 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.810
 here behind you already see you have two engines 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.030
 independent in one nozzle and in another 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.200
 in which we would say the tube of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.510
 channeling towards the different 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.130
 stays here you have the probe 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.530
 temperature this takes the temperature 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.810
 environment that stays separate so that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.610
 get real room temperature so that 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.260
 I'm not touching sheet metal and I know I'm 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.030
 note a temperature that is not not 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.490
 real and here you have the switch 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.850
 general power off 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.260
 connections and important smoke output 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.420
 of 88 centimeters in diameter 82 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.220
 millimeters is always born stainless the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.990
 smoke is very important the biomass of 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.960
 smoke always in stainless steel for 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.580
 avoid corrosion and condensation is 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.050
 important also the air intake lame 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.460
 air directly the street with four 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.010
 centimeters to get air from the 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.110
 street and do not consume local air is very 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.090
 important and I tell you canalizations 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.090
 up to 10 meters very good boiler
