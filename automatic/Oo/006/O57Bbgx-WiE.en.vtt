generation<00:00:04.470> jawbone<00:00:05.220> up<00:00:05.520> looks<00:00:05.790> like<00:00:06.140> with

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
generation jawbone up looks like with

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.580 
generation jawbone up looks like with
the<00:00:07.259> casing<00:00:07.649> off<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.099> I've<00:00:09.110> cut<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.230> casing

the casing off of it I've cut the casing
off<00:00:10.710> but<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.639> one<00:00:11.880> does<00:00:12.150> not<00:00:12.179> work<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:13.019> bought

off but this one does not work I bought
it<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.490> parts<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.240> know<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.599> could<00:00:16.670> have<00:00:17.670> an

extra cap for my Gen 1 and an extra

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.670 
extra cap for my Gen 1 and an extra
charger<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.600> got<00:00:21.750> my<00:00:21.840> wife<00:00:22.050> at<00:00:22.260> Gen<00:00:22.470> 2

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
charger because I got my wife at Gen 2

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.710 
charger because I got my wife at Gen 2
and<00:00:22.980> I'm<00:00:23.039> getting<00:00:23.279> another<00:00:23.460> Gen<00:00:23.730> 2<00:00:23.970> by<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> way

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
and I'm getting another Gen 2 by the way

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.450 
and I'm getting another Gen 2 by the way
I'm<00:00:24.900> wearing<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.260> Gen<00:00:25.470> 1<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:26.250> works

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
I'm wearing a Gen 1 that works

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.419 
I'm wearing a Gen 1 that works
flawlessly<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.330> think<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> main<00:00:28.289> problem<00:00:28.470> in

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
flawlessly I think the main problem in

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.130 
flawlessly I think the main problem in
my<00:00:29.580> personal<00:00:30.000> opinion<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.570> had<00:00:30.990> with

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
my personal opinion that they had with

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.170 
my personal opinion that they had with
these<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.679> not<00:00:31.800> even<00:00:32.040> their<00:00:32.189> problem<00:00:32.579> oh<00:00:32.820> by

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
these it's not even their problem oh by

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.430 
these it's not even their problem oh by
the<00:00:33.210> way<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.690> not<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> slam<00:00:34.200> against

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the way this is not a slam against

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.319 
the way this is not a slam against
jawbone<00:00:36.380> submersion<00:00:37.380> problems<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
jawbone submersion problems you know the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.720 
jawbone submersion problems you know the
batteries<00:00:39.690> right<00:00:39.840> here<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.340> see<00:00:41.520> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
batteries right here you can see that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.560 
batteries right here you can see that
and<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:43.170> would<00:00:43.980> assume<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
and I would assume this is

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.119 
and I would assume this is
microprocessor<00:00:45.570> over<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.289> it's

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
microprocessor over here and it's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.100 
microprocessor over here and it's
actually<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:48.030> very<00:00:48.180> cool<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.809> mean<00:00:48.960> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
actually very very cool I mean this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.279 
actually very very cool I mean this
thing<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:50.360> quite<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.660> technology<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
thing is quite a bit of technology to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.910 
thing is quite a bit of technology to
wear<00:00:52.440> around<00:00:52.559> your<00:00:52.829> wrist<00:00:53.480> but<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.920> could

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
wear around your wrist but I could

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.170 
wear around your wrist but I could
clearly<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.250> under<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> battery<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.059> this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
clearly see under the battery on this

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.660 
clearly see under the battery on this
one<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.809> lift<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
one I'm not going to lift it up that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.830 
one I'm not going to lift it up that
there's<00:00:59.670> corrosion<00:01:00.090> under<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.420> which<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
there's corrosion under there which is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.460 
there's corrosion under there which is
from<00:01:01.649> water<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.899> although<00:01:03.899> they<00:01:04.049> say<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> can

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
from water so although they say you can

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.469 
from water so although they say you can
wear<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.739> washing<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.159> hands<00:01:05.369> again<00:01:06.150> my

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
wear it washing your hands again my

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.070 
wear it washing your hands again my
personal<00:01:06.570> opinion<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:09.090> person<00:01:09.840> -<00:01:09.930> probably

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
personal opinion this person - probably

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.200 
personal opinion this person - probably
owned<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.439> probably<00:01:10.770> submerged<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.000> mean

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
owned this probably submerged it I mean

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120 
owned this probably submerged it I mean
underwater<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.350> some<00:01:13.500> time<00:01:13.680> maybe<00:01:13.890> what's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
underwater for some time maybe what's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.380 
underwater for some time maybe what's
swimming<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> thought<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> could<00:01:15.270> you

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
swimming with it thought you could you

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.390 
swimming with it thought you could you
know<00:01:15.509> slowly<00:01:15.810> indestructible<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> could<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
know slowly indestructible you could to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
know slowly indestructible you could to
do<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.180> actually<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.930> one

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
do that and just can actually this one

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.570 
do that and just can actually this one
even<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.409> its<00:01:19.500> present<00:01:19.830> state<00:01:19.860> I'll<00:01:20.250> plug<00:01:20.460> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
even in its present state I'll plug it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.969 
even in its present state I'll plug it
in<00:01:20.700> here

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979

this<00:01:27.720> thing's<00:01:27.990> still<00:01:28.880> well<00:01:30.200> charged<00:01:31.310> but<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
this thing's still well charged but it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
this thing's still well charged but it
just<00:01:32.579> won't<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.240> battery's<00:01:33.540> dead<00:01:33.570> shorted<00:01:34.079> so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
just won't the battery's dead shorted so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.060 
just won't the battery's dead shorted so
it<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.220> won't<00:01:35.400> won't<00:01:36.119> hold<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.479> charge<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
it just won't won't hold a charge and

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.499 
it just won't won't hold a charge and
obviously<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.430> got<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> partner<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
obviously now it's got a partner in the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.210 
obviously now it's got a partner in the
neck<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:40.049> there's<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> battery<00:01:40.860> hanging

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
neck I know there's the battery hanging

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.190 
neck I know there's the battery hanging
out<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.490> there

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
out right there

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.679 
out right there
but<00:01:43.040> she<00:01:43.369> still<00:01:43.880> light<00:01:44.060> brights<00:01:44.299> like<00:01:44.509> that

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
but she still light brights like that

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.499 
but she still light brights like that
and<00:01:44.869> it'll<00:01:44.990> actually<00:01:45.200> still<00:01:45.560> sink<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.390> lot<00:01:47.390> of

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
and it'll actually still sink a lot of

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.270 
and it'll actually still sink a lot of
people<00:01:47.689> were<00:01:47.780> complaining<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.259> bricking<00:01:48.740> which

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
people were complaining a bricking which

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.929 
people were complaining a bricking which
is<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:50.570> just<00:01:50.780> goes<00:01:50.930> dead<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.670> like<00:01:52.909> a

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
is it just goes dead and it it's like a

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.389 
is it just goes dead and it it's like a
brick<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.840> does<00:01:54.020> nothing<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.979> that's<00:01:55.189> what
