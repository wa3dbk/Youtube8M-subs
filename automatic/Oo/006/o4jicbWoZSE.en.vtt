00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.410
 Hello everyone, today we will see the exercise a 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 below so I'll show you how I got 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.820
 taught to pretend to pass under the legs 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 first I take a treat 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.660
 I take a step forward and in vitro pint 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.010
 pass slowly under my legs 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.820
 when it passes and leaves under braking e 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.480
 the referee going out at this point I do 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.560
 another step I believe the tidbit with 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.940
 the other hand and do the same thing 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.030
 let's review now I do it faster 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:46.470
 I have the treat both hands 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:48.239
 pasta pockets but at this point I remove the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.489
 first I consider it only in the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.280
 second hand so I invite you to follow 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.290
 the hand leads and the sooner or later to the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.960
 second step 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.060
 but 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.690
 very well 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.690
 again 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.660
 obviously you anticipate the movements 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.650
 why already know the exercise then 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.320
 it's very fast 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.480
 your dog will probably be a little 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.580
 slower than you should drive it in 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.310
 right direction because he wo n't know where 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.810
 go start at this point is due 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.810
 local constellate below 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.180
 the steps that are clear also increase 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.810
 unfortunately I can't do too many 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:48.070
 because it does not offer the necessary space 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:48.070
 under very good 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.100
 However 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.410
 at some point it will be possible not 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.860
 use your hands more as a target 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.620
 so simply walk and say 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.540
 raise which is the exercise then 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.519
 renounce only the voice signal 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.519
 with the below below 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.450
 she was beautiful 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.290
 no 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.290
 of course 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.330
 on the tour 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.709
 clean well means finished 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.709
 let us know how the next hello goes
