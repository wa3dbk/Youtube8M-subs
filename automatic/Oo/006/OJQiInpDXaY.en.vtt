00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
switch flipped like like completely over

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.089 
switch flipped like like completely over
the<00:00:28.260> bolts<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.769> it

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the bolts and on it

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.099 
the bolts and on it
most<00:00:29.400> people<00:00:29.670> hang<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.970> off<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> lot<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.779> do

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
most people hang it off a lot but I do

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.650 
most people hang it off a lot but I do
it<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.000> I<00:00:33.000> don't<00:00:33.210> know<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
it like this and I don't know I think it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
it like this and I don't know I think it
makes<00:00:33.809> me<00:00:33.899> kick<00:00:34.079> harder<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.590> flows<00:00:34.920> better<00:00:35.070> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
makes me kick harder and flows better so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.760 
makes me kick harder and flows better so
I've<00:00:36.000> been<00:00:36.120> doing<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.559> I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
I've been doing there like that but I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.619 
I've been doing there like that but I
just<00:00:37.920> try<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.340> pop<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.670> high<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
just try and pop as high as I can and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.500 
just try and pop as high as I can and
flick<00:00:39.899> out<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.200> hard<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.270> catch<00:00:42.270> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
flick out as hard as I can and catch it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.430 
flick out as hard as I can and catch it
and<00:00:42.800> try<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.890> roll<00:00:44.040> away<00:00:44.129> pray<00:00:44.989> for<00:00:45.989> me<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and try and roll away pray for me the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
and try and roll away pray for me the
most<00:00:46.680> most<00:00:47.250> common<00:00:47.579> problem<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.059> landing

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
most most common problem is landing

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.020 
most most common problem is landing
primo<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.200> over/under<00:00:50.039> flipping<00:00:50.370> always

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
primo or over/under flipping always

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.610 
primo or over/under flipping always
catching<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.989> too<00:00:52.079> early<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.590> dying<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.620> pop

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
catching it too early and dying so pop

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
catching it too early and dying so pop
it<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:56.449> flick<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.780> super-hard<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.420> think

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it and then flick out super-hard I think

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.970 
it and then flick out super-hard I think
that's<00:01:00.660> why<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> always<00:01:01.050> land<00:01:01.289> primo<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:01.890> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that's why I always land primo because I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.429 
that's why I always land primo because I
don't<00:01:02.670> flick<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:02.940> hard<00:01:03.149> enough<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:04.199> here

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
don't flick out hard enough so it's here

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.590 
don't flick out hard enough so it's here
and<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.100> flick<00:01:05.489> out<00:01:05.670> super-hard<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and then just flick out super-hard and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.250 
and then just flick out super-hard and
it<00:01:06.720> usually<00:01:06.990> goes<00:01:07.140> hopefully<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
it usually goes hopefully and then I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.750 
it usually goes hopefully and then I
usually<00:01:10.260> plan<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.799> or<00:01:11.070> something<00:01:11.250> but

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
usually plan like this or something but

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.780 
usually plan like this or something but
Oh<00:01:12.950> rocket<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.600> think<00:01:15.990> that's<00:01:16.110> what<00:01:16.259> I

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
Oh rocket I think that's what I

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.609 
Oh rocket I think that's what I
think<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> party<00:01:18.630> flick<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:19.320> level

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
think the party flick it the more level

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.490 
think the party flick it the more level
it'll<00:01:19.799> go<00:01:19.950> look<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.900> harder<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.320> just

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
it'll go look like the harder it just

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.109 
it'll go look like the harder it just
goes<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> don't

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
goes like that and then if you don't

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
goes like that and then if you don't
look<00:01:24.270> at<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.479> article<00:01:24.860> you're<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that might be with my foots not in the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.630 
that might be with my foots not in the
middle<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> tail<00:01:49.439> enough<00:01:49.740> could<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
middle of the tail enough could be it

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.080 
middle of the tail enough could be it
let<00:01:51.090> me<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.299> try<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> yeah<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.000> want
