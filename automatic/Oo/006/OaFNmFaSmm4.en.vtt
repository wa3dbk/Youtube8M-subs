were<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.879> put<00:02:18.319> like<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.409> pencil<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.799> were<00:02:19.860> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
were to put like a pencil if you were to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.250 
were to put like a pencil if you were to
have<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.099> circle<00:02:20.420> exactly<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.689> with<00:02:22.110> this

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
have a circle exactly this with this

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.050 
have a circle exactly this with this
segment<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.370> know<00:02:23.459> being<00:02:23.670> part<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.879> that's

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
segment you know being part of that's

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.630 
segment you know being part of that's
greater<00:02:24.569> circle<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.319> perfect<00:02:25.680> circle<00:02:26.040> it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
greater circle and perfect circle it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.390 
greater circle and perfect circle it
would<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> large<00:02:27.900> circle<00:02:28.560> diameter<00:02:29.250> this

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
would have a large circle diameter this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.710 
would have a large circle diameter this
actually<00:02:29.940> makes<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.329> very<00:02:30.900> even<00:02:31.590> radius

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
actually makes a very even radius

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.690 
actually makes a very even radius
throughout<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:34.049> section<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.890> karabiner

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
throughout this section of the karabiner

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.059 
throughout this section of the karabiner
this<00:02:35.879> bar<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.840> very<00:02:37.019> even

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
this bar so it's very even

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.319 
this bar so it's very even
that's<00:02:38.430> what<00:02:38.609> Petzl<00:02:39.090> really<00:02:40.079> tries<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.590> do

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
that's what Petzl really tries to do

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.630 
that's what Petzl really tries to do
such<00:02:42.329> as<00:02:42.569> with<00:02:43.849> their<00:02:44.849> as<00:02:45.180> tache<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:47.370> have

such as with their as tache you you have

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.910 
such as with their as tache you you have
this<00:02:47.909> very<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:49.109> very<00:02:50.000> equal<00:02:51.000> even<00:02:51.599> section<00:02:52.530> here

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
this very a very equal even section here

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.160 
this very a very equal even section here
where<00:02:53.099> it's<00:02:53.280> all<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.819> same<00:02:54.060> distance<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.810> this

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
here all are the same exact distance so

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.000 
here all are the same exact distance so
you<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.269> all<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:03.989> what<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.530> work<00:03:04.739> with

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
you have all of this what to work with

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.470 
you have all of this what to work with
in<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.519> perfect<00:03:06.000> radius<00:03:07.040> whereas<00:03:08.299> with<00:03:09.299> the

in a perfect radius whereas with the
black<00:03:09.690> diamond<00:03:10.319> not<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:11.549> much<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:12.840> really

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
black diamond not so much it really

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.119 
black diamond not so much it really
isn't<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:16.260> significant<00:03:18.530> not<00:03:19.530> really

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
isn't and is it significant not really

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.189 
isn't and is it significant not really
the<00:03:20.940> only<00:03:21.060> time<00:03:21.239> it's<00:03:21.389> significant<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:21.989> when

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
the only time it's significant is when

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.110 
the only time it's significant is when
you're<00:03:22.349> using<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.739> pulley<00:03:22.980> system<00:03:23.069> or<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.940> have

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
you're using a pulley system or you have

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.729 
you're using a pulley system or you have
two<00:03:24.540> metal<00:03:25.049> bars<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:27.209> are<00:03:27.480> going<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.349> be

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.530 

smashed<00:03:31.739> up<00:03:32.129> together<00:03:32.669> not<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.150> an<00:03:33.299> innate

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
smashed up together not like an innate

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.610 
smashed up together not like an innate
EC<00:03:33.989> but<00:03:34.530> when<00:03:34.799> they're<00:03:34.949> smashed<00:03:35.370> up<00:03:35.639> together

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
EC but when they're smashed up together

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.430 
EC but when they're smashed up together
it<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:38.220> will<00:03:38.519> tend<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.940> go<00:03:39.269> towards<00:03:39.690> because

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
it it will tend to go towards because

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.309 
it it will tend to go towards because
the<00:03:40.919> middle<00:03:41.340> will<00:03:42.030> try<00:03:42.419> to<00:03:42.449> go<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
the middle will try to go to the

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.030 
the middle will try to go to the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
furthest point in the carabiner then if

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.369 
furthest point in the carabiner then if
it's<00:03:47.730> more<00:03:47.970> towards<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.389> spine<00:03:48.660> then<00:03:49.169> it'll

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
it's more towards the spine then it'll

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.400 
it's more towards the spine then it'll
smash<00:03:49.859> one<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.549> metal<00:03:50.930> um<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.169> know<00:03:52.260> one

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
smash one of the metal um you know one

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.520 
smash one of the metal um you know one
of<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:53.250> sides<00:03:53.519> into<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.540> spine<00:03:54.959> which<00:03:55.319> is

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
of the the sides into the spine which is

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.780 
of the the sides into the spine which is
not<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:56.359> that<00:03:57.359> great<00:03:57.659> versus<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:58.919> you<00:03:59.220> have<00:03:59.459> a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
not that that great versus if you have a

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.479 
not that that great versus if you have a
true<00:04:00.690> para<00:04:01.049> beaner<00:04:01.319> shape<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> pear<00:04:02.459> shape

true para beaner shape to a pear shape

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.199 
true para beaner shape to a pear shape
then<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.810> have<00:04:04.019> because<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:04.470> have<00:04:04.650> more<00:04:05.209> even

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
then you have because you have more even

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.039 
then you have because you have more even
radius<00:04:06.859> at<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:08.069> top<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.819> work<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.750> won't

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
radius at the top to work with it won't

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.189 
radius at the top to work with it won't
tend<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.859> go<00:04:11.010> towards<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.609> spine<00:04:11.909> so<00:04:12.449> Petzl

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
tend to go towards the spine so Petzl

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.729 
tend to go towards the spine so Petzl
makes<00:04:13.859> this<00:04:14.280> no<00:04:15.090> understands<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.109> makes

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
makes this no understands this and makes

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.560 
makes this no understands this and makes
and<00:04:17.180> implements<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.329> into<00:04:18.810> there<00:04:20.510> there<00:04:21.510> are

two<00:04:21.659> most<00:04:21.840> popular<00:04:22.349> carabiners<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:23.070> William

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
two most popular carabiners the William

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.800 
two most popular carabiners the William
the<00:04:23.750> attache<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:25.550> carabiner<00:04:26.120> not<00:04:26.510> being

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
the attache this carabiner not being

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.630 
the attache this carabiner not being
taken<00:04:27.290> into<00:04:27.560> consideration<00:04:27.740> at<00:04:28.250> all<00:04:28.280> in<00:04:28.520> this

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
taken into consideration at all in this

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.120 
taken into consideration at all in this
discussion<00:04:29.150> this<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.330> kind<00:04:29.600> of<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.840> shape<00:04:30.130> so

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
discussion this is kind of the shape so

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.960 
discussion this is kind of the shape so
black<00:04:31.370> diamond<00:04:31.790> really<00:04:32.470> doesn't<00:04:33.470> do<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:34.160> um

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
black diamond really doesn't do that um

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.590 
black diamond really doesn't do that um
sure<00:04:35.660> this<00:04:36.050> little<00:04:36.350> curve<00:04:36.650> right<00:04:36.680> here<00:04:37.600> helps

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
sure this little curve right here helps

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.760 
sure this little curve right here helps
you<00:04:39.080> know<00:04:39.200> move<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:39.590> away<00:04:39.710> from<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.220> spine<00:04:40.570> but

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
you know move it away from the spine but

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.080 
you know move it away from the spine but
it'll<00:04:42.770> tend<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.220> anything<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:43.790> know<00:04:43.880> if<00:04:44.000> a

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
it'll tend to anything you know if a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.890 
it'll tend to anything you know if a
pulley<00:04:44.360> were<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.780> be<00:04:45.520> you<00:04:46.520> know<00:04:46.640> be<00:04:47.450> here<00:04:47.750> and

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
pulley were to be you know be here and

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.630 
pulley were to be you know be here and
you<00:04:47.960> want<00:04:48.170> to<00:04:48.290> hang<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:49.220> know<00:04:49.340> without

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
you want to hang you know without

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.430 
you want to hang you know without
smashing<00:04:50.510> up<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:50.660> really<00:04:50.900> wish<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.080> had<00:04:51.170> a<00:04:51.200> pulley

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
smashing up I really wish I had a pulley

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.680 
smashing up I really wish I had a pulley
but<00:04:52.040> see<00:04:52.610> how<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:52.940> kind<00:04:53.390> of<00:04:55.390> when<00:04:56.390> when

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
but see how it kind of when when

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.640 
but see how it kind of when when
dangling<00:04:57.170> it<00:04:58.010> kind<00:04:58.430> of<00:04:59.080> you<00:05:00.080> can't<00:05:00.260> really<00:05:00.320> see

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
dangling it kind of you can't really see

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.470 
dangling it kind of you can't really see
it<00:05:00.740> but<00:05:00.980> it's<00:05:01.490> more<00:05:01.760> of<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:01.940> straight<00:05:02.300> edge

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
it but it's more of a straight edge

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.680 
it but it's more of a straight edge
right<00:05:02.720> here<00:05:03.050> it's<00:05:03.320> not<00:05:03.500> really<00:05:03.800> radiused<00:05:04.690> like

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
right here it's not really radiused like

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.909 
right here it's not really radiused like
a<00:05:05.720> circle<00:05:06.200> perfectly

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.719 

so<00:05:12.669> that's<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.599> difference<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:15.550> you're

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
so that's the difference and you're

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:16.950 
so that's the difference and you're
doing<00:05:15.819> a<00:05:16.030> Munter<00:05:16.419> hitch

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
doing a Munter hitch

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.809 
doing a Munter hitch
like<00:05:17.349> if<00:05:17.740> you're<00:05:17.979> rappelling<00:05:18.340> with<00:05:18.370> a<00:05:18.490> Munter

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
like if you're rappelling with a Munter

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.709 
like if you're rappelling with a Munter
or<00:05:19.360> your<00:05:20.169> bling<00:05:20.710> somebody<00:05:21.460> you're<00:05:21.999> a<00:05:22.449> follower

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
or your bling somebody you're a follower

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.550 
or your bling somebody you're a follower
with<00:05:23.439> a<00:05:23.469> Munter<00:05:23.800> it<00:05:24.460> really<00:05:25.120> doesn't<00:05:26.050> matter

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
with a Munter it really doesn't matter

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.540 
with a Munter it really doesn't matter
you<00:05:26.949> really<00:05:27.340> don't<00:05:27.879> notice<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.569> difference

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
you really don't notice the difference

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.980 
you really don't notice the difference
but<00:05:31.020> in<00:05:32.020> terms<00:05:32.199> of<00:05:32.379> function<00:05:32.860> but<00:05:33.669> it<00:05:34.120> does

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
but in terms of function but it does

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.719 
but in terms of function but it does
you<00:05:35.259> don't<00:05:35.439> feel<00:05:35.710> it<00:05:35.889> being<00:05:36.039> smoother<00:05:36.400> but<00:05:36.639> you

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
you don't feel it being smoother but you

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.550 
you don't feel it being smoother but you
could<00:05:36.879> see<00:05:37.180> that<00:05:37.449> it<00:05:37.629> kind<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:38.110> has<00:05:38.169> a<00:05:38.289> little

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
could see that it kind of has a little

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.499 
could see that it kind of has a little
bit<00:05:38.620> more<00:05:38.680> space<00:05:39.039> to<00:05:39.219> work<00:05:39.370> with<00:05:39.430> but<00:05:40.270> really

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
bit more space to work with but really

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.989 
bit more space to work with but really
functionally<00:05:41.349> when<00:05:41.710> using<00:05:41.860> an<00:05:42.039> ATC<00:05:42.610> when

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:42.999 
functionally when using an ATC when

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.909 
functionally when using an ATC when
using<00:05:43.150> a<00:05:43.300> Munter<00:05:43.659> hitch<00:05:43.689> when<00:05:44.229> doing<00:05:44.560> anything

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
using a Munter hitch when doing anything

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.360 
using a Munter hitch when doing anything
really<00:05:45.310> in<00:05:45.930> climbing<00:05:46.930> that's<00:05:47.139> not<00:05:47.409> using<00:05:48.279> a

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
really in climbing that's not using a

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.800 
really in climbing that's not using a
pulley<00:05:48.629> ie

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
pulley ie

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.950 
pulley ie
aid<00:05:50.110> big<00:05:50.620> wall<00:05:51.180> anything<00:05:52.180> trad<00:05:52.539> or<00:05:52.779> free

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
aid big wall anything trad or free

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.929 
aid big wall anything trad or free
climbing<00:05:53.409> or<00:05:53.560> you<00:05:54.189> know<00:05:54.279> sport<00:05:54.550> climbing<00:05:54.669> it

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:54.939 
climbing or you know sport climbing it

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:59.159 
climbing or you know sport climbing it
really<00:05:55.360> doesn't<00:05:56.139> matter<00:05:56.650> so<00:05:57.389> that's<00:05:58.389> what<00:05:58.900> I

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
really doesn't matter so that's what I

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.700 
really doesn't matter so that's what I
think<00:05:59.199> of<00:05:59.650> black<00:06:00.039> diamond<00:06:00.520> versus<00:06:00.939> Petzl<00:06:01.419> when

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
think of black diamond versus Petzl when

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.779 
think of black diamond versus Petzl when
considering<00:06:02.710> buying<00:06:02.889> your<00:06:03.310> belay<00:06:03.960> carabiner

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
considering buying your belay carabiner

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.189 
considering buying your belay carabiner
in<00:06:06.789> terms<00:06:07.000> of<00:06:07.120> quality<00:06:07.479> I<00:06:07.509> think<00:06:07.839> they're<00:06:07.960> both

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
in terms of quality I think they're both

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.439 
in terms of quality I think they're both
excellent<00:06:09.069> excellent<00:06:09.610> quality<00:06:10.150> both

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
excellent excellent quality both

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.950 
excellent excellent quality both
excellent<00:06:11.020> metal<00:06:11.589> strength<00:06:12.460> I<00:06:12.819> think<00:06:13.449> are

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
excellent metal strength I think are

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.999 
excellent metal strength I think are
both<00:06:14.589> excellent<00:06:15.069> let's<00:06:15.370> see<00:06:15.490> this<00:06:15.639> is<00:06:16.560> 25<00:06:17.560> 77

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:18.009 
both excellent let's see this is 25 77

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.269 
both excellent let's see this is 25 77
that's<00:06:18.819> fine<00:06:19.300> 24<00:06:20.139> 7<00:06:20.680> 8

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:21.279 
that's fine 24 7 8

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.320 
that's fine 24 7 8
fine<00:06:21.839> the<00:06:22.839> gate<00:06:23.169> I<00:06:24.069> think<00:06:24.580> I<00:06:24.789> really<00:06:25.240> like

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
fine the gate I think I really like

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.399 
fine the gate I think I really like
black<00:06:25.539> diamond<00:06:25.900> gates<00:06:26.110> I<00:06:26.800> really<00:06:27.550> like<00:06:27.699> the

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
black diamond gates I really like the

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.779 
black diamond gates I really like the
screw<00:06:29.409> lock<00:06:29.620> I<00:06:29.949> think<00:06:30.279> they're<00:06:30.430> they're

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
screw lock I think they're they're

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.189 
screw lock I think they're they're
really<00:06:31.449> great<00:06:31.629> design

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
really great design

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.589 
really great design
I<00:06:32.259> think<00:06:33.099> pencils<00:06:33.460> are<00:06:33.610> a<00:06:33.639> really<00:06:33.879> great

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
I think pencils are a really great

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.629 
I think pencils are a really great
design<00:06:34.930> on<00:06:35.469> pencils<00:06:36.009> tend<00:06:36.279> to<00:06:36.339> be<00:06:36.430> a<00:06:36.460> little

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
design on pencils tend to be a little

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.519 
design on pencils tend to be a little
bit<00:06:36.759> squeaky<00:06:37.149> I<00:06:37.569> think<00:06:37.990> they're<00:06:38.139> the<00:06:38.319> screw

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:38.529 
bit squeaky I think they're the screw

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.920 
bit squeaky I think they're the screw
they're<00:06:38.649> a<00:06:38.680> little<00:06:38.800> bit<00:06:38.949> finer<00:06:39.189> but<00:06:39.569> with<00:06:40.569> with

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
they're a little bit finer but with with

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.670 
they're a little bit finer but with with
really<00:06:41.500> a<00:06:41.529> long<00:06:42.099> long<00:06:42.370> long<00:06:42.610> use<00:06:43.180> um<00:06:43.449> I<00:06:44.139> noticed

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
really a long long long use um I noticed

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.200 
really a long long long use um I noticed
on<00:06:44.860> other<00:06:45.009> people's<00:06:45.370> pencils<00:06:45.729> that<00:06:45.909> the<00:06:46.029> gate

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
on other people's pencils that the gate

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.899 
on other people's pencils that the gate
really<00:06:47.050> like<00:06:47.349> breaks<00:06:47.649> in<00:06:47.860> really<00:06:48.279> nice<00:06:48.490> I

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:48.909 
really like breaks in really nice I

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.240 
really like breaks in really nice I
don't<00:06:49.270> know<00:06:49.389> I<00:06:49.629> don't<00:06:49.689> know<00:06:49.979> I've<00:06:50.979> thought

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
don't know I don't know I've thought

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.589 
don't know I don't know I've thought
I've<00:06:51.310> used<00:06:51.610> a<00:06:51.669> slot<00:06:51.909> and<00:06:52.060> it's<00:06:52.149> still<00:06:52.360> kind<00:06:52.569> of

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 
I've used a slot and it's still kind of

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:54.929 
I've used a slot and it's still kind of
squeaky<00:06:52.899> but<00:06:53.080> I<00:06:53.289> think<00:06:53.649> I<00:06:54.039> don't<00:06:54.490> know<00:06:54.550> pets<00:06:54.819> is

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:54.939
