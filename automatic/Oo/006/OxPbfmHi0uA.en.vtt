00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
this one's a few bucks more than the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.540 
this one's a few bucks more than the
standard<00:02:11.540> i'll<00:02:12.319> probably<00:02:12.560> do<00:02:12.920> some<00:02:13.250> sort<00:02:13.489> of

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
standard i'll probably do some sort of

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.720 
standard i'll probably do some sort of
update<00:02:14.090> on<00:02:14.629> this<00:02:14.870> knife<00:02:15.140> I'd<00:02:16.069> like<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.459> carry

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
update on this knife I'd like to carry

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.000 
update on this knife I'd like to carry
it<00:02:16.910> but<00:02:17.030> I've<00:02:17.150> got<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.569> three<00:02:18.530> month<00:02:18.709> deal

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
it but I've got the three month deal

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.420 
it but I've got the three month deal
going<00:02:19.310> with<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> don't<00:02:20.239> know<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.950> I'll

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
going with this so I don't know but I'll

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.490 
going with this so I don't know but I'll
definitely<00:02:22.549> do<00:02:22.879> an<00:02:23.000> update<00:02:23.360> on<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:24.049> and<00:02:24.319> let

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
definitely do an update on this and let

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.400 
definitely do an update on this and let
you<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.680> what<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.610> think<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.209> if<00:02:27.170> it's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
you know what I think of it if it's

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.470 
you know what I think of it if it's
worth<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.650> extra<00:02:27.920> money<00:02:28.129> definitely<00:02:29.030> seems

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
worth the extra money definitely seems

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.320 
worth the extra money definitely seems
like<00:02:29.569> this<00:02:29.810> black<00:02:30.080> coating<00:02:30.560> might<00:02:30.739> be<00:02:31.330> making

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
like this black coating might be making

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.940 
like this black coating might be making
a<00:02:32.540> little<00:02:32.780> stiff<00:02:33.110> I'm<00:02:33.319> sure<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.560> needs<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.830> be

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
a little stiff I'm sure it needs to be

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.910 
a little stiff I'm sure it needs to be
broken<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.930> I'm<00:02:35.930> also<00:02:36.110> curious<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.650> see<00:02:36.799> if

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
broken in I'm also curious to see if

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.180 
broken in I'm also curious to see if
they've<00:02:37.069> done<00:02:37.310> any<00:02:38.260> upgrades<00:02:39.260> from<00:02:40.010> the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
they've done any upgrades from the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.979 
they've done any upgrades from the
standard<00:02:40.549> version<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:41.120> know<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.629> lot<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.870> people

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
standard version I know a lot of people

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.449 
standard version I know a lot of people
had<00:02:42.379> trouble<00:02:42.799> with<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:45.049> screws<00:02:45.459> stripping

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
had trouble with the screws stripping

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.180 
had trouble with the screws stripping
out<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.299> things<00:02:47.660> like<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.349> maybe<00:02:48.980> they

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
out and things like that so maybe they

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.880 
out and things like that so maybe they
fix<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:50.030> I'm<00:02:50.510> also<00:02:50.660> curious<00:02:50.959> on<00:02:51.349> how<00:02:51.560> this

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
fix that I'm also curious on how this

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.009 
fix that I'm also curious on how this
coating<00:02:52.280> is<00:02:52.489> going<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.700> hold<00:02:52.879> up<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.569> looks

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
coating is going to hold up it looks

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.819 
coating is going to hold up it looks
like<00:02:54.730> Teflon<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:56.629> me<00:02:56.810> which<00:02:57.079> is<00:02:57.110> your<00:02:57.379> standard

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
like Teflon to me which is your standard

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.509 
like Teflon to me which is your standard
china<00:02:59.200> coding<00:03:00.200> it's<00:03:00.379> what<00:03:00.530> cult<00:03:00.769> still<00:03:01.040> uses

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
china coding it's what cult still uses

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.440 
china coding it's what cult still uses
it's<00:03:02.329> very<00:03:02.780> weak<00:03:03.349> against<00:03:04.280> physical<00:03:05.030> damage

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
it's very weak against physical damage

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.420 
it's very weak against physical damage
you<00:03:05.660> know<00:03:05.690> it'll<00:03:06.290> scrape<00:03:06.590> off<00:03:06.859> really<00:03:07.190> really

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
you know it'll scrape off really really

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.569 
you know it'll scrape off really really
easily<00:03:07.989> but<00:03:08.989> there<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.410> an<00:03:09.620> added<00:03:10.040> benefit<00:03:10.400> to

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
easily but there is an added benefit to

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.520 
easily but there is an added benefit to
the<00:03:10.670> Teflon<00:03:11.120> which<00:03:11.840> not<00:03:12.079> a<00:03:12.109> lot<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.410> people

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
the Teflon which not a lot of people

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.640 
the Teflon which not a lot of people
mention<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.579> is<00:03:13.700> extremely

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
mention and that is it is extremely

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.710 
mention and that is it is extremely
chemical<00:03:15.650> resistant<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:17.329> know<00:03:17.389> this

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
chemical resistant and I know this

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.539 
chemical resistant and I know this
because<00:03:17.780> I've<00:03:18.170> tried<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.530> strip<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:19.310> paint

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
because I've tried to strip the paint

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.199 
because I've tried to strip the paint
off<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:20.109> cold<00:03:21.109> steel<00:03:21.440> knives<00:03:21.650> before<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.639> it's

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
off of cold steel knives before and it's

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.349 
off of cold steel knives before and it's
impossible<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.780> do<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:24.049> used<00:03:24.730> every<00:03:25.730> chemical

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
impossible to do I used every chemical

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.559 
impossible to do I used every chemical
known<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.780> man<00:03:27.609> paint<00:03:28.609> thinner<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.150> harshest

known to man paint thinner the harshest
of<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.959> harsh<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:32.389> it<00:03:32.569> doesn't

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
of the harsh and it just it doesn't

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.250 
of the harsh and it just it doesn't
affect<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.349> at<00:03:33.470> all<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:34.579> doesn't<00:03:35.329> it<00:03:35.599> doesn't

even make it bubble like it doesn't do

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.780 
even make it bubble like it doesn't do
anything<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.680> if<00:03:39.919> you're<00:03:40.069> so<00:03:40.280> many<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.579> works

is actually a very very good way for you
to<00:03:49.970> go<00:03:50.209> but<00:03:50.510> I'm<00:03:51.019> not<00:03:51.319> one<00:03:51.739> hundred<00:03:51.889> percent

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
to go but I'm not one hundred percent

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.979 
to go but I'm not one hundred percent
sure<00:03:52.370> if<00:03:52.639> that's<00:03:52.849> what<00:03:53.000> this<00:03:53.120> coating<00:03:53.419> is<00:03:53.690> I'm

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
sure if that's what this coating is I'm

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.379 
sure if that's what this coating is I'm
kind<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.230> hoping<00:03:54.530> it's<00:03:54.680> not<00:03:54.790> but<00:03:55.790> that's<00:03:56.000> you

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
kind of hoping it's not but that's you

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.409 
kind of hoping it's not but that's you
know<00:03:56.419> just<00:03:57.669> based<00:03:58.669> off<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.060> knowledge<00:03:59.389> that

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
know just based off the knowledge that

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.780 
know just based off the knowledge that
it<00:03:59.630> comes<00:03:59.780> out<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.049> China<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:01.280> look<00:04:01.519> of<00:04:01.700> it

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
it comes out of China and the look of it

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.479 
it comes out of China and the look of it
it<00:04:01.940> does<00:04:02.090> look<00:04:02.329> like<00:04:02.480> Teflon<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.319> I'll<00:04:04.069> let<00:04:04.340> you

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
it does look like Teflon so I'll let you

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.610 
it does look like Teflon so I'll let you
know<00:04:04.599> hopefully<00:04:05.599> I<00:04:05.629> can<00:04:05.780> get<00:04:06.019> some<00:04:06.200> use<00:04:06.410> out<00:04:06.560> of

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620
