00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.039
 Bordeaux people have six points 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.570
 more than the Rennes but the form 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.250
 the current two teams differ between 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.259
 Girondins did not win a single match 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.750
 in March with two defeats and 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.279
 three consecutive draws the bretons as to 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.230
 to them after flirting a time with 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.269
 the red zone remains on three wins 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.759
 immediately in all competitions 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.580
 a first this season for philippe 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.050
 Montanier and his men 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.080
 Bordeaux gets the first 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.979
 situation with that strike of Gregory 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:46.449
 sertic pushed back in a little academic way 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:49.449
 by benoît costil little rhythm in 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.369
 this first period and bordeaux can 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.100
 try to operate against the balloon 

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:56.290
 in the depth to 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.699
 guillaume hoarau who wins his face at 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.519
 face before benoît costil 1 goal to 0 for 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.049
 the Girondins second goal for 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.390
 guillaume hoarau under the colors 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.150
 Girondines a very good assist 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.510
 of the Uruguayan diego forlan in the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.140
 race of the former Parisian and the 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.710
 Girondins brings to 0 this will be the score to 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.320
 the break the Rennes too timorous too 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.500
 wait and see again 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.240
 the Bordeaux assaults in three passes the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.260
 Rennes defense has to be put to the back 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.810
 henri saivet 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.370
 it's impeccable for diego forlan the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 first goal of the striker diego forlan 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:43.330
 he who had arrived in Bordeaux in 2013 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.580
 this first goal with the Girondins 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.990
 father mother the men of francis gillot 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.140
 led to two nil but 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.510
 paradoxically bordeaux will disunite 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.570
 let go of the ballast and reindeer goes in 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.560
 enjoy with this purpose of doucouré is 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.409
 well served by jean ii makoun little bit 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.750
 more envied and self-sacrificing for 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.340
 doucouré in front of luca sort ban est 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.769
 then cedric carrasso can not realize 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.299
 feat 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.190
 galvanized by this reduction in score 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.140
 reindeer will continue to push the ball 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.300
 at the second post 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.030
 and it's Roman alessandrini who's wrong 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.770
 company to mariano to propel this 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.530
 ball in net 2 goals everywhere 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.120
 the Rennes were led two goals to 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.610
 zero they manage to come back to score 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.380
 this is the second point for the moment 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.630
 took part of Rennes after being 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.570
 led to score Gironde have a reaction 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.370
 and even touched wood with this 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.160
 corner that comes next to strike the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.510
 post of benoît costil a lot of 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.180
 success for costil but has it enormously 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.489
 of talent on that role hit and 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.040
 the Breton goalkeeper relaxes well and 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.810
 remove this bullet from the skylight and 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.170
 prevents the beautiful role anna from registering a 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.140
 double 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.060
 final score 2 goals everywhere a lot of 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.230
 regrets for the girondins big force 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.230
 reaction for Rennes
