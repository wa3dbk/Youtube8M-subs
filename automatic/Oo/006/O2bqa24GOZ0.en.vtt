00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Good day and welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.150
 follow from call of duty where we bit 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.510
 rumballern and team play deathmatch 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.790
 and have scored points but immediately 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.840
 gone it suck you can 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.370
 not that starts again 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.179
 good at 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.609
 last consequence was very many 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.470
 snipers at the moment wanted 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.789
 we have nothing to say about it 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.609
 heard soon before a shot 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.810
 unfortunately you can stay lying down 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.179
 oh it has done well is not 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.399
 he just walked in the corner or 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.910
 probably good on the left and right 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.230
 survey and shot 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.930
 that did very well no no could 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.930
 I left because but was in the way 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.930
 dung 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.610
 yes we lost control but 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.110
 everything is still cool 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:01.170
 The type of always says the points 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.339
 spokesman because there are 100 100 rounds saw 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.240
 I would have around 100 points again 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.830
 there are per round 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 I would probably say that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.030
 and there it is a bit from time to time 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.250
 No matter if you are the guide for immediately 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.250
 loses or wins, he is dead 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.030
 badly hit shit 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.030
 submerge 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.470
 Oh, that's what I can do 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.470
 I'll see her when I 'm blind 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.380
 Assist aba gets very nice and go 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:51.700
 on it of course because we have little 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:58.290
 live 65 currently still first place no 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:08.590
 next door beaten sound deaf shooter 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:12.400
 yes right from the back annoying 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.900
 so again and again annoying comic space 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.440
 but it was not a weapon 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.660
 had a gang here are three people 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.970
 who is killed with chilled who with 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.970
 So yes that is so yes least want 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.269
 have taken a hell with him 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.709
 the 100 points 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.220
 is just the advantage that you are still good 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.870
 can catch up if you look natural 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.690
 is concentrated now just because 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:49.570
 it is a bit longer now does it 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:51.480
 Once you get a chicken you can go in 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.110
 White 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.090
 now the man in red or yellow because 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.220
 we assumed paintball effect i believe 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.540
 this effect to be real something 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.100
 It's a shame that you can 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.540
 can not adjust color that you 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.630
 stop just yellow gets as a template of 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.330
 winter the lsti are an incentive 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.280
 but there is no money for you, for example 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.870
 I only spend the lake around other people 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.430
 do not stop that 's a little bit yes they are 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.390
 but actually there to show 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:31.300
 What we did not set then we did 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.480
 get our second chance and pack 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:48.790
 but not least we have this time 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:53.220
 after all, a stalker one took 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.220
 nachweint of us in the winter joined 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:03.140
 can be very good i wonder what for 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.060
 is a fast-bet of who is 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.030
 probably also be slow call of 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.549
 Duty at fast tempo full with extra 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.549
 every now and then really fast pace 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.680
 It used to be one earlier 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.330
 bit different 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.810
 In the past, the 75 points are longer 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.810
 lasted 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.270
 never are three 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:43.590
 only 21 11 and one apprentice his 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.590
 star was always 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.550
 that actually means that maybe 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.289
 that's why it's so important because he's always too 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.660
 second are the others then have to 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.080
 yes the fine ones are for the or not in 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.610
 their eyes are indeed the other donors 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.190
 masters and students are then the enemies 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.259
 therefore based more are each 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.930
 have teamed up and the sith 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:14.150
 said lords to always ne ne ne ne come 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.270
 how far together you are never all 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.560
 angry child, he could do anything 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.050
 Although you do that but you are 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.050
 none, then they fight 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:32.919
 how should I understand or have this 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.919
 this is still acting with each other 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.830
 that's a little weird no 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.110
 Clue must with george lucas mayer 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.390
 We'll meet him in a moment 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.520
 that was already close he says 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:55.610
 since then there are 100 points of it 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.420
 often always just under 25 18 years less 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.340
 died 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.960
 is one he is now often due 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.010
 the longer one rounds out the next one 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.010
 Have a nice day after three
