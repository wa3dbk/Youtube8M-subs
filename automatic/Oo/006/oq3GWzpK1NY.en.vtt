I<00:01:45.580> just<00:01:45.760> want<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.030> show<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.299> something<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:47.020> I

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
I just want to show you something that I

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.980 
I just want to show you something that I
found<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.799> could<00:01:48.189> cause<00:01:48.430> some<00:01:48.460> confusion

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
found that could cause some confusion

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.080 
found that could cause some confusion
when<00:01:49.990> you're<00:01:50.140> installing<00:01:50.409> it<00:01:50.890> it's<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.939> it's

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
when you're installing it it's a it's

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.060 
when you're installing it it's a it's
very<00:01:52.420> well<00:01:52.630> labeled<00:01:53.110> but<00:01:53.350> there<00:01:53.530> are<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.740> couple

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
very well labeled but there are a couple

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.850 
very well labeled but there are a couple
screws<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.880> hold<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.270> face<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.590> charge

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
screws that hold the face of the charge

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.010 
screws that hold the face of the charge
controller<00:01:57.189> onto<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.210> electronics<00:01:58.900> and

controller onto the electronics and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.780 
controller onto the electronics and
they're<00:01:59.650> kind<00:01:59.860> of<00:01:59.979> in<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.130> place<00:02:00.430> where<00:02:00.700> it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
they're kind of in a place where it

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.340 
they're kind of in a place where it
could<00:02:01.000> cause<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.270> little<00:02:01.540> bit<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.869> confusion

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
could cause a little bit of confusion

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.039 
could cause a little bit of confusion
now<00:02:03.220> go<00:02:03.400> power<00:02:03.640> obviously<00:02:04.330> has<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.630> labeled<00:02:04.990> to

you<00:03:29.180> just<00:03:29.360> tighten<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.690> down<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.320> same

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
you just tighten it down and the same

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.340 
you just tighten it down and the same
with<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:30.920> negative<00:03:31.600> once<00:03:32.600> we<00:03:32.750> have<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.140> in

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
with the negative once we have that in

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.020 
with the negative once we have that in
there<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:33.650> should<00:03:33.920> be<00:03:34.100> able<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.520> go<00:03:34.640> ahead<00:03:34.730> and

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
there you should be able to go ahead and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.660 
there you should be able to go ahead and
tighten<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.480> down<00:03:35.540> pretty<00:03:36.020> easy<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.670> you'll

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
tighten this down pretty easy and you'll

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.970 
tighten this down pretty easy and you'll
have<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:38.270> working<00:03:40.060> array<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.680> once<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.830> do

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
have a working array and once you do

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.950 
have a working array and once you do
that<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.520> will<00:03:43.580> be<00:03:43.820> really<00:03:44.180> simple<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.750> go<00:03:44.870> up

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
that it will be really simple to go up

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.860 
that it will be really simple to go up
on<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.200> roof<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.620> plug<00:03:45.800> these<00:03:46.040> guys<00:03:46.250> in<00:03:46.610> I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
on the roof and plug these guys in I

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.040 
on the roof and plug these guys in I
guess

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
guess

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.930 
guess
so<00:03:48.260> what<00:03:48.410> we've<00:03:48.560> got<00:03:48.590> now<00:03:48.740> is<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.460> charge

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
so what we've got now is the charge

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.080 
so what we've got now is the charge
controller<00:03:50.210> is<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:51.380> 30<00:03:51.680> amp<00:03:51.980> PWM<00:03:52.670> model<00:03:53.000> from

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
controller is the 30 amp PWM model from

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.080 
controller is the 30 amp PWM model from
go<00:03:53.330> power<00:03:53.570> it's<00:03:54.350> currently<00:03:54.800> hooked<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.490> just<00:03:55.910> a

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
go power it's currently hooked to just a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.550 
go power it's currently hooked to just a
battery<00:03:56.300> we<00:03:56.630> haven't<00:03:56.900> hooked<00:03:56.960> up<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.350> solar

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
battery we haven't hooked up the solar

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.760 
battery we haven't hooked up the solar
panel<00:03:57.950> yet<00:03:58.190> it's<00:03:59.030> inside<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.930> a<00:03:59.990> knock<00:04:00.200> out<00:04:00.410> box

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
panel yet it's inside of a knock out box

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.410 
panel yet it's inside of a knock out box
so<00:04:01.070> we<00:04:01.220> can<00:04:01.250> easily<00:04:01.580> demonstrate<00:04:02.270> its

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
so we can easily demonstrate its

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.660 
so we can easily demonstrate its
functions<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.620> let's<00:04:03.800> get<00:04:03.950> going<00:04:04.190> what<00:04:04.340> first

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
functions so let's get going what first

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.310 
functions so let's get going what first
thing<00:04:04.850> we<00:04:04.940> need<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.120> do<00:04:05.330> is<00:04:05.510> we<00:04:05.660> need<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.900> shade

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
thing we need to do is we need to shade

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.800 
thing we need to do is we need to shade
the<00:04:07.070> solar<00:04:07.370> panel<00:04:07.760> before<00:04:08.090> we<00:04:08.210> hook<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.540> up<00:04:08.660> to

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
the solar panel before we hook it up to

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.000 
the solar panel before we hook it up to
the<00:04:08.930> charge<00:04:09.170> controller<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:09.710> we're<00:04:09.830> gonna<00:04:09.950> go

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
the charge controller so we're gonna go

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.880 
the charge controller so we're gonna go
ahead<00:04:10.100> and<00:04:10.190> do<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.430> now<00:04:11.590> today<00:04:12.590> what<00:04:12.740> we're

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
ahead and do that now today what we're

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.250 
ahead and do that now today what we're
going<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.040> do<00:04:13.190> is<00:04:13.280> actually<00:04:13.460> use<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.260> solar

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
going to do is actually use the solar

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.770 
going to do is actually use the solar
kit<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.830> RV<00:04:16.100> solar<00:04:16.340> kit<00:04:16.580> box<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.270> shade<00:04:17.510> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
kit the RV solar kit box to shade the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.810 
kit the RV solar kit box to shade the
panel<00:04:18.140> you<00:04:18.680> never<00:04:19.100> want<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.430> hook<00:04:19.489> up<00:04:19.670> the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
panel you never want to hook up the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.630 
panel you never want to hook up the
panel<00:04:20.180> when<00:04:20.359> it's<00:04:20.570> under<00:04:20.980> under<00:04:21.980> load<00:04:22.220> or<00:04:22.490> has

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
panel when it's under under load or has

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.340 
panel when it's under under load or has
an<00:04:22.850> apartament<00:04:23.360> out<00:04:23.660> so<00:04:23.810> we'll<00:04:23.960> go<00:04:24.050> ahead<00:04:24.230> and

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
an apartament out so we'll go ahead and

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.680 
an apartament out so we'll go ahead and
cover<00:04:24.890> that<00:04:25.130> up

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
cover that up

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.560 
cover that up
well<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.710> will<00:04:26.860> reduce<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.400> power<00:04:27.580> down

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
well and that will reduce the power down

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.120 
well and that will reduce the power down
on<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.990> solar<00:04:29.230> panel<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:29.860> it's<00:04:29.980> not

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
on the solar panel so it's not

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.850 
on the solar panel so it's not
outputting<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.790> power<00:04:31.470> I'm<00:04:32.470> going<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.740> go

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
outputting the power I'm going to go

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.040 
outputting the power I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:32.980> and<00:04:33.220> connect<00:04:33.580> up<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:34.030> mc4<00:04:35.020> connectors

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
ahead and connect up the mc4 connectors

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.620 
ahead and connect up the mc4 connectors
for<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.680> go<00:04:35.860> power<00:04:36.070> solar<00:04:36.400> kit<00:04:36.670> so<00:04:37.300> now<00:04:37.450> we've

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
for the go power solar kit so now we've

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.840 
for the go power solar kit so now we've
currently<00:04:38.020> connected<00:04:38.560> in<00:04:38.680> our<00:04:38.830> array<00:04:39.190> all

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
currently connected in our array all

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.670 
currently connected in our array all
right<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:40.240> we're<00:04:40.450> hooked<00:04:40.690> up<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.380> charge

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
right so we're hooked up to the charge

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.100 
right so we're hooked up to the charge
controller<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.520> battery<00:04:42.910> now<00:04:43.750> go<00:04:43.990> ahead

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
controller and the battery now go ahead

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.810 
controller and the battery now go ahead
and<00:04:44.260> uncover<00:04:44.770> this<00:04:45.010> solar<00:04:45.280> panel<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:45.730> we

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
and uncover this solar panel and we

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:53.340 
and uncover this solar panel and we
should<00:04:46.030> start<00:04:46.300> producing<00:04:46.630> power<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.960> as<00:04:53.170> you

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
should start producing power and as you

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.250 
should start producing power and as you
can<00:04:53.530> see<00:04:53.880> we<00:04:54.880> didn't<00:04:55.120> have<00:04:55.240> any<00:04:55.450> change<00:04:55.840> really

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
can see we didn't have any change really

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.350 
can see we didn't have any change really
on<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.560> charge<00:04:56.800> controller<00:04:57.160> but<00:04:57.940> what<00:04:58.090> we<00:04:58.210> can

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
on the charge controller but what we can

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.300 
on the charge controller but what we can
do<00:04:58.480> is<00:04:58.660> look<00:04:58.840> at<00:04:59.020> if<00:04:59.230> we<00:04:59.440> can<00:04:59.590> find<00:04:59.890> the<00:05:00.130> amp

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
do is look at if we can find the amp

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.480 
do is look at if we can find the amp
output<00:05:00.580> so<00:05:01.180> what<00:05:01.330> we'll<00:05:01.480> do<00:05:01.570> is<00:05:01.600> push<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:02.170> and<00:05:02.890> we

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
output so what we'll do is push a and we

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.620 
output so what we'll do is push a and we
can<00:05:03.640> see<00:05:03.790> we're<00:05:03.910> at<00:05:03.970> twelve<00:05:04.240> point<00:05:04.450> seven

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
can see we're at twelve point seven

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.200 
can see we're at twelve point seven

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
it changes to just a number and you'll

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.370 
it changes to just a number and you'll
see<00:05:42.220> here<00:05:42.520> we're<00:05:42.760> in<00:05:42.790> setting<00:05:43.330> 2<00:05:43.570> which<00:05:44.110> if<00:05:44.260> you

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
see here we're in setting 2 which if you

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.890 
see here we're in setting 2 which if you
look<00:05:44.530> at<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.800> chart<00:05:45.070> is<00:05:45.220> an<00:05:45.340> AGM<00:05:45.790> setting<00:05:46.300> but

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
look at the chart is an AGM setting but

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.630 
look at the chart is an AGM setting but
I'm<00:05:47.050> using<00:05:47.260> a<00:05:47.470> flooded<00:05:47.919> battery<00:05:48.310> so<00:05:48.610> the

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
I'm using a flooded battery so the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.310 
I'm using a flooded battery so the
charging<00:05:49.180> algorithm<00:05:49.720> is<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:49.870> little<00:05:50.200> bit

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
charging algorithm is a little bit

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.110 
charging algorithm is a little bit
different<00:05:50.740> so<00:05:51.160> what<00:05:51.280> I<00:05:51.310> need<00:05:51.520> to<00:05:51.640> do<00:05:51.790> is<00:05:52.000> to

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
different so what I need to do is to

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.960 
different so what I need to do is to
push<00:05:52.360> the<00:05:52.540> B<00:05:52.720> button<00:05:53.050> until<00:05:53.440> it<00:05:53.919> transfers<00:05:54.640> to

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
push the B button until it transfers to

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.090 
push the B button until it transfers to
a<00:05:55.000> 1<00:05:55.360> which<00:05:55.690> is<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:56.050> flooded<00:05:56.500> alga<00:05:56.800> rhythm

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
a 1 which is the flooded alga rhythm

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.400 
a 1 which is the flooded alga rhythm
I'll<00:05:57.610> go<00:05:57.820> ahead<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.210> push<00:05:58.390> a<00:05:58.600> to<00:05:58.630> accept<00:05:59.290> the

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
I'll go ahead and push a to accept the

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.460 
I'll go ahead and push a to accept the
change<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:01.450> once<00:06:01.660> I<00:06:01.780> do<00:06:01.840> that<00:06:01.960> we'll<00:06:02.320> go<00:06:02.440> back

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
change and once I do that we'll go back

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.460 
change and once I do that we'll go back
to<00:06:02.830> put<00:06:03.070> to<00:06:03.880> the<00:06:04.000> amp<00:06:04.180> reading<00:06:04.630> on<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:05.020> charge

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
to put to the amp reading on the charge

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.040 
to put to the amp reading on the charge
controller<00:06:06.030> now<00:06:07.030> I've<00:06:07.150> gone<00:06:07.300> ahead<00:06:07.450> and<00:06:07.630> set

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050
