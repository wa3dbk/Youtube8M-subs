right<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.060> tre<00:00:21.240> flip<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> 360<00:00:22.410> kickflip

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
right the tre flip is a 360 kickflip

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.009 
right the tre flip is a 360 kickflip
which<00:00:23.189> means<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.550> rotates<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.240> time<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
which means it rotates one time like a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.160 
which means it rotates one time like a
normal<00:00:25.439> kickflip<00:00:25.859> while<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.730> spinning<00:00:27.170> 360

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
normal kickflip while it's spinning 360

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.080 
normal kickflip while it's spinning 360
degrees<00:00:28.500> which<00:00:28.890> altogether<00:00:29.189> gives<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
degrees which altogether gives you the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
degrees which altogether gives you the
trade<00:00:30.300> flip<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:30.750> 360<00:00:31.439> kickflip<00:00:31.890> which<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
trade flip or 360 kickflip which is the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.220 
trade flip or 360 kickflip which is the

how to ollie and how to kickflip so if

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.500 
how to ollie and how to kickflip so if
you<00:00:38.219> haven't<00:00:38.489> check<00:00:38.670> those<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.270> check

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
you haven't check those out go check

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.150 
you haven't check those out go check
them<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.320> doing<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> trade<00:00:40.920> flip

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
them out now I'm doing the trade flip

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
them out now I'm doing the trade flip
and<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> reason<00:00:41.790> I'm<00:00:41.879> mentioning<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.390> is

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
and the reason I'm mentioning this is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.510 
and the reason I'm mentioning this is
because<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.200> first<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.890> gonna<00:00:44.040> make<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
because at first I was gonna make this a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.389 
because at first I was gonna make this a
varial<00:00:45.120> flip<00:00:45.390> how-to<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.020> teach<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> 180

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
varial flip how-to and teach you the 180

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.830 
varial flip how-to and teach you the 180
kickflip<00:00:47.850> since<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> would<00:00:48.510> come<00:00:48.660> next

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
kickflip since that would come next

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720 
kickflip since that would come next
after<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.260> kickflip<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.980> figure<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
after a kickflip but I figure if you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.580 
after a kickflip but I figure if you
learn<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.270> regular<00:00:51.629> kickflip<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> learn

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
learn the regular kickflip and you learn

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.590 
learn the regular kickflip and you learn
the<00:00:52.770> trade<00:00:52.980> flip<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.610> I've<00:00:53.730> naturally<00:00:54.300> be

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the trade flip I think I've naturally be

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.420 
the trade flip I think I've naturally be
able<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.899> figure<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.530> varial<00:00:55.920> flip<00:00:56.219> so

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
able to figure out the varial flip so

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.430 
able to figure out the varial flip so
I'm<00:00:56.520> not<00:00:56.699> worried<00:00:56.910> about<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.210> 180s<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.050> finger

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
I'm not worried about the 180s so finger

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.830 
I'm not worried about the 180s so finger
placement<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.460> tre<00:00:59.850> flip<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.420> me<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
placement for the tre flip for me you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.150 
placement for the tre flip for me you
might<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.109> play<00:01:01.350> around<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.920> till<00:01:02.039> you

might have play around with it till you
find<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.550> place<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:03.000> works<00:01:03.120> best<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.750> but

about<00:01:15.509> regular<00:01:15.869> kickflip<00:01:16.350> stance<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
about regular kickflip stance like I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.679 
about regular kickflip stance like I
said<00:01:17.520> play<00:01:17.729> around<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> you'll<00:01:18.509> figure

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
said play around with it you'll figure

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.450 
said play around with it you'll figure
it<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.020> okay<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.439> once<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.920> kickflips

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it out okay so once you have kickflips

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
it out okay so once you have kickflips
dialed<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> you're<00:01:21.540> landing<00:01:21.750> them<00:01:22.080> about

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
dialed in and you're landing them about

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
dialed in and you're landing them about
70<00:01:22.860> percent<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> time<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:23.759> better<00:01:23.970> you're

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
70 percent of the time or better you're

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.270 
70 percent of the time or better you're
ready<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> tray<00:01:25.140> flip<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.920> really

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
ready for the tray flip and I really

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
ready for the tray flip and I really
really<00:01:26.460> recommend<00:01:26.790> learning<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.689> regular

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
really recommend learning the regular

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.990 
really recommend learning the regular
kickflip<00:01:28.590> before<00:01:28.979> learning<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.490> tray<00:01:29.700> flip

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
kickflip before learning the tray flip

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
kickflip before learning the tray flip
the<00:01:30.210> ollie<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> kickflip<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the ollie and the kickflip are the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.679 
the ollie and the kickflip are the
basics<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.369> everything<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.240> learn<00:01:33.450> those

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
basics to everything so learn those

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.660 
basics to everything so learn those
first<00:01:34.079> no<00:01:34.320> matter<00:01:34.439> how<00:01:34.710> frustrated<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.400> get

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
first no matter how frustrated you get

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.370 
first no matter how frustrated you get
stick<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.540> will<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.869> glad<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
stick with it you will be glad that you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.890 
stick with it you will be glad that you
did<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.920> sure<00:01:38.130> okay<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> tray<00:01:39.600> left

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
did for sure okay so to do the tray left

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.420 
did for sure okay so to do the tray left
to<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.439> doesn't<00:01:40.829> feel<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> regular

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to me it doesn't feel like a regular

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.670 
to me it doesn't feel like a regular
kickflip<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:43.049> focused<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
kickflip at all so don't be focused on a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.710 
kickflip at all so don't be focused on a
regular<00:01:44.159> kickflip<00:01:44.610> style<00:01:44.970> flip<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
regular kickflip style flip when you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.749 
regular kickflip style flip when you
tray<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.290> main<00:01:46.560> motion<00:01:46.829> you're<00:01:47.159> gonna<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
tray the main motion you're gonna do is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.020 
tray the main motion you're gonna do is
the<00:01:48.030> swoop<00:01:48.720> swoop<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:50.070> your<00:01:50.250> back<00:01:50.460> finger<00:01:50.670> or

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the swoop swoop with your back finger or

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
the swoop swoop with your back finger or
middle<00:01:51.210> finger<00:01:51.720> you're<00:01:51.930> gonna<00:01:52.049> swoop<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.710> pop

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
middle finger you're gonna swoop and pop

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.889 
middle finger you're gonna swoop and pop
at<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.220> same<00:01:53.549> time<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.240> back<00:01:54.420> finger

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
at the same time with your back finger

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.630 
at the same time with your back finger
see<00:01:55.079> how<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.320> curving<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.829> around<00:01:55.920> towards<00:01:56.460> me

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
see how I'm curving it around towards me

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.420 
see how I'm curving it around towards me
pops<00:01:56.939> whoo

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.800 

so<00:02:03.430> when<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.700> swoop<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.150> pop<00:02:04.330> with<00:02:04.510> your<00:02:04.660> back

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
so when you swoop and pop with your back

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.420 
so when you swoop and pop with your back
finger<00:02:05.200> your<00:02:05.440> front<00:02:05.740> fingers<00:02:06.130> going<00:02:06.340> to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
finger your front fingers going to

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.340 
finger your front fingers going to
naturally<00:02:06.610> bump<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.480> front<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:07.990> give<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.260> the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
naturally bump the front and give it the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.170 
naturally bump the front and give it the
flip<00:02:08.650> motion<00:02:09.130> for<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.430> to<00:02:09.520> do<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.760> kickflip

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
flip motion for it to do the kickflip

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.580 
flip motion for it to do the kickflip
part<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.810> tray<00:02:11.020> flip<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> key<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.470> the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
part of the tray flip but the key to the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.740 
part of the tray flip but the key to the
trick<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.100> really<00:02:18.340> getting<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.030> only<00:02:19.360> spin

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
trick is really getting it to only spin

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.470 
trick is really getting it to only spin
and<00:02:20.110> flip<00:02:20.140> one<00:02:20.860> time<00:02:21.190> each<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.880> catching<00:02:22.390> it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
and flip one time each and catching it

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.060 
and flip one time each and catching it
and<00:02:22.720> rolling<00:02:23.050> out<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.530> normally<00:02:23.890> happens

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
and rolling out so it normally happens

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.620 
and rolling out so it normally happens
that<00:02:24.430> I've<00:02:24.550> noticed<00:02:24.760> when<00:02:25.150> people<00:02:25.420> try<00:02:25.570> this

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
that I've noticed when people try this

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.180 
that I've noticed when people try this
for<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.080> first<00:02:26.230> time<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.680> say<00:02:26.770> just<00:02:26.980> give<00:02:27.100> it

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
for the first time and say just give it

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.770 
for the first time and say just give it
a<00:02:27.250> karate<00:02:27.580> flip<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.180> hope<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.600> comes

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
a karate flip and hope that it comes

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.210 
a karate flip and hope that it comes
around<00:02:29.050> oh<00:02:29.230> yeah<00:02:29.970> didn't<00:02:30.970> land<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.360> oh<00:02:31.480> yeah

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
around oh yeah didn't land it oh yeah

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.390 
around oh yeah didn't land it oh yeah
got<00:02:33.220> it

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
got it

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.580 
got it
try<00:02:33.700> flip<00:02:33.970> no<00:02:34.180> that's<00:02:34.420> not<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.600> tre<00:02:34.810> flip<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.320> you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
try flip no that's not a tre flip so you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.840 
try flip no that's not a tre flip so you
don't<00:02:35.740> want<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.920> do<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.580> got<00:02:36.730> to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
don't want to do that so you got to

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.950 
don't want to do that so you got to
think<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.120> lot<00:02:37.300> slower

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
think a lot slower

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.360 
think a lot slower
this<00:02:38.140> might<00:02:38.320> sound<00:02:38.530> goofy<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.100> if<00:02:39.220> you're

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
this might sound goofy but if you're

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.280 
this might sound goofy but if you're
having<00:02:39.520> trouble<00:02:39.940> doing<00:02:40.030> tre<00:02:40.330> flips<00:02:40.630> or<00:02:40.900> it's

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
having trouble doing tre flips or it's

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.230 
having trouble doing tre flips or it's
over<00:02:41.500> flipping<00:02:42.130> like<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.310> just<00:02:42.430> did<00:02:42.760> there<00:02:43.000> or

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
over flipping like I just did there or

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.580 
over flipping like I just did there or
it's<00:02:43.390> flipping<00:02:43.840> too<00:02:44.050> fast

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
it's flipping too fast

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.080 
it's flipping too fast
I'm<00:02:44.680> gonna<00:02:44.800> give<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.040> my<00:02:45.160> fresh<00:02:45.430> episode's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
I'm gonna give you my fresh episode's

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.000 
I'm gonna give you my fresh episode's
perspective<00:02:46.720> try<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.020> try<00:02:47.590> acting<00:02:47.890> like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
perspective try this try acting like

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.470 
perspective try this try acting like
you're<00:02:48.190> flipping<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.790> slow<00:02:49.210> motion

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
you're flipping it in slow motion

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.900 
you're flipping it in slow motion
literally<00:02:50.260> try<00:02:50.530> doing<00:02:50.710> the<00:02:50.860> tre<00:02:51.070> flip<00:02:51.310> as<00:02:51.550> slow

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
literally try doing the tre flip as slow

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.730 
literally try doing the tre flip as slow
as<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.150> can<00:02:52.950> roll<00:02:54.690> wall<00:02:55.690> when<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.320> do<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.470> tre

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
as you can roll wall when you do a tre

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.440 
as you can roll wall when you do a tre
flip<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.220> fingerboard<00:02:57.520> is<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.880> small<00:02:58.180> it

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
flip the fingerboard is so small it

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.480 
flip the fingerboard is so small it
wants<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.750> flip<00:02:58.960> so<00:02:59.320> fast<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.920> it's<00:03:00.130> really

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
wants to flip so fast that it's really

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.280 
wants to flip so fast that it's really
really<00:03:00.670> easy<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:01.150> over<00:03:01.630> rotate<00:03:01.780> as<00:03:02.230> you

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
really easy to over rotate as you

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.020 
really easy to over rotate as you
probably<00:03:02.590> already<00:03:02.890> know<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.430> just<00:03:03.459> slow<00:03:04.000> down

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
probably already know so just slow down

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.910 
probably already know so just slow down
to<00:03:04.450> them<00:03:04.570> as<00:03:04.660> slow<00:03:04.930> as<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.170> can<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:05.709> will

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
to them as slow as you can and that will

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.970 
to them as slow as you can and that will
probably<00:03:06.040> really<00:03:06.400> help<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.700> out<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.830> might

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
probably really help you out it might

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.380 
probably really help you out it might
look<00:03:12.220> like<00:03:12.280> when<00:03:12.610> people<00:03:12.880> are<00:03:12.970> doing<00:03:13.090> tre

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
look like when people are doing tre

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.910 
look like when people are doing tre
flips<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:13.810> they're<00:03:13.959> really<00:03:14.170> flipping<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.650> fast

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
flips if they're really flipping it fast

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.470 
flips if they're really flipping it fast
and<00:03:15.190> landing<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.670> because<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.120> flips<00:03:16.360> around

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
and landing it because it flips around

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.420 
and landing it because it flips around
so<00:03:16.840> fast<00:03:17.110> but<00:03:17.410> really<00:03:17.709> they've<00:03:17.980> learned<00:03:18.280> to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
so fast but really they've learned to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.310 
so fast but really they've learned to
slow<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:18.970> down<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.480> flip<00:03:19.780> at<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.080> right

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
slow it down and flip at that right

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.410 
slow it down and flip at that right
speed<00:03:20.770> to<00:03:21.100> make<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:21.520> around<00:03:21.760> once<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.180> land

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
speed to make it go around once and land

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.150 
speed to make it go around once and land
it<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:22.959> it's<00:03:23.230> tricky<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.650> find<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.040> right

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
it so it's tricky to find the right

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.100 
it so it's tricky to find the right
speed<00:03:24.850> but<00:03:25.090> you'll<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.420> them<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:25.750> practice

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
speed but you'll get them just practice

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.410 
speed but you'll get them just practice
them<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.380> slow<00:03:26.620> motion<00:03:26.830> like<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.190> said<00:03:30.420> you'll

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
them in slow motion like I said you'll

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.120 
them in slow motion like I said you'll
get<00:03:31.600> them<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.080> tre<00:03:32.230> flip<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.620> really<00:03:32.890> fun

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
get them but the tre flip is really fun

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.009 
get them but the tre flip is really fun
probably<00:03:33.459> my<00:03:33.670> favorite<00:03:34.000> trick<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:34.570> learn<00:03:34.810> them

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
probably my favorite trick so learn them

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.259 
probably my favorite trick so learn them
then<00:03:35.230> try<00:03:35.380> some<00:03:35.680> variations<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.640> can<00:03:36.850> trade

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
then try some variations you can trade

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.330 
then try some variations you can trade
to<00:03:37.510> manual<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.200> can<00:03:38.230> do<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.709> tre<00:03:38.920> flip<00:03:39.160> into

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
to manual you can do a tre flip into
