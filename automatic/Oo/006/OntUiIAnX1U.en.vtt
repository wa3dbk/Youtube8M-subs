path<00:03:46.680> will<00:03:47.370> help<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.730> accomplish<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.510> so

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
path will help you accomplish that so

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.930 
path will help you accomplish that so
the<00:03:49.440> ball<00:03:49.650> will<00:03:49.860> react<00:03:50.160> good<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.550> mid<00:03:50.730> part

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
the ball will react good in the mid part

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.460 
the ball will react good in the mid part
of<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.150> lane<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.480> won't<00:03:51.630> hook<00:03:51.780> too<00:03:52.020> soon<00:03:52.260> and

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
of the lane it won't hook too soon and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.860 
of the lane it won't hook too soon and
use<00:03:52.590> its<00:03:52.800> energy<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.970> doesn't<00:03:54.330> stop

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
use its energy so it doesn't stop

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.170 
use its energy so it doesn't stop
hooking<00:03:55.290> on<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.530> back<00:03:55.709> end<00:03:56.100> it'll<00:03:56.640> skid<00:03:56.970> down

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
hooking on the back end it'll skid down

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.930 
hooking on the back end it'll skid down
the<00:03:57.360> lane<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.900> yet<00:03:58.620> not<00:03:58.920> produce<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.610> violent

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
the lane and yet not produce a violent

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.310 
the lane and yet not produce a violent
reaction<00:04:00.060> from<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.660> break<00:04:00.840> point<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
reaction from the break point to the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.229 
reaction from the break point to the
pocket<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:01.860> that's<00:04:01.980> another<00:04:02.370> reason<00:04:02.640> why

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
pocket so that's another reason why

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.750 
pocket so that's another reason why
