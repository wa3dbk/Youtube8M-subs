00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
these are forms or molds they're made

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.519 
these are forms or molds they're made
out<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:13.009> latex<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.190> believe<00:00:15.109> they<00:00:16.109> come<00:00:16.320> in

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
out of latex I believe they come in

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.349 
out of latex I believe they come in
eight<00:00:17.220> foot<00:00:17.520> lengths<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:17.940> they're<00:00:18.060> hundred

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
eight foot lengths and they're hundred

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.970 
eight foot lengths and they're hundred
bucks<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.170> they're<00:00:19.320> not<00:00:19.439> cheap

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980

Maximizer 5500 and in just regular
Portland<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:10.140> about<00:01:10.470> almost<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> 50/50<00:01:11.580> ratio

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.620 

let<00:01:17.780> me<00:01:17.840> show<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.080> this<00:01:18.200> base<00:01:18.470> here<00:01:19.480> this<00:01:20.480> is

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
let me show you this base here this is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.760 
let me show you this base here this is
the<00:01:20.750> base<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.170> going<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.350> be<00:01:21.440> on<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.620> table

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
the base it's going to be on the table

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.800 
the base it's going to be on the table
at<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.040> cedar<00:01:22.340> it's<00:01:22.610> going<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.880> be<00:01:22.970> being<00:01:23.570> put

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
at a cedar it's going to be being put

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.840 
at a cedar it's going to be being put
together<00:01:23.930> here<00:01:24.260> shortly<00:01:24.590> it's<00:01:25.550> gonna<00:01:25.700> have

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
together here shortly it's gonna have

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.340 
together here shortly it's gonna have
these<00:01:25.970> rods<00:01:26.240> across<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.780> bottom<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.260> they're

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
these rods across the bottom and they're

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.650 
these rods across the bottom and they're
not<00:01:27.440> in<00:01:27.680> yet<00:01:27.890> it's<00:01:28.220> just<00:01:28.370> a<00:01:28.460> cedar<00:01:28.670> base<00:01:28.970> it's

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
not in yet it's just a cedar base it's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.510 
not in yet it's just a cedar base it's
really<00:01:29.870> not<00:01:29.990> any<00:01:30.170> need<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.650> attach<00:01:30.950> those<00:01:31.190> tops

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
really not any need to attach those tops

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.580 
really not any need to attach those tops
to<00:01:31.729> those<00:01:31.940> bases<00:01:32.360> because<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.780> top<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.260> I'd

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
to those bases because the top so I'd

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.990 
to those bases because the top so I'd
say<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.770> top<00:01:34.070> probably<00:01:34.400> weighs<00:01:34.490> 75<00:01:34.880> pounds

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
say that top probably weighs 75 pounds

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.870 
say that top probably weighs 75 pounds
and<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:35.690> there's<00:01:35.840> really<00:01:36.020> not<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.320> need<00:01:36.560> to

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
and so there's really not a need to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.380 
and so there's really not a need to
attach<00:01:37.880> them<00:01:38.060> they<00:01:38.180> can<00:01:38.330> just<00:01:38.570> set<00:01:38.780> on<00:01:39.580> and<00:01:40.580> as

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
attach them they can just set on and as

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.600 
attach them they can just set on and as
far<00:01:41.570> as<00:01:41.630> former<00:01:42.110> lease<00:01:45.190> that's<00:01:46.190> what<00:01:46.460> we're

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
far as former lease that's what we're

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.510 
far as former lease that's what we're
using<00:01:46.880> there<00:01:47.240> I've<00:01:48.050> got<00:01:48.110> forms<00:01:48.770> for<00:01:49.040> sinks<00:01:49.460> and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
using there I've got forms for sinks and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520 
using there I've got forms for sinks and
encounter<00:01:52.520> tops<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.210> I'll<00:01:54.110> show<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.320> there's

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
encounter tops and I'll show you there's
