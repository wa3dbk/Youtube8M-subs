00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.420
 my eyes have turned away from the windows 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.660
 tinted my back is recovering slightly 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.059
 and my tears redouble the sound of the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 key turning in the lock the door 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.250
 yellow that opens on this silhouette 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.560
 white 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.020
 as I would like it to be 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.779
 silhouette a ghost that passes and does not 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.210
 do not stop curled up near 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.640
 the pillow clinging to the bar of the bed 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.099
 stuck between the half painted iron table 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 in white and my misfortune I observe it 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.450
 behind the fog of the same weapon 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.350
 my eyes are fixed on the board 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.210
 that they wear is undeniable challenge 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.399
 energetic the pose on the table and me 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.219
 look at me showing the chair then 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.760
 invite me banal sentence that here becomes 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.550
 so cruel slowly to back off 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 the threat I get up and cross the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.320
 derisory m speckled tiling that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 separate me from the other end of the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.960
 prison pretended to see nothing 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.629
 on this plateau ridiculous reason of all 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.900
 these walls I look down on metris 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.360
 skinny and skinny in reality my eyes 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.210
 have all noticed the compartments 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.460
 unequal shape in shape the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.250
 pieces of meat blackened beans 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.350
 shiny greens is huge the dish of 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.229
 rice the hard-boiled egg of those who 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.650
 must call mayonnaise the bread 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.380
 stale and the disgusting dessert she 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.850
 really believe that I'm going to eat that 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.320
 I remove annassers impurities under 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.890
 the nail of my right index finger 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.840
 I'm waiting crying started no they do not 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.270
 will not have me I want him to forget me 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.460
 let them die in this straitjacket 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.439
 who ignore it and do not torture me anymore 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.200
 with his plateaus and his threats 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.540
 I do not ask anything she will not get anything 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.030
 she can talk about trying anything 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.710
 what a stupid trick like looking at 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.490
 to wait on my terrible fate 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.700
 take turns first to pity 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.950
 angry indifferent or domineering you 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.560
 would not like to be at home 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.180
 would be nice anyway you do not think 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.220
 since it is you who say why 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.349
 you do not help me escape say 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.930
 they need a diploma to ask 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.430
 similar questions 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.219
 I look at my legs while lowering the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.079
 head brought it closer to my chair so that 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.000
 my francs are above the rice collar 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.370
 that makes me want to throw up 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.030
 she started a nasty oath and 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.459
 stupid 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.859
 about the sun shining on the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.989
 little red leaves of autumn and 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.819
 of this boy who stayed four years in 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.700
 a room by lowering his head on the 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.639
 trays it is very beautiful outside you 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.829
 know the sun is hot me i'm 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.099
 sneer of the sun she wants to make me very 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.590
 wrong 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.049
 it is not worth it there is more than 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.669
 that in less trouble she widened 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.180
 head an hour to invent some 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.579
 stories 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.799
 she even tried to show me how 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.879
 take a fork is chewed 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.310
 I will have forgotten 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.900
 what am i doing i take this this 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.939
 fork to pretend to me 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.310
 to force her to say that I did 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.680
 an effort not after she will want me 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.560
 serve me we can take my hand 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.790
 get closer to me more I 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.040
 want them to know that anyway 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.439
 they can do anything 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.870
 I refuse their room tray I do not 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.840
 do not want either their pity or their 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.349
 say they will not have me why 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.720
 do they have the right to lock him up person 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.870
 do not say anything no one protests 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.400
 they do not care it soon will be 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.769
 maybe their turn if he cries too much 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.569
 often if they are still sad 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.729
 if they do not have a taste for it 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.709
 other his others who can you 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:41.489
 lock up and make you what good 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.009
 it seems to me she left me alone in front of 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.720
 my plateau she may believe that 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:48.479
 it's his presence that bothers me 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.400
 swallowing up the tears warms me up 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.220
 their bitterness and helplessness 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.579
 I would like him to walk on it crushed 7 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.379
 9 who smells bad and gives me nausea 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.530
 will never make unacceptable what 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.780
 offers on its trays of prisoners 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.579
 but what crime is committed and I 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.359
 killed someone then lost the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:12.329
 memory and I killed stolen no I did a 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.979
 choice it does not concern them this is 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.949
 not them who suffer I am 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.509
 harmless I hate them who 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.669
 say that I hurt them in me 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.370
 leaving them to die they can not 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.990
 know I will not tell them anyway 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.380
 he the same 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.270
 that's not how we like it is 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.280
 forbidden to dispose of your person to 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.030
 you do not want to miss you 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.240
 do not belong to your body is to us I 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.849
 will avenge me I will do it worse evil 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.690
 than they can ever do to me 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.900
 to avenge noah miserably locked up 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.930
 powerless 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.330
 they are the strongest they have them 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.819
 keys even if I ever go one day this 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.210
 weight gate could I the accused 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.930
 they will say the poor save her from a 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.509
 certain death 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.569
 she is still upset but soon 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.680
 she will thank us for the anger goes away 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.050
 and makes way for a terrible 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.169
 discouragement that leaves me useless 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.360
 forget the walls wobbles around me 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.550
 like his rides on which I do not 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.139
 could never mount 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.909
 what importance do I 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.470
 hated 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:21.470
 she will come back for the plateau 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.630
 even heavier loaded with my refusal and 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.830
 of my despair 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.650
 I hope he will make her fall into this 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.199
 dark hallway the rotten egg become a 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.870
 irreparable damage will remain stuck on his 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.300
 face the rice grains will go into 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.190
 her eyes and make her blind and 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.060
 when tonight I 'll have permission 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.460
 to go to the sink 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.060
 I could pass in front of her we put her 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.060
 prison she covered with this food 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.060
 disgusting
