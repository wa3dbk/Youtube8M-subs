because<00:05:06.920> some<00:05:07.920> of<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.070> wickets<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:08.490> fell

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
because some of the wickets that fell

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.370 
because some of the wickets that fell
were<00:05:08.850> very<00:05:09.030> soft<00:05:09.360> as<00:05:09.510> well<00:05:09.660> right<00:05:09.960> yeah

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
were very soft as well right yeah

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.650 
were very soft as well right yeah
definitely<00:05:10.980> as<00:05:11.580> I<00:05:11.700> said<00:05:11.940> because<00:05:12.150> we<00:05:12.420> are<00:05:12.510> not

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
definitely as I said because we are not

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.720 
definitely as I said because we are not
being<00:05:13.320> in<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.710> situation<00:05:13.890> to<00:05:14.400> lock<00:05:14.580> that's

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
being in that situation to lock that's

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.790 
being in that situation to lock that's
why<00:05:14.940> probably<00:05:15.210> some<00:05:15.840> guys<00:05:15.990> will<00:05:16.200> be<00:05:16.320> panicking

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
why probably some guys will be panicking

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.830 
why probably some guys will be panicking
in<00:05:16.920> that<00:05:17.130> situation<00:05:17.640> so<00:05:17.820> but<00:05:18.270> still<00:05:18.390> we<00:05:18.720> get

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
in that situation so but still we get

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.810 
in that situation so but still we get
through<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.110> is<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.740> most<00:05:20.190> important<00:05:20.670> thing

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
through that is the most important thing

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.910 
through that is the most important thing
and<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.270> think<00:05:21.540> all<00:05:21.750> all<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.290> guys<00:05:22.440> learn<00:05:22.740> from

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920
