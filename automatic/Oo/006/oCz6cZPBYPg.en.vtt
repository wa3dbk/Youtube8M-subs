aluminum<00:00:54.399> spar<00:00:54.789> in<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.149> it<00:00:55.420> has<00:00:56.289> a<00:00:56.859> carbon

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
aluminum spar in it it has a carbon

fiber spar back these are not hinged

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.000 
fiber spar back these are not hinged
from<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.690> bottom<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.260> lot<00:01:02.440> of<00:01:02.559> guys<00:01:02.710> thought

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
from the bottom a lot of guys thought

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.889 
from the bottom a lot of guys thought
the<00:01:03.309> control<00:01:03.820> surfaces<00:01:04.330> were<00:01:04.509> hinge<00:01:04.690> from<00:01:04.869> the

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
the control surfaces were hinge from the

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.600 
the control surfaces were hinge from the
bottom<00:01:05.259> because<00:01:05.560> they<00:01:05.950> look<00:01:06.130> like<00:01:06.250> they<00:01:06.460> are

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
bottom because they look like they are

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.150 
bottom because they look like they are
but<00:01:07.390> what<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.690> is<00:01:07.720> is<00:01:07.869> they're<00:01:08.440> not<00:01:08.649> finished

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
but what it is is they're not finished

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.130 
but what it is is they're not finished
cut<00:01:09.580> out<00:01:09.729> all<00:01:09.970> i<00:01:10.149> have<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.300> do<00:01:10.509> is<00:01:10.630> finish<00:01:10.810> cut

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
cut out all i have to do is finish cut

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.139 
cut out all i have to do is finish cut
it<00:01:11.289> out<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.770> woods<00:01:11.979> already<00:01:12.340> routed<00:01:12.550> in<00:01:12.910> there

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
it out the woods already routed in there

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.990 
it out the woods already routed in there
and<00:01:13.690> then<00:01:14.500> i'll<00:01:14.649> put<00:01:14.950> rove<00:01:15.130> our<00:01:15.310> style<00:01:15.640> inches

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
and then i'll put rove our style inches

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.639 
and then i'll put rove our style inches
in<00:01:16.149> there<00:01:16.330> so<00:01:16.509> it's<00:01:16.690> just<00:01:16.929> I<00:01:17.110> think<00:01:17.170> he<00:01:17.440> didn't

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
in there so it's just I think he didn't

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.559 
in there so it's just I think he didn't
cut<00:01:17.770> them<00:01:17.920> all<00:01:18.069> the<00:01:18.160> way<00:01:18.280> off<00:01:18.310> just<00:01:19.000> so<00:01:19.240> they

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
cut them all the way off just so they

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.389 
cut them all the way off just so they
would<00:01:20.110> be<00:01:20.259> falling<00:01:20.649> all<00:01:20.740> over<00:01:20.800> because<00:01:21.190> it<00:01:21.310> was

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
would be falling all over because it was

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.999 
would be falling all over because it was
a<00:01:21.429> prototype<00:01:21.729> we<00:01:22.390> mom's<00:01:22.660> plane<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:23.800> that's

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
a prototype we mom's plane so that's

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.499 
a prototype we mom's plane so that's
going<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.250> be<00:01:24.310> nothing<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.179> rudders

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
going to be nothing the the rudders

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.979 
going to be nothing the the rudders
already<00:01:25.840> done<00:01:26.050> and<00:01:26.410> it's<00:01:26.950> normal<00:01:27.869> can't<00:01:28.869> it<00:01:28.959> be

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:28.989
