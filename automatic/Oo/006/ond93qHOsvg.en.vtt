to be non allergenic and they give it to
hospitals<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.630> hospitals<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.770> premature

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
hospitals in hospitals to premature

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
hospitals in hospitals to premature
infants<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> Middle<00:01:48.119> East<00:01:48.270> because<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
infants in the Middle East because it's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.100 
infants in the Middle East because it's
thought<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:49.920> allergenic<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.549> also<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
thought to be not allergenic and also it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.460 
thought to be not allergenic and also it
is<00:01:52.409> very<00:01:52.860> good<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.630> certain<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.020> issues

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
is very good for certain you know issues

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.999 
is very good for certain you know issues
so<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.549> thought<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.719> really<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> need<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
so I thought that's really all I need to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.950 
so I thought that's really all I need to
know<00:01:59.070> something<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.360> went<00:02:00.509> off<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.869> my

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
know something just went off and my

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.499 
know something just went off and my
intuition<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> huge<00:02:02.820> important

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
intuition and that is a huge important

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.719 
intuition and that is a huge important
part<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.140> message<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.799> us<00:02:04.950> parents<00:02:05.369> because

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
part of a message to us parents because

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.029 
part of a message to us parents because
really<00:02:06.060> your<00:02:06.329> intuition<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.619> important

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
really your intuition is so important

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
really your intuition is so important
because<00:02:08.220> no<00:02:08.520> one<00:02:08.670> knows<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> child<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.720> we

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
because no one knows the child like we

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.610 
because no one knows the child like we
do<00:02:10.229> yeah<00:02:10.849> so<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.569> got<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.140> fire

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
do yeah so I just got a fire

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.259 
do yeah so I just got a fire
my<00:02:13.830> belly<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.310> speak<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> went<00:02:15.000> home<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
my belly so to speak and I went home and

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.970 
my belly so to speak and I went home and
I<00:02:15.330> started<00:02:15.569> researching<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.290> camel<00:02:16.799> milk

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
I started researching this camel milk

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.920 
I started researching this camel milk
thing<00:02:17.190> because<00:02:17.879> instantly<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.390> thought<00:02:18.720> eh

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
thing because instantly I thought eh

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.649 
thing because instantly I thought eh
this<00:02:19.860> might<00:02:20.159> do<00:02:20.400> something<00:02:20.879> for<00:02:21.090> my<00:02:21.269> son's

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
this might do something for my son's

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.470 
this might do something for my son's
immune<00:02:22.140> system<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.769> B<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.700> thought<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.330> could

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
immune system and B I thought it could

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.360 
immune system and B I thought it could
be<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.659> really<00:02:24.840> great<00:02:25.019> dairy<00:02:25.500> substitute<00:02:26.159> for

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
be a really great dairy substitute for

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.860 
be a really great dairy substitute for
people<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.819> cannot<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.269> regular<00:02:27.659> dairy

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
people that cannot have regular dairy

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.780 
people that cannot have regular dairy
products<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.440> there<00:02:28.920> was<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.489> couple<00:02:29.519> of

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
products and there was just a couple of

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.789 
products and there was just a couple of
weird<00:02:30.000> articles<00:02:30.420> about<00:02:30.629> making<00:02:31.049> cheese<00:02:31.319> and

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
weird articles about making cheese and

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.770 
weird articles about making cheese and
kind<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.670> odd<00:02:32.819> things<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.299> that<00:02:33.480> mostly

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
kind of odd things like that mostly

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.930 
kind of odd things like that mostly

idea how to bring it in the country then

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.379 
idea how to bring it in the country then
I<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:17.010> decided<00:03:17.489> I've<00:03:17.700> got<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:17.910> do<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.120> right

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
I just decided I've got to do this right

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.900 
I just decided I've got to do this right
so<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.810> called<00:03:19.200> Israel<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:20.040> connected<00:03:20.609> with<00:03:20.639> some

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
so I called Israel I connected with some

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.849 
so I called Israel I connected with some
scientists<00:03:21.599> um<00:03:21.720> some<00:03:21.870> camel<00:03:22.200> milk<00:03:22.380> producers

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
scientists um some camel milk producers

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.460 
scientists um some camel milk producers
learned<00:03:23.519> all<00:03:23.700> about<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:24.120> stuff<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.690> finally

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
learned all about this stuff and finally

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.409 
learned all about this stuff and finally
brought<00:03:26.130> some<00:03:26.340> into<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.639> country<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419

brought some into the country and
eventually<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.049> became<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.530> first<00:03:28.739> person<00:03:29.010> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
eventually I became the first person to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.920 
eventually I became the first person to
get<00:03:29.579> federal<00:03:30.090> government<00:03:30.450> permission<00:03:30.810> to
