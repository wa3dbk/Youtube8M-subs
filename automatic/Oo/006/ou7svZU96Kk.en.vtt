PowerPoint slide so for this demo we're
going<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.070> be<00:00:20.160> creating<00:00:20.490> something<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.850> this

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
going to be creating something like this

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.070 
going to be creating something like this
okay<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.640> get<00:00:23.789> started<00:00:24.180> here<00:00:24.960> we

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
okay so how do we get started here we

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
okay so how do we get started here we
are<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.470> PowerPoint<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> little<00:00:27.210> graph

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
are in PowerPoint we have a little graph

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.630 
are in PowerPoint we have a little graph
we<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> few<00:00:28.380> areas<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.890> could<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.189> used

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
we have a few areas that could be used

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.179 
we have a few areas that could be used
to<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.390> circled<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.529> don't<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.830> quite<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
to be circled we don't have quite the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.709 
to be circled we don't have quite the
right<00:00:32.460> elements<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.000> need<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.510> this

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
right elements we need in this

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.470 
right elements we need in this
particular<00:00:34.290> view<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:35.280> create<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.030> circle<00:00:36.390> if

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
particular view to create this circle if

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.670 
particular view to create this circle if
that<00:00:36.630> could<00:00:36.719> make<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.899> look<00:00:37.110> pretty<00:00:37.320> realistic

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
that could make it look pretty realistic

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
that could make it look pretty realistic
so<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.450> I'm<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.380 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
jump<00:00:40.530> online<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.219> we're<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:41.969> create

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
jump online and we're going to create

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.090 
jump online and we're going to create
the<00:00:42.570> circle<00:00:43.079> that's<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> circle<00:00:43.950> those

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the circle that's going to circle those

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.190 
the circle that's going to circle those
values<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:45.180> I'm<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> pixlr.com

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.510 
this to a hundred pixel with a hundred
pixel<00:01:09.780> height<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.290> make<00:01:10.799> sure<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.400> have

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
pixel height and make sure that we have

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
pixel height and make sure that we have
transparent<00:01:12.299> selected<00:01:12.869> I'll<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.619> ahead<00:01:13.680> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
transparent selected I'll go ahead and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
and that's going to give me a little box

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.929 
and that's going to give me a little box
and<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> hundred<00:01:17.759> pixels

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and it's going to be the hundred pixels

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.179 
and it's going to be the hundred pixels
one<00:01:18.180> hundred<00:01:18.420> pixels<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> need<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> do

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
one hundred pixels and what I need to do

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.280 
one hundred pixels and what I need to do
is<00:01:20.340> draw<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> little<00:01:20.670> circle<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.659> this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
is draw a little circle in here and this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.660 
is draw a little circle in here and this
little<00:01:22.439> grid<00:01:22.770> background<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.369> lets<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
little grid background just lets you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.980 
little grid background just lets you
know<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:23.970> transparent<00:01:24.479> there's<00:01:24.810> another

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
know it's transparent there's another

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.770 
know it's transparent there's another
other<00:01:25.259> no<00:01:25.560> other<00:01:25.770> pixels<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> grab

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
other no other pixels in there so I grab

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.620 
other no other pixels in there so I grab
on<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.200> brush<00:01:28.500> tool<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.090> adjust<00:01:30.570> my

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
on my brush tool and I can adjust my

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.539 
on my brush tool and I can adjust my
brush<00:01:31.049> size<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> take<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.100> down<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
brush size I'm going to take it down to

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
brush size I'm going to take it down to
about<00:01:32.670> 20<00:01:33.299> let's<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:33.659> how<00:01:33.750> big<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
about 20 let's see how big that is

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.390 
about 20 let's see how big that is
that's<00:01:34.530> gonna<00:01:34.770> work<00:01:34.979> great

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that's gonna work great

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
you're going to have multiple circles

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.599 
you're going to have multiple circles
you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.439> go<00:02:55.560> ahead<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.919> insert<00:02:56.280> those

you can go ahead and insert those

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.069 
you can go ahead and insert those
different<00:02:57.030> circle<00:02:57.359> pictures<00:02:57.719> again

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
different circle pictures again

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.899 
different circle pictures again
just<00:02:58.379> do<00:02:58.469> the<00:02:58.590> same<00:02:58.769> thing<00:02:58.829> insert<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.639> few

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
just do the same thing insert a few

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.879 
just do the same thing insert a few
times<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.840> need<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.139> size<00:03:01.379> one<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.769> those

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
times if you need to size one of those

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.979 
times if you need to size one of those
pictures<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.969> can<00:03:03.150> do<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.450> as<00:03:03.569> well<00:03:03.599> so<00:03:03.750> that

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
pictures you can do that as well so that

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.390 
pictures you can do that as well so that
circle<00:03:04.439> doesn't<00:03:04.709> always<00:03:04.829> have<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.129> be<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
circle doesn't always have to be the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.580 
circle doesn't always have to be the
same<00:03:05.669> exact<00:03:06.150> size<00:03:06.329> so<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.019> can<00:03:07.169> make<00:03:07.290> this<00:03:07.409> one<00:03:07.530> a

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
same exact size so I can make this one a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.459 
same exact size so I can make this one a
little<00:03:07.739> bigger<00:03:08.040> if<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.370> like<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.870> I'll<00:03:10.019> do<00:03:10.200> one

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
little bigger if I like and I'll do one

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.039 
little bigger if I like and I'll do one
more<00:03:10.709> here<00:03:11.040> insert<00:03:11.579> this<00:03:11.819> circle<00:03:12.359> once<00:03:12.569> again

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
more here insert this circle once again

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.309 
more here insert this circle once again
and<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:14.370> can<00:03:14.549> make<00:03:14.639> it<00:03:14.790> even<00:03:15.000> smaller<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:16.079> need

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
and it can make it even smaller you need

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.170 
and it can make it even smaller you need
so<00:03:17.099> what<00:03:17.220> we're<00:03:17.310> going<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.459> do<00:03:17.639> now<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.000> we're

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
so what we're going to do now is we're

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.490 
so what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.329> animate<00:03:18.599> these<00:03:18.870> ends<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.260> make<00:03:19.379> it

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
going to animate these ends to make it

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.770 
going to animate these ends to make it
look<00:03:19.650> like<00:03:19.919> it's<00:03:20.190> being<00:03:20.459> circled<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.540> what<00:03:21.690> I'm

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780

was four little areas that try to make
that<00:03:46.799> circle<00:03:47.040> didn't<00:03:47.430> look<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.699> was

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
that circle didn't look like it was

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.969 
that circle didn't look like it was
being<00:03:48.060> drawn<00:03:48.329> on<00:03:48.569> if<00:03:49.199> you<00:03:49.290> look<00:03:49.470> over<00:03:49.709> here<00:03:49.889> in

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
animations and it's going to add that

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.070 
animations and it's going to add that
one<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.120> you'll<00:04:38.270> see<00:04:38.450> there's<00:04:38.630> this<00:04:38.750> list

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
one so you'll see there's this list

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.260 
one so you'll see there's this list
that's<00:04:39.230> developing<00:04:39.800> you'll<00:04:40.250> see<00:04:40.430> a<00:04:40.460> number<00:04:40.730> to

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
that's developing you'll see a number to

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.850 
that's developing you'll see a number to
the<00:04:41.390> left<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.780> each<00:04:41.900> of<00:04:42.080> these<00:04:42.170> images<00:04:42.680> that

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
the left of each of these images that

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.890 
the left of each of these images that
lets<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.460> know<00:04:43.670> that<00:04:43.700> that's<00:04:44.420> the<00:04:44.690> next

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
lets you know that that's the next

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.750 
lets you know that that's the next
animation<00:04:45.530> since<00:04:45.770> that's<00:04:46.130> going<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.550> happen

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
animation since that's going to happen

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.750 
animation since that's going to happen
so<00:04:47.450> again<00:04:47.720> I'll<00:04:47.870> turn<00:04:48.020> my<00:04:48.290> spoke<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.770> one<00:04:48.980> gives

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
so again I'll turn my spoke to one gives

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.340 
so again I'll turn my spoke to one gives
you<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.000> kind<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.390> emulation<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.080> what<00:04:51.260> it

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
you the kind of emulation of what it

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.900 
you the kind of emulation of what it
will<00:04:51.440> look<00:04:51.590> like<00:04:51.650> in<00:04:52.010> presentation<00:04:52.730> and

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
will look like in presentation and

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.540 
will look like in presentation and
basically<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:54.080> repeat<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:54.680> for<00:04:54.920> each<00:04:55.310> of

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
basically you repeat that for each of

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.790 
basically you repeat that for each of
the<00:04:55.640> areas<00:04:55.850> in<00:04:56.330> your<00:04:56.960> presentation<00:04:57.650> that

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
the areas in your presentation that

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.730 
the areas in your presentation that
you'd<00:04:58.160> like<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.520> create<00:04:58.700> that<00:04:58.970> circle<00:04:59.420> effect

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
you'd like to create that circle effect

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.090 
you'd like to create that circle effect
finish<00:05:00.740> it<00:05:00.890> out<00:05:01.010> with<00:05:01.070> this<00:05:01.460> guy<00:05:01.700> here<00:05:02.800> turn<00:05:03.800> on

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
finish it out with this guy here turn on

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.240 
finish it out with this guy here turn on
the<00:05:04.430> spoke<00:05:04.760> to<00:05:05.000> one<00:05:05.240> now<00:05:05.870> right<00:05:05.900> now<00:05:06.500> if<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:06.980> went

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
the spoke to one now right now if I went

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.420 
the spoke to one now right now if I went
ahead<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:07.790> played<00:05:08.060> this<00:05:08.270> in<00:05:08.600> my<00:05:09.430> preview

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
ahead and played this in my preview

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.760 
ahead and played this in my preview
window<00:05:10.730> it's<00:05:11.360> gonna<00:05:11.600> circle<00:05:12.200> it<00:05:12.290> every<00:05:12.530> time<00:05:12.740> I

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
window it's gonna circle it every time I

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.040 
window it's gonna circle it every time I
hit<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.190> my<00:05:13.310> next<00:05:13.550> frame<00:05:13.880> it's<00:05:14.630> going<00:05:14.810> to<00:05:14.900> give

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
hit to my next frame it's going to give

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.380 
hit to my next frame it's going to give
you<00:05:15.140> that<00:05:15.290> emulation<00:05:15.800> of<00:05:16.160> it<00:05:16.610> circling<00:05:17.210> a

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
you that emulation of it circling a

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.010 
you that emulation of it circling a
particular<00:05:17.990> element<00:05:18.200> within<00:05:19.070> your<00:05:19.610> graph<00:05:20.180> so

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
particular element within your graph so

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.530 
particular element within your graph so
there's<00:05:21.980> any<00:05:22.160> other<00:05:22.310> questions<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:23.150> can<00:05:23.330> put

otherwise that's how you can create a

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.430 
otherwise that's how you can create a
circle<00:05:27.830> effect<00:05:28.100> using<00:05:28.840> PowerPoint<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.140> the
