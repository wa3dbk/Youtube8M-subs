00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
renamed the extreme mining mod because

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.250 
renamed the extreme mining mod because
it<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.700> sounds<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> whole<00:00:39.390> lot<00:00:39.450> more<00:00:39.750> exciting

beautiful or is just pretty much one of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.940 
beautiful or is just pretty much one of
these<00:01:25.860> clumps<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.640> every<00:01:26.850> single<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.420> in

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
these clumps for every single or in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.060 
these clumps for every single or in
minecraft<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.250> at<00:01:29.579> least<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.880> vanilla<00:01:30.150> um

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070

minecraft or at least in vanilla um
anyway<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.640> stops<00:01:32.939> lagging<00:01:34.009> basically

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
anyway if it stops lagging basically

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.980 
anyway if it stops lagging basically
what<00:01:35.189> these<00:01:35.369> clumps<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.090> ores<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
what these clumps of ores do is that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.010 
what these clumps of ores do is that
they<00:01:37.020> sort<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.710> replace<00:01:38.549> these<00:01:38.850> old<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.540> block

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
they sort of replace these old or block

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.950 
they sort of replace these old or block
so<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.549> stops<00:01:41.850> lagging<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
so if it stops lagging there that is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.889 
so if it stops lagging there that is
that<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.670> guilty<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.909> are<00:01:44.939> guilty<00:01:45.420> your

anyway I look at all these beautiful
oars<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> basically<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:10.160> amazing<00:02:11.160> part

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
oars and basically the amazing part

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820 
oars and basically the amazing part
about<00:02:11.760> these<00:02:12.270> clumps<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.080> locks<00:02:13.320> are<00:02:13.590> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
about these clumps of locks are that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.170 
about these clumps of locks are that
they<00:02:14.430> spawn<00:02:14.940> naturally<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:16.020> only<00:02:16.170> spawn<00:02:16.590> in

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
they spawn naturally they only spawn in

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.670 
they spawn naturally they only spawn in
naturally<00:02:18.180> generated<00:02:18.390> cave<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.470> when<00:02:19.620> you

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
naturally generated cave so when you

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.980 
naturally generated cave so when you
spawn<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.100> new<00:02:20.280> world<00:02:20.550> or<00:02:20.910> load<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.630> new

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
spawn in a new world or load up a new

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.830 
spawn in a new world or load up a new
area<00:02:22.460> only<00:02:23.460> then<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:23.850> these<00:02:24.030> guys<00:02:24.060> spawn<00:02:24.600> so

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
area only then can these guys spawn so

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.260 
area only then can these guys spawn so
you<00:02:24.930> can't<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.170> dig<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> tunnel<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.640> end

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
you can't just dig a tunnel to the end

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.290 
you can't just dig a tunnel to the end
and<00:02:27.709> defeat<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.070> Ender<00:02:29.340> Dragon<00:02:29.370> or<00:02:30.030> sleep

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
and defeat the Ender Dragon or sleep

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.760 
and defeat the Ender Dragon or sleep
with<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.600> whatever<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.050> decide<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.350> do<00:02:31.620> with

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
with it whatever you decide to do with

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.540 
with it whatever you decide to do with
it<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.910> come<00:02:33.180> back<00:02:33.390> expecting<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:35.280> find

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
it and just come back expecting to find

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.840 
it and just come back expecting to find
these<00:02:35.790> contours<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.750> tunnel<00:02:37.050> value<00:02:37.320> Doug

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
these contours in the tunnel value Doug

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.310 
these contours in the tunnel value Doug
so<00:02:38.850> that's<00:02:39.060> kind<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.390> nice<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> reason

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
so that's kind of nice and the reason

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.600 
so that's kind of nice and the reason
why<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.040> whole<00:02:41.250> thing<00:02:41.459> is

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
why this is this whole thing is

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.090 
why this is this whole thing is
implemented<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.420> because<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.500> sort<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
implemented is because it's sort of to

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.310 
implemented is because it's sort of to
discourage<00:02:44.760> strip<00:02:45.209> mining<00:02:45.510> because<00:02:46.050> strip

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
discourage strip mining because strip

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.620 
discourage strip mining because strip
mining<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.770> kind<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.550> boring<00:02:47.820> but<00:02:48.270> it's<00:02:48.420> more

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
mining is kind of boring but it's more

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.440 
mining is kind of boring but it's more
effective<00:02:48.959> than<00:02:49.320> cave<00:02:49.590> exploring<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.450> it's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
effective than cave exploring and it's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.240 
effective than cave exploring and it's
also<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.780> lot<00:02:52.020> safer<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.800> also<00:02:52.920> kind<00:02:53.190> of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
also a lot safer but it also kind of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.790 
also a lot safer but it also kind of
made<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.580> lot<00:02:53.940> more<00:02:54.239> boring<00:02:54.989> for<00:02:55.410> resource

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
made it a lot more boring for resource

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800 
made it a lot more boring for resource
gathering<00:02:56.070> in<00:02:56.370> Minecraft<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.480> basically

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
gathering in Minecraft and basically

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.060 
gathering in Minecraft and basically
what<00:02:58.020> this<00:02:58.170> does<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.620> sort<00:02:59.040> of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
what this does is it sort of

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.100 
what this does is it sort of
revolutionizes<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.630> whole<00:03:00.750> thing<00:03:00.989> that

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
revolutionizes the whole thing that

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.949 
revolutionizes the whole thing that
makes<00:03:01.320> cave<00:03:01.560> exploring<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.070> lot<00:03:02.220> funner<00:03:02.640> and

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
makes cave exploring a lot funner and

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.300 
makes cave exploring a lot funner and
resource<00:03:03.959> gathering<00:03:04.170> in<00:03:04.500> Minecraft<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.130> lot

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
resource gathering in Minecraft a lot

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.060 
resource gathering in Minecraft a lot
more<00:03:05.610> exciting<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:07.260> can<00:03:07.380> also<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.980> know

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
more exciting and you can also you know

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.430 
more exciting and you can also you know
run<00:03:08.310> across<00:03:08.610> these<00:03:08.900> beautiful<00:03:09.900> over<00:03:10.170> blogs

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
run across these beautiful over blogs

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.140 
run across these beautiful over blogs
you<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.620> rub<00:03:10.890> your<00:03:11.040> butt<00:03:11.280> against<00:03:11.670> redstone

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
you can rub your butt against redstone

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.330 
you can rub your butt against redstone
and<00:03:12.360> make<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.170> emit<00:03:13.470> particles<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.130> MIT

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
and make it emit particles and MIT

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.720 
and make it emit particles and MIT
particles<00:03:15.170> ok<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.200> guess<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.709> guess<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.280> doesn't

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
particles ok I guess I guess it doesn't

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.050 
particles ok I guess I guess it doesn't
feel<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.090> same<00:03:18.209> way<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.720> me<00:03:19.110> but<00:03:19.620> uh<00:03:20.060> yeah

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
feel the same way about me but uh yeah

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.300 
feel the same way about me but uh yeah
and<00:03:21.420> that's<00:03:22.230> that's<00:03:22.440> gold<00:03:22.769> by<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.010> way<00:03:23.190> in

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
and that's that's gold by the way in

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.670 
and that's that's gold by the way in
case<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.610> can't<00:03:23.820> tell<00:03:23.910> um<00:03:24.360> most<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.650> is

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
case you can't tell um most of it is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.229 
case you can't tell um most of it is
pretty<00:03:25.980> obvious<00:03:26.130> but<00:03:26.640> gold's<00:03:26.970> kind<00:03:27.150> of

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
pretty obvious but gold's kind of

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.000 
pretty obvious but gold's kind of
difficult<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.930> tell<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:28.680> you're<00:03:28.830> still

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
difficult to tell but you're still

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.250 
difficult to tell but you're still
beautiful<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:30.269> know<00:03:30.360> one<00:03:30.540> can<00:03:30.690> fetch<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> high

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
beautiful you know one can fetch a high

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.680 
beautiful you know one can fetch a high
price<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.860> it's<00:03:32.070> like<00:03:32.130> them<00:03:32.430> golden<00:03:33.360> poop

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
price it's it's like them golden poop

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.090 
price it's it's like them golden poop
it's<00:03:33.959> like<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.320> best<00:03:34.680> quality<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.370> fancy

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
it's like the best quality it's fancy

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.280 
it's like the best quality it's fancy
anyway<00:03:38.100> but<00:03:39.090> yeah<00:03:39.299> that's<00:03:39.360> pretty<00:03:39.900> much<00:03:40.080> all

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
anyway but yeah that's pretty much all

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.479 
anyway but yeah that's pretty much all
of<00:03:40.440> these<00:03:40.590> ores<00:03:40.950> um<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:42.150> course<00:03:42.450> these<00:03:42.630> make

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
of these ores um of course these make

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.910 
of these ores um of course these make
that's<00:03:44.489> my<00:03:44.670> alarm<00:03:44.970> thing<00:03:45.209> these<00:03:45.720> makes<00:03:46.080> normal

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
that's my alarm thing these makes normal

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.600 
that's my alarm thing these makes normal
or<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.880> lot<00:03:48.239> rarer<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.380> it's<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:50.010> can't<00:03:50.250> find

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
or is a lot rarer so it's you can't find

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.090 
or is a lot rarer so it's you can't find
like<00:03:50.940> clumps<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.420> iron<00:03:51.600> littered<00:03:52.500> over<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
like clumps of iron littered over the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.830 
like clumps of iron littered over the
surface<00:03:53.459> caves<00:03:53.730> because<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.360> find<00:03:54.660> these

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
surface caves because you can find these

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.789
