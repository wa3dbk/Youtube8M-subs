than<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.640> normally<00:00:44.910> would

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
than I normally would

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
than I normally would
I<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:46.140> change<00:00:46.410> anything<00:00:46.710> about<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.250> all

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I don't change anything about that all

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.709 
I don't change anything about that all
but<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.690> seven<00:00:48.989> days<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.620> drank<00:00:50.190> five<00:00:50.820> cups<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
but for seven days I drank five cups of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.090 
but for seven days I drank five cups of
green<00:00:52.530> tea<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.280> day<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.199> also<00:00:55.199> may<00:00:55.379> try<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> five

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
green tea a day and also may try a five

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.389 
green tea a day and also may try a five
full<00:00:56.610> glasses<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.180> water<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.660> day<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.280> was

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
full glasses of water a day so it was

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.490 
full glasses of water a day so it was
quite<00:00:59.609> easy<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.059> remember<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:00.989> five<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
quite easy to remember to do five and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.160 
quite easy to remember to do five and
five<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:05.420> obviously<00:01:06.420> went<00:01:06.570> dramatic

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
five and and obviously went dramatic

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.109 
five and and obviously went dramatic
results<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.890> wasn't<00:01:08.040> doing<00:01:09.000> anything

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
results because I wasn't doing anything

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.570 
results because I wasn't doing anything
really<00:01:09.570> different<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.470> diet<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:11.130> my

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
really different with my diet or my

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640 
really different with my diet or my
exercise<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.140> didn't<00:01:13.350> weight<00:01:13.470> myself

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
exercise and I didn't weight myself

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.230 
exercise and I didn't weight myself
before<00:01:14.010> or<00:01:14.310> after<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:14.760> anything<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
before or after or anything like that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
before or after or anything like that
because<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.020> wasn't<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.920> an<00:01:17.189> attempt<00:01:17.729> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
because it wasn't really an attempt to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.890 
because it wasn't really an attempt to
lose<00:01:18.150> weight<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.790> sort<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.909> preparing<00:01:21.689> my

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
lose weight it was sort of preparing my

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.370 
lose weight it was sort of preparing my
system<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.580> big<00:01:24.270> health<00:01:24.600> kick<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.200> I'm

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
system for this big health kick that I'm

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.370 
system for this big health kick that I'm
on<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:27.500> broke<00:01:28.500> out<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.640> bad<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.380> literally

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
on and I broke out so bad that literally

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.510 
on and I broke out so bad that literally
can<00:01:31.650> probably<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.689> few<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.930> remaining

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
can probably see a few of the remaining

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.510 
can probably see a few of the remaining
spots<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:37.290> weeks<00:01:37.530> later<00:01:37.950> basically

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
spots this is two weeks later basically

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.319 
spots this is two weeks later basically
and<00:01:38.930> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.159> green<00:01:41.549> tea<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> water

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and I think the green tea and the water

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.719 
and I think the green tea and the water
combination<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.619> broke<00:01:44.159> me<00:01:44.369> out<00:01:44.399> completely

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
combination just broke me out completely

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149 
combination just broke me out completely
all<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.899> impurities<00:01:46.140> seem<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.950> come

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
all the impurities seem to just come

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.719 
all the impurities seem to just come
straight<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.820> skin<00:01:48.180> surface<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.549> just

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
straight the skin surface and I was just

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.499 
straight the skin surface and I was just
a<00:01:51.000> big<00:01:51.240> walking<00:01:51.479> pimple<00:01:52.020> basically<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.509> but

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
a big walking pimple basically and but

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.350 
a big walking pimple basically and but
yeah<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.140> definitely<00:01:56.329> kick-started<00:01:57.329> my

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
yeah it definitely kick-started my

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.590 
yeah it definitely kick-started my
health<00:01:58.170> regime<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:59.310> would<00:01:59.939> recommend<00:02:00.390> it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
health regime I would recommend it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.060
