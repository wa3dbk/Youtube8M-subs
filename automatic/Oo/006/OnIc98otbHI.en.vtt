piece the lid over thought before the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.789 
piece the lid over thought before the
beans<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.280> let<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.659> water<00:01:07.049> boil<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
beans are in to let the water boil at a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.050 
beans are in to let the water boil at a
full<00:01:08.040> rapid<00:01:08.490> pace<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:10.460> why<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.729> being<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
full rapid pace and why are we being the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:22.310 
full rapid pace and why are we being the
beans<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.509> table<00:01:20.329> so<00:01:21.329> that's<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
beans on the table so that's a so this

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.120 
beans on the table so that's a so this
is<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.469> good<00:01:22.679> way<00:01:22.859> to<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:24.679> sip<00:01:25.679> through<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
is a good way to just sip through the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.899 
is a good way to just sip through the
beans<00:01:26.399> and<00:01:26.880> make<00:01:27.060> sure<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.390> don't<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.840> any

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
beans and make sure you don't get any

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.649 
beans and make sure you don't get any
rock<00:01:30.079> and<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.259> need<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.979> wash<00:01:32.219> the<00:01:32.490> beam<00:01:32.670> okay

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
rock and you need to wash the beam okay

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.069 
rock and you need to wash the beam okay
this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.109> a<00:01:34.140> large<00:01:34.590> amount<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.159> bleeding<00:01:39.079> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
this is a large amount of bleeding so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.989 
this is a large amount of bleeding so
what<00:01:40.229> she's<00:01:40.409> doing<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.829> sifting<00:01:41.759> through

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
what she's doing is just sifting through

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.609 
what she's doing is just sifting through
the<00:01:42.030> beans<00:01:42.359> and<00:01:42.569> making<00:01:43.079> sure<00:01:43.259> there's<00:01:43.499> no

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the beans and making sure there's no

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.889 
the beans and making sure there's no
rocks<00:01:44.630> look<00:01:45.630> she<00:01:45.810> found<00:01:46.020> another<00:01:46.079> rocks<00:01:46.469> and

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
rocks look she found another rocks and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:59.180 
rocks look she found another rocks and
she's<00:01:48.899> putting<00:01:49.200> them<00:01:49.319> into<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.969> strainer

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:15.440 

I<00:02:05.960> mean<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.050> just<00:02:07.080> smells<00:02:07.440> so<00:02:07.590> good<00:02:14.240> you<00:02:15.240> want

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
all of our six cups in here no beans

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.860 
all of our six cups in here no beans
left<00:02:17.490> behind<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.470> are<00:02:19.740> going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.250> let<00:02:20.520> this

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
left behind so we are going to let this

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.250 
left behind so we are going to let this
come<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> boil<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.980> then<00:02:23.360> we'll<00:02:24.360> reduce<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
come to a boil and then we'll reduce the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.590 
come to a boil and then we'll reduce the
heat<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:25.740> now<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.370> high<00:02:26.760> will<00:02:27.330> let<00:02:27.480> it

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
heat right now it's on high will let it

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.290 
heat right now it's on high will let it
come<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.990> boil<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.590> reduce<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.790> simmer

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
come to a boil and reduce it to simmer

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.600 
come to a boil and reduce it to simmer
okay<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.320> now<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.280> beans<00:02:32.430> are<00:02:32.580> boiling

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
okay so now that the beans are boiling

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.220 
okay so now that the beans are boiling
that's<00:02:33.390> way<00:02:33.600> too<00:02:33.660> hot<00:02:35.180> how<00:02:36.180> much<00:02:36.390> longer<00:02:36.540> do<00:02:37.170> we

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
that's way too hot how much longer do we

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.430 
that's way too hot how much longer do we
let<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.590> go<00:02:38.330> Mike<00:02:39.330> an<00:02:39.480> hour<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> half<00:02:40.110> so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
let it go Mike an hour and a half so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.250 
let it go Mike an hour and a half so
total<00:02:41.040> how<00:02:41.280> long<00:02:41.520> are<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> beans<00:02:42.030> cooking<00:02:42.330> for

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
total how long are the beans cooking for

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.620 
total how long are the beans cooking for
hours<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.310> beans<00:02:44.520> will<00:02:44.760> cook<00:02:44.970> about<00:02:45.180> four<00:02:45.510> to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
hours the beans will cook about four to

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.280 
hours the beans will cook about four to
five<00:02:45.660> hours<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.610> too<00:02:47.970> high<00:02:48.390> for<00:02:48.870> an<00:02:48.990> all

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
five hours this is too high for an all

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.570 
five hours this is too high for an all
day<00:02:49.800> cooking<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:51.000> while<00:02:51.240> lower<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.990> too<00:02:52.980> low<00:02:53.280> so

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
day cooking so while lower it too low so

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.460 
day cooking so while lower it too low so
that<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:53.880> more<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.300> simmer<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.230> lid

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
that it's more of a simmer with the lid

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.980 
that it's more of a simmer with the lid
on<00:02:56.030> we're<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.270> recover<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.870> beans<00:02:58.200> now
