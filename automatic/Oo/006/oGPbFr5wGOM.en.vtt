00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
alright Rebecca so today we're going to

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.209 
alright Rebecca so today we're going to
move<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.360> breaststroke<00:00:09.960> okay<00:00:10.590> stroke

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
move on to breaststroke okay stroke

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.940 
move on to breaststroke okay stroke
you're<00:00:11.370> pretty<00:00:11.610> familiar<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:12.950> breaststroke

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
you're pretty familiar with breaststroke

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.279 
you're pretty familiar with breaststroke
did<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.340> know<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.269> only<00:00:15.420> real<00:00:15.809> short

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
did you know is is the only real short

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.900 
did you know is is the only real short
access<00:00:16.680> stroke<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.490> where<00:00:17.730> we're

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
access stroke it's the one where we're

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.960 
access stroke it's the one where we're
rotating<00:00:18.690> our<00:00:18.779> body<00:00:19.100> along<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.250> axis<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.850> our

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
rotating our body along the axis to our

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
rotating our body along the axis to our
hip<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.720> we're<00:00:21.869> really<00:00:22.050> elevating<00:00:22.710> cutting

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
hip and we're really elevating cutting

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.070 
hip and we're really elevating cutting
on<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> lot<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.730> motion<00:00:24.029> backward<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.900> then

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
on a lot of motion backward and then

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.179 
on a lot of motion backward and then
forward<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.310> you've<00:00:26.519> been<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:26.970> good<00:00:27.210> at<00:00:28.189> but

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
forward that you've been so good at but

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.410 
forward that you've been so good at but
there's<00:00:29.400> two<00:00:29.580> elements<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> breaststroke

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
there's two elements of the breaststroke

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.990 
there's two elements of the breaststroke
that<00:00:30.689> are<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:30.990> vital<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.130> 80%<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
that are really vital one is the 80% of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510 
that are really vital one is the 80% of
the<00:00:33.059> power<00:00:33.270> comes<00:00:33.690> from<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.960> legs<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:35.130> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the power comes from the legs so you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.459 
the power comes from the legs so you
have<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.000> develop<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.510> strong<00:00:36.809> kick<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.290> order

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
have to develop a strong kick in order

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.020 
have to develop a strong kick in order
to<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:37.920> good<00:00:38.129> at<00:00:38.250> restroom<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.910> other

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
to be very good at restroom the other

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.580 
to be very good at restroom the other
part<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> lot<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.050> people<00:00:40.410> forget

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
part of it that a lot of people forget

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.190 
part of it that a lot of people forget
about<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:42.059> importance<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.690> happens

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
about is the importance what happens

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.040 
about is the importance what happens
after<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> kick<00:00:44.070> where<00:00:44.910> 80%<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.660> propulsion

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
after the kick where 80% of propulsion

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.650 
after the kick where 80% of propulsion
is<00:00:46.320> providing<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.860> lot<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> force<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:48.480> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
is providing a lot of the force but you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.260 
is providing a lot of the force but you
also<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.860> very<00:00:50.100> low<00:00:50.399> drag

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
also have to be in a very low drag

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.450 
also have to be in a very low drag
position<00:00:51.899> moving<00:00:52.140> forward<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:53.219> we're<00:00:53.340> going

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
position moving forward what we're going

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.040 
position moving forward what we're going
to<00:00:53.489> start<00:00:53.760> out<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> few<00:00:54.420> drills<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.930> are

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to start out with a few drills that are

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.290 
to start out with a few drills that are
going<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> help<00:00:55.530> us<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.640> into<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.059> low

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
going to help us to get into that low

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.319 
going to help us to get into that low
drag<00:00:57.600> position<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:59.160> amazes<00:00:59.699> me<00:00:59.730> because<00:01:00.120> most

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
drag position it amazes me because most

breast strokers when they when they take
their<00:01:03.049> when<00:01:04.049> they<00:01:04.140> ready<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> strike

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
their when they ready for the strike

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.490 
their when they ready for the strike
phase<00:01:05.369> when<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.700> ready<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> move<00:01:06.210> forward

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
phase when they're ready to move forward

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.690 
phase when they're ready to move forward
instead<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.890> into<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.159> low<00:01:08.400> drag

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
instead of going into a low drag

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.330 
instead of going into a low drag
position<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.960> go<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.680> Superman

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
position they go out here like Superman

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
position they go out here like Superman
or<00:01:11.369> superwoman<00:01:11.900> which<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.320> bad

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
or superwoman which is a very bad

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.210 
or superwoman which is a very bad
position

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
position

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.160 
position
so<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.549> whether<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.600> power<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.020> their

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
so they whether they have power in their

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.539 
so they whether they have power in their
legs<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.619> they're<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> go<00:01:17.400> very

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
legs or not they're not going to go very

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.149 
legs or not they're not going to go very
fast<00:01:17.939> or<00:01:18.360> very<00:01:18.390> far<00:01:19.290> forward<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.040> we

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
fast or very far forward so what we

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.359 
fast or very far forward so what we
first<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.509> try<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.500> do

first do to try to get you to do
something<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.570> important<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
something that is really important to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
something that is really important to
keep<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.500> head<00:01:25.680> down<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.189> you're<00:01:26.340> moving
