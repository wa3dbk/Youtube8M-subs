wasn't sure exactly how they worked so I

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
wasn't sure exactly how they worked so I
tried<00:00:36.930> them<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.140> today<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.370> thought<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.059> figure

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
tried them out today I thought I figure

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.430 
tried them out today I thought I figure
out<00:00:39.450> how<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> use<00:00:39.719> them<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.110> I'm<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.350> show

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
out how to use them so I'm going to show

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.750 
out how to use them so I'm going to show
you<00:00:40.500> guys<00:00:40.680> how<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.040> some<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.430> actually

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
you guys how do you some it's actually

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
you guys how do you some it's actually
pretty<00:00:41.940> simple<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.140> takes<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.500> little

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
pretty simple it just takes a little

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.260 
pretty simple it just takes a little
longer<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.100> think<00:00:44.340> than<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> regular<00:00:45.000> curling

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
longer I think than a regular curling

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
longer I think than a regular curling
iron<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.930> maybe<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.410> me

and this is the bigger size become a two

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.380 
and this is the bigger size become a two
sides<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.210> small<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.350> large

and you can wrap it either way I'm going
to<00:01:58.270> do<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.510> to<00:01:58.690> where<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.870> gives<00:01:58.990> you<00:01:59.110> spiral

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
to do it to where it gives you spiral

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.520 
to do it to where it gives you spiral
curls<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.150> just<00:02:01.360> wrap<00:02:02.229> it<00:02:02.260> around<00:02:02.740> like

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
curls for you just wrap it around like

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.219 
curls for you just wrap it around like
this<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.860> twist<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.270> then<00:02:07.930> I'm<00:02:08.050> going<00:02:08.170> to

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
this and twist it and then I'm going to

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.710 
this and twist it and then I'm going to
stick<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:09.280> through<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.179> loop<00:02:10.420> right<00:02:10.660> here

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
stick this through the loop right here

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.810 
stick this through the loop right here
there's<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.260> little<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:12.250> get<00:02:12.370> through<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.640> loop

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
there's a little to get through the loop

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.640 
there's a little to get through the loop
pull<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.240> then<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.840> stays<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.380> your<00:02:17.470> hair

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
pull it and then it stays in your hair

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.030 
pull it and then it stays in your hair
like<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:18.900> they're<00:02:19.900> not<00:02:20.050> heated<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:20.740> you're

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
like that they're not heated so you're

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.380 
like that they're not heated so you're
not<00:02:21.130> going<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.370> see<00:02:21.550> anything<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:22.060> my<00:02:22.180> hair

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
not going to see anything but my hair

not going to see anything but my hair
right<00:02:22.540> now<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:23.080> just<00:02:23.440> finished<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.580> ten

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
right now I just finished it like ten

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
minutes ago and I use this technique and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.949 
minutes ago and I use this technique and
it<00:02:26.739> came<00:02:26.860> out<00:02:27.010> fine<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.780> can

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.600 
it came out fine and you just you can
sleep<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.500> or<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.100> can<00:02:30.280> leave<00:02:30.430> them<00:02:30.550> in

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
sleep this on or you can leave them in

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.220 
sleep this on or you can leave them in
for<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.910> ten<00:02:31.120> minutes<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.480> did<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.870> left<00:02:31.989> mine

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
for like ten minutes I did I left mine

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.930 
for like ten minutes I did I left mine
in<00:02:32.260> for<00:02:32.530> ten<00:02:32.650> minutes<00:02:32.830> because<00:02:33.610> I'm<00:02:33.820> actually

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
in for ten minutes because I'm actually

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.729 
in for ten minutes because I'm actually
going<00:02:34.120> somewhere<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.780> let<00:02:35.080> let<00:02:35.440> them<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.709> my

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
going somewhere so I let let them in my

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.350 
going somewhere so I let let them in my
hair<00:02:36.040> for<00:02:36.070> ten<00:02:36.370> minutes<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.880> took<00:02:36.970> them<00:02:37.209> out

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
hair for ten minutes and I took them out

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.300 
hair for ten minutes and I took them out
and<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:38.110> got<00:02:38.260> these<00:02:38.380> curls<00:02:38.739> they're<00:02:38.950> actually<00:02:39.250> a

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and I got these curls they're actually a

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.370 
and I got these curls they're actually a
lot<00:02:39.459> curlier<00:02:39.940> but<00:02:40.570> what<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.750> do<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:40.989> I<00:02:41.110> brush

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
lot curlier but what I do is I brush

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.250 
lot curlier but what I do is I brush
through<00:02:41.739> them<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.220> then<00:02:42.310> spray<00:02:42.640> them<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.720> they

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
through them and then spray them so they

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.009 
through them and then spray them so they
come<00:02:44.500> out<00:02:44.590> really<00:02:45.310> curly<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.269> then<00:02:46.870> when<00:02:46.959> you

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
come out really curly and then when you

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.820 
come out really curly and then when you
want<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.200> take<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.470> off<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.830> just<00:02:47.950> pull<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.830> out

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
want to take it off you just pull it out

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.660 
want to take it off you just pull it out
of<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.160> loop<00:02:51.400> like<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.250> then<00:02:54.250> unwrap<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
of the loop like so and then unwrap it

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
of the loop like so and then unwrap it
and<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.630> would<00:02:55.810> have<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.200> nice<00:02:56.350> curl<00:02:57.690> they

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
and then you would have a nice curl they

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.720 
and then you would have a nice curl they
come<00:02:58.840> out<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.140> curly<00:02:59.709> like<00:03:00.250> Taylor<00:03:00.579> Swift

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
come out really curly like Taylor Swift

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.039 
come out really curly like Taylor Swift
curls<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:01.329> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.510> just<00:03:01.600> brush<00:03:01.870> through

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
curls but you can just brush through

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.390 
curls but you can just brush through
them<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:02.350> your<00:03:02.470> fingers<00:03:02.769> like<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.100> did<00:03:03.250> and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.610 
them with your fingers like I did and
spray<00:03:03.670> them<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:04.030> get<00:03:04.150> them<00:03:04.269> loose<00:03:04.570> or<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.440> can

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
spray them to get them loose or you can

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.039 
spray them to get them loose or you can
make<00:03:05.829> you<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:06.070> keep<00:03:06.730> them<00:03:06.910> really<00:03:07.150> curly

comfortable<00:03:32.019> alternative<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:33.250> saw<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.090> weird

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
comfortable alternative I saw that weird

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.620 
comfortable alternative I saw that weird
alternative<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.230> curlers<00:03:35.799> actually<00:03:36.370> have

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
alternative to curlers actually have

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.750 
alternative to curlers actually have
hair<00:03:37.630> curlers<00:03:38.049> but<00:03:38.769> those<00:03:38.950> are<00:03:39.160> not<00:03:39.190> obviously

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
hair curlers but those are not obviously

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.830 
hair curlers but those are not obviously
comfortable<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.209> sleep<00:03:40.329> in<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.660> they<00:03:40.720> always

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
comfortable to sleep in and they always

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.930 
comfortable to sleep in and they always
fall<00:03:41.110> out<00:03:41.260> but<00:03:41.829> these<00:03:42.010> they<00:03:42.310> pretty<00:03:42.549> much<00:03:42.700> stay

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
fall out but these they pretty much stay

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.520 
fall out but these they pretty much stay
in<00:03:43.209> your<00:03:43.360> hair<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.750> can<00:03:43.780> use<00:03:43.930> clipped<00:03:44.320> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
in your hair you can use clipped the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.860 
in your hair you can use clipped the
human<00:03:44.829> better<00:03:45.040> but<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:46.000> didn't<00:03:46.420> use<00:03:46.510> any<00:03:46.690> clip

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
human better but I didn't use any clip

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.569 
human better but I didn't use any clip
they<00:03:47.110> stayed<00:03:47.320> fine<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.890> these<00:03:48.310> are<00:03:48.489> more

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
they stayed fine and these are more

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.800 
they stayed fine and these are more
comfortable<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:49.090> sleep<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:49.390> because<00:03:49.510> they're

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
comfortable to sleep in because they're

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.420 
comfortable to sleep in because they're
like<00:03:49.959> they're<00:03:50.410> more<00:03:50.590> gel<00:03:50.890> like<00:03:51.040> they<00:03:51.250> just

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
like they're more gel like they just

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.490 
like they're more gel like they just
have<00:03:51.549> a<00:03:51.579> spring<00:03:52.060> inside<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.600> heats<00:03:52.780> up<00:03:52.989> when

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
have a spring inside that heats up when

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.539 
have a spring inside that heats up when
you<00:03:53.620> put<00:03:53.799> them<00:03:53.890> in<00:03:53.950> here<00:03:54.160> but<00:03:54.310> they're<00:03:54.459> pretty

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
you put them in here but they're pretty

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.900 
you put them in here but they're pretty
comfortable<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:55.209> lay<00:03:55.359> on<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:57.549> can<00:03:57.730> sleep

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
comfortable to lay on so you can sleep

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.580 
comfortable to lay on so you can sleep
it<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.180> or<00:03:58.510> leave<00:03:59.140> them<00:03:59.230> in<00:03:59.290> your<00:03:59.320> hair<00:03:59.560> for

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
it in or leave them in your hair for

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.110 
it in or leave them in your hair for
just<00:03:59.890> 10<00:04:00.070> minutes<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.430> take<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.670> out<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.030> they

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
just 10 minutes and take it out and they

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.589 
just 10 minutes and take it out and they
come<00:04:01.329> out<00:04:01.420> great<00:04:01.750> either<00:04:01.989> way<00:04:02.340> for<00:04:03.340> school<00:04:04.180> or

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
come out great either way for school or

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.660 
come out great either way for school or
work<00:04:04.629> I<00:04:05.200> would<00:04:05.830> recommend<00:04:06.220> just<00:04:06.280> sleeping

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
work I would recommend just sleeping

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.380 
work I would recommend just sleeping
with<00:04:06.700> them

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
with them

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.730 
with them
you<00:04:07.450> don't<00:04:07.630> have<00:04:07.780> time<00:04:08.020> in<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.200> morning<00:04:08.530> like

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
you don't have time in the morning like

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.190 
you don't have time in the morning like
I<00:04:08.890> don't<00:04:08.980> have<00:04:09.400> time<00:04:09.640> at<00:04:09.819> all<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:09.990> waste<00:04:10.990> on

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
I don't have time at all to waste on

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.800 
I don't have time at all to waste on
these<00:04:11.319> because<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.740> took<00:04:11.860> me<00:04:11.920> about<00:04:12.220> two<00:04:12.459> hours

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
these because it took me about two hours

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.970 
these because it took me about two hours
maybe<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:13.900> was<00:04:14.110> just<00:04:14.200> slow<00:04:14.470> at<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.650> because<00:04:14.950> I

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
maybe I was just slow at it because I

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.569 
maybe I was just slow at it because I
kind<00:04:15.160> of<00:04:15.220> took<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.400> couple<00:04:15.640> breaks<00:04:15.970> but<00:04:17.010> if<00:04:18.010> you

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
kind of took a couple breaks but if you

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.680 
kind of took a couple breaks but if you
were<00:04:18.700> going<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:18.940> go<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.090> school<00:04:19.329> or<00:04:19.450> work<00:04:19.540> the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
were going to go to school or work the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.090 
were going to go to school or work the
next<00:04:19.780> morning<00:04:20.200> I'd<00:04:20.290> recommend<00:04:20.650> sleeping<00:04:20.980> with

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
next morning I'd recommend sleeping with

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.400 
next morning I'd recommend sleeping with
these<00:04:21.250> if<00:04:21.519> not<00:04:21.840> if<00:04:22.840> you're<00:04:22.990> going<00:04:23.080> somewhere

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.900 
these if not if you're going somewhere

that day just put them in take them out

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.760 
that day just put them in take them out
ten<00:04:25.120> minutes<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:26.020> that's<00:04:26.200> how<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.350> use<00:04:26.590> them

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
ten minutes so that's how to use them

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.120 
ten minutes so that's how to use them
you<00:04:27.040> can<00:04:27.340> buy<00:04:27.520> them<00:04:27.550> at<00:04:27.700> Walmart<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:29.590> really

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.960 
like this product I think it was cool at
first<00:04:32.169> it<00:04:32.770> took<00:04:32.980> me<00:04:33.130> like<00:04:33.250> an<00:04:33.370> hour<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.669> figure

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
first it took me like an hour to figure

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.730 
first it took me like an hour to figure
out<00:04:34.060> how<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.210> actually<00:04:34.360> use<00:04:34.720> them<00:04:34.990> because<00:04:35.650> I

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
out how to actually use them because I

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.550 
out how to actually use them because I
didn't<00:04:36.040> have<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.340> instructions<00:04:36.880> like<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.180> said

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
didn't have the instructions like I said

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.780 
didn't have the instructions like I said
my<00:04:38.560> family<00:04:38.860> about<00:04:38.919> this<00:04:39.220> for<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.490> three<00:04:39.700> or

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
my family about this for like three or

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.460 
my family about this for like three or
four<00:04:39.850> years<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:40.870> they're<00:04:40.960> actually<00:04:41.080> really

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
four years but they're actually really

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.290 
four years but they're actually really
awesome<00:04:41.590> for<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.280> price<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.850> really<00:04:43.090> liked
