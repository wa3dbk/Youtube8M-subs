00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.410
 welcome dear audience it 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.990
 Only let's say lightning again and me 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.010
 go directly to the place on here 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.790
 jazz 24th 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 there we are and looking for an opponent 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.250
 and I play again three minutes 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.630
 now a bit fixer too 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.279
 even more demanding because I 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.380
 have less time and still 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.670
 Reasonable trains must be found and good 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.640
 must play and we have an opponent 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.859
 I found a guest player 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.570
 do not get his exact one here 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.439
 Numbers read aloud that interested 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.780
 anyone 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.550
 and we just play here and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.770
 I will try to play fast 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.200
 and at the same time still reasonable too 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.750
 tell well we see the Sicilian 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.710
 probably now Maidorf exactly for 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.960
 g5 the hottest back and now 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.820
 Talk is the fashion train and me 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.449
 problems runs c4 there are still next to it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 f4 and thus two c7 ok-chef in it 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.970
 It's not so smart to see 7 not like that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.409
 good 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.939
 but I can not just great here 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.479
 Of course it has to spit sounds like that too 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.830
 prove why is not that good 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.900
 and yes I was ten run by b 3 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.259
 then pretty good when black later 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.500
 playing with e6 then you can do that very well 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.909
 Runners sacrifice six and there we have 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.259
 now exactly the fault on the board 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.479
 and I do it now with one hand 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.680
 that already announces so then must 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.939
 Of course I do that now too 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.530
 I might have one to wait 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.180
 may have to play four but 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.659
 I think it is very nice here too 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.790
 very attractive to me and you see 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.130
 I have not fully developed black 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.840
 and I can proceed right here 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.790
 with four five and so on maybe 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.590
 also springer ag 5 and I believe that 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.570
 Especially in a short flash has 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.850
 be very difficult here for three minutes 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:58.310
 to defend him well at the time five 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.439
 Now the question jump d5 or 11 484 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.210
 directly five lying open against the 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.000
 king in the middle is the must here 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.229
 the idea you have to do it yourself once 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.050
 because he just gives me this 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.830
 farmers on gysi with chess and there grab 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.030
 I of course too 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.460
 so now I already have three farmers 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.610
 something for the figure already here 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.040
 sufficient material for an easy 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.370
 feverish and that's it 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.700
 pretty good, plus more 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.220
 attack here 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.600
 and will end badly for him because 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.480
 I am very confident 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.490
 i play at 4 i can do it once 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.530
 chess, so I give everything here 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.600
 keep covered and then just the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.790
 springer pull king g6 well then 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.200
 I also take with my opponent 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.660
 may not seem his best 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:55.110
 That's why I got caught here today 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:57.870
 make such gifts and now 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.370
 I know so many possibilities 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.920
 certainly not know what to draw 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.450
 I'll say goodbye again and now 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:15.860
 I like to sell immediately 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:15.860
 but the question is how I play times 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.620
 I swim h4 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.570
 I want to go straight to the king now 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.070
 pierce sympathy for he plays 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.070
 himself h5 clearly he can do that 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.760
 because I have no other choice than 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.319
 here quite boring mean mine 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.189
 springer pull away aschach and then 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.780
 I pull the tail but I stand 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.400
 here with three more farmers plus 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.909
 Therefore , I am allowed to attack the Royal 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.700
 well he remains very optimistic 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:56.260
 I strike king again 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:01.090
 Completely open good for you with chess 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.189
 There is not that way, too 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.599
 covered but now comes the lady 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.769
 King as they do more than that 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:14.440
 We can come here now 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:16.720
 pure with chess lady g6 king f8 it 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.600
 smells like dull but exactly how 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.260
 maybe jump f5 better now has to 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.010
 he makes king g6 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.720
 that should be here now 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:33.870
 that's over, that may be now 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:36.789
 so chess and make everything clear 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.810
 neudorf exciting opening player with 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.010
 I also have both colors here at 24 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.740
 made with black series believes 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.750
 naidoo for advanced sc you can 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.780
 even look when they me 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.430
 small advertising still allowed and if 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.169
 You are not watching black here 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.699
 seen right in the mouth he has 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.500
 a little wrong celebrity lady 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.599
 may be more like b 6 or a5 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.889
 so that they just out of this victim radius 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.169
 out is that they are not right 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.330
 attacked if white on e six 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.139
 out all beats a bit 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.910
 built up wrong 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.949
 The victims directly for a light 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.139
 open lines and there he is 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.570
 not best defended but it is 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.229
 anyway, I think everything is difficult 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.150
 clearly fell 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.050
 Many thanks for the audience and we see 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.050
 See you soon as well
