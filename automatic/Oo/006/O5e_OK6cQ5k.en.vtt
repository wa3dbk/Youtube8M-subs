00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the ground about like that i probably

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.910 
the ground about like that i probably
ready<00:01:21.930> cover<00:01:22.170> again<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> little

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
ready cover again just to get a little

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.980 
ready cover again just to get a little
bit<00:01:23.100> smoother<00:01:23.580> i'm<00:01:24.180> trying<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> make<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.780> shut

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
bit smoother i'm trying to make it shut

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.289 
bit smoother i'm trying to make it shut
so<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.380> topsoil<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.130> probably<00:01:26.580> i<00:01:26.909> would

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so that the topsoil is probably i would

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.140 
so that the topsoil is probably i would
say<00:01:27.420> half<00:01:27.810> miracle-gro<00:01:28.320> half<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.549> salts<00:01:30.000> in

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
say half miracle-gro half this salts in

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.340 
say half miracle-gro half this salts in
here<00:01:30.360> which<00:01:30.509> had<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> lot<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.900> miracle<00:01:31.229> grow

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
here which had a lot of miracle grow

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.410 
here which had a lot of miracle grow
soil<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> already<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:33.210> probably

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
soil in it already and will probably

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
soil in it already and will probably
feel<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> 10<00:01:34.200> 10<00:01:34.439> 10<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.979> there

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
feel a little bit of 10 10 10 in there

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.969 
feel a little bit of 10 10 10 in there
and<00:01:35.509> then<00:01:36.509> see<00:01:36.720> how<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.960> winter<00:01:37.320> garden<00:01:37.350> grows

I'll<00:02:35.470> loosened<00:02:35.890> up<00:02:35.980> really<00:02:36.190> good<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.610> chunked

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
I'll loosened up really good and chunked

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.240 
I'll loosened up really good and chunked
up<00:02:37.060> just<00:02:37.840> sprinkle<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.350> seat<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.710> top<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.220> it

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
up just sprinkle the seat on top of it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.740 
up just sprinkle the seat on top of it
and<00:02:39.400> maybe<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:39.850> scratch<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.420> little<00:02:40.570> bit

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
and maybe just scratch it a little bit

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.650 
and maybe just scratch it a little bit
with<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.470> rake<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:42.220> used<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.460> garden<00:02:42.760> rake<00:02:42.970> and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
with a rake so I used a garden rake and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.710 
with a rake so I used a garden rake and
just<00:02:43.840> kind<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.140> basically<00:02:44.470> just<00:02:44.680> kind<00:02:44.920> of

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
just kind of basically just kind of

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.870 
just kind of basically just kind of
forked<00:02:46.720> down<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.290> like<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
forked down in it like that it's the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.510 
forked down in it like that it's the
garden<00:02:49.210> rake<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.710> so<00:02:50.710> got<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.010> seat<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.280> a

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
garden rake and so got the seat just a

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.770 
garden rake and so got the seat just a
little<00:02:51.700> bit<00:02:51.820> down<00:02:51.970> in<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> ground<00:02:52.390> doesn't

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
little bit down in the ground doesn't

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.270 
little bit down in the ground doesn't
need<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:52.990> be<00:02:53.110> buried<00:02:53.410> very<00:02:53.590> far<00:02:53.920> he<00:02:54.040> said<00:02:54.160> you

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
need to be buried very far he said you

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.330 
need to be buried very far he said you
could<00:02:54.490> just<00:02:54.670> put<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.690> on<00:02:55.840> there<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.410> spray<00:02:57.310> it

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
could just put it on there and spray it

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.790 
could just put it on there and spray it
with<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.580> hose<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.090> would<00:02:58.240> still<00:02:58.750> grow<00:02:59.020> but

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
with a hose and it would still grow but

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.590 
with a hose and it would still grow but
so<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.190> look<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.700> think<00:03:01.000> less<00:03:01.210> than<00:03:01.450> two

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
so this is look I think less than two

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.330 
so this is look I think less than two
weeks<00:03:01.780> maybe<00:03:02.200> two<00:03:02.350> weeks<00:03:02.740> worth<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.100> growth

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
weeks maybe two weeks worth of growth

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.610 
weeks maybe two weeks worth of growth
something<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.230> which<00:03:05.230> there's<00:03:05.470> our

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
something like that which there's our

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.610 
something like that which there's our
asparagus<00:03:05.890> still<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.840> what<00:03:08.200> I've<00:03:08.290> got<00:03:08.410> over

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
asparagus still and what I've got over

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.250 
asparagus still and what I've got over
here<00:03:09.000> there's<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.060> little<00:03:10.330> bits<00:03:10.600> of<00:03:10.840> spinach

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
here there's a little bits of spinach

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.140 
here there's a little bits of spinach
coming<00:03:11.620> if<00:03:11.710> I<00:03:11.830> did<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.310> same<00:03:12.580> way<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.090> a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
coming if I did that the same way it's a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.700 
coming if I did that the same way it's a
little<00:03:13.360> bit<00:03:13.480> slower<00:03:13.810> coming<00:03:14.290> up<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.530> looks

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
little bit slower coming up it looks

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.280 
little bit slower coming up it looks
like<00:03:15.210> there's<00:03:16.210> spinach<00:03:16.510> coming<00:03:16.930> up<00:03:17.050> there
