running on t-mobile's network this phone

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.140 
running on t-mobile's network this phone
is<00:00:11.940> actually<00:00:12.179> better<00:00:13.019> than<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.759> t-mobile<00:00:14.759> one

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
is actually better than the t-mobile one

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.840 
is actually better than the t-mobile one
because<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.630> has<00:00:15.780> LTE<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.220> uses<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.640> same

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
because it has LTE and it uses the same

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.660 
because it has LTE and it uses the same
bands<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.420> t-mobile<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.800> I've<00:00:20.220> been<00:00:20.369> getting

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670
