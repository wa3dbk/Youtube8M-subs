00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.740 

the<00:00:14.440> spacecraft<00:00:14.950> was<00:00:15.849> a<00:00:15.910> long<00:00:16.180> way<00:00:16.360> from<00:00:16.420> home

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
the spacecraft was a long way from home

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.409 
the spacecraft was a long way from home
I<00:00:17.550> thought<00:00:18.550> it<00:00:18.640> might<00:00:18.759> be<00:00:18.849> a<00:00:18.880> good<00:00:19.060> idea<00:00:19.360> just

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
I thought it might be a good idea just

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.870 
I thought it might be a good idea just
after<00:00:20.020> Saturn<00:00:20.380> to<00:00:20.890> have<00:00:21.070> them<00:00:21.189> take<00:00:21.400> one<00:00:21.610> last

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
after Saturn to have them take one last

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.139 
after Saturn to have them take one last
glance<00:00:22.270> homeward<00:00:22.980> from<00:00:23.980> Saturn<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:25.029> earth

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:25.149 
glance homeward from Saturn the earth

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.060 
glance homeward from Saturn the earth
would<00:00:25.390> appear<00:00:25.689> too<00:00:25.930> small<00:00:26.169> for<00:00:26.470> Voyager<00:00:26.919> to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
would appear too small for Voyager to

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.429 
would appear too small for Voyager to
make<00:00:27.189> out<00:00:27.340> any<00:00:27.369> detail<00:00:27.899> our<00:00:28.899> planet<00:00:29.259> would<00:00:29.410> be

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
make out any detail our planet would be

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.479 
make out any detail our planet would be
just<00:00:29.739> a<00:00:29.890> point<00:00:30.700> of<00:00:30.790> light<00:00:30.849> too<00:00:31.270> lonely<00:00:31.540> pixel

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
just a point of light too lonely pixel

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.560 
just a point of light too lonely pixel
hardly<00:00:33.489> distinguishable<00:00:33.969> from<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.420> many

other points of light Voyager would see

nearby planets far-off Suns but

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.529 
nearby planets far-off Suns but
precisely<00:00:41.739> because<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.760> obscurity<00:00:43.300> of

our world thus revealed such a picture

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
might be worth having it had been well

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.069 
might be worth having it had been well
understood<00:00:48.609> by<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.179> scientists<00:00:49.929> and

philosophers of classical antiquity that
the<00:00:52.839> earth<00:00:52.989> was<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.379> mere<00:00:53.649> point<00:00:53.980> in<00:00:54.969> a<00:00:55.149> vast

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
the earth was a mere point in a vast

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.399 
the earth was a mere point in a vast
encompassing<00:00:56.769> cosmos<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.899> no<00:00:59.050> one<00:00:59.199> had<00:00:59.319> ever

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.309 
encompassing cosmos but no one had ever
seen<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.949> as<00:01:00.100> such<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:01.629> was<00:01:01.749> a<00:01:01.780> first<00:01:02.079> chance

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
seen it as such here was a first chance

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.850 
seen it as such here was a first chance
