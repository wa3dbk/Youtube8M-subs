00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 what seems to me the closest season 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.340
 must demonstrate 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.190
 Bebeshko about the news from the office 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.929
 store meet throw this year 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:09.609
 so here 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.569
 opening up 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:13.539
 it is clear that he managed to discuss not 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.529
 disclosed and does not get in an accident 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.460
 here 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 Dimitrova 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.659
 Lebanon fled clear points guard 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.050
 the latest news from the spot took place 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.810
 we got an answer to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 to counterattack literally 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
 champions and competently 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.340
 original bye 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340
 but the rollback did not watch the match 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.800
 not bad just chepurin to the ball not 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 I got and most likely yes arbitrator Igor 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.780
 silent 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.800
 But you can take it and we watch our replay 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 child before throwing crossings 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.200
 chigorin side and then one of them 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.110
 came out for 15 bld. 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.250
 aviv without matches of streets 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.440
 it turned out nothing sensible 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.400
 in response to the counterattack throw 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.690
 previously a judge in his 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.470
 partners throw 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.470
 Bukovsky look what 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.610
 running shoes 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.400
 crap trance on the spot sort out before and 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.810
 there must be 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.090
 for example atomic gas explosion 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.610
 at the site 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.160
 15 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.730
 there is still a lot of solution left 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.740
 troops sly hit the crossbar 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.070
 but here you need to interrogate him with his 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.030
 time reports site timur dibir 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.470
 demonstrate in all its glory our experts 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.880
 number 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.409
 did not get fame and books 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.440
 if today is concrete 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.180
 since then there can be more and more 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.960
 this 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.010
 we know both from the past season and because 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.140
 break through the day in our area 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.650
 cues fail 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.149
 moreover for all three 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.520
 Samples 19 19 23 Why so from under our 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.410
 cities 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.310
 Mironov 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.399
 lost the ball and immediately counterattack 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.320
 counterattacks 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.559
 Dzerzhinsky alignment of forces in the crossbar 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.559
 I respect but the gap runs away 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.989
 Here is such a target cast 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.989
 attention and first slip of the solution 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.699
 thought sucked partners 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.019
 we situation 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.309
 let's say so simplified 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.759
 maybe really 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.930
 Minsk residents are so formidable at home 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.489
 find out soon throw 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.509
 the dream will be honest 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.509
 Minsk Dynamo translation 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.919
 powerful to hold this meeting 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.919
 as it turned out a little over 40 people 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.489
 Well, look 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.519
 replies 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.260
 throw dibirov imprudently 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.799
 dibir sets gave way qualitatively 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.569
 one of ours 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.259
 edges and edges no wonder and first 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.569
 reflected first reflected in tunisia 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.219
 his pictures were like that 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.479
 which are smaller than in the third reich 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.059
 at 13 m number fell positions about strengthening 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:11.059
 Viktor Kovalenko for the first time 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.009
 in his pocket for example he has 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:18.669
 alarming 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.669
 trying to pierce 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.359
 throw kovalenko land rod 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.109
 already caught our only rod a 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.579
 it was great played by the way fight 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.459
 for crossing the streets 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.899
 four goals scored balls 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:43.159
 7 meter throw of the most powerful further 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.549
 football is all 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.299
 Pavel Hathman on transfers the ball to 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.629
 right prosoft again can not score 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.359
 Minsk citizens fail again Oleg Grams 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.149
 a circle 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.999
 appeared m on the site for the first time 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:55.859
 Today 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.879
 decided to surprise and cause not 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.359
 it turned out in the meantime but it 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.359
 to the question who is guilty of the person who has run away 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.709
 in landfills and here's how to write scourge 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.559
 In general, select how to throw but 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:10.829
 ugly execution 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.139
 but blow however we seek 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.400
 Valladolid in Kiev here 1 but in today's 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.159
 meetings won the Minsk dynamo 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.399
 won quite confidently we won 

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.849
 in the most against outplayed say so 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.399
 at the right moment at the moment of the meeting 

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.610
 when 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.400
 yield statistical tekke with a difference plus 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.159
 all investments are a common mood and 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.550
 sent back 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.009
 before so in a year
