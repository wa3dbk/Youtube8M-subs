to<00:01:37.409> add<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> piece<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> foam<00:01:38.100> tape<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> top

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
to add a piece of foam tape to the top

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.380 
to add a piece of foam tape to the top
of<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> toothbrush<00:01:39.810> head<00:01:40.670> can<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.759> mount<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
of the toothbrush head can we mount the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.830 
of the toothbrush head can we mount the

next we're going to want to add the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
next we're going to want to add the
battery<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.670> battery<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> go

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
battery the battery is going to go

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.160 
battery the battery is going to go
between<00:01:54.540> those<00:01:55.170> two<00:01:55.350> wire<00:01:55.590> terminals<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:57.170> if

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
between those two wire terminals now if

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.990 
between those two wire terminals now if
you<00:01:58.259> notice<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.590> got<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:59.040> wire<00:01:59.280> bent<00:01:59.610> down

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you notice I got one wire bent down

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.330 
you notice I got one wire bent down
touching<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> foam<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.619> others<00:02:01.799> up<00:02:01.979> above

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
touching the foam the others up above

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.980 
touching the foam the others up above
and<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.969> clamp<00:02:03.240> down<00:02:03.390> under<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and it's going to clamp down under the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.660 
and it's going to clamp down under the
top<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.350> battery<00:02:04.710> when<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.100> there<00:02:05.280> let's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
top of battery when it's in there let's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.639 
top of battery when it's in there let's
see<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.030> works<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.570> I've<00:02:07.079> got<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> battery

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
see if it works so I've got the battery

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.730 
see if it works so I've got the battery
in<00:02:07.740> there

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
in there

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.980 
in there
and<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.970> motors<00:02:10.210> going<00:02:10.360> look<00:02:10.570> I've<00:02:10.840> got

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
and so the motors going look I've got

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.370 
and so the motors going look I've got
the<00:02:11.080> battery<00:02:11.350> stuck<00:02:11.680> down<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.430> foam<00:02:12.610> tape

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the battery stuck down to the foam tape

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.320 
the battery stuck down to the foam tape
okay<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.680> got<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.910> battery<00:02:15.910> hooked<00:02:16.030> up

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
okay so you got the battery hooked up

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.950 
okay so you got the battery hooked up
Motors<00:02:16.930> go<00:02:17.080> on<00:02:17.200> even<00:02:17.470> more<00:02:17.680> or<00:02:17.800> less<00:02:17.950> just

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:30.200 

really<00:02:22.960> go

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:44.920 

you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.960 

so<00:02:45.470> as<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.590> can<00:02:45.709> see<00:02:45.799> this<00:02:45.920> thing<00:02:46.069> really<00:02:46.430> goes

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
so as you can see this thing really goes

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.970 
so as you can see this thing really goes
because<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.510> directionality<00:02:48.319> imparted<00:02:48.950> by

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
because the directionality imparted by

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.130 
because the directionality imparted by
the<00:02:49.129> bristles<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:49.970> toothbrush<00:02:50.659> ah<00:02:53.140> so

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
the bristles of the toothbrush ah so

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.170 
the bristles of the toothbrush ah so
that's<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.500> easy<00:02:55.010> five<00:02:55.489> minutes

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
that's it easy five minutes

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.089 
that's it easy five minutes
