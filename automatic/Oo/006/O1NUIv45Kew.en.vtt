00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For the 2012-2013 season, I'd like to go even further and push the boundaries of the imagination.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I want to offer performances on a grand scale.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I am truly pleased to add Kaguyahime, Moon princess to our repertory,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.000
a monumental piece for an integral evening of fusion between two worlds, East and West.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:28.000
What’s interesting about this work is that in addition to the orchestra, it also features other Japanese artists, namely the group Kodo and musicians from the gagaku tradition.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
December is obviously synonymous with The Nutcracker, one of our most celebrated traditions.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:46.500
Interestingly, in 2011, Reader’s Digest mentioned Montreal as being one of the best cities in which to spend the holiday season – and we’re proud to say that The Nutcracker by Les Grands Ballets Canadiens was listed as one of the reasons why.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Turning to invited companies; it is with great joy that we announce that National Ballet of China will be making their first-ever appearance in Montreal and in Canada with their hugely-successful Raise the Red Lantern.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:16.500
In the month of March, we’ll be presenting a double bill called Danz &amp; TooT, by Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin and Dutch choreographer Didy Veldman.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Our second invited company is Alberta Ballet with their top all-time success, Love Lives Bleeding, a mega-production based on the music of Elton John.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.500
This daring production, featuring sumptuous décor and costumes, easily rivals the boldest of Broadway productions.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It is the product of Quebec-born artistic director and choreographer Jean Grand-Maitre.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.500
The last show of the season was specially commissioned by Les Grands Ballets Canadiens.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The choreographer is a young, German talent by the name of Stephan Thoss.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.500
We are already familiar with Stephan Thoss as we presented his outstanding work, Searching for Home, last year.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
In fact, the Montreal Gazette named it the Best Dance Show of 2011.
