automatically I think I want to move I
am<00:02:23.510> moving<00:02:24.940> when<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.510> get<00:02:26.840> used<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.080> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
am moving when you get used to the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.720 
am moving when you get used to the
inventory<00:02:27.650> as<00:02:27.920> sort<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.310> pushing<00:02:28.640> things

bottom you sort of expect it to always

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.630 
bottom you sort of expect it to always
do<00:02:34.819> that

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
do that

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.030 
do that
so<00:02:37.640> what<00:02:37.730> ends<00:02:37.910> up<00:02:37.940> happening<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.800> you<00:02:39.800> end<00:02:39.950> up

so what ends up happening is you end up

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.120 
so what ends up happening is you end up
in<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.160> situation<00:02:40.190> like<00:02:40.670> this<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:42.020> are<00:02:42.380> out<00:02:43.070> of

in a situation like this you are out of

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.060 
in a situation like this you are out of
crafting<00:02:43.520> bench<00:02:44.680> putting<00:02:45.680> together<00:02:45.770> some

stuff and then there's an object here
and<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.950> your<00:02:49.250> brain<00:02:49.490> or<00:02:50.300> you<00:02:50.630> say<00:02:50.810> to

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870

yourself I want to move this down here
and<00:02:53.240> your<00:02:53.450> brand<00:02:53.720> immediately<00:02:54.080> goes<00:02:54.170> ha<00:02:54.530> I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
and your brand immediately goes ha I

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.870 
and your brand immediately goes ha I
know<00:02:54.890> how<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.160> do<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.370> in<00:02:55.490> under<00:02:55.790> that

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
know how to do that in under that

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.210 
know how to do that in under that
quickly<00:02:56.120> I'll<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:56.660> shift<00:02:57.140> click<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.680> this

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
quickly I'll just shift click and this

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.740 
quickly I'll just shift click and this
is<00:02:58.340> something<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.700> actually<00:02:58.970> process<00:02:59.540> it's

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
is something you actually process it's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.380 
is something you actually process it's
literally<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.890> think<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.490> want<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.030> down

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
literally you think I want this down

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.840 
literally you think I want this down
here<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.930> then<00:03:03.080> this<00:03:03.520> part<00:03:04.520> of<00:03:04.640> your<00:03:04.700> brain

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
here and then this part of your brain

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.060 
here and then this part of your brain
just<00:03:05.060> goes<00:03:05.150> alright<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:06.110> got<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.860> then

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
just goes alright I got this and then

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.620 
just goes alright I got this and then
you<00:03:07.100> end<00:03:07.310> up<00:03:07.400> with<00:03:07.460> enough<00:03:07.670> leather<00:03:07.880> pants<00:03:08.330> to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
you end up with enough leather pants to

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.890 
you end up with enough leather pants to
film<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.080> remake<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.530> matrix<00:03:10.750> because<00:03:11.750> our

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
film a remake of the matrix because our

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.960 
film a remake of the matrix because our
brains<00:03:12.170> aren't<00:03:12.440> very<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:13.040> modal<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:13.820> this

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
brains aren't very like modal in this

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.060 
brains aren't very like modal in this
sense<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.870> makes<00:03:15.140> sense<00:03:15.440> for<00:03:17.620> things<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.770> do

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
sense it makes sense for things to do

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.700 
sense it makes sense for things to do
the<00:03:19.310> same<00:03:19.550> thing<00:03:19.940> regardless<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.930> where<00:03:21.530> they

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
the same thing regardless of where they

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.780 
the same thing regardless of where they
occur<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:23.140> shift-clicking<00:03:24.140> should<00:03:24.980> for<00:03:25.700> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
occur so shift-clicking should for the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.730 
occur so shift-clicking should for the
most<00:03:26.000> part<00:03:26.270> always<00:03:26.840> move<00:03:27.050> something<00:03:27.410> from<00:03:27.620> the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
most part always move something from the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.190 
most part always move something from the
top<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.160> bottom<00:03:28.780> how<00:03:29.780> many<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.020> you<00:03:30.110> have

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
top to the bottom how many of you have

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.960 
top to the bottom how many of you have
done<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.890> craft<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.220> nice<00:03:31.370> new<00:03:31.610> set<00:03:31.880> of

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
done this you craft a nice new set of

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.080 
done this you craft a nice new set of
armor<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.600> want<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.810> put<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.050> on<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:34.090> what

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
armor and you want to put it on so what

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.650 
armor and you want to put it on so what
happens<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.600> instead<00:03:35.990> of<00:03:36.290> clicking<00:03:36.830> here

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
happens is instead of clicking here

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.850 
happens is instead of clicking here
picking<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.750> up<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.110> dropping<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.590> in<00:03:39.680> its

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
picking it up and dropping it in its

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.740 
picking it up and dropping it in its
proper<00:03:39.920> location<00:03:40.580> you<00:03:41.060> should<00:03:41.300> click<00:03:41.450> on<00:03:41.600> it

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
proper location you should click on it

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.180 
proper location you should click on it
expecting<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.440> pop<00:03:42.590> up<00:03:42.620> here<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.010> it

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
expecting it to pop up here and it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.770 
expecting it to pop up here and it
doesn't<00:03:43.489> it'll<00:03:43.640> either<00:03:43.820> go<00:03:44.209> into<00:03:44.239> this<00:03:44.480> corner

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
doesn't it'll either go into this corner

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.720 
doesn't it'll either go into this corner
or<00:03:45.080> not<00:03:45.470> go<00:03:45.590> anywhere<00:03:45.860> if<00:03:46.450> your<00:03:47.450> bar<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.380> full

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
or not go anywhere if your bar is full

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.120 
or not go anywhere if your bar is full
what's<00:03:49.730> happening<00:03:50.090> here<00:03:50.239> is<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.660> same<00:03:50.870> thing

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
what's happening here is the same thing

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.100 
what's happening here is the same thing
your<00:03:52.270> muscle-memory<00:03:53.270> sort<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.840> has<00:03:53.959> it

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
your muscle-memory sort of has it

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.350 
your muscle-memory sort of has it
associated<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:54.820> shift<00:03:55.820> clicking<00:03:56.030> moves

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
associated that shift clicking moves

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.920 
associated that shift clicking moves
things<00:03:56.540> from<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.870> top<00:03:57.020> to<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.170> bottom<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:58.930> as

I've<00:04:21.500> also<00:04:21.680> done<00:04:21.859> something<00:04:22.160> similar<00:04:22.280> with

I've also done something similar with

I've also done something similar with

same because shift clicking moves around

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.219

it moves from the top to the bottom not

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
from here to here it just confuses the

from here to here it just confuses the
parts<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:41.960> your<00:04:42.020> brain<00:04:42.199> that<00:04:42.349> really

parts of your brain that really

shouldn't<00:04:43.460> be<00:04:43.669> confused<00:04:45.099> alright<00:04:46.099> so<00:04:46.280> let's

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
shouldn't be confused alright so let's

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.360 
shouldn't be confused alright so let's
think<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.449> solutions<00:04:47.840> how<00:04:48.110> do<00:04:48.169> we<00:04:48.440> keep

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
think of solutions how do we keep

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.820 
think of solutions how do we keep
inventory<00:04:49.759> management<00:04:50.330> consistent<00:04:51.169> while

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
inventory management consistent while

not losing the benefits that shift
clicking<00:04:54.380> provides<00:04:55.660> first<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:57.430> believe<00:04:58.430> that

clicking provides first I believe that
