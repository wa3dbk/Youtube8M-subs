a smooth set but we've got all the
school<00:02:54.960> set<00:02:55.200> images<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.040> there<00:02:56.340> aren't<00:02:56.700> any

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820

new<00:02:57.590> new<00:02:58.590> ninjas<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.220> small<00:02:59.640> sets<00:02:59.940> so

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
new new ninjas in small sets so

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.630 
new new ninjas in small sets so
therefore<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.500> gonna<00:03:01.800> have<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.100> come<00:03:02.250> in

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
therefore it's gonna have to come in

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.810 
therefore it's gonna have to come in
poly<00:03:02.970> bag<00:03:03.240> that's<00:03:04.110> my<00:03:04.410> speculation<00:03:04.820> that's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
poly bag that's my speculation that's

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.150 
poly bag that's my speculation that's
where<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.180> base<00:03:06.510> my<00:03:06.750> evidence<00:03:06.990> from<00:03:07.500> that's

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
where I base my evidence from that's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.860 
where I base my evidence from that's
what<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:08.760> think<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.270> going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.750> happen<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.870> what

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
what I think is going to happen so what

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.710 
what I think is going to happen so what
do<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.200> think<00:03:13.500> about<00:03:13.710> my<00:03:14.010> speculations<00:03:14.720> do

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
do you think about my speculations do

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.960 
do you think about my speculations do
you<00:03:15.900> think<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.440> will<00:03:16.650> be<00:03:16.710> a<00:03:16.890> lego<00:03:17.280> ninja<00:03:17.730> in

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
you think there will be a lego ninja in

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.410 
you think there will be a lego ninja in
2015<00:03:18.870> poly<00:03:19.170> bags<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.770> almost<00:03:20.670> think<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:21.300> a

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
2015 poly bags I almost think it's a

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.190 
2015 poly bags I almost think it's a
no-brainer

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
no-brainer

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.510 
no-brainer
but<00:03:22.410> there<00:03:22.560> will<00:03:22.860> be<00:03:22.890> some<00:03:23.340> poly<00:03:23.550> bags<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.360> just

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
but there will be some poly bags it just

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.610 
but there will be some poly bags it just
it's<00:03:26.520> just<00:03:26.580> screaming<00:03:27.240> at<00:03:27.600> me<00:03:27.780> almost<00:03:28.020> that's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
it's just screaming at me almost that's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.620 
it's just screaming at me almost that's
why<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.800> made<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.100> video<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.760> because<00:03:30.510> that

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
why I made this video and because that

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.590 
why I made this video and because that

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
guy who commented earlier kind of made

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.870 
guy who commented earlier kind of made
me<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:34.170> about<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.160> thought<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:35.730> a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
me think about it and I thought that's a

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.800 
me think about it and I thought that's a
