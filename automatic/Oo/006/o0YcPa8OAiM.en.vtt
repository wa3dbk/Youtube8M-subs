what<00:00:26.580> knocks<00:00:26.820> i<00:00:27.029> seem<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> get<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.480> lot<00:00:27.510> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
what knocks i seem to get a lot of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.859 
what knocks i seem to get a lot of
questions<00:00:28.109> about<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> real

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
questions about that so this is a real

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.170 
questions about that so this is a real
simple<00:00:31.320> really<00:00:31.619> using<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.669> first<00:00:32.969> thing

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
simple really using not the first thing

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.370 
simple really using not the first thing
you<00:00:33.270> start<00:00:33.570> off<00:00:34.460> doing<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.899> folding<00:00:36.899> your<00:00:37.200> line

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
you start off doing is folding your line

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.549 
you start off doing is folding your line
in<00:00:37.559> half<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.950> you're<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> feed

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
in half like so and you're going to feed

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.910 
in half like so and you're going to feed
both<00:00:43.559> those<00:00:43.920> strands<00:00:45.200> through<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> area<00:00:46.770> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
both those strands through the area that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.400 
both those strands through the area that
you<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.399> tie<00:00:48.950> yourself<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.430> bit<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.700> room

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
you want to tie yourself a bit of room

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
you want to tie yourself a bit of room
like<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.620> you're<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:56.420> is

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
like so and then you're going to do is

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.360 
like so and then you're going to do is
tie<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.000> standard<00:01:00.629> rapper<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.500> not

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.630 

just<00:01:05.000> like<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.920> using<00:01:06.920> both<00:01:08.050> strands<00:01:09.640> done

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
just like that using both strands done

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.080 
just like that using both strands done
what<00:01:10.850> I<00:01:10.910> do<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.360> just<00:01:11.570> pull<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:12.970> till<00:01:13.970> it's

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
what I do is I just pull it till it's

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.590 
what I do is I just pull it till it's
semi<00:01:14.480> taught

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.050 

and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.140> plop<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.979> whatever<00:01:20.670> you're<00:01:20.820> tying

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and then plop here whatever you're tying

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.690 
and then plop here whatever you're tying
back<00:01:21.450> through<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> loop<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:23.000> just<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
back through this loop here just like so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.800 
back through this loop here just like so
now<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> tricks<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.750> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
now one of the tricks to this is you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.430 
now one of the tricks to this is you
want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.320> loop<00:01:28.880> up<00:01:29.880> over<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:31.110> tying

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
want to get this loop up over your tying

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.190 
want to get this loop up over your tying
area<00:01:32.540> especially<00:01:33.540> when<00:01:33.930> you're<00:01:34.049> using

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
area especially when you're using

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.190 
area especially when you're using
thicker<00:01:34.649> more<00:01:35.070> stubborn<00:01:35.430> lines<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.690> tends<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
thicker more stubborn lines it tends to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.700 
thicker more stubborn lines it tends to
want<00:01:37.409> catch<00:01:38.159> down<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.289> snagged

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
want catch down here and get all snagged

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.660 
want catch down here and get all snagged
up<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.869> sort<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.289> pull<00:01:44.190> it<00:01:44.310> all<00:01:44.399> through

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
up so I just sort of pull it all through

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.270 
up so I just sort of pull it all through
like<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> keep<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.750> I'll<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.890> give<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
like that keep it up I'll just give it a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.930 
like that keep it up I'll just give it a
tug<00:01:49.640> make<00:01:50.640> sure<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.000> nice<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.210> tight

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.790 

and<00:01:56.360> then<00:01:56.480> you<00:01:56.600> just<00:01:56.750> trim<00:01:57.020> off<00:01:57.170> your<00:01:57.380> excess

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
and then you just trim off your excess

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:08.800 
and then you just trim off your excess
and<00:01:59.290> you<00:02:00.290> are<00:02:00.560> finished

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.649 

there<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.500> go
