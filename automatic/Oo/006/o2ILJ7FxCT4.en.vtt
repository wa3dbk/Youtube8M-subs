00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 moin moin so we have our day 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.850
 reached where I am allowed to hold the seminar 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.440
 a bit prepared earlier today 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.240
 I am also looking forward to any event 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.840
 it also share my experiences 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.550
 to be able to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.799
 Now it's time for breakfast then 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.210
 I always go to the seminar and there I am 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.039
 curious how many people come as 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.720
 the whole, seminars will be over 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.830
 really cool was fun if you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.289
 The Messiah with Helmut are always afraid 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 spoken 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.650
 very modest i hope the journey will be 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.170
 Now this is transferred once 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.770
 you can pretend the same system 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.750
 developed with his own 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.090
 that can mean growing up in fear 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.070
 Much of the system is apple fear 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.390
 that subtle feeling you have one already 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.829
 feel different about things 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.210
 make that decision one 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.010
 Make a decision whether you feel like it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.570
 that she is afraid stands for perseverance 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.160
 again and again the things 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.600
 make me scared and then rather 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.100
 a bit rocket or right or 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.230
 Monday is a New Year's Eve rocket 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.750
 in the air shoots so loud so loud 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.489
 miles away in the radius everyone can see 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.530
 could have done what he was right 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.460
 has made you so afraid that at some point 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.290
 Shooters look over the city and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.200
 the whole sky fireworks and many 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.760
 But they are really afraid of you 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.070
 go for example from life without fear 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.140
 I would have overcome that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.479
 I just spoke that was mine 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.780
 third speed of the game all the time and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.689
 I believe 100 people or something and everything 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.250
 That's what I used to know 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.360
 Anxiety has explained that even more 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.960
 so scared that's what where i am 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.040
 can grow 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.420
 So I just have a great one 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.840
 always corresponds again and again 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.509

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.060

 So definitely not there and there 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.070
 a little bit of Munich I think at some point 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.539
 right 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.020
 I know even more but actually 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.539
 talking about vocation in the profession always find 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.789
 want to be a thing is magnify 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.979
 and it's about motivation itself 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.530
 unfortunately, please be left want and 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.939

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.039

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.850

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.569
 so cool thing maybe still in the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.850
 conclusion noted that something scared 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.510
 then makes you happy because that's what 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.790
 Potential simply has the biggest ones 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.180
 potentials of life become reality 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.590
 to let 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.819
 a reason to celebrate and therefore one 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.269
 especially with a big month 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.330
 Fireworks 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.330
 so it is still a pizza for me 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.470
 What should I say to the rest 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.530
 huge hungry 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.280

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.890
 agrees simon 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.950

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:55.670
