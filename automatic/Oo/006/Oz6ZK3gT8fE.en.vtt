roll of tape to your painting because

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.529 
roll of tape to your painting because
that's<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.870> point<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.440> it<00:01:04.649> may<00:01:05.300> tear<00:01:06.300> the

that's the point that it may tear the
paper<00:01:06.899> this<00:01:07.500> way<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.490> stay<00:01:08.759> on<00:01:09.119> there<00:01:09.450> we

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
paper this way it will stay on there we

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.240 
paper this way it will stay on there we
can<00:01:09.990> move<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.259> up<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:10.800> have<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.009> little

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
can move it up that way have a little

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.779 
can move it up that way have a little
wrinkle<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> won't<00:01:12.030> matter<00:01:13.429> put<00:01:14.429> it<00:01:14.580> down

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
wrinkle and it won't matter put it down

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.680 
wrinkle and it won't matter put it down
on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.569> paper<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.410> like<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:17.940> that's

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
on the paper just like that and that's

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.770 
on the paper just like that and that's
the<00:01:18.929> way<00:01:19.050> you<00:01:19.080> want<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.679> tape<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.190> I<00:01:20.599> take<00:01:21.599> my

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the way you want to tape it I take my

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
artists tape and I peel off whatever

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.479 
artists tape and I peel off whatever
amount<00:01:25.289> I<00:01:25.410> think<00:01:25.440> I'm<00:01:25.800> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.099> need<00:01:26.280> I'm

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:26.489 
amount I think I'm going to need I'm

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:27.800 
amount I think I'm going to need I'm
going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.819> this<00:01:26.970> stretching<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.599> up

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
going to do this stretching right up

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.830 
going to do this stretching right up
through<00:01:27.989> here<00:01:28.319> I<00:01:28.789> have<00:01:29.789> it<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.239> and<00:01:30.450> instead

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
through here I have it here and instead

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.870 
through here I have it here and instead
of<00:01:30.899> putting<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.380> directly<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.069> the<00:01:32.099> paper<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
of putting it directly on the paper and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.359 
of putting it directly on the paper and
then<00:01:33.690> taking<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.110> off<00:01:34.289> I'm<00:01:34.560> actually<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
then taking it off I'm actually going to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.169 
then taking it off I'm actually going to
put<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.759> my<00:01:35.970> shirt<00:01:36.300> just<00:01:36.690> like<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.709> or<00:01:38.179> on

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
put it on my shirt just like that or on

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.180 
put it on my shirt just like that or on
a<00:01:39.209> pent<00:01:39.660> leg<00:01:39.929> or<00:01:40.110> wherever<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.649> that<00:01:40.979> will

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
a pent leg or wherever and that will

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.600 
a pent leg or wherever and that will
take<00:01:41.399> enough<00:01:41.700> tack<00:01:42.060> off<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.050> paper<00:01:43.610> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
take enough tack off of the paper to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.240 
take enough tack off of the paper to
keep<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.119> from<00:01:45.450> tearing<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.530> paper<00:01:46.739> and<00:01:47.099> then

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
keep it from tearing the paper and then

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.430 
keep it from tearing the paper and then
I'm<00:01:47.429> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> place<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.720> tape<00:01:48.929> up<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:49.380> it

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
I'm going to place the tape up here it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.229 
I'm going to place the tape up here it
may<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.770> some<00:01:49.950> wrinkles<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.119> it

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:51.239 
may have some wrinkles in it because it

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:53.479 
may have some wrinkles in it because it
would<00:01:51.330> go<00:01:51.420> along<00:01:51.599> that<00:01:51.840> line<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.250> really

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:53.489 
would go along that line but that really

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:56.270 
would go along that line but that really
won't<00:01:53.759> matter<00:01:54.319> and<00:01:55.319> it<00:01:55.679> will<00:01:55.830> mash<00:01:56.039> it<00:01:56.250> down

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
won't matter and it will mash it down

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.850 
won't matter and it will mash it down
very<00:01:56.759> well<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.569> that<00:01:57.629> little<00:01:58.140> thing<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.590> then
