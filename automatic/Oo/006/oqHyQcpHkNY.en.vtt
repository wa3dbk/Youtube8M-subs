from the MATLAB comm welcome thank you
so<00:00:05.220> much<00:00:05.370> for<00:00:05.549> watching<00:00:05.970> today<00:00:06.660> we're<00:00:06.779> going

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
effect in Photoshop this technique is

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.730 
effect in Photoshop this technique is
really<00:00:11.820> simple<00:00:12.480> really<00:00:12.870> straightforward<00:00:13.559> and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
really simple really straightforward and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740 
really simple really straightforward and
really<00:00:14.009> quick<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.969> it's<00:00:15.179> going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> look

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
really quick and it's going to look

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.130 
really quick and it's going to look
really<00:00:16.230> cool<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:17.070> well<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.420> if<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.630> jump<00:00:18.990> over

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
really cool as well so if we jump over

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.740 
really cool as well so if we jump over
here<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.279> layers<00:00:20.580> palette<00:00:20.939> I'm<00:00:21.539> just

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
here to the layers palette I'm just

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.509 
here to the layers palette I'm just
going<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.960> show<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> two<00:00:22.560> simple<00:00:23.250> curves

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
going to show you the two simple curves

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.980 
going to show you the two simple curves
layers<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.980> off<00:00:26.699> again<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.480> that's<00:00:27.750> our

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
layers on and off again so that's our

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.210 
layers on and off again so that's our
before<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.380> after<00:00:28.590> let<00:00:28.949> me<00:00:29.010> show<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.189> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
before and after let me show you that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.710 
before and after let me show you that
again<00:00:29.429> real<00:00:29.670> quick<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.599> we're

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
again real quick so you know what we're

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.860 
again real quick so you know what we're
doing<00:00:32.630> okay<00:00:33.630> really<00:00:34.110> simple<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.510> start

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
doing okay really simple so we start

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.639 
doing okay really simple so we start
with<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:38.030> curves<00:00:39.030> layer<00:00:39.149> okay<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.170> hit<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
with a curves layer okay so hit this

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.639 
with a curves layer okay so hit this
little<00:00:40.890> half<00:00:41.219> circle<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.379> jump<00:00:43.379> down<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
little half circle and jump down to

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.190 
little half circle and jump down to
curves<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.510> okay<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:45.930> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
curves there okay so we get this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.979 
curves there okay so we get this
crazy-looking<00:00:47.070> panel<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> we're<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:48.780> going

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
crazy-looking panel and we're just going

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.590 
crazy-looking panel and we're just going
to<00:00:49.020> jump<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.789> how<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.239> image<00:00:51.480> is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to jump this up see how that image is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.569 
to jump this up see how that image is
getting<00:00:51.899> bright<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.829> specifically

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
getting bright and now that specifically

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.560 
getting bright and now that specifically
is<00:00:53.730> actually<00:00:54.000> getting<00:00:54.180> brighter<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
is actually getting brighter in the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.200 
is actually getting brighter in the
shadows<00:00:54.989> only<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.789> we're<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> drag

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
shadows only and now we're going to drag

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.000 
shadows only and now we're going to drag
this<00:00:57.480> corner<00:00:57.930> down<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> getting

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
this corner down this is getting

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.790 
this corner down this is getting
slightly<00:00:59.430> darker<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> highlights

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
slightly darker but in the highlights

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.429 
slightly darker but in the highlights

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
only all right I'm gonna put a little

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.320 
only all right I'm gonna put a little
contrast<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.280> here<00:01:05.549> don't<00:01:05.909> worry<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
contrast in here don't worry if you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.700 
contrast in here don't worry if you
don't<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.840> doing<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.470> have

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
looking good all right now I personally

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.179 
looking good all right now I personally
would<00:01:22.619> leave<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:24.049> okay<00:01:25.049> that's<00:01:25.770> my

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
would leave it there okay that's my

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.320 
would leave it there okay that's my
preference<00:01:26.490> because<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.180> going

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
preference because I don't like going

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.740 
preference because I don't like going
over<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> top<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.290> stuff<00:01:29.240> but<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.509> know

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
over the top with this stuff but I know

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.990 
over the top with this stuff but I know
some<00:01:30.930> people<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.740> little<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.610> than<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
some people like a little more than that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
some people like a little more than that
which<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.110> fine<00:01:34.409> because<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.920> their

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
which is fine because it's like their

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190 
which is fine because it's like their
style<00:01:35.400> whatever<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.600> we've<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> curves

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
style whatever so we've got the curves

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.340 
style whatever so we've got the curves
again<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.000> time<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:39.990> simple

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
again and this time just really simple

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.760 
again and this time just really simple
just<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> little<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:42.450> shadows<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
just a little more on the shadows and a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.480 
just a little more on the shadows and a
little<00:01:44.070> more<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.820> highlights<00:01:46.280> I've<00:01:47.280> got

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
little more on the highlights I've got

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.090 
little more on the highlights I've got
my<00:01:47.670> nice<00:01:47.909> bit<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> fade<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:49.229> that's<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:50.070> I
