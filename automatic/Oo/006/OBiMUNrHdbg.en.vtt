00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.450
 today we are going to learn to do what 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.069
 are the little flowers for filling 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.530
 any floral arrangement that we have 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.719
 prepared paste paste which helps 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.750
 occupy all the spaces that we have left 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.140
 and so do not have to resort to another type 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.050
 of elaboration then let's start 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.950
 first let's take a piece of dough 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.580
 of about a ball of about 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.200
 two centimeters in diameter we are going to 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.929
 knead with electric that told them 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.850
 at the beginning which would be quite 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:37.609
 good always have available for 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.019
 make this type of pastry and arrangements 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.640
 floral and we are going to knead well for 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.920
 avoid all kinds of wrinkles 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.039
 it is mainly the function of the crisco 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.020
 avoid wrinkles and at the same time make us 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.060
 the very manipulable dough 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.710
 let's take a ball of about two 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.710
 centimeters in diameter 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.890
 from here we are going to smooth in the part 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 lateral so that it remains as a form of 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.880
 pear 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.670
 let's take from the thickest part and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.790
 let's go crushing 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.890
 so that the surface is finite 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.200
 And power 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.170
 that of a reality that is a flower 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.100
 pretty natural 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.100
 we are making progress 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.730
 and we will place it 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.950
 on the table we take the cutter 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.870
 we tweeted a little bit the top 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:42.420
 so that it fits without problems 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.420
 we perform the cut we take out the excess 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.510
 and with this flower that remains here what 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.900
 what we are going to do is fine-tune the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.050
 we start from the center we move and 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.660
 always supporting the fingertip 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.370
 be very careful not to be afraid of 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.810
 press because the mass that is the 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.170
 characteristic that has the mass of 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.970
 paste paste that is quite elastic and is 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.240
 very difficult to break apart 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.420
 of the fondant 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.220
 once we have the flower open 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.220
 We are going to place it in the sponge 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.980
 and we go with the bolillo 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.980
 to fine tune the entire edge he cited 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.840
 and we will leave it 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.180
 aside to prepare what is 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.209
 the pistils we are going to catch a wire 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.799
 let's take a little spin in the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.220
 part of above so that it remains with a 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.840
 kind of crochet 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.720
 taking care not to close it 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.230
 completely so that we fit a couple 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.230
 of beeps 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.010
 and we close 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.230
 [Music] 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.069
 with the same with the same tool 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.069
 that we had 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.730
 we press there so that the 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.569
 pistil let's go through the part 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.569
 central flower 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:28.350
 and let's chafe smoothly smoothing or 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.350
 refining the bottom part of the flower 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.420
 to give a more natural movement to 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:39.060
 the flower we can touch again 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.060
 but now this time in 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.940
 simply a very smooth movement 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.750
 and there we would have our first flower 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.000
 as you see here we have different types 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.320
 of cutters one a little bit bigger one 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.600
 a little smaller 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.260
 which can be perfectly a game 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.060
 quite interesting and very good for 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.430
 be able to occupy all the spaces that 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.340
 commented that we can cover in the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:17.230
 gum paste flower arrangements 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.860
