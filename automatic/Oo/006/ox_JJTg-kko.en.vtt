the<00:00:09.389> architecture<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.019> first<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.800> derived

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the architecture of first is derived

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.810 
the architecture of first is derived
from<00:00:11.730> ideas<00:00:12.269> about<00:00:12.620> Street<00:00:13.620> activity<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.610> it's

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
from ideas about Street activity so it's

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.420 
from ideas about Street activity so it's
it's<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.240> wrapping<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.870> site<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:17.039> create

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
it's a wrapping of the site to create

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.029 
it's a wrapping of the site to create
this<00:00:17.640> ground<00:00:18.270> scale<00:00:19.039> pedestrian-friendly

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
this ground scale pedestrian-friendly

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.460 
this ground scale pedestrian-friendly
domain<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.939> then<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> point<00:00:21.779> tower<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.289> take

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
domain and then a point tower to take

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.320 
domain and then a point tower to take
advantage<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.130> all<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.490> views<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:24.180> a
