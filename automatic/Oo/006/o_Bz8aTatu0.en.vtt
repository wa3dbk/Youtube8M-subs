00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.650
 weeks that I had not been able to 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.260

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.600

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.940
 Today's recipe is a little chicken 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.079
 with chicken strips that if I stay like that 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.640
 like white people because I put it 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.850
 defrost in the micro winds well 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.850
 it was tomato gourds 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.320
 onion the tomatoes can 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.550
 substitute for peppers or that I in this 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.700
 case I do not have peppers but bag 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.400
 tomato and onion can use it 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.170
 I will make it white because it is 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.980
 the one that buys and has a source 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.309
 has is a purple onion is a high 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.160
 source of senses sense but if 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.620
 you want the white does not matter 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.620
 then we will use for the oil in 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.250
 aerosol 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:20.170
 pineapple is also important pineapple 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.260
 our garlic powder 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.500
 Pepper 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.180
 not now 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 and our salt 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.610
 obviously we are going exactly our 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.610
 sticks for skewers that are 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.570
 saved 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.270
 as here to sweep them and in this part 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.820
 They are so pointy when it's more 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.130
 that an auditor tea are flat 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.620
 but they have like at the moment of being 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.470
 planes help us insert things and 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.820
 there are ones that are very sharp and that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.210
 it's like I do not recommend them because you 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.920
 can you hurt yourself 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.320
 the moment of trade at the moment of 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.900
 manipulate are the implants these the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.189
 possible operatives 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.359
 [Music] 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.960
 very well we are going to start by chopping in 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:13.680
 cubes the onion the tomato 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.810
 the pumpkins the pineapple and the chicken are going to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.260
 do a little magic all are 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.090
 lists are already chopped and perfect as 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.830
 can see 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.480
 they are in large cubes to chop the onion 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.069
 complete the slices they leave to the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.220
 half and they are starting those that are 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.890
 same 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.860
 we start the calabash of matches and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.890
 sliced ​​and very thick 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.120
 is the tomato form if they want the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.510
 pepper equal neither of the two with 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.510
 seeds 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.440
 the chicken 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.440
 and the skin 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.390
 all ready 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.280
 the first thing I'm going to put is onion 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.360
 because it will give us coke 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:17.120
 so that they do not leave confirm them 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.120
 and then pineapple I like 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.970
 and I always like to put just 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.840
 the pineapples 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.840
 the fire 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.629
 and let's start again 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.629

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.249
 here we are going to accommodate the skewers in 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.679
 our tray 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.829
 it's a bit slow but it's 

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:47.560
 perfectly indicates this then let's 

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:52.070
 to put in our tray 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.970
 and we're going to start watering them with them 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.970
 the bass 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.460
 with functions 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.490
 and the oregano 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.540
 5 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.920

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:15.320
 how is skewered and served one 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:18.440
