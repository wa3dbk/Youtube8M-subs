okay now we want to mobilize the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.839 
okay now we want to mobilize the
mechanoreceptors<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:14.040> joint<00:00:14.280> capsules

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
mechanoreceptors in the joint capsules

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.609 
mechanoreceptors in the joint capsules
we<00:00:15.000> want<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.299> create<00:00:15.450> some<00:00:15.809> joint<00:00:16.080> play<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
we want to create some joint play in the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.000 
we want to create some joint play in the
joint<00:00:16.920> capsules<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.420> do<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.900> by<00:00:19.439> side

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
joint capsules we can do that by side

bending<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.730> take<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.330> thumb<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.990> run<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.650> along

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
bending I take my thumb I run it along

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.189 
bending I take my thumb I run it along
the<00:00:23.220> spine<00:00:23.550> bodies<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> spinous<00:00:24.660> process

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the spine bodies of the spinous process

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.769 
the spine bodies of the spinous process
with<00:00:25.500> my<00:00:25.650> flat<00:00:25.949> thumb<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:27.090> both

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
with my flat thumb like this on both

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.450 
with my flat thumb like this on both
sides<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.500> then<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:30.000> i<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.630> i<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:32.279> your

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
sides and then what i do is i if your

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.610 
sides and then what i do is i if your
side<00:00:32.730> bending<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.300> side<00:00:33.600> bend<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.380> push

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
side bending you side bend and you push

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.000 
side bending you side bend and you push
on<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.489> your<00:00:35.670> thumb<00:00:36.230> like<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.500> when

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
on the with your thumb like that when

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.470 
on the with your thumb like that when
you<00:00:38.100> slide<00:00:38.340> bend<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> left<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.300> go

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you slide bend to the left when you go

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.510 
you slide bend to the left when you go
to<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.690> right<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.899> push<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.559> right<00:00:40.800> left

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.330 
to the right you push to the right left
right<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:43.110> you've<00:00:43.260> got<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> fulcrum<00:00:43.980> right

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

have<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.609> dig<00:01:00.059> all<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> way<00:01:00.449> down<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.960> t1<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.829> far

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
have I dig all the way down to t1 as far

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.000 
have I dig all the way down to t1 as far
as<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:03.059> down<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.780> pushing<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.769> far

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
as I can go down in there pushing as far

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.070 
as I can go down in there pushing as far
as<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.309> go<00:01:05.549> down<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.090> side<00:01:06.630> bending

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
as I can go down in there side bending

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.620 
as I can go down in there side bending
then<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.920> translate<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.360> harder

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
then I translate this is a little harder

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.120 
then I translate this is a little harder
to<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.140> can't<00:01:10.409> translate<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
to do if you can't translate if you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.679 
to do if you can't translate if you
can't<00:01:11.340> pick<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.580> head<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.240> translate

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
can't pick the head up and translate

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.090 
can't pick the head up and translate
sometimes<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.260> put<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> pillow<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
sometimes you can put it on a pillow and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
sometimes you can put it on a pillow and
it's<00:01:14.250> easier<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.720> want<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> be

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it's easier because you don't want to be

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.050 
it's easier because you don't want to be
carrying<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> weight<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.710> their<00:01:17.520> head<00:01:17.759> around

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
carrying the weight of their head around

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.399 
carrying the weight of their head around
and<00:01:18.979> causing<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.270> structural<00:01:21.270> problems<00:01:22.020> but

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and causing you structural problems but

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.230 
and causing you structural problems but
translation<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.159> wonderful<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> totally

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
translation is wonderful it's a totally

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.969 
translation is wonderful it's a totally
different<00:01:24.270> thing<00:01:24.570> than<00:01:24.750> side<00:01:25.170> bending<00:01:25.530> side

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
different thing than side bending side

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.160 
different thing than side bending side
bending<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.880> translation<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> you're

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
bending is this translation is you're

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.660 
bending is this translation is you're
keeping<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.650> head<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> same<00:01:29.369> plane

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
keeping the head in the same plane

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
keeping the head in the same plane
notice<00:01:30.060> his<00:01:30.240> head<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> staying<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.049> same

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
notice his head is staying in the same

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
notice his head is staying in the same
plane<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:31.950> still<00:01:32.369> pushing<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
plane I'm still pushing on the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.910

spinous processes going that direction
and<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.829> bad<00:01:38.009> direction<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.939> I'm

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and going bad direction but I'm

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.719 
and going bad direction but I'm
translating<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:40.049> side<00:01:40.350> bending<00:01:40.740> there's

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
translating I'm not side bending there's

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.350 
translating I'm not side bending there's
a<00:01:41.850> difference<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.479> big<00:01:43.140> difference<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
a difference a big difference and

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.319 
a difference a big difference and
translation<00:01:45.360> helps<00:01:45.899> loosen<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.520> joint

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
translation helps loosen the joint

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.870 
translation helps loosen the joint
capsules<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:50.930> helps<00:01:51.930> loosen<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.880> spinal
