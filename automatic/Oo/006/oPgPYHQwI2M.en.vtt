times<00:01:55.770> should<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.100> repeat<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.579> pattern<00:01:58.159> three

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
times should I repeat the pattern three

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.670 
times should I repeat the pattern three
every<00:02:00.840> point<00:02:02.840> okay<00:02:03.840> maybe<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.229> need<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> do

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
every point okay maybe we need to do

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.160 
every point okay maybe we need to do
replay<00:02:05.100> while<00:02:05.369> we're<00:02:05.520> doing<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.990> let's<00:02:06.990> try<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
replay while we're doing it let's try to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.960 
replay while we're doing it let's try to
can<00:02:07.439> record<00:02:08.119> well<00:02:09.119> let's<00:02:10.020> go<00:02:10.319> here<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.730> it's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
can record well let's go here so it's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.080 
can record well let's go here so it's
and<00:02:12.980> then<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.470> then<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.760> want

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
and then here and then here so we want

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.700 
and then here and then here so we want
that<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.590> then<00:02:19.740> we<00:02:19.860> type<00:02:20.070> replay<00:02:21.560> eat<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
that and then we type replay eat the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.330 
that and then we type replay eat the
pattern<00:02:23.100> five<00:02:23.880> times<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.980> don't<00:02:25.980> think<00:02:26.160> they

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
pattern five times I don't think they

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.120 
pattern five times I don't think they
replay<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.720> replay<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.440> record<00:02:28.950> thing

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
replay the replay and record thing

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.220 
replay the replay and record thing
doesn't<00:02:29.490> really<00:02:29.580> work<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:29.930> yeah<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.200> only

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
doesn't really work so yeah but the only

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.380 
doesn't really work so yeah but the only
main<00:02:31.650> feature<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.070> dig<00:02:32.520> which<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:32.970> pretty<00:02:33.150> cool

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
main feature is dig which is pretty cool

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.430 
main feature is dig which is pretty cool
so<00:02:33.660> shred<00:02:34.560> dig<00:02:34.800> again<00:02:35.100> ding<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.970> he<00:02:36.450> canna<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
so shred dig again ding and he canna and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.700 
so shred dig again ding and he canna and
he<00:02:37.590> need<00:02:37.770> he<00:02:38.220> can't<00:02:38.400> dig<00:02:38.610> him<00:02:38.870> he<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:40.050> dig<00:02:40.290> all

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710
