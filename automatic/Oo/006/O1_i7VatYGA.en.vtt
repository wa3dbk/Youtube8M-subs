unique<00:02:00.710> things<00:02:00.740> about<00:02:01.040> this<00:02:01.340> shot<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.820> that

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
unique things about this shot is that

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.400 
unique things about this shot is that
you<00:02:02.119> start<00:02:02.390> out<00:02:02.509> with<00:02:02.540> your<00:02:02.869> wrist<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.320> the

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
you start out with your wrist on the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.980 
you start out with your wrist on the
handle<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:05.000> important<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.479> have<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.690> solid

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
handle it's important to have a solid

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.919 
handle it's important to have a solid
pin<00:02:06.440> so<00:02:06.680> you<00:02:06.710> don't<00:02:06.979> lose<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.340> ball<00:02:07.750> make<00:02:08.750> sure

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
pin so you don't lose the ball make sure

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.600 
pin so you don't lose the ball make sure
you're<00:02:09.140> applying<00:02:09.259> some<00:02:09.830> downwards<00:02:10.250> pressure

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
you're applying some downwards pressure

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.940 
you're applying some downwards pressure
with<00:02:10.910> your<00:02:11.090> wrist<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:12.500> will<00:02:12.650> give<00:02:12.830> you

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
with your wrist and this will give you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.120 
with your wrist and this will give you
more<00:02:13.100> control<00:02:13.459> when<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.450> shoot<00:02:15.010> once<00:02:16.010> you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
more control when you shoot once you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.460 
more control when you shoot once you
have<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> ball<00:02:16.520> set<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:16.940> rock<00:02:17.480> back<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:17.959> forth

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
have the ball set up rock back and forth

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.880 
have the ball set up rock back and forth
and<00:02:18.709> then<00:02:19.610> pick<00:02:19.910> your<00:02:19.940> shot<00:02:20.800> notice<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
and then pick your shot notice the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.590 
and then pick your shot notice the
technique<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.430> use<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.970> square<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.360> shot

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
technique that I use to square the shot

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.830 
technique that I use to square the shot
at<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.470> point<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.830> impact<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:26.120> rod<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.600> going

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
at the point of impact the rod is going

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.110 
at the point of impact the rod is going
to<00:02:26.900> move<00:02:27.170> in<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.530> opposite<00:02:27.950> direction<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
to move in the opposite direction of the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.820 
to move in the opposite direction of the
site<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.690> where<00:02:29.989> I'm<00:02:30.110> shooting<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:36.650> first

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
site of where I'm shooting the first

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.890 
site of where I'm shooting the first
option<00:02:37.220> for<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.519> shot<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.239> straight<00:02:38.570> and

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
option for this shot is the straight and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.330 
option for this shot is the straight and
make<00:02:39.110> sure<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.440> rock<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.830> ball<00:02:39.950> back<00:02:40.160> and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
make sure you rock the ball back and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.220 
make sure you rock the ball back and
forth<00:02:40.430> even<00:02:41.390> if<00:02:41.690> you're<00:02:41.840> going<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.049> go

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
forth even if you're going to go

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.810 
forth even if you're going to go
straight<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.769> this<00:02:43.040> way<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.280> won't<00:02:43.549> have<00:02:43.700> a

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
straight and this way you won't have a

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.229 
straight and this way you won't have a
towel<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:46.040> next<00:02:46.310> option<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.850> push<00:02:47.060> side

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
towel the next option is the push side

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.150 
towel the next option is the push side
which<00:02:47.570> is<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.750> side<00:02:48.049> that's<00:02:48.320> farther<00:02:48.980> away

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
which is the side that's farther away

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.970 
which is the side that's farther away
from<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.060> again<00:02:51.019> notice<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.560> recoil

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
from you and again notice the recoil

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.400 
from you and again notice the recoil
motion<00:02:52.489> once<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.060> shoot<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.420> shot<00:02:53.660> which

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
motion once I shoot the shot which

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.000 
motion once I shoot the shot which
causes<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.010> ball<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.190> go<00:02:55.430> straight<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:57.769> next

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
causes the ball to go straight the next

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.039 
causes the ball to go straight the next
option<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.489> pull<00:02:58.820> side<00:02:59.060> which<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.810> the

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
option is the pull side which is the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.100 
option is the pull side which is the
side<00:03:00.410> that's<00:03:00.950> closest<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.110> again

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
side that's closest to you and again

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.870 
side that's closest to you and again
notice<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.470> recoil<00:03:03.950> motion<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.519> square<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
notice the recoil motion to square the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.530 
notice the recoil motion to square the
shot<00:03:05.890> here's<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:07.010> few<00:03:07.280> real-time<00:03:07.760> examples<00:03:07.940> on

how I shoot the shot you'll notice some

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.990 
how I shoot the shot you'll notice some
fakes<00:03:11.630> here<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.110> there<00:03:12.670> also<00:03:13.670> once<00:03:13.850> you

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
fakes here and there also once you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.940 
fakes here and there also once you
become<00:03:14.360> more<00:03:14.570> advanced<00:03:15.230> you'll<00:03:15.590> want<00:03:15.860> to

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
become more advanced you'll want to

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.310 
become more advanced you'll want to
start<00:03:16.160> shooting<00:03:16.370> inside<00:03:16.970> holes<00:03:17.299> which<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.140> did

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
start shooting inside holes which I did

on<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> push<00:03:27.360> side<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.810> then<00:03:28.020> explode<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
on the push side and then explode to the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.220 
on the push side and then explode to the
push<00:03:28.860> side<00:03:31.760> as<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.910> start<00:03:33.150> playing<00:03:33.390> more<00:03:34.080> and

more<00:03:34.380> people<00:03:34.710> you're<00:03:34.890> gonna<00:03:35.010> see<00:03:35.310> that

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
more people you're gonna see that

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.820 
more people you're gonna see that
there's<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.730> lot<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.090> different<00:03:36.390> styles<00:03:36.830> for

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
there's a lot of different styles for

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.350 
there's a lot of different styles for
example<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:38.280> more<00:03:38.430> advanced<00:03:38.760> way<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.150> shooting

example a more advanced way of shooting
the<00:03:39.660> rollover<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.290> by<00:03:40.530> walking<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.790> so

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
the rollover is by walking it and so

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.270 
the rollover is by walking it and so
this<00:03:42.510> takes<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.840> lot<00:03:42.960> of<00:03:42.990> practice<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.770> be<00:03:44.190> able

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
this takes a lot of practice to be able

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.860 
this takes a lot of practice to be able
to<00:03:44.430> get<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:44.790> type<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.000> control<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:45.720> it's

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
to get this type of control but it's

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.570 
to get this type of control but it's
really<00:03:46.250> effective

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
really effective

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.910 
really effective
some<00:03:48.420> people<00:03:48.690> will<00:03:48.840> shoot<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.350> roll<00:03:49.740> over

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
some people will shoot the roll over

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.480 
some people will shoot the roll over
from<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:50.970> standstill<00:03:51.800> which<00:03:52.800> is<00:03:52.950> also<00:03:53.250> hard<00:03:53.460> to

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
from a standstill which is also hard to

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.480 
from a standstill which is also hard to
do<00:03:53.720> I've<00:03:54.720> also<00:03:54.960> seen<00:03:55.260> some<00:03:55.530> people<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.130> will

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
do I've also seen some people that will
