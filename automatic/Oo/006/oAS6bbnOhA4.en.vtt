00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
he's very good at pvp so I think this

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.540 
he's very good at pvp so I think this
would<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.810> really<00:00:19.170> good<00:00:19.410> matchup<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.189> it'll

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
would be a really good matchup and it'll

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.400 
would be a really good matchup and it'll
be<00:00:20.640> very<00:00:20.850> interesting<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.630> who<00:00:21.779> wins<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
be very interesting to see who wins and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:02:19.170 
be very interesting to see who wins and
so<00:00:22.920> without<00:00:23.100> further<00:00:23.279> ado<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.900> go
