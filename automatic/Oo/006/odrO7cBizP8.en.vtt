 hello everyone how are today good today 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.299
 let's make a video a little bit 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.830
 different a little bit not very different what 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.200
 that we were seeing habitually in my 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.480
 channel because some of the girls have 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.099
 come asking for cooking videos with the 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.039
 order to lower a bit the topics of the 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.740
 channel and that this form reaches the public 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.960
 and there are people who want to watch videos 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.120
 as of varied and diverse topics 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.239
 things then what are we going to do today 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.640
 They are three sauces for different types of 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.230
 pasta I long I'm not very expert in the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.080
 cook but I love food 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.879
 Italian then be done as some 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.040
 sauces for pasta that are what they 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.530
 I'm going to teach salsa today 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.409
 Neapolitan the other is pesto sauce and the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.699
 another is carbonara sauce a clear 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.739
 small society that I want to make them 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.019
 before we start is that the pasta 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.019
 carbonara in your original recipe is made 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.879
 with bacon or with bacon in this video 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.500
 I'm going to do it with ham to make the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.690
 recipe a little healthier because 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.260
 this does not have a lot of fat 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.180
 in this type of videos if you liked the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.860
 recipe or you think it was rich and what 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.900
 they wanted to try then I hope that 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.030
 Put me little fingers up and tell me 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.310
 How did you like the video and how did you 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.500
 was the recipe and especially if they want 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.720
 that we continue or not trying this type 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.720
 of topics on the channel and now if 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.580
 let's start 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.110
 we started cooking pasta in water 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.110
 boiling for 10 minutes 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.090
 for the pesto sauce we're going to need 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.090
 Basil leaves 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.579
 Salt 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.799
 garlic cloves olive oil and nuts 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.100
 let's start by putting in a 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.880
 blender garlic cloves the leaves 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.880
 of basil 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.030
 the nuts 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.349
 olive oil 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.220
 and a little salt 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.450
 we will liquefy all this until 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.450
 let's have a thick mixture 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.930
 let's put them in a container and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.230
 then we mix it with some cheese 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.230
 Parmesan 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.209
 until we have something like this 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.730
 Y 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.760
 for the Neapolitan pastries we are going to 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.700
 need parmesan cream milk 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.430
 garlic cloves olive oil leaflets 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.650
 of basil and crushed tomatoes that 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.989
 we will achieve by entering in water 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.780
 boiling the tomatoes that we go to 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.090
 need and after they are a while 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.769
 in the boiling water let's start 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.049
 see how the skin is coming off 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.360
 little by little this way is going to be very 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.050
 easy to remove the skin and start 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.300
 crush the 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.890
 let's also remove the little hard button 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.310
 that they have in half 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.380
 we break them into very small pieces and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.220
 then we put them in a pan with 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.220
 olive oil 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.180
 when it is boiling add salt to 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.180
 taste 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.550
 and a little sugar to hide the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:52.010
 acid taste of tomatoes 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.010
 then we are going to pour the cream of milk 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.710
 and finally the basil leaves 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.710
 cut into pieces 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.480
 for carbonara pasta we are going to 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.060
 need cream ham diced 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.979
 milk parmesan cheese garlic cloves and 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.350
 eggs let's start then 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.449
 splitting the ham into small squares 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.190
 and then we're going to put them to sautÃ© in 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.190
 a pan with olive oil 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.460
 apart let's make a milk mixture 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.100
 with flour to prepare a sauce 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.870
 bechamel that we are going to pour it into 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.610
 pan where we are suffering the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.439
 pieces of ham 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.909
 let's continue stirring and 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:47.909
 we also add salt to taste 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.700
 while we stir we are going to add the 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.700
 cream of milk 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.319
 when we take the pasta out of the water 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:07.089
 let's stir them a whole egg 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:07.089
 both the yolk and the clear 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.310
 and this is the final result of our 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.860
 Sauces do not forget that the sauce 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.650
 carbonara should be put to pasta 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.390
 that they have mixed the egg 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.820
 forget to accompany your pasta with 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.890
 bits of bread and put the final touch 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.840
 which is the parmesan cheese I hope that 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.740
 put fingers up and subscribe 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.740
