needed to service this process started I

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.000 
needed to service this process started I
think<00:00:52.210> maybe<00:00:52.570> three<00:00:52.960> principals<00:00:53.469> ago<00:00:53.680> back

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
think maybe three principals ago back

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.420 
think maybe three principals ago back
and<00:00:54.250> maybe<00:00:55.350> 2004-2005<00:00:56.379> is<00:00:56.680> when<00:00:57.039> I<00:00:57.070> believe

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
and maybe 2004-2005 is when I believe

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.340 
and maybe 2004-2005 is when I believe

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.289 
so when someone comes into the school or
if<00:01:53.710> they're<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.040> one<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.490> side<00:01:54.729> hallways

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
if they're in one of the side hallways

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.450 
if they're in one of the side hallways
or<00:01:55.570> in<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:55.840> library<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.619> have<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.920> ability<00:01:57.250> to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
or in a library you have this ability to

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.789 
or in a library you have this ability to
look<00:01:57.700> out<00:01:57.909> into<00:01:58.090> this<00:01:58.299> green<00:01:58.719> space<00:01:59.079> and<00:01:59.560> I

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
look out into this green space and I

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.920 
look out into this green space and I
think<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.159> creates<00:02:00.310> distance<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:01.210> calm<00:02:01.540> of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
think it creates distance of calm of

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.100 
think it creates distance of calm of
openness<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.100> really<00:02:03.670> adds<00:02:04.060> something<00:02:04.719> to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
openness that really adds something to

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.649 
openness that really adds something to
the<00:02:05.380> entire<00:02:05.770> building<00:02:06.399> Ron<00:02:07.090> Rock<00:02:07.240> High<00:02:07.420> School

summer moving over to the $1,200

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.809 
summer moving over to the $1,200
but<00:02:11.660> in<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.379> tradition<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:13.010> not<00:02:13.250> stepping<00:02:13.550> on

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
but in the tradition of not stepping on

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.759 
but in the tradition of not stepping on
the<00:02:13.940> entryway<00:02:14.209> tile<00:02:14.569> dragon<00:02:15.050> move<00:02:15.410> over<00:02:15.650> here
