00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.000 
help to get to the top of the apple tree
here<00:00:34.790> comes<00:00:34.970> the<00:00:35.090> auto<00:00:35.239> transporter<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:35.900> help

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:48.700 

let's<00:00:40.010> see<00:00:40.220> we<00:00:41.150> can<00:00:41.270> build<00:00:41.449> a<00:00:41.510> spaceship<00:00:41.960> or<00:00:47.710> a

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
let's see we can build a spaceship or a

00:00:48.710 --> 00:01:00.580 
let's see we can build a spaceship or a
teleporter<00:00:54.160> or<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.879> super-powered<00:00:56.600> mech<00:00:59.590> the

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
teleporter or a super-powered mech the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.139 
teleporter or a super-powered mech the
best<00:01:00.800> solutions<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.219> a<00:01:01.340> problem<00:01:01.399> are<00:01:01.850> often

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
best solutions to a problem are often

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.940 
best solutions to a problem are often
the<00:01:02.210> simplest<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.140> get<00:01:03.230> to<00:01:03.290> those<00:01:03.500> apples

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
the simplest so to get to those apples

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.160 
the simplest so to get to those apples
let's<00:01:04.220> build<00:01:04.399> a<00:01:04.460> cherry<00:01:04.670> picker<00:01:04.960> now<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.110> we

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
let's build a cherry picker now that we

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.540 
let's build a cherry picker now that we
have<00:01:06.259> an<00:01:06.350> idea<00:01:06.619> of<00:01:06.740> what<00:01:06.890> will<00:01:07.009> work<00:01:07.160> let's

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
have an idea of what will work let's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.300 
have an idea of what will work let's
figure<00:01:07.700> out<00:01:07.940> how<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.149> build<00:01:08.360> it<00:01:08.979> so<00:01:09.979> I<00:01:10.009> decided

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
figure out how to build it so I decided

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.070 
figure out how to build it so I decided
to<00:01:10.399> go<00:01:10.580> with<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.970> cherry<00:01:11.270> picker<00:01:11.479> because<00:01:11.840> I

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
to go with the cherry picker because I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.900 
to go with the cherry picker because I
wanted<00:01:12.560> something<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.009> could<00:01:13.160> be<00:01:13.369> fun<00:01:13.640> and

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
wanted something that could be fun and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.940 
wanted something that could be fun and
interesting<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.810> thought<00:01:15.320> with<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.530> parts

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
interesting I thought with the parts

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.410 
interesting I thought with the parts
that<00:01:16.039> I<00:01:16.160> had<00:01:16.369> in<00:01:16.520> these<00:01:16.640> two<00:01:16.850> sets<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.270> could

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
that I had in these two sets I could

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.180 
that I had in these two sets I could
make<00:01:17.570> something<00:01:17.840> very<00:01:18.020> unique<00:01:18.649> and<00:01:19.039> colorful

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
make something very unique and colorful

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.120 
make something very unique and colorful
and<00:01:20.060> very<00:01:20.300> exciting<00:01:20.720> at<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.840> same<00:01:20.930> time<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
and very exciting at the same time the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.620 
and very exciting at the same time the
biggest<00:01:22.369> challenge<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:22.759> faced<00:01:23.030> when<00:01:23.300> building

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
biggest challenge I faced when building

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.300 
biggest challenge I faced when building
this<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.289> I<00:01:24.320> wanted<00:01:24.649> it<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.860> function

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
this is that I wanted it to function

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.609 
this is that I wanted it to function
since<00:01:26.270> it's<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.479> cherry<00:01:26.690> picker<00:01:26.869> it<00:01:27.170> needed

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
since it's a cherry picker it needed

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.830 
since it's a cherry picker it needed
some<00:01:27.830> sort<00:01:28.039> of<00:01:28.220> apparatus<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.330> back<00:01:29.540> that

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
some sort of apparatus on the back that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.539 
some sort of apparatus on the back that
could<00:01:29.960> actually<00:01:30.110> function<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.340> went<00:01:31.520> to

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
could actually function so I went to

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.520 
could actually function so I went to
work<00:01:31.670> designing<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:32.479> kind<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.049> system<00:01:33.439> of

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
work designing this kind of system of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.179 
work designing this kind of system of
arms<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.340> really<00:01:35.330> wanted<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.810> arms<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.530> move

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
arms I really wanted the arms to move

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.760 
arms I really wanted the arms to move
similar<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.060> real<00:01:38.450> cherry<00:01:38.930> picker<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.740> I

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
similar to a real cherry picker so I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.429 
similar to a real cherry picker so I
actually<00:01:39.979> added<00:01:40.340> this<00:01:40.580> complex<00:01:41.299> pivot<00:01:42.080> system

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
actually added this complex pivot system

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.350 
actually added this complex pivot system
down<00:01:42.619> here<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:43.549> no<00:01:43.640> matter<00:01:43.790> which<00:01:44.000> way<00:01:44.299> you

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
down here so no matter which way you

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.289 
down here so no matter which way you
angle<00:01:45.080> it<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:46.040> minifigure<00:01:46.520> will<00:01:46.729> always<00:01:47.030> stay

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
angle it the minifigure will always stay

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.630 
angle it the minifigure will always stay
upright<00:01:47.689> in<00:01:48.530> addition<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.189> function<00:01:49.520> of

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
upright in addition to the function of

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.280 
upright in addition to the function of
the<00:01:49.729> basket<00:01:50.150> I<00:01:50.180> also<00:01:50.450> wanted<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.930> car<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.200> be

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
the basket I also wanted the car to be

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.320 
the basket I also wanted the car to be
fun<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.860> used<00:01:52.040> a<00:01:52.280> lot<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.460> different<00:01:52.790> colors<00:01:53.090> and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
fun I used a lot of different colors and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.749 
fun I used a lot of different colors and
shapes<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.900> textures<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:55.159> try<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.369> create

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
shapes and textures to try to create

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.929 
shapes and textures to try to create
just<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.119> very<00:01:56.409> exciting<00:01:57.409> car<00:01:57.680> my<00:01:58.520> family's

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
just a very exciting car my family's

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.390 
just a very exciting car my family's
really<00:01:59.180> neat<00:01:59.509> sideways<00:02:00.170> building<00:02:00.590> pieces<00:02:00.979> and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
really neat sideways building pieces and

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.780 
really neat sideways building pieces and
I<00:02:02.210> used<00:02:02.630> them<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:02.930> create<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:04.100> front<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:04.640> the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
I used them to create the front and the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.210 
I used them to create the front and the
back<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.450> car<00:02:05.689> in<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.590> very<00:02:06.799> interesting

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
back of the car in a very interesting

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.270 
back of the car in a very interesting
way<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.880> also<00:02:08.720> used<00:02:09.200> them<00:02:09.590> on<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.799> sides<00:02:10.040> of<00:02:10.190> the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
way I also used them on the sides of the

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.630 
way I also used them on the sides of the
car<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.840> get<00:02:11.989> different<00:02:12.290> accents<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.160> shapes

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
car to get different accents and shapes

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.509 
car to get different accents and shapes
I<00:02:13.790> needed<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.840> fit<00:02:15.049> a<00:02:15.230> minifigure<00:02:15.680> into<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
I needed to fit a minifigure into the

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.800 
I needed to fit a minifigure into the
car<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:17.030> had<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.870> raise<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.079> roof<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.810> it's

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
car I had to raise the roof and it's

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.650 
car I had to raise the roof and it's
actually<00:02:21.170> removable<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.209> can<00:02:23.420> place<00:02:23.630> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
actually removable so you can place a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.800 
actually removable so you can place a
figure<00:02:24.079> inside<00:02:24.440> easily

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
figure inside easily

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.810 
figure inside easily
well<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.680> looks<00:02:26.830> like<00:02:26.920> our<00:02:27.070> model<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.490> all<00:02:27.610> done

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820
