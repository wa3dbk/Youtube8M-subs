00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.040 
for car camping and things like that
let's<00:00:35.460> blow<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.760> up<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.540> how<00:00:36.570> long<00:00:36.870> it's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
let's blow it up and see how long it's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.510 
let's blow it up and see how long it's
going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> take<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> set<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.010> how

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
going to take to set it up how

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.350 
going to take to set it up how
comfortable<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
comfortable it is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.160 
comfortable it is
and<00:00:39.629> then<00:00:40.230> let's<00:00:40.860> break<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.219> down<00:00:43.820> as<00:00:45.170> I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and then let's break it down as I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.720 
and then let's break it down as I
mentioned<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.770> internal<00:00:47.309> pump<00:00:47.520> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
mentioned this internal pump is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
mentioned this internal pump is
battery-powered<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:49.620> uses<00:00:50.010> C<00:00:50.969> batteries<00:00:51.710> take

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
battery-powered it uses C batteries take

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.660 
battery-powered it uses C batteries take
six<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> them<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:55.050> easy<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.500> install<00:00:55.800> let's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
six of them it's easy to install let's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:08.929 
six of them it's easy to install let's
go<00:00:56.879> ahead<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.239> pump<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.840> baby<00:00:58.079> up

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.639 

so<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.210> bed<00:01:10.390> did<00:01:10.630> take<00:01:10.869> about<00:01:11.020> seven<00:01:11.500> minutes

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
so the bed did take about seven minutes

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.800 
so the bed did take about seven minutes
to<00:01:11.950> fill<00:01:12.100> up<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.060> was<00:01:13.210> on<00:01:13.360> new<00:01:13.570> C

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
to fill up and that was on new C

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.469 
to fill up and that was on new C
batteries<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:15.250> not<00:01:15.490> too<00:01:15.670> bad<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.240> there's

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
batteries that's not too bad and there's

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.730 
batteries that's not too bad and there's
always<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.720> lot<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:16.960> stuff<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.320> do<00:01:17.439> around<00:01:17.619> the

problems might have a little trouble

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.889 
problems might have a little trouble
getting<00:01:26.020> down<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.619> slope<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.570> battery

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
getting down the slope the battery

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.779 
getting down the slope the battery
powered<00:01:29.229> pump<00:01:29.439> seems<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.920> have<00:01:30.070> gotten<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
powered pump seems to have gotten the

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:38.359 
powered pump seems to have gotten the
bed<00:01:30.970> pretty<00:01:31.210> firm<00:01:31.950> let's<00:01:32.950> see<00:01:33.549> how<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.759> feels

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.039 

feels<00:01:39.369> good<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.909> don't<00:01:40.060> feel<00:01:40.209> any<00:01:40.420> pressure

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
feels good I don't feel any pressure

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.620 
feels good I don't feel any pressure
points<00:01:41.470> or<00:01:41.950> anything<00:01:42.130> like<00:01:42.399> that<00:01:42.459> it's<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.119> nice

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
points or anything like that it's a nice

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.300 
points or anything like that it's a nice
even<00:01:44.259> feeling<00:01:44.500> if<00:01:45.069> I<00:01:45.250> get<00:01:45.399> over<00:01:45.819> to<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.090> edge<00:01:46.240> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
even feeling if I get over to the edge I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.710 
even feeling if I get over to the edge I
don't<00:01:48.310> get<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.940> sense<00:01:49.209> that<00:01:49.330> I'm<00:01:49.539> gonna

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
don't get that the sense that I'm gonna

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.660 
don't get that the sense that I'm gonna
roll<00:01:50.380> off<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.590> bed<00:01:50.890> or<00:01:51.130> anything<00:01:51.340> like<00:01:51.610> that

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
roll off the bed or anything like that

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.059 
roll off the bed or anything like that
so<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.690> seems<00:01:52.929> like<00:01:53.080> it's<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.350> good<00:01:53.679> sound<00:01:53.860> day

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
so it seems like it's a good sound day

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.639 
so it seems like it's a good sound day
of<00:01:54.190> bed<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.909> sheets<00:01:54.940> are<00:01:55.899> hanging<00:01:56.289> on<00:01:56.380> real

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
of bed the sheets are hanging on real

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.230 
of bed the sheets are hanging on real
tight<00:01:56.920> with<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.250> flocking<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.789> they<00:01:57.909> put<00:01:58.119> on

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
tight with the flocking that they put on

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.359 
tight with the flocking that they put on
here<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.500> looks<00:01:59.709> like<00:01:59.860> this<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.159> going<00:02:00.310> to

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
here so it looks like this is going to

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.309 
here so it looks like this is going to
be<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> good<00:02:00.700> solid<00:02:00.970> bed<00:02:01.270> I'm<00:02:01.750> going<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.049> give<00:02:02.200> it

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
be a good solid bed I'm going to give it

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.679 
be a good solid bed I'm going to give it
a<00:02:02.439> few<00:02:03.189> hours<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.640> sit<00:02:03.819> here<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.330> then<00:02:04.569> I'm

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
you know about what I think about it in

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:14.190 
you know about what I think about it in
the<00:02:07.209> morning<00:02:11.760> okay<00:02:12.760> well<00:02:13.299> that<00:02:13.840> was<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.989> good

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
the morning okay well that was a good

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.880 
the morning okay well that was a good
night's<00:02:14.380> sleep

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
night's sleep

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.670 
night's sleep
there<00:02:15.489> was<00:02:15.670> no<00:02:15.880> noticeable<00:02:16.480> loss<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:17.019> air<00:02:17.260> so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
there was no noticeable loss of air so

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.710 
there was no noticeable loss of air so
I've<00:02:17.829> stayed<00:02:18.190> off<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.370> floor<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:18.850> night<00:02:18.880> it's

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
I've stayed off the floor all night it's

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.250 
I've stayed off the floor all night it's
a<00:02:19.930> comfortable<00:02:20.530> bed<00:02:21.480> there's<00:02:22.480> easily<00:02:22.840> room

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
a comfortable bed there's easily room

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.560 
a comfortable bed there's easily room
for<00:02:23.440> two<00:02:23.560> people<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:24.010> there<00:02:24.250> like<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.060> said<00:02:25.150> it's

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
for two people on there like I said it's

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.780 
for two people on there like I said it's
an<00:02:25.780> actual<00:02:26.500> full-size<00:02:27.040> been<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> full-size

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
an actual full-size been a full-size

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.890 
an actual full-size been a full-size
sheets<00:02:28.090> are<00:02:28.209> gonna<00:02:28.329> fit<00:02:28.570> on<00:02:28.720> it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
sheets are gonna fit on it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.289 
sheets are gonna fit on it
I<00:02:29.049> guess<00:02:29.680> now<00:02:29.890> let's<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.459> take<00:02:30.609> the<00:02:30.790> time<00:02:31.000> to

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
I guess now let's just take the time to

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.750 
I guess now let's just take the time to
see<00:02:32.019> see<00:02:32.440> how<00:02:32.560> long<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.829> takes<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.070> deflate<00:02:33.489> and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
see see how long it takes to deflate and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.830 
see see how long it takes to deflate and
put<00:02:34.750> away<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:36.000> maybe<00:02:37.000> some<00:02:37.239> final<00:02:37.540> words<00:02:37.750> at

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
put away and maybe some final words at

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.160 
put away and maybe some final words at
the<00:02:37.959> end

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.949 

so<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.530> took<00:02:45.709> about<00:02:46.030> four<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.180> half<00:02:47.209> close

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
so that took about four and a half close

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.289 
so that took about four and a half close
to<00:02:48.170> five<00:02:48.620> minutes<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.129> the<00:02:49.219> plate<00:02:49.489> which<00:02:50.150> is

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
to five minutes to the plate which is

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.629 
to five minutes to the plate which is
about<00:02:50.510> half<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.810> time<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.159> took<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.459> fill

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
about half the time that it took to fill

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.940 
about half the time that it took to fill
with<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:52.939> up<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.510> was<00:02:53.659> really<00:02:53.870> efficient<00:02:54.530> at

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
with that up it was really efficient at

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.929 
with that up it was really efficient at
getting<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:55.639> the<00:02:55.849> air<00:02:56.030> out<00:02:56.359> of<00:02:56.389> the<00:02:56.629> bed<00:02:56.810> which

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
getting all the air out of the bed which

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.280 
getting all the air out of the bed which
indicates<00:02:58.939> that<00:02:59.120> it's<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.359> strong<00:02:59.659> pump<00:02:59.930> inside

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
indicates that it's a strong pump inside

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.580 
indicates that it's a strong pump inside
so<00:03:00.670> really<00:03:01.670> impressed<00:03:02.030> with<00:03:02.269> that<00:03:02.299> as<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.469> can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
so really impressed with that as you can

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.309 
so really impressed with that as you can
see<00:03:03.650> it's<00:03:04.040> easy<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:05.329> fold<00:03:05.599> up<00:03:05.780> it's<00:03:06.079> going<00:03:06.260> to

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
see it's easy to fold up it's going to

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.649 
see it's easy to fold up it's going to
be<00:03:06.409> easy<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.799> put<00:03:07.010> back<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.819> whatever<00:03:08.180> bag<00:03:08.359> you

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
be easy to put back in whatever bag you

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.479 
be easy to put back in whatever bag you
have<00:03:08.900> some<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:09.680> these<00:03:09.769> come<00:03:10.040> with<00:03:10.219> a<00:03:10.250> carrying

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
have some of these come with a carrying

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.339 
have some of these come with a carrying
case<00:03:11.000> others<00:03:11.959> don't

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
case others don't

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.899 
case others don't
this<00:03:12.530> one<00:03:12.709> didn't<00:03:13.450> but<00:03:14.450> all<00:03:15.319> that<00:03:15.530> said<00:03:15.909> that

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
this one didn't but all that said that

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.860 
this one didn't but all that said that
deflated<00:03:17.540> put<00:03:17.900> away<00:03:18.139> I<00:03:18.909> can<00:03:19.909> recommend<00:03:20.299> the

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
deflated put away I can recommend the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.170 
deflated put away I can recommend the
Intex<00:03:21.260> camping<00:03:21.709> air<00:03:21.859> mattress<00:03:22.280> full-size<00:03:22.909> bed

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
Intex camping air mattress full-size bed

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.300 
Intex camping air mattress full-size bed
with<00:03:23.480> with<00:03:23.780> confidence<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.829> seems<00:03:25.010> like<00:03:25.159> it's

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
with with confidence it seems like it's

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.879 
with with confidence it seems like it's
going<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.489> be<00:03:25.609> a<00:03:25.639> good<00:03:25.790> solid<00:03:26.060> bed<00:03:26.389> and<00:03:26.889> Intex

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
going to be a good solid bed and Intex

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.819 
going to be a good solid bed and Intex
has<00:03:28.189> a<00:03:28.219> warranty<00:03:28.669> that<00:03:29.290> that's<00:03:30.290> good<00:03:30.530> as<00:03:30.680> far

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
has a warranty that that's good as far

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.530 
has a warranty that that's good as far
as<00:03:30.980> air<00:03:31.189> beds<00:03:31.370> go<00:03:31.549> I<00:03:31.579> think<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.329> one-year

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
as air beds go I think it's a one-year

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.830 
as air beds go I think it's a one-year
so<00:03:33.319> that's<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.250> for<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.760> full<00:03:35.000> size<00:03:35.180> Intex

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
so that's it for the full size Intex

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.769 
so that's it for the full size Intex
