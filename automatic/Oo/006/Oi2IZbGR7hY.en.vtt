just hanging out a lot of people like to

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.160 
just hanging out a lot of people like to
take<00:01:24.220> this<00:01:24.400> divider<00:01:24.790> out<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.299> maximize<00:01:25.900> the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
take this divider out to maximize the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.530 
take this divider out to maximize the
space<00:01:26.229> within<00:01:26.740> here<00:01:27.189> now<00:01:27.970> I'm<00:01:28.119> not<00:01:28.299> actually

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
space within here now I'm not actually

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.620 
space within here now I'm not actually
sure<00:01:29.009> how<00:01:30.009> many<00:01:30.070> shadows<00:01:30.729> you<00:01:31.090> can<00:01:31.299> get<00:01:31.479> in

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
sure how many shadows you can get in

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.230 
sure how many shadows you can get in
here<00:01:31.869> when<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.200> pop<00:01:32.439> that<00:01:32.470> divider<00:01:32.950> out

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
here when you pop that divider out

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.370 
here when you pop that divider out
because<00:01:34.240> I<00:01:34.329> haven't<00:01:34.540> done<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.110> it's<00:01:35.229> the

everyone knows that Z palettes was so

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.529 
everyone knows that Z palettes was so
great<00:02:08.350> about<00:02:08.470> them<00:02:08.860> is<00:02:09.039> that<00:02:09.130> you<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:10.239> see

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
great about them is that you can see

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.750 
great about them is that you can see
through<00:02:10.899> them<00:02:11.110> they<00:02:11.709> don't<00:02:12.070> have<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> divider

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
through them they don't have a divider

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.780 
through them they don't have a divider
in<00:02:13.030> them<00:02:13.299> so<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.810> can<00:02:14.110> really<00:02:14.530> maximize<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
in them so you can really maximize the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.539 
in them so you can really maximize the
space<00:02:15.850> within<00:02:16.299> them<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.560> totality<00:02:18.459> I'm

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
space within them and so I totality I'm

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.330 
space within them and so I totality I'm
like<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.850> need<00:02:19.120> a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
like I need a

of<00:04:19.160> it<00:04:20.349> it's<00:04:21.349> I<00:04:21.620> mean<00:04:21.769> as<00:04:21.889> you<00:04:21.979> can<00:04:22.250> see<00:04:22.520> is<00:04:22.700> with

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
of it it's I mean as you can see is with

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.950 
of it it's I mean as you can see is with
much<00:04:23.750> thicker<00:04:24.200> than<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:25.450> original<00:04:26.450> pilot<00:04:26.660> so

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
much thicker than the original pilot so

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.839 
much thicker than the original pilot so
if<00:04:27.110> they<00:04:27.289> could<00:04:27.500> do<00:04:27.740> this<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.219> make<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.520> as

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
if they could do this and make it as

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.080 
if they could do this and make it as
thin<00:04:29.210> as<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.630> original<00:04:30.110> one<00:04:30.349> who<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.849> would

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
thin as the original one who that would

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.439 
thin as the original one who that would
just

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
just

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.929 
just
lovely<00:04:33.229> I<00:04:33.439> mean<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:33.919> did<00:04:34.129> travel<00:04:34.610> with<00:04:34.759> these

lovely I mean I did travel with these

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.159 
lovely I mean I did travel with these
pilots<00:04:35.449> and<00:04:35.599> multiple<00:04:35.990> other<00:04:36.080> palettes<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:36.889> my

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
pilots and multiple other palettes in my

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.809 
pilots and multiple other palettes in my
in<00:04:39.169> my<00:04:39.229> case<00:04:39.590> over<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:39.949> weekend<00:04:40.249> amanda<00:04:40.639> have

in my case over the weekend amanda have
any<00:04:40.849> problem<00:04:41.330> traveling<00:04:41.689> with<00:04:41.839> there<00:04:42.020> but<00:04:42.229> I

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:42.469 
any problem traveling with there but I

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:47.049 
any problem traveling with there but I
mean<00:04:44.439> it's<00:04:45.439> almost<00:04:45.770> like<00:04:46.099> having<00:04:46.339> this<00:04:46.849> is

00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:47.059 
mean it's almost like having this is

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:49.179 
mean it's almost like having this is
like<00:04:47.240> if<00:04:47.419> I<00:04:47.569> had<00:04:47.809> if<00:04:47.990> this<00:04:48.169> was<00:04:48.379> as<00:04:48.559> thin<00:04:48.860> as<00:04:48.889> the

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:49.189 
like if I had if this was as thin as the

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.640 
like if I had if this was as thin as the
original<00:04:49.610> one<00:04:49.819> this<00:04:50.629> thickness<00:04:51.050> right<00:04:51.469> here

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
original one this thickness right here

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.379 
original one this thickness right here
this<00:04:51.830> would<00:04:52.009> be<00:04:52.099> like<00:04:52.129> three<00:04:52.639> pallets<00:04:53.120> so<00:04:53.360> that

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
this would be like three pallets so that

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.239 
this would be like three pallets so that
would<00:04:53.839> be<00:04:53.870> like<00:04:54.199> what's<00:04:54.919> 24<00:04:55.430> x<00:04:55.699> 3<00:04:56.830> yeah<00:04:57.830> I<00:04:58.099> mean

00:04:58.239 --> 00:04:58.249 
would be like what's 24 x 3 yeah I mean

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:00.670 
would be like what's 24 x 3 yeah I mean
that's<00:04:58.339> a<00:04:58.520> lot<00:04:58.550> of<00:04:58.879> shadows<00:04:59.779> but<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.319> absolutely

Academy<00:05:56.089> some<00:05:56.330> kind<00:05:56.569> of<00:05:56.629> magnets<00:05:57.169> in<00:05:57.740> order<00:05:58.009> to

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
Academy some kind of magnets in order to

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.489 
Academy some kind of magnets in order to
get<00:05:58.370> these<00:05:58.610> you<00:05:58.939> know<00:05:59.360> them<00:05:59.629> is<00:05:59.870> fat<00:06:00.110> so<00:06:00.349> they

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:00.499 
get these you know them is fat so they

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:04.659 
get these you know them is fat so they
actually<00:06:00.680> have<00:06:01.360> magnetite<00:06:03.189> so<00:06:04.189> this<00:06:04.370> is<00:06:04.520> it

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
actually have magnetite so this is it

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.820 
actually have magnetite so this is it
and<00:06:04.999> it's<00:06:05.180> just<00:06:05.389> a<00:06:05.479> type<00:06:05.689> of<00:06:05.719> Magna<00:06:06.319> it's<00:06:06.529> a<00:06:06.649> key

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
and it's just a type of Magna it's a key

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.489 
and it's just a type of Magna it's a key
step<00:06:07.009> on<00:06:07.189> one<00:06:07.339> side<00:06:07.669> and<00:06:08.089> I<00:06:08.930> mean<00:06:09.080> it's<00:06:09.229> really

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:09.499 
step on one side and I mean it's really

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.399 
step on one side and I mean it's really
convenient<00:06:09.889> because<00:06:10.249> you<00:06:10.550> can<00:06:10.729> just<00:06:11.259> pull<00:06:12.259> it

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
convenient because you can just pull it

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.679
