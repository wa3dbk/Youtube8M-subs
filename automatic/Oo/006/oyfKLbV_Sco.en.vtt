00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hi, I'm a video for everyone today, we're going to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.629
 make some chicken sticks that also 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.429
 they are known as a chicken subsidiary or 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.570
 chicken fried and to do it we are going to 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.880
 need the following ingredients 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.650
 a chicken breast if you want to know 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.660
 how the breast is pulled out of a chicken 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.949
 I'm going to leave you a hole link 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 description breadcrumbs an egg salt 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.970
 and the ingredients that they like most for 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.910
 season the breadcrumbs in my case 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.890
 dried parsley garlic powder and peppers 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.400
 first I'll cut the chicken in 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.830
 strips 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.210
 so let's take this piece of 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.210
 here that is known as sirloin 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.110
 and we cut it into strips 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.710
 I'll make it bigger smaller 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.300
 and we can do the same with everything 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.989
 the chicken I'm going to remove this membrane 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.989
 what do you have here 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.800
 i 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.960
 I'm going to cut a chicken in two so that 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.960
 it is easier to make the strips 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.910
 and we have already cut it into an equal strip 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.910
 what strass 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.290
 i 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.650
 and this is how they are very long, because we can 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.580
 cut it in half and so we do 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.580
 smaller strips 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.090
 once we have the chicken cut in 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.090
 strips let's move to seasoning the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.659
 and we mix it well so that all 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.579
 pieces have salt and pepper 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.259
 once mixed before moving to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.049
 tarnish what I'm going to flavor the bread 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.320
 grated so we add the garlic in 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.450
 powder and dried parsley and mix it 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.250
 and once it does all mixed we're going to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.470
 happen to tarnish I've beaten the egg 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.050
 with a little salt and let's go 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.710
 separating each strip we pass it first 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.710
 good for eggs 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.910
 we drain a little and for the bread crumbs 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.720
 we are squeezing well so that he leaves 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.720
 hitting the bread crumbs well 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.370
 and once we have it ready 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.140
 we are putting in a little dish and we are going to 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.610
 do the same with all and once 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.230
 are all ready let's move 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.970
 fry them though you can also do it 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.740
 in the oven putting a little bit of 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.360
 oil on top to fry them 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.370
 put in a pan deep enough 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.720
 amount of oil and I'm going to put the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.240
 wta plate at medium-high heat 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.070
 once the oil is about 175 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.480
 degrees let's go and frying the strips 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.930
 of little time so they do not stick 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.930
 each 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.680
 we will be looking for the golden brown on 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.870
 everywhere 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.219
 Once they are golden, I could go 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.959
 taking out a plate with a paper 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.000
 absorbent for case the court in its 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.069
 oil and I will continue asking for the rest with 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.840
 the macabre at medium heat in the sun here 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.060
 you can see some of the chicken ends 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.890
 of plated accompanied with a sauce 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.989
 of cheddar cheese that is my favorite 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.180
 although you can accompany it with ketchup 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.189
 mayonnaise barbecue sauce or the one that more os 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.200
