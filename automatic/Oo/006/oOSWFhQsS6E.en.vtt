because you have additional bracing

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890 
because you have additional bracing
that's<00:00:44.140> actually<00:00:44.680> holding<00:00:44.920> it<00:00:45.430> up<00:00:45.900> providing

that's actually holding it up providing

structural support for it here you're
not<00:00:49.330> going<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.660> have<00:00:49.900> that<00:00:50.200> but<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:52.500> patio

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500

not going to have that but the patio
designer<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.960> whether<00:00:56.230> you<00:00:56.410> made<00:00:56.590> a

designer actually it whether you made a

routered<00:01:05.710> into<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.670> six<00:01:06.939> by<00:01:07.149> six<00:01:07.479> post<00:01:07.929> and

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
routered into the six by six post and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.639 
routered into the six by six post and
the<00:01:08.950> reason<00:01:09.399> for<00:01:09.429> that<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:10.119> simple<00:01:10.659> this<00:01:11.259> post

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
the reason for that is simple this post

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.499 
the reason for that is simple this post
base<00:01:12.159> was<00:01:13.119> made<00:01:13.390> for<00:01:13.749> a<00:01:13.780> standard<00:01:14.850> six<00:01:15.850> by<00:01:16.090> six

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
base was made for a standard six by six

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.050 
base was made for a standard six by six
which<00:01:17.259> is<00:01:17.289> five<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.009> half<00:01:18.069> inches<00:01:18.640> by<00:01:18.789> five

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
which is five and a half inches by five

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.870 
which is five and a half inches by five
and<00:01:19.299> a<00:01:19.329> half<00:01:19.390> inches<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.229> rough<00:01:20.920> sawn<00:01:21.219> six<00:01:21.640> by

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
and a half inches a rough sawn six by

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.899 
and a half inches a rough sawn six by
six<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.509> full<00:01:23.140> six<00:01:23.590> inches<00:01:24.100> by<00:01:24.460> six<00:01:24.819> inches

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
six is a full six inches by six inches

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.989 
six is a full six inches by six inches
and<00:01:25.539> would<00:01:26.200> not<00:01:26.530> have<00:01:26.829> fit<00:01:27.100> into<00:01:27.369> this<00:01:27.640> flange

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
and would not have fit into this flange

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:33.719 
and would not have fit into this flange
if<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.729> carpenter<00:01:30.729> did<00:01:31.030> not<00:01:32.729> router

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
if the carpenter did not router

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.279 
if the carpenter did not router
something<00:01:34.719> in<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.679> set<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.429> flange<00:01:36.729> into<00:01:37.289> now

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
something in to set the flange into now

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.669 
something in to set the flange into now
this<00:01:38.679> also<00:01:39.039> provides<00:01:39.460> additional<00:01:39.850> support

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
this also provides additional support

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.510 
this also provides additional support
for<00:01:41.679> the<00:01:41.920> lateral<00:01:42.460> movement<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.539> patio<00:01:44.520> by

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
for the lateral movement of the patio by

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.349 
for the lateral movement of the patio by
putting<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.240> flange<00:01:46.539> in<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:48.310> setting<00:01:48.909> it<00:01:49.090> into

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
putting the flange in in setting it into

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.910 
putting the flange in in setting it into
the<00:01:49.689> post<00:01:49.959> like<00:01:50.289> this<00:01:50.560> you're<00:01:51.340> going<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:52.920> give

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
the post like this you're going to give

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.489 
the post like this you're going to give
each<00:01:54.130> individual<00:01:55.119> post<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.719> little<00:01:56.259> more

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
each individual post a little more

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:00.260 
each individual post a little more
structural<00:01:57.279> support<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:59.020> it's<00:01:59.289> a<00:01:59.380> good<00:01:59.590> idea

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
structural support so it's a good idea

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.999 
structural support so it's a good idea
whether<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.450> was<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.630> mistake<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.529> then

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
whether it was a mistake and then

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.830 
whether it was a mistake and then
whether<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.579> was<00:02:03.700> planned<00:02:03.939> or<00:02:04.209> a<00:02:04.270> mistake<00:02:04.600> I

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
whether it was planned or a mistake I

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.590 
whether it was planned or a mistake I
don't<00:02:04.899> know<00:02:05.409> I<00:02:06.279> wouldn't<00:02:06.909> have<00:02:06.999> done<00:02:07.149> this<00:02:07.389> I

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
don't know I wouldn't have done this I

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.509 
don't know I wouldn't have done this I
would<00:02:07.749> have<00:02:07.779> got<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.140> right<00:02:08.289> post<00:02:08.590> base<00:02:08.920> just

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
would have got the right post base just

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.089 
would have got the right post base just
so<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.670> didn't<00:02:09.939> have<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.149> router<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:11.099> flange

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
so I didn't have to router the flange

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.200 
so I didn't have to router the flange
into<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:13.150> either<00:02:13.390> way<00:02:13.629> this<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.019> good

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
into it but either way this is good

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.140 
into it but either way this is good
idea<00:02:14.570> now<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.590> black<00:02:16.040> arrow<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.520> pointing<00:02:16.940> to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
idea now the black arrow is pointing to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.420 
idea now the black arrow is pointing to
the<00:02:17.690> bottom<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.560> post<00:02:18.800> base<00:02:19.100> which

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
the bottom of the post base which

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.340 
the bottom of the post base which
originally<00:02:20.000> was<00:02:20.270> raised<00:02:20.570> off<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
originally was raised off of the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.180 
originally was raised off of the
concrete<00:02:21.970> floor<00:02:23.350> someone<00:02:24.350> added<00:02:24.590> some<00:02:24.890> tile

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
concrete floor someone added some tile

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.670 
concrete floor someone added some tile
which<00:02:25.700> probably<00:02:26.090> added<00:02:26.600> about<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> half<00:02:27.410> inch

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
which probably added about a half inch

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.500 
which probably added about a half inch
to<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.340> top<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.760> concrete<00:02:32.300> which

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
to the to the top of the concrete which

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.820 
to the to the top of the concrete which
reduced<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.550> flange<00:02:34.720> distance<00:02:35.720> here<00:02:36.380> now

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
reduced the flange distance here now

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.030 
reduced the flange distance here now
this<00:02:37.070> is<00:02:37.130> good<00:02:37.520> because<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:38.150> provides<00:02:39.040> any

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
this is good because this provides any

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.270 
this is good because this provides any
extra<00:02:40.640> water<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.270> drain<00:02:41.840> away<00:02:42.110> from<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.980> post

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
extra water to drain away from the post

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.300 
extra water to drain away from the post
you<00:02:43.730> do<00:02:44.480> not<00:02:44.690> want<00:02:45.050> water<00:02:45.350> pooling<00:02:45.740> up<00:02:46.040> around

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
you do not want water pooling up around
