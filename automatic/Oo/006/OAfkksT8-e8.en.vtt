00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
with the tech lab just yet and what is

with the tech lab just yet and what is
marine<00:02:41.879> king<00:02:42.239> up<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.659> his<00:02:42.870> building<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.709> star

gas though we will see a Banshee Banshee
without<00:02:50.870> cloak<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.200> same<00:02:53.040> thing<00:02:53.310> goes

for dream on dream also doesn't get the
second<00:02:56.519> refinery<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.390> yet<00:02:57.660> but<00:02:57.840> he's<00:02:58.019> a

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
second refinery just yet but he's a

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.740 
second refinery just yet but he's a
little<00:02:58.230> bit<00:02:58.440> slower<00:02:58.769> with<00:02:59.340> his<00:02:59.599> Banshee<00:03:00.599> he

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
little bit slower with his Banshee he

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.119 
little bit slower with his Banshee he
will<00:03:00.989> be<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.200> little<00:03:01.349> bit<00:03:01.500> slow<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:01.859> a<00:03:01.890> banshee

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
will be a little bit slow with a banshee

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.490 
will be a little bit slow with a banshee
first<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.120> because<00:03:03.329> his<00:03:03.750> star<00:03:04.170> pot<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:04.470> a

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
first of all because his star pot is a

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.710 
first of all because his star pot is a
bit<00:03:04.799> slower<00:03:05.069> than<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.670> start<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.209> marine<00:03:06.480> King

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
bit slower than the start of marine King

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.319 
bit slower than the start of marine King
but<00:03:06.959> he<00:03:07.440> also<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:08.430> doesn't<00:03:08.670> build<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
but he also it doesn't build the

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.660 
but he also it doesn't build the
starport<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.290> position<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.099> tech<00:03:11.459> lab

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
starport in the position of the tech lab

starport in the position of the tech lab
drinking<00:03:12.480> with<00:03:12.629> a<00:03:12.659> slightly<00:03:13.379> different<00:03:13.680> build

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
drinking with a slightly different build

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.069 
drinking with a slightly different build
as<00:03:14.129> you<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:14.430> see<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.849> because<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.810> already

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
as you can see it because we already

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.870 
as you can see it because we already
have<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.560> stopper<00:03:16.890> being<00:03:17.099> built<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.459> exact

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
have the stopper being built and exact

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.309 
have the stopper being built and exact
the<00:03:18.000> position<00:03:18.329> he<00:03:18.389> needs<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.750> be<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:18.989> order<00:03:19.109> to

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
the position he needs to be in order to

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.949 
the position he needs to be in order to
get<00:03:19.440> access<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.430> set<00:03:20.669> to<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.030> tech<00:03:21.359> lab<00:03:21.540> so

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
get access to the set to the tech lab so

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:22.970 
get access to the set to the tech lab so
he<00:03:22.079> could<00:03:22.230> start<00:03:22.470> with<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.620> banshee<00:03:22.950> right

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
he could start with the banshee right

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.180 
he could start with the banshee right
away<00:03:23.459> while<00:03:24.060> dream<00:03:24.480> now<00:03:24.750> has<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.650> switch

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
away while dream now has to switch

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.530 
away while dream now has to switch
buildings<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.299> this<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.019> obviously<00:03:29.480> taking<00:03:30.480> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
buildings and this is obviously taking a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.069 
buildings and this is obviously taking a
couple<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:31.139> seconds<00:03:31.970> therefore<00:03:32.989> linking<00:03:33.989> a

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
couple of seconds therefore linking a

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.229 
couple of seconds therefore linking a
little<00:03:34.650> bit<00:03:34.799> faster<00:03:35.280> with<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.669> banshee<00:03:35.879> plane

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
little bit faster with a banshee plane

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.890 
little bit faster with a banshee plane
but<00:03:37.079> besides<00:03:38.069> this<00:03:38.819> particular<00:03:39.120> bill<00:03:39.480> there

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
but besides this particular bill there

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.110 
but besides this particular bill there
are<00:03:40.109> not<00:03:40.530> too<00:03:40.799> many<00:03:40.829> differences<00:03:41.519> in<00:03:41.819> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
are not too many differences in the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.479 
are not too many differences in the
building<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.840> now<00:03:43.230> obviously<00:03:44.010> we<00:03:44.340> have<00:03:44.459> a

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
building just now obviously we have a

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.240 
building just now obviously we have a
tech<00:03:44.910> lab<00:03:45.090> now<00:03:45.239> for<00:03:45.870> inking<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.650> want<00:03:46.859> some

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
tech lab now for inking you want some

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.550 
tech lab now for inking you want some
additional<00:03:47.879> marines<00:03:48.510> let's<00:03:48.900> see<00:03:49.199> how<00:03:49.349> that's

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
additional marines let's see how that's

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.619 
additional marines let's see how that's
going<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.829> work<00:03:49.889> because<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:50.760> he<00:03:50.970> attacks<00:03:51.299> with

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
going to work because if he attacks with

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.740 
going to work because if he attacks with
benches<00:03:52.199> with<00:03:52.650> hellions<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.910> Marines<00:03:54.269> this

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
benches with hellions and Marines this

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.629 
benches with hellions and Marines this
is<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.900> very<00:03:54.930> full<00:03:55.379> very<00:03:55.560> powerful<00:03:56.220> build<00:03:56.459> we've

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639
