 girls hello series of video lessons 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:21.180
 basic weaving continues today i 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.180
 show you how to weave a fishtail braid 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.050
 we will weave it on one side 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:47.289
 to make it clearer and more convenient 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:51.729
 like a bowl of hair in this weaving we will 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:54.870
 use two strands we share our 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.870
 hair into 2 parts 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:15.240
 now from the far left side 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:18.810
 on the edge of the left edge we have to scrub 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.810
 little pryadochka 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.049
 you can release our left big 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.390
 strand and this little strand 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:41.520
 in total on top of the big left and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.520
 attach it to the far right strand 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.869
 now on the right we also 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:59.560
 we allocate a small pryadochka we throw 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:09.759
 top and attach a big extremely 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:17.860
 white ties again allocate part of the hair 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:24.160
 from the left strand and given join 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:27.540
 extreme right strand and select the part 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.180
 hair from the edge to the right 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.540
 we throw on top we attach to the left 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.540
 strands 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.410
 smog part of the hair on the left is attached to 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:47.530
 right strand 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:50.850
