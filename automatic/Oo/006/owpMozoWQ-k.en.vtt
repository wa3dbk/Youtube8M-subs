00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.849
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.040
 this new video where as you will already have 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.470
 understood from the title I will give you little ones 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.449
 tweak tips suggestions on how 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.160
 improve your performance 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.830
 ernest color shine 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.539
 the gearbox is precisely this and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.550
 they know almost all it takes to change 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.039
 one card in another between the card 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.710
 choice or in what you want 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.050
 this video was born from the fact that I have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.820
 seen many performances of this change 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.260
 of colors executed incorrectly or 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 totally wrong 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.450
 in fact many follow him in this way 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.120
 push the card forward pull the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.079
 card below back then index la 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.840
 rejects and the hand over back to cover 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.829
 the viewer is not stupid that is if you want 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.640
 performed such a thing 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.399
 push pull index and come back understand 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.000
 that there is something strange that you are 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.950
 in short, making is not the maximum yield 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.229
 so let's see ways to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.170
 improve both paper extraction 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.330
 from below is repositioning 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.060
 let's start from the extraction of the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.920
 second card but especially from 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.820
 how to push the first one forward to 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.390
 then facilitate the taking of the second 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.710
 there are so many ways to do this on 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.240
 worst is to push it forward 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.009
 just so obvious without any 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.990
 coverage is totally wrong 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.030
 forget it a little more 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.380
 intelligent is to push it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.040
 forward through the little finger of the hand 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.960
 right 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.090
 when the right hand goes to cover the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.549
 deck before changing 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.470
 little finger pushes her slightly forward but 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.509
 I don't like this method because of it 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.299
 left and also from the front are 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.730
 perfectly executed you see third 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.510
 method what I use a little more often 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.630
 this is to say contact with the base 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.550
 of the four fingers the first card e 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.740
 the action is performed entirely by the hand 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.500
 left pulling back at all 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.390
 deck except the first card that is held 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.050
 by friction from these four 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.730
 fingers 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.960
 so this the right hand does not 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.150
 nothing ok we see the concept of the brief 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.850
 now that's the space you need 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.920
 leave to remove the paper underneath 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.560
 it's not important to have a brief like that 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.200
 wide enough to remove it easily enough 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.120
 just so much less than a 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.920
 centimeter is important instead the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.200
 right hand position he must 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.480
 to be diagonal to be able to extract 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.480
 easily the paper from below you see in 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.040
 this way the card already out and bach 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.530
 at this point I can go to perform 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.830
 the change the fourth method is the most 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.860
 difficult but the cleanest that is 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.570
 of the bacall in fact bend the first one 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.000
 paper by half inch in this 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.290
 way and then with the index you push everything 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 the bunch back 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.740
 at this point you have your grease e 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.230
 you are able to perform the change in 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.580
 clean so under the cover 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.400
 of the right hand 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.160
 the left hand does this the forefinger 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.959
 pushes and the change happens like this we go 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.120
 now to see the action of the index 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.130
 of the left hand than team 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.489
 in the card at the top we use kill 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.110
 the third hand method contacts the first 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.620
 card but the left brings back 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.900
 palm diagonally pulls back the hand 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.690
 come back and the index shows as 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.820
 square the card to the four of flowers 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.750
 only after the right hand is covered 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:38.470
 everything now the index runs the team 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.510
 chin ok if squared first is uglier 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.790
 to see if you watch this perform 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.640
 this is always the third method 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.020
 framework and then I go to make the change 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.120
 sorry but I came a little bad 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:56.140
 I repeat third method shooting hand squadra e 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.220
 change is much better if you do this 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.690
 every hand 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.300
 pull gear and then team when the hand 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.280
 team covers ok so this was all 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.230
 as for today's tutorial 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.850
 I hope these tips have been there 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.070
 useful they had helped somehow 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.660
 improve if it was so let me 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.640
 understand with a like and maybe a 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.450
 comment below to help me 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.430
 improve 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.620
 I remind you to put me like mine

 what I do 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.820
 and nothing so sign up see you
