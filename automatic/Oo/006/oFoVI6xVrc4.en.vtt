00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.050
 so here we have one 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:08.080
 new hydro device 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.410
 and this hydro is very very 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.410
 narrow 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.860
 By the way, there are kettles but have here 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.370
 Let's see him first 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.370
 when 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 speedily 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.990
 4 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.990
 this is easy 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.150
 up here 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.890
 the lid for the cleaning of the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.890
 heat exchangers 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.600
 Here is the exhaust gas guide either above 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.600
 or laterally 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.109
 here you can see 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.940
 lateral exhaust gas possible 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.320
 a very slim device worth on everyone 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.810
 be very good again 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.810
 It will be a hydro at this one 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.810
 included 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.560
 hot air blower 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.260
 has a bit similarity 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.050
 of a 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.050
 club something a little higher 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.890
 So either I'm fine that is 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.600
 or under control of the room 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.350
 Temperature sensor becomes practical 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.740
 redirect active countries to these 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740
 these 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.210
 who with bags so falls already 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.090
 questionable these were the temperatures 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.580
 fall 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.770
 nothing again 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.009
 for too long 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.009
 Yes 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.950
 but suddenly 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.370
 attempt
