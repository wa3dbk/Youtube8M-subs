00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.570
 this is the motorized manifestation is 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.600
 another one of the actuators of the system 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.850
 common rail of a chain and an engine 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.210
 dense a system of use as a king 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.900
 let's go here simply 2 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.750
 the three cables forgive a feeding 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.260
 a 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.530
 a mesh and a wire activating the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.450
 computer there is probably a system 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.340
 of power or a power stage 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 because we are going to see in the oscilloscope 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.210
 which is low-voltage stations 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.040
 let's see if he copied them to see the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.070
 sign of this actor 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.470
 we come to our own and 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.080
 then let's enter we have here a 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.300
 couple of possibilities first the 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.130
 voltmeter and remember that they are minutes 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.050
 a portable activation 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.050
 then here we see 

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:12.259
 maximum and minimum and the percentage 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.600
 once we are going to accelerate it and we are going to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.390
 accelerate it to see how it changes the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.659
 activation percentage with respect to 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.710
 the acceleration 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:27.100
 and we see that it varies between 45 and 60 60% 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.190
 approximately 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.380
 now let's move on to the changes 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.390
 we will pass if you confirm us we do not have 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.940
 too often this also is another 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.940
 option to see it 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.000
 something very important in this that you 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.430
 I wanted to comment is that the frequency 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.970
 practically does not vary because it is 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.490
 constant frequency and 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.860
 requirement is we accelerate here 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.860
 practically the frequency is 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.980
 250 cycles per second 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.310
 if we need them 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.640
 go to a component that is activation 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.700
 digital for example could be a 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.300
 control valve minimum 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.560
 could be for example let's see if 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.560
 we find someone else 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.860
 good could be firing on 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.319
 because it 's a digital signal if you see it 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.580
 here it is already but it is very small 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.120
 because the activation of the activation 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.120
 as well 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.240
 it takes a higher voltage but here 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.900
 we could accommodate the service 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.590
 it's basically an activation of 1.2 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.320
 volts so that's why we could 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.720
 prevent there is a power stage 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.390
 within the component, notice that the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.090
 trend is down voltages towards 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.610
 low power activations for not 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.180
 recharge the computer and so everything 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.880
 is incorporated in the component here 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.650
 we could have and look at this we're going to 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.020
 do an acceleration and look like the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.110
 Frequency does not vary I will put my 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.569
 fingers 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.420
 in situ the mustache 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.170
 they are in a static part of the signal 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.170
 is 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.260
 part does not vary however you see that 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.090
 the other two parties are and are 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.790
 varying and that's where the variation occurs 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.970
 in time it is very important to remember 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.730
 that we have a constant event and the 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.170
 variation is given by the pulse width or 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.810
 how much of the signal is activated but not 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:43.579
 how many signals are given per second that 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.049
 are constant so I hope I have 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.190
 served this video also to learn 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:53.590
 to see signs on the toyota hylux or not 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.590
 stay like a king with sun set 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.590
