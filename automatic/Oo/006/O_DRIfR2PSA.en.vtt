00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.099
 adjustments for some champions with this 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:14.880
 new challengers arrived who will be the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.650
 new rail master the current masters 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.289
 of the lane are preparing for the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.689

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.970
 jungle we find the teacher and he emits 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.029
 we found six in support we found 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.820
 to lioness and nds we find the ying now 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.769
 let's see who survives and now is the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.390
 current rail master for top all 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.700
 they know that their potential is to kill from a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.340
 so easy to those champions who do not 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.440
 they have enough s to kill her before 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.760
 that it's too late but there comes a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.300
 champion to test their 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.550
 skills your challengers jacks 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.590
 once jacques reaches level 6 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.170
 it became a dip and it 's pretty strong and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.910
 dreaded tomb towers like crazy but this 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.300
 it will be enough to beat fee now 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.460
 the winner of this meeting is jacks 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.620
 jack becomes feet so be it 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 totally tank once it reaches the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.330
 level 6 his is quite useful in the fights 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.369
 of the most complex team is to paste is 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.619
 to several enemies at once you can 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.810
 overcome almost any bully who 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.060
 put on top the next meeting is 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.040
 in the jungle as expected arrives 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.570
 to have for the wikileaks flashlight and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.330
 with it a weakness for the teacher 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.789
 since your challenger will surely want 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.000
 take advantage of their challengers nothing more and nothing 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:30.000
 less than Warwick and the winner of this 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.160
 meeting is warwick stenger by the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.679
 flashlight a very hard blow for the 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.929
 teacher and warwick on the other hand despite 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.090
 of that January is still something broken 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.399
 currently and its definitive remains 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.070
 just as upset as before only 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.229
 now it hurts you more and they can kill you 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.930
 only the next encounter is in mid 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.840
 six is the current master of the lane 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.760
 and it is that in this battle it is difficult 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 decide a winner both champions 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.860
 they have utility and everyone is good at 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.370
 different cases however the winner 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.470
 of this meeting is that they have made a 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.479
 Lots of changes the most for jungle 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.700
 that may not directly impact on 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.170
 credit but if in your lane for the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.540
 new champions who become 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.300
 popular in the jungle and their ambushes 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.160
 The impact that keys have had is in the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.140
 changes in runes now has more 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.570
 versatility to carry your runes and has 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.489
 much improved in its mid lane the 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.280
 next encounter is in support the master 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.320
 current is lioness his challengers morgan to 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.360
 everyone got gritty in the 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.640
 chapter has passed but let's see who is 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.820
 the winner of this meeting the winner 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.350
 of this meeting is morgana as I said 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.150
 Previously , many 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.340
 changes lately and the champions 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.080
 popular in jungle have changed and that 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.239
 indirectly affects others 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.980
 lanes in particular to the support that should 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.930
 protect your ads from those ambushes 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.580
 along with the changes in the objects of 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.400
 support and its configuration routes 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.129
 morgana has been put in the entire 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.040
 make the best option as support for 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.689
 last the battle to adc this patch 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.579
 has not brought great changes for this 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:04.129
 lane so no one has arrived 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.560
 challenger kings is kept as master of the 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.140
 lane in abc these have been the stretches 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.819
 of the lane for patch 4.6 you have to 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.579
 remember that this top of champions is 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.230
 only to play in single cue 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.090
 solo qualifiers this is not 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.280
 a viable composition to play as 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.689
 team is likely that this top change 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.670
 a little bit because of the patches that lightning 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.069
 I could do however in the next 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.849
 chapter we will be up to date luck and 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.959
 until next time 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.959
 chao chao
