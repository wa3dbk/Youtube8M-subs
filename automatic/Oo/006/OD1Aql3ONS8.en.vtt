 of his goodies boys we go to 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.070
 one.com man o my god already the name 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.869

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.440
 changed 4 trolling item koman by tells a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.090
 minecraft gect idem explain national des 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.280
 troyes play nation 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.300
 I ask him watch foundation I don't need it 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.190
 jets of water and snow to see them then 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.680
 we have the first one that already has a very name 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:56.699
 particular is called thruway bo tnt 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:59.120
 so probably launch at tnt that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.120
 cool 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.380
 I'm launching random tnt from that 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.549
 which I know these explosions do not generate 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.010
 objects that therefore fall practically 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.159
 it also reduces the lag from what it has 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.159
 said i already then ok let's find 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.090
 something else perfect then we have it 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.860
 squid bloc 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.369
 let's see what the program does a 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.369
 break 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.910
 the troll and it is so if more is an infinity 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.530
 of written boys who remain for one 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.170
 fifty seconds on the ground like this 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.860
 stacked to break the balls ok 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.890
 let's go ahead Umbrian cable hours and this 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.690
 already says everything cannot be broken 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.570
 boy imagine you find yourself in front of 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.760
 a gold is so beautiful and you want to go 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.900
 to undermine it perhaps with a con and no si si 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.960
 breaks 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.160
 tell me if it is not a heavy finding 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.330
 maybe a milly of yours does 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.470
 treat 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.250
 then here we also have an object 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.800
 we are at the right troll block brick serves 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.190
 breeding the troll bloc he sees placed 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.840
 let's see some lightning bloc ok this 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.720
 it should be very dangerous I assume 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.920
 off a little okay if I wasn't creative 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.860
 I assume I was not dead more than madonna 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.000
 then we have knowledge of what blogs do 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.170
 Let's check 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.990
 I saw you wait no no no no wait 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.170
 first go to the mini breaks because they succeed 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.350
 because then we try to pull good 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.820
 trappolin activate 3x3 classic with the hole 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.130

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.330

 diamond set that he cannot in fact 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.170

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.310
