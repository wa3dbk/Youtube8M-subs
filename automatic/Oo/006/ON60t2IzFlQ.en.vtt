00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
to do was add sugar and water if you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.010 
to do was add sugar and water if you
don't<00:01:35.910> have<00:01:36.149> one<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.360> those<00:01:36.570> little<00:01:36.750> packets

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and they work out perfectly but in a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.230 
and they work out perfectly but in a
pinch<00:01:46.050> water<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.070> sugar<00:01:47.550> will<00:01:47.789> work<00:01:47.970> just
