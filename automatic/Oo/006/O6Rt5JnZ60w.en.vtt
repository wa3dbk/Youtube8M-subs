00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
hair as well it just looks like

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.910 
hair as well it just looks like
extensions<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.110> been<00:01:19.170> added<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> your<00:01:19.740> hair

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
especially if you have really fine hair

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.679 
especially if you have really fine hair
naturally<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.460> hair<00:01:23.909> extensions<00:01:24.360> itself

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
naturally the the hair extensions itself

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.539 
naturally the the hair extensions itself
is<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.560> amount<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.920> thickness<00:01:26.250> from<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
is the same amount of thickness from the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
is the same amount of thickness from the
top<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> bottom<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:28.020> thin

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
top to the bottom so they do not thin

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
top to the bottom so they do not thin
out<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> bottom<00:01:29.490> they<00:01:29.729> stay

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
out as you get to the bottom they stay

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960 
out as you get to the bottom they stay
thick<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.380> bottom<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> weft<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.759> it's

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
thick at the bottom of the weft so it's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.499 
thick at the bottom of the weft so it's
thick

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
thick

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.410 
thick
throughout<00:01:33.960> evenly<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.640> thick

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
throughout evenly so if you have thick

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.390 
throughout evenly so if you have thick
hair<00:01:36.450> naturally<00:01:37.200> they<00:01:37.470> blend<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.070> easily

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
hair naturally they blend really easily

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.080 
hair naturally they blend really easily
like<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.360> very<00:01:39.689> very<00:01:40.020> thick<00:01:40.530> hair<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
like I have very very thick hair and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.020 
like I have very very thick hair and
they<00:01:42.090> blend<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:43.140> amazingly<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.729> they

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
they blend just amazingly because they

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.510

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.780 
are thick at the top all the way to the
bottom<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:49.079> real<00:01:49.409> hair<00:01:49.829> have

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
bottom just like my real hair have

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.410 
bottom just like my real hair have
actually<00:01:51.479> curled<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.170> hair<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.729> held

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
actually curled this hair and it held

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.319 
actually curled this hair and it held
the<00:01:54.780> curl<00:01:56.869> for<00:01:58.310> like<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> day<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.820> half<00:01:59.850> which

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the curl for like a day and a half which

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.770 
the curl for like a day and a half which
is<00:02:00.450> awesome<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.219> my<00:02:02.219> real<00:02:02.880> hair<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.329> curly

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
is awesome because my real hair is curly

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.319 
is awesome because my real hair is curly
naturally<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.710> will<00:02:04.890> hold<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.189> curl<00:02:05.399> forever

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
naturally so it will hold a curl forever

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.200 
naturally so it will hold a curl forever
and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210
