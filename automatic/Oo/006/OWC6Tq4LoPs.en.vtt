space that I'm gonna have - the tubing -
the<00:02:06.200> tubing<00:02:06.640> in<00:02:07.640> terms<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.660> silicone

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
the tubing in terms of the silicone

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.800 
the tubing in terms of the silicone
tubing<00:02:09.859> coming<00:02:10.190> out<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.399> there<00:02:10.579> into<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.570> pump

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
tubing coming out of there into the pump

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.509 
tubing coming out of there into the pump
and<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.320> pump<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.799> then<00:02:12.920> through<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.160> 50

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
and the pump and then through that 50

and the pump and then through that 50
foot<00:02:13.670> coil<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:17.209> I'm<00:02:17.299> also<00:02:17.450> probably<00:02:17.720> gonna

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
foot coil so I'm also probably gonna

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.009 
foot coil so I'm also probably gonna
have<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.230> figure<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.650> up<00:02:18.890> as<00:02:19.040> well<00:02:20.019> whenever

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
have to figure that up as well whenever

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.270 
have to figure that up as well whenever
I<00:02:21.140> mash<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:24.200> at<00:02:24.440> least<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.739> way<00:02:24.799> I<00:02:24.950> got<00:02:25.250> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
I mash but at least this way I got a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.009 
I mash but at least this way I got a
good<00:02:25.430> start<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.910> know<00:02:25.970> two<00:02:26.329> gallons<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.870> are

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
good start I know two gallons that are

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.750 
good start I know two gallons that are
gonna<00:02:27.109> be<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.320> here<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:27.769> gonna<00:02:28.370> be<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.489> bulk

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
gonna be in here this is gonna be a bulk

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.140 
gonna be in here this is gonna be a bulk
of<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.060> if<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.600> had<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.840> guess<00:02:30.459> my<00:02:31.459> other<00:02:31.489> parts

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
of it if I had to guess my other parts

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.640 
of it if I had to guess my other parts
gonna<00:02:32.299> be<00:02:32.390> three<00:02:32.780> gallons<00:02:35.320> it's<00:02:36.320> what<00:02:36.530> I'm

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
gonna be three gallons it's what I'm

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.099 
gonna be three gallons it's what I'm
gonna<00:02:36.739> need<00:02:37.060> or<00:02:38.060> not<00:02:38.269> three<00:02:38.540> gallons<00:02:38.930> it'll

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
gonna need or not three gallons it'll

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.690 
gonna need or not three gallons it'll
bring<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.350> up<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.530> three<00:02:39.709> gallons<00:02:40.010> like<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.340> I

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
bring it up to three gallons like I I

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.000 
bring it up to three gallons like I I
can<00:02:41.329> see<00:02:41.510> using<00:02:41.900> enough<00:02:42.200> tubing<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.709> enough

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
can see using enough tubing and enough

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.490 
can see using enough tubing and enough
everything<00:02:43.459> for<00:02:43.640> one<00:02:43.880> gallon<00:02:44.269> but<00:02:44.989> I'll

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
everything for one gallon but I'll

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.530 
everything for one gallon but I'll
figure<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:45.860> out<00:02:46.010> too<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:46.550> well<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:47.450> all

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
figure that out too as well it's all

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.490 
figure that out too as well it's all

but<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> next<00:02:49.250> step<00:02:49.430> I'm<00:02:49.610> gonna<00:02:49.730> do<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.870> I'm

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
but the next step I'm gonna do is I'm

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.390 
but the next step I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:02:51.080> fill<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:51.470> up<00:02:51.650> with<00:02:51.710> what<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.250> usually

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
gonna fill this up with what I usually

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.710 
gonna fill this up with what I usually
match<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:53.710> for<00:02:54.710> a<00:02:54.740> 10<00:02:54.950> gallon<00:02:55.100> batch<00:02:55.720> just

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
match with for a 10 gallon batch just

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.860 
match with for a 10 gallon batch just
ten<00:02:56.960> depends<00:02:57.350> on<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:58.160> amount<00:02:58.720> I'm<00:02:59.720> gonna

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
ten depends on the the amount I'm gonna

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.570 
ten depends on the the amount I'm gonna
go<00:03:00.020> through<00:03:00.230> my<00:03:00.350> notes<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.950> believe<00:03:01.340> it's

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
go through my notes I believe it's

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.410 
go through my notes I believe it's
usually<00:03:01.730> about<00:03:01.970> five<00:03:02.300> gallons<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.840> water<00:03:03.310> I

don't<00:03:56.269> know<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.570> might<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:57.050> go<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.200> little<00:03:57.290> bit

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
don't know I might just go a little bit

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.030 
don't know I might just go a little bit
below<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:58.150> and<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:01.459> way<00:04:01.610> I'm<00:04:01.730> safe<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.890> that

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
way I'll be safe too if I do to do a

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.070 
way I'll be safe too if I do to do a
smaller<00:04:05.930> batch<00:04:06.670> if<00:04:07.670> that<00:04:07.850> makes<00:04:08.090> any<00:04:08.420> sense<00:04:08.690> or

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080

look like a professional kettle if we're
going<00:05:37.529> for<00:05:37.680> looks<00:05:37.889> I'm<00:05:38.279> just<00:05:38.580> hoping<00:05:38.849> that

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
going for looks I'm just hoping that

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.519 
going for looks I'm just hoping that
they<00:05:39.180> read<00:05:39.389> correctly<00:05:39.629> and<00:05:39.990> they<00:05:40.110> work<00:05:40.289> right

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
they read correctly and they work right

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.879 
they read correctly and they work right
for<00:05:40.740> me<00:05:40.969> that's<00:05:41.969> what<00:05:42.150> I'm<00:05:42.270> hoping

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
for me that's what I'm hoping

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:52.700 
for me that's what I'm hoping
so<00:05:44.419> next<00:05:45.419> thing<00:05:45.539> is<00:05:46.490> bulkhead<00:05:49.129> coupling<00:05:51.710> and

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
so next thing is bulkhead coupling and

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.579 
so next thing is bulkhead coupling and
then<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.099> side<00:05:53.310> shoot<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:55.860> shoot<00:05:56.069> out<00:05:57.589> it's

00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:58.589 
then the side shoot to shoot out it's

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.680 
then the side shoot to shoot out it's
gonna<00:05:58.740> go<00:05:58.919> up<00:05:58.949> here<00:05:59.039> and<00:05:59.520> put<00:06:00.419> it<00:06:00.539> right<00:06:00.569> there

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
gonna go up here and put it right there

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.999 
gonna go up here and put it right there
maybe<00:06:01.339> we<00:06:02.339> can<00:06:02.639> rotate<00:06:02.819> the<00:06:03.029> mash<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:04.830> goes

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
maybe we can rotate the mash so it goes

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:11.659 
maybe we can rotate the mash so it goes
around<00:06:05.539> and<00:06:09.949> circulates<00:06:10.949> that<00:06:11.129> mash<00:06:11.339> so<00:06:11.580> it

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
around and circulates that mash so it

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.309 
around and circulates that mash so it
stays<00:06:11.879> constant<00:06:12.389> temperature<00:06:13.759> so<00:06:15.050> I'll<00:06:16.050> be

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
stays constant temperature so I'll be

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.990 
stays constant temperature so I'll be
back<00:06:16.500> when<00:06:16.620> we<00:06:16.710> had<00:06:16.800> that<00:06:16.889> done<00:06:17.099> here's<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.639> side

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
back when we had that done here's a side

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.519 
back when we had that done here's a side
port<00:06:18.330> put<00:06:18.509> on<00:06:20.719> fill<00:06:21.719> it<00:06:21.839> up<00:06:21.930> with<00:06:22.050> some<00:06:22.199> pvw

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:22.529 
port put on fill it up with some pvw

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:26.839 
port put on fill it up with some pvw
ease<00:06:22.800> well<00:06:23.389> everything<00:06:24.389> is<00:06:24.539> cleaned<00:06:24.960> off<00:06:25.849> its

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
ease well everything is cleaned off its

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.700 
ease well everything is cleaned off its
nipple<00:06:27.330> coupler<00:06:27.949> ball<00:06:28.949> valve<00:06:29.270> nut<00:06:30.270> ball<00:06:30.449> valve

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
nipple coupler ball valve nut ball valve

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.619 
nipple coupler ball valve nut ball valve
bulkhead<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:32.339> I<00:06:32.490> got<00:06:32.639> this<00:06:32.759> little<00:06:33.029> side<00:06:33.270> port

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:33.629 
bulkhead and I got this little side port

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.300 
bulkhead and I got this little side port
here<00:06:33.870> and

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.520 

well<00:06:37.310> if<00:06:37.400> I<00:06:37.490> can<00:06:37.670> demonstrate<00:06:37.790> here<00:06:38.350> do<00:06:39.350> some

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
well if I can demonstrate here do some

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.880 
well if I can demonstrate here do some
force<00:06:39.770> coming<00:06:40.100> out<00:06:40.310> of<00:06:40.430> this<00:06:40.520> wall

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.110 

so<00:06:45.890> I'll<00:06:46.010> start<00:06:46.220> recirculating<00:06:46.970> that<00:06:47.090> a

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
so I'll start recirculating that a

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.600 
so I'll start recirculating that a
little<00:06:47.420> bit<00:06:47.540> for<00:06:47.780> me<00:06:48.010> now<00:06:49.010> if<00:06:49.070> I<00:06:49.190> ever<00:06:49.310> needed

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
little bit for me now if I ever needed

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.060 
little bit for me now if I ever needed
needed<00:06:50.270> to<00:06:50.360> I<00:06:50.390> could<00:06:50.630> add<00:06:50.660> on<00:06:50.930> some<00:06:51.260> tubing<00:06:51.680> or

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
needed to I could add on some tubing or

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.540 
needed to I could add on some tubing or
something<00:06:52.370> like<00:06:52.430> that<00:06:53.710> and<00:06:54.710> just<00:06:54.740> get<00:06:55.100> good

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
something like that and just get good

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.330 
something like that and just get good
circulation<00:06:56.030> going<00:06:56.600> out<00:06:56.750> there

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
circulation going out there

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.150 
circulation going out there
granted<00:06:58.340> that's<00:06:58.460> not<00:06:58.760> gonna<00:06:59.030> be<00:06:59.210> perfect<00:06:59.750> but

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
granted that's not gonna be perfect but

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:06.220 
granted that's not gonna be perfect but
we'll<00:07:01.160> try<00:07:02.890> run<00:07:03.890> a<00:07:04.220> couple<00:07:05.150> times<00:07:05.420> we'll<00:07:05.780> see

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 
we'll try run a couple times we'll see

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.320 
we'll try run a couple times we'll see
how<00:07:06.350> it<00:07:06.410> goes

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
how it goes

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330 
how it goes
Cheers
