00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.250
 against unemployment 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.460
 with a problem 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.980
 first missing recessive we request three points other inhabitants 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.859
 how they came from 2-1 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.859
 1 201 900 tied 2 to 2 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.749
 country where the crime 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.460
 Previous closing 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.880
 finish everything 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.970
 for good as well as bad because the palmarés of the corpse past the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.319
 decline 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.029
 if at the beginning of the first time and 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.440
 finally the palm people that the empire stole from the revamped 1 to 0 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.120
 and is that according to the forward 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.690
 but I think the virtue that the team had in that game was to maintain the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.590
 calm 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.590
 know we had 90 minutes to win the game and that's how it was 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.900
 for monago initially 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.370
 and without foundations 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.140
 very suffered 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.760
 but I think that 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.040
 well-deserved and fair winner 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.020
 last year's Saturday 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.510
 at home 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.550
 the tea party works 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.890
 we lost 1 to 0 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.230
 but do not change because it was based on a new change 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.650
 let's go to roma and turn 2 to 0 of 2 into the mouras 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.880
 missing 12 minute 2002 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.740
 look for an aerial ball that I do not know why 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 fluctuated the left side I find that position 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.780
 kicked the rainbow 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.070
 and it was a goal and it was the draw 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.810
 his numbers allowed to maintain the distance with the roma 9 points 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.380
 I started running 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.960
 it was minute 88 in the ideal companion 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.990
 the number of matches towers 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.399
 of being correct coral activity of benidorm as Mexicans rodrigo rojas 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.080
 whistles swept oasis 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.080
 I just think they noticed and we noticed in the sports portal 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.750
 in santiago de la rosa in siena 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.200
 Hassan II 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 although team 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.219
 describes the first day until the last dominator 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.910
 beating all the records 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.249
 demolish 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.649
 a championship 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.459
 after so many years of the successful attempt 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.809
 in this as an outlet for all 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.919
 I think people do not take it that way 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.619
 when I come back I remember the plane 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.569
 well it was docking many people airport of lahr port subsanasen to 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.459
 Milan 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.269
 he said we are not in the middle of dinner 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.729
 the fans 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.519
 although the communicators and 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.919
 the wolf was doing 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.699
 the same with a collective of eating crossing morals 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.899
 I never saw so many people on the internet like this after cancer and how healthy 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:50.519
 the subsidiary of marinade scarce well then that as it was 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.769
 the very important announcement 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.650
 we had asked that the interior at home be marked with that air but four 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.699
 we come to rematch yes yes 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.019
 we arrived 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.629
 atypical by josé solís this is what happens here 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.039
 It was all given 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.809
 is to know how to win 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:12.279
 tordesillas and 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:13.989
 gilles simon 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.839
 is his 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.839
 at the end of the game 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.479
 there was my father in the stands 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.909
 and stop counting on that goal 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.629
 only if you clean defender on top of him 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.629
 as to supervise the heras 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:33.959
 very happy 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.959
 Yesterday it seemed to me like this happens to Mons 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.719
 of what is said 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.289
 very happy said 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:48.099
 I am very happy to be able 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.099
 for having managed to convert 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.309
 because there I met San Siro a stadium 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:55.829
 imposing 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.289
 Costa Rican we won not serve only managed to save them 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.069
 and the rally 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.069
 I remember when that little frame comes in that imposing frame 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.929
 each trip 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.929
 for many it is much shorter for we were the two South Americans 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.559
 we give it all the staff 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:16.599
 before there were so many 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.499
 if what is being pursued 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.079
 we are her 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.860
 in kandahar a friendship and thank you 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.710
 I wish much better 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.279
 The first step was given 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:30.629
 had debuted we had won 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.840
 alignments of playing well 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.789
 and clarified that those moments 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.789
 share it with my loved ones to know 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.860
 it was very very good
