00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.340
 now we will test 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.340
 metal detector meinl about x terra 705 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.820
 the goals I prepared are sufficient 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.140
 interesting and now we look at 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.070
 what depth and which of these goals 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.780
 will detect a metal detector 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 x-terra 705 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.510
 metal detector turn on 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.440
 preloaded first search mode and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.809
 medium level set 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:58.899
 sensitivity the first goal we 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.739
 let's test this big silver ruble 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.739
 Peter's time 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.860
 19-20 centimeters to silver ruble 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.990
 similar coin later 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.530
 ruble elizabeth beautiful pretty 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.530
 coin 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.790
 same 19 centimeters next 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.650
 the goal is heavy enough for some 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.670
 metal detectors is a stack of silver 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:11.790
 rubles see how to cope with it 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:14.760
 metal detector minelab x-terra 705 15 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.180
 16 centimeters per large pile 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.459
 silver rubles 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.850
 the next chain is also quite complicated 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.020
 This is an openwork silver bracelet with 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.020
 stone inlays 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.450
 12 13 centimeters on such a bracelet and 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.050
 instrument readings are not quite stable 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.990
 although it shows that the target is from color 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.540
 metal 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:21.140
 the next target is the gold coin of the end 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:27.410
 nineteenth century 15 rubles 14 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:44.260
 centimeters another goal 25 rubles too 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:44.260
 gold 16 centimeters 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:53.500
 the next target is Peter's scales 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.500
 small silver coin 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.170
 six centimeters 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:30.200
 Another goal is also very hard it 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:48.530
 small light openwork golden 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:53.930
 Kulonchik 5 centimeters and the last goal 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:57.230
 This is a very heavy goal. 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:04.120
 woven gold chain see 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:08.170
 can meinl find it on x terra 705 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.170
 standard search program 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.520
 Here I rub pokatushki 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.900
 he doesn't see her let's try now 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:33.300
 switch to all metals possible 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.300
 we will be able to discover this goal 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.069
 here again i am a corpse and coil nothing 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:06:17.740
 happens so let's go to mode 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:06:27.250
 giu search does not work here and build 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:30.930
 metal detector just like that 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.930
 trick is obtained 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:46.500
 Unfortunately, it does not work out from the 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.500
 soil but here in discrimination mode 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:57.210
 discover such a chain with this 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.400
 metal detector fails like that 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:05.129
 get results with a metal detector 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.129
 meinl on x terra 705
