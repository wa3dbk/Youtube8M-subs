00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
really excited and I think I've got a

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.590 
really excited and I think I've got a
lot<00:04:59.510> of<00:04:59.540> potential<00:05:00.490> in<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.700> 135<00:05:02.150> division<00:05:02.510> in

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
lot of potential in the 135 division in

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.600 
lot of potential in the 135 division in
the<00:05:02.660> pros<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:03.169> think<00:05:03.470> it's<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.980> deepest

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
the pros I think it's the deepest

the pros I think it's the deepest
division<00:05:05.030> for<00:05:05.330> women<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.930> think<00:05:06.140> it's<00:05:06.410> the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
division for women I think it's the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.550 
division for women I think it's the
toughest<00:05:06.770> division<00:05:07.130> for<00:05:07.280> women<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:08.560> I'm

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560

years<00:05:31.160> being<00:05:31.370> kind<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.580> crazy<00:05:31.810> but<00:05:32.810> I<00:05:33.190> feel

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
years being kind of crazy but I feel

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.350

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
like it's all kind of come to a head

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.409

think that's why I've been training so
hard<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:39.890> I<00:05:39.979> focus<00:05:40.340> so<00:05:40.370> much<00:05:40.520> on<00:05:40.760> it<00:05:40.940> that's<00:05:41.540> why

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.439 
I put so much into this because it
really<00:05:43.520> means<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.210> lot<00:05:44.240> to<00:05:44.510> me<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.660> know
