00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.170 
right arm the legs well the legs are
pretty<00:01:43.920> even<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.700> centered<00:01:44.909> um<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
pretty even and centered um the way to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.990 
pretty even and centered um the way to
start<00:01:48.570> revolving<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.009> usually<00:01:50.430> say<00:01:50.820> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
start revolving it I usually say is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.209 
start revolving it I usually say is
start<00:01:51.329> with<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> tail<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.530> tail<00:01:53.570> unfolds<00:01:54.570> and

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
start with the tail the tail unfolds and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.530 
start with the tail the tail unfolds and
will<00:01:56.219> eventually<00:01:56.460> flip<00:01:56.969> over<00:01:57.180> when<00:01:57.420> you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
will eventually flip over when you

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.660 
will eventually flip over when you
reveal<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> wings<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.680> once<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.920> unfold<00:01:59.460> it

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
reveal the wings but once you unfold it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
reveal the wings but once you unfold it
I<00:01:59.880> usually<00:02:00.360> lock<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.840> place

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I usually lock it in place

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.020 
I usually lock it in place
just<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> little<00:02:02.340> base<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
just to be a little base and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.359 
just to be a little base and

really<00:02:10.200> simple<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.920> mean<00:02:10.950> they're<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> easiest

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
really simple I mean they're the easiest

to other seasons I mean I think one of
the<00:02:16.770> hardest<00:02:17.190> ones<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.490> digivolve<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.150> mut

think the funniest thing is that it
actually<00:04:44.110> gives<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.710> Giga<00:04:44.920> smasher

saying<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.350> as<00:05:44.680> a<00:05:44.740> child<00:05:45.070> both<00:05:46.030> of<00:05:46.330> his<00:05:46.630> that

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
saying that as a child both of his that

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.420 
saying that as a child both of his that
he<00:05:46.930> ever<00:05:47.080> had<00:05:47.200> caused<00:05:47.680> him<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.100> his<00:05:48.190> brother

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
he ever had caused him and his brother

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.420 
he ever had caused him and his brother
had<00:05:49.090> one<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.570> his<00:05:50.170> cousin<00:05:50.500> had<00:05:50.650> one<00:05:50.860> their

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
had one and his cousin had one their

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.580 
had one and his cousin had one their
wings<00:05:51.760> either<00:05:52.090> broke<00:05:52.480> or<00:05:52.510> their<00:05:52.930> jaw<00:05:53.230> either

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
wings either broke or their jaw either

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.580 
wings either broke or their jaw either
broke<00:05:54.100> I<00:05:54.730> don't<00:05:55.540> know<00:05:55.630> much<00:05:55.840> about<00:05:55.870> how<00:05:56.380> these

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
broke I don't know much about how these

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.470 
broke I don't know much about how these
would<00:05:56.770> break<00:05:56.980> but<00:05:57.130> I<00:05:57.220> could<00:05:57.400> see<00:05:57.700> how<00:05:57.970> I<00:05:58.000> guess

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
would break but I could see how I guess

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.300 
would break but I could see how I guess
over<00:05:58.750> time<00:05:58.990> they<00:05:59.200> can<00:05:59.380> break<00:05:59.530> I<00:05:59.710> mean<00:05:59.860> they're

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
over time they can break I mean they're

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.610 
over time they can break I mean they're
just<00:06:00.490> like<00:06:00.640> the<00:06:00.970> like<00:06:01.810> Pegg<00:06:02.140> gimmicks<00:06:02.560> like

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
just like the like Pegg gimmicks like

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.430 
just like the like Pegg gimmicks like
the<00:06:02.890> really<00:06:03.700> loose<00:06:03.910> joint<00:06:04.270> systems<00:06:05.110> that<00:06:05.350> you

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
the really loose joint systems that you

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.080 
the really loose joint systems that you
would<00:06:05.560> eventually<00:06:06.160> see<00:06:06.460> on<00:06:06.550> toys<00:06:06.850> where<00:06:07.000> it's

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
would eventually see on toys where it's

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.450 
would eventually see on toys where it's
just<00:06:07.210> like<00:06:07.330> a<00:06:07.570> small<00:06:08.260> little<00:06:08.620> rod<00:06:08.920> or<00:06:09.160> peg

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
just like a small little rod or peg

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.810 
just like a small little rod or peg
through<00:06:10.180> a<00:06:10.240> hole<00:06:10.480> to<00:06:10.720> hold<00:06:11.290> in<00:06:11.700> and<00:06:12.700> I

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
through a hole to hold in and I

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.160 
through a hole to hold in and I
could<00:06:12.970> see<00:06:13.120> how<00:06:13.210> this<00:06:13.390> could<00:06:13.540> break<00:06:13.750> apart<00:06:13.870> I

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
could see how this could break apart I

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.050 
could see how this could break apart I
could<00:06:14.320> see<00:06:14.500> how<00:06:14.650> this<00:06:14.800> could<00:06:14.860> be<00:06:15.340> weird<00:06:15.760> I<00:06:15.910> mean

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
could see how this could be weird I mean

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.540 
could see how this could be weird I mean
um<00:06:16.720> this<00:06:17.200> toy<00:06:17.380> is<00:06:17.680> great<00:06:17.950> I<00:06:18.070> mean<00:06:18.280> you

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
this to be like metal Greymon and stuff

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.410 
this to be like metal Greymon and stuff
so<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.890> right<00:06:27.070> way<00:06:27.250> for<00:06:28.120> like<00:06:28.270> the

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
so the right way for like the

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.080 
so the right way for like the
digivolution<00:06:29.310> gimmick<00:06:30.310> would<00:06:30.430> be<00:06:30.550> like<00:06:30.700> hold

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
digivolution gimmick would be like hold

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.520 
digivolution gimmick would be like hold
them<00:06:31.210> out<00:06:31.330> like<00:06:31.450> that<00:06:31.720> and<00:06:32.020> you<00:06:32.170> got<00:06:32.260> metal

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
them out like that and you got metal

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.700 
them out like that and you got metal
