00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209 
I didn't expect to take three minutes

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:25.059 
I didn't expect to take three minutes
now<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.810> course<00:01:22.000> yeah<00:01:23.030> it's<00:01:23.679> surprising<00:01:24.679> I

now of course yeah it's surprising I

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.819 
now of course yeah it's surprising I
surprised<00:01:25.490> myself<00:01:25.729> with<00:01:26.209> it's<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:27.049> it's<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.679> good

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
surprised myself with it's a it's a good

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.750 
surprised myself with it's a it's a good
surprise

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.090 

well<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:34.060> TT<00:01:34.480> is<00:01:34.690> something<00:01:35.080> that<00:01:35.260> suits<00:01:35.860> me

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
well the TT is something that suits me

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.450 
well the TT is something that suits me
pretty<00:01:36.400> well<00:01:36.640> because<00:01:37.480> it's<00:01:37.810> short<00:01:38.110> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
pretty well because it's short and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.390 
pretty well because it's short and
intensive<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.790> I<00:01:40.060> think<00:01:40.300> such<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.810> long<00:01:41.110> uphill

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
intensive and I think such a long uphill

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.360 
intensive and I think such a long uphill
also<00:01:42.400> suits<00:01:42.760> me<00:01:42.910> quite<00:01:43.330> good<00:01:43.870> so<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:45.040> doesn't

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
also suits me quite good so it doesn't

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.510 
also suits me quite good so it doesn't
say<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:46.050> everything<00:01:47.050> of<00:01:47.440> course<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.280> says
