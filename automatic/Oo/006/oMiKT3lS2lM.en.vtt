00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.849
 to me it is not true 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.820
 not at all 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.329
 no 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.339
 will be the last big event of the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.079
 world cycling in the classical europe 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.000
 of dead leaves even if compared to 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.280
 past the date has been brought forward to 6 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.710
 October just a week after the 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.329
 world of florence and in lombardy that 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.519
 this year it will take place on a Sunday 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.390
 departure from Bergamo in honor of happy 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.710
 gimondi and arrival in lecco after 242 km 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.479
 in recent days we have been in 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.159
 reconnaissance on the final part of the 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.379
 route together with the boys of the team 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.750
 columbia one of the formations that yes 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.520
 ranks from the start of lombardy 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.200
 this year the caravan will go towards the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.179
 Val Calepio will then cross the plain 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.369
 Bergamo and then return to the city â€‹â€‹and 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.049
 take the direction of lecco 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.880
 the first height difficulties are 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.350
 represented by the valcava pass e 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.729
 from the hill brianza 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.830
 nothing compared to what 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.679
 will wait for the runners a little further on 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.810
 first the spectacular and feared wall of 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.659
 surmount with the slopes that graze in 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.640
 some stretches 27 percent less than 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.920
 two kilometers in the woods but with 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.159
 the road that rears hard already 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.060
 in training 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.060
 but it is good 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:51.620
 orange is not even the place 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.620
 not at all 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.750
 cheyenne 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.550
 but 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.550
 to eat 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.390
 then a long and technical descent before 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.930
 face the mythical climb of ghisallo 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.760
 from the flagship valerio tebaldi 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.640
 sports director of the colombia team 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.069
 analyzes this part of the journey 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.129
 I think the two climbs are decisive 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.810
 the important ones of Lombardy not 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.989
 that is what they will do 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.150
 thinking about the wall of the selection 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.050
 we are for those who can say the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.090
 final victory 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.020
 then the next one will be the descent 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.720
 very demanding and we say the inconvenience 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.209
 will be the climb that will put a 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.910
 attimano by the last possibility that a 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.800
 slightly detached to return but then from there 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:41.730
 forward there will be a di di race 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.099
 strength already here on the lake will wreak havoc 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.950
 present with the wind because it will be a lot 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.530
 slow against then being covered for then 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.350
 get to face the last climb 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.160
 final which is the one that will decide after 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.660
 vain the race during reconnaissance in 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.640
 top of the ghisallo stop at the sanctuary 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.620
 of the Madonna of the cyclists moment of 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.060
 refueling photo ritual and also a 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.580
 moment of prayer for the religious 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.530
 Colombian runners before ascending 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.540
 in the saddle but the race day is not there 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.060
 will be stops from here we will project ourselves 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.830
 towards the decisive phase of the route e 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.079
 it will be just the last climb to 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.150
 villa vergano less than 10 km from the 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.310
 conclusion to decide the race as 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.250
 confirm the words still of tebaldi 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.350
 he saw himself widen as in all the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.140
 recent years and I think it's the thing to 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.390
 climb that will decide the gala what that 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.410
 more informal can make the difference 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.350
 to the first regular part but then 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.430
 the last kilometer and a half 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.670
 and hard with a slope is a road 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.070
 close there the runner who is more into 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.400
 shape can in the seat can decide the 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.650
 race 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.710
 I think the crucial point is this 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.140
 they serve there finally the dive towards the 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.680
 lecco goal that we will see colombia 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.010
 in lombardy but I think we have two 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.400
 three guys at the same puma duarte 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.040
 cia the tip they should be there 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.100
 because they are in good condition a 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.090
 someone for the artist world championship 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.280
 he will take noble condition as well e 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.280
 to clean up the last runs pointed out 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.340
 they are motivated so I believe we will have 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.170
 a careful and careful training of one 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.110
 part with his initials and then 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:28.580
 definitely in the end if we have how 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.470
 of ours try to have our say for 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.930
 close a technical note because on a 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.880
 path so demanding basic the 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.770
 choice of materials as explained by the 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:42.580
 colombia giacomo team mechanic 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:46.300
 roosters we have not given sets 30 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.370
 back and made the best choice 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:57.699
 a choice made above all 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:06:02.440
 of the very hard sormano wall pass 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:04.270
 this is the appointment for everyone 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.069
 cycling enthusiasts is for 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.330
 Sunday 6 October with the show 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.330
 of lombardy
