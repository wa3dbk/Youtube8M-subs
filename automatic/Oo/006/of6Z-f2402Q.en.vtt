 nozzles on the car moves lace 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.299
 first we will disable 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.040
 the fuel hose is disconnected in order 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.910
 to clean 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.750
 the pressure in the pipe because here all 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.550
 under pressure understood after which 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.770
 This part is removed here 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.430
 I have it installed at one-two-three 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:41.699
 four bolts 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.440
 then unscrew the nozzle holder 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:51.550
 he also unscrews just two 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:54.100
 bolts them easily seen here here is your 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 the bags are so worth unscrewed by two 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.229
 bolted 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.930
 after which the nozzle holder along with 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.580
 jets can safely move but 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.280
 in order to remove we need 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.920
 disconnect the injector terminal 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.240
 it is done this way 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.240
 nozzle connected 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:21.000
 pressing the button pulls out 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.760
 withstand 4 injectors 4 terminals and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.430
 neatly pull out so we 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:32.350
 removed the nozzles along with the service holder 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.310

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.640
 carburetor cleaner and throw for 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.980
 In order not to allow dust and was not 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.980

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.230
 the nozzle is removed so taken 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:03.820
 12 on one side 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:03.820
 blade and here they take off 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.939
 for shift bag 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.010
 in order to 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.270
 Strengthen the nozzle I took the charger 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.120

 install the nozzles in place 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.190
 so that nothing touched the nozzle science 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:50.639
 so that our works were not in vain 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:57.889
