00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.600
- Here's another thing that
keeps me from getting places.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.066
I procrastinate
all the time.

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.600
Do you procrastinate?
Yeah.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
Today I want to talk about
procrastination.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.366
You know what?
I'll talk about it tomorrow.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.166
[laughter]

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.133
Let's play "Heads Up!"
instead, okay?

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.133
[cheers and applause]

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.566
You want to play too?

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.500
All right, so I'm gonna play
with each and every one of you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.233
one at a time
individually,

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:29.333
'cause we'll get to know
each other that way.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.600
Our strengths,
our weaknesses.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.866
Is that good?

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.866
No.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.866
[cheers and applause]

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.933
I'm being told--

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.200
I'm being told
by Mary

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.766
that we cannot play
one at a time,

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.900
so I'll play
with everybody at once.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.366
All right.
That's what we'll do.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.466
So that'll save time, because
when you think about it...

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.400
Okay.
Stand up, everybody.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.033
We're gonna play
together.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:55.100
And the category
is animals, and--

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.700
So you can't talk.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.166
You can't say,
"It's a zebra,"

00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.400
or, you know, but--

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.866
'cause then I'd go,
"It's a zebra,"

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.166
so you have to, like--

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.700
I don't know how you'd act
like a zebra.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.900
I hope there's not one
on here,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.700
'cause I would
just say horse.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.933
Anyway, so for the first time
in history,

00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.400
I am not going to pass,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.000
so I'm gonna try
to get each and every one.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.300
So you have to act out
the animal, okay, everybody?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.700
You can make sounds.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.700
I want to--

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.066
[tablet dinging]

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.233
Oh, no.
Something happened.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:26.733
Wait, stop.
Stop, stop it.

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:27.733
Oh, okay.
Okay, good.

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.800
Go.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.866
[audience roars]

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.566
It's a lion!
It's a lion.

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.566
[cheers and applause]

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.566
Yeah.

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.233
[audience trumpets]

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:38.233
Oh, it's an elephant.

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:40.933
Yes.
It's an elephant.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.066
[audience hisses]

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.233
Oh, it's a snake.
It's a snake.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:48.233
[audience hooting]

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:57.266
It's a monkey
or a gorilla.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:00.300
[people shouting]

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.966
It's a fish!
Dory, yes.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.900
Oh, it's a long, big,
high neck.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.033
It's a giraffe.

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:13.633
[cheers and applause]

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:19.866
Oh, it's a shark.
It's a shark.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:24.066
[audience roaring]

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:35.066
It's a gorilla.
A gorilla.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:36.366
A bear, a bear!

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:38.333
[cheers and applause]

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:39.933
[audience barking]

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:43.700
A doggy, a doggy.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.233
[laughter]

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.200
[tablet dinging]

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.366
It's a turtle.

00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:52.566
[cheers and applause]

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:57.466
Flamingo!

00:02:57.466 --> 00:02:59.600
[cheers and applause]

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.766
Is that it?

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:04.100
Wonderful.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.466
That was wonderful.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:07.900
You got them all.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.333
[cheers and applause]

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.066
We did it!

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.566
Y'all were great.
