00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.770
 hello everyone my name is earl and gÃ³mez 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.450
 I am seer later display men and in the 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.030
 today's video we're going to see how to migrate a 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.719
 of hcp server from windows server 2003 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.510
 towards windows server 2012 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.190
 I have this process set up, I have 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.660
 my environment configured with a machine 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.750
 virtual in windows server 2003 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.670
 r2 and a standard windows server 2012 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.670
 so let's see what the process is like 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.260
 and I have my virtual machine with windows 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.219
 server 2003 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.219
 as we can see 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.089
 with service pack 3 and it's an ere 2 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.610
 so what we 're going to see is that I have 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.680
 an hcp will be here 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.489
 already configured with a scope already 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.649
 done as we can see here I have 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.500
 an area already ready and is delivering 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.049
 ip addresses to our network what 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 let's do is set our 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.899
 sorry to migrate our domain to windows 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.580
 server 2012 by means of a few simple 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:16.810
 commands in a system console 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.630
 then for it 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.900
 let's open a command prompt 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.480
 in this command prompt 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.200
 we are going to 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.210
 type first I will change language 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.350
 so that it takes the keyboard to us we are going to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.570
 type net sh 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.760
 we take the command we tell you about hcp 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.620
 in hcp let's specify the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.740
 server from which we are going to export 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.540
 our hcp server configuration will 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.060
 we say server 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.800
 so it's the cows and the address 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.570
 ip or the name of our server in 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.820
 this case the ip address of our 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:04.090
 windows server 2012 is 100 192 168 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.670
 points 0.1 and we give you enter here we are going to 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.950
 specify the next parameter of 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.879
 the following commands we are going to export 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.879
 sports 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.970
 the unit of a unit that I already have 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.220
 mounted on my server to pass the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.410
 file that we will generate from my 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.860
 server windows server 2003 to 2012 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.130
 let's in the unit of 2 points is the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.280
 dge and let's name it windows 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.819
 server 2003 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.120
 from hcp 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.489
 and we passed the parameter to him 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.219
 Export all the configuration we give 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.200
 enter and we will wait for the command 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:47.440
 finish correctly 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.959
 as we see are four commands very 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.340
 basic here we see that it was completed with 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:57.879
 success the first is net sh 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.830
 the second is from hcp and the third 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.860
 we specify server with the ip address 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.370
 from our server that has the hp 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.319
 assembled at this time and with export and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.110
 we specify a route to save the 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.549
 file with the parameter all if we go to 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.970
 look in our unit with the end and 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:21.129
 let's see that we already have the file 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.510
 ready to be taken to the other server 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.870
 we can pass it by network 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.740
 I'm going to do it by means of a unit 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.040
 for which I am going to disassemble my unit 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.290
 here in my virtual machine that I already have 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.770
 connected out there is coaching we're going to 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.770
 remove it 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.020
 and I'm going to now to my server I'm going to ride 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.460
 my unit and I'm looking for you I'm commenting 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.460
 what do I have configured 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.260
 I'm going to assemble my unit where I already have the 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.330
 response file to the created file 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.940
 with 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.060
 the configuration here in my windows 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.940
 server 2002 in 2012 I already have installed 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.040
 the role of hcp as you can see I have it 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.450
 ready the last thing we're going to do is 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.730
 complete the configuration we are going to 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.950
 authorize our server and let's 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.990
 give it next and we will confirm 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.690
 authorize our dhcp server in 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.209
 windows server 2012 in the normal process 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.530
 to add the role of hcp 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.590
 we give it close and we give it close here 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.110
 then to continue 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.970
 we leave we also open a symbol of 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.970
 system in our windows server 2012 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.360
 as an administrator if you can 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.740
 and what we are going to do now we are going to 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.930
 confirm that our unit is 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.050
 mounted as we see it here we have it 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.629
 list also now with the letter ey 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.879
 we have the file that we bring from 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.530
 windows server 2003 then what 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.289
 let's do it again with the 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.960
 net command sh 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.960
 we started the hcp cousins 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.839
 we are in hp tells us a question that 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.389
 Microsoft recommends that you move to windows 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:14.020
 by chelsea and currently use ssh to 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.610
 configure and manage hp service 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.009
 we can see normally perform the 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.540
 configuration and we're going to explain the 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.210
 server parameter 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.920
 so that the cows and now the 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:32.560
 ip address of my server 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:35.080
 windows server 2012 which is 05 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.139
 let's enter and here what we're going to do 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.539
 is to pass the import command 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.479
 with the path where the file is from and 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:52.610
 how is the file called two points for 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:52.610
 what is lars and windows server 2003 from hcp 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:06:01.449
 and we passed the command or the parameter 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:01.449
 we 're going to enter 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.000
 and let us hope that we 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.560
 end the command as we see here we 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.010
 says that the command was completed 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.320
 correctly we already have our 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:20.030
 dhcp server imported to our 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.050
 windows server 2012 we came out with the 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.320
 command exit and exit again we are going to 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.419
 corroborate and let's see if as we have 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.670
 our hcp we can tools 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.980
 we open our hcp console 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.340
 let's see what configuration we have 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.340
 now 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:47.410
 and as you can see we have our same 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.410
 scope of hcp with the same 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.190
 address set that 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.919
 we specify on our server 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.500
 windows server 2012 then as we see 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:07:00.520
 It is very easy to import and 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.350
 Exporting our dhcp server from 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.400
 windows server 2003 to windows server 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:09.370
 2012 I hope it will be very helpful 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.410
 this video and see you in a 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.410
 next time until soon
