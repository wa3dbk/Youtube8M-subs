the<00:03:16.950> next<00:03:17.100> thing<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.520> try<00:03:17.730> are<00:03:17.940> these

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the next thing I have to try are these

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.090 
the next thing I have to try are these
Chiclets<00:03:18.630> tiny<00:03:19.050> size<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.680> I'm<00:03:19.740> not<00:03:19.860> sure<00:03:20.010> if

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
Chiclets tiny size and I'm not sure if

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.890 
Chiclets tiny size and I'm not sure if
these<00:03:20.220> are<00:03:20.280> even<00:03:20.670> American<00:03:21.210> they're<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
these are even American they're in the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.660 
these are even American they're in the
American<00:03:22.320> store<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.770> I'm<00:03:22.890> assuming<00:03:23.370> they<00:03:23.490> are

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
American store so I'm assuming they are

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.860 
American store so I'm assuming they are
but<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.060> think<00:03:24.240> they're<00:03:24.360> like<00:03:24.480> little<00:03:24.750> tiny

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
