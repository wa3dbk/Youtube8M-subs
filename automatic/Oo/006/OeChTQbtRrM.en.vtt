aluminum<00:00:09.240> cases<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:09.990> think<00:00:10.260> three<00:00:10.530> words

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
aluminum cases and I think three words

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.100 
aluminum cases and I think three words
summarize<00:00:11.309> their<00:00:11.580> direction<00:00:12.110> simplicity

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
summarize their direction simplicity

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.499

missed over my last several reviews as

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.980 
missed over my last several reviews as
really<00:00:23.519> getting<00:00:23.789> your<00:00:23.880> hands<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.600> full

really getting your hands on this full
aluminum<00:00:25.590> frame<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.340> very<00:00:26.670> satisfying<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.599> of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
aluminum frame is very satisfying and of

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.839 
aluminum frame is very satisfying and of
course<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.410> gotta<00:00:28.590> pay<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> premium<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.699> Lee

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
course you gotta pay the premium for Lee

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.030 
course you gotta pay the premium for Lee
and<00:00:30.000> Lee<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.390> they<00:00:30.869> still<00:00:31.199> keep<00:00:31.349> production<00:00:31.650> in

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and Lee as they still keep production in

but let's see if Leonie managed to pack

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.439 
but let's see if Leonie managed to pack
enough<00:00:49.320> functionality<00:00:50.010> into<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.850> case<00:00:51.090> to
