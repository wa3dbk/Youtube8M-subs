hi<00:00:25.780> team<00:00:26.050> this<00:00:26.260> is<00:00:26.440> Chris<00:00:26.650> Abraham<00:00:27.040> from<00:00:27.220> go

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
hi team this is Chris Abraham from go

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.240 
hi team this is Chris Abraham from go
math<00:00:27.670> today<00:00:28.150> we're<00:00:28.570> going<00:00:28.660> to<00:00:28.750> work<00:00:28.960> with

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
math today we're going to work with

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.010 
math today we're going to work with
inequalities<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.460> number<00:00:30.910> lines<00:00:31.120> first<00:00:31.660> I

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
inequalities and number lines first I

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.160 
inequalities and number lines first I
want<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.040> be<00:00:33.160> able<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.600> understand<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.720> basics

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
want to be able to understand the basics

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.390 
want to be able to understand the basics
of<00:00:35.610> taking<00:00:36.610> inequality<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:37.570> grafting<00:00:38.110> it<00:00:38.400> so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
of taking inequality and grafting it so

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.500 
of taking inequality and grafting it so
let's<00:00:39.670> just<00:00:39.760> start<00:00:40.180> with<00:00:40.300> if<00:00:40.630> I<00:00:40.780> had<00:00:41.020> X<00:00:41.400> is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
let's just start with if I had X is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.060 
let's just start with if I had X is
let's<00:00:43.510> say<00:00:43.780> X<00:00:44.260> is<00:00:44.739> less<00:00:45.430> than<00:00:45.820> 2<00:00:46.890> how<00:00:47.890> would<00:00:48.040> I

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
let's say X is less than 2 how would I

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.180 
let's say X is less than 2 how would I
represent<00:00:48.610> that<00:00:48.670> graphically<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:50.739> I<00:00:50.949> would

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
represent that graphically well I would

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.530 
represent that graphically well I would
have<00:00:51.309> an<00:00:51.460> I<00:00:51.670> have<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:51.879> number<00:00:52.120> line<00:00:52.390> here<00:00:54.540> and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
have an I have a number line here and

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.229 
have an I have a number line here and
let's<00:00:55.720> give<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.110> values<00:00:56.650> like<00:00:57.060> let's<00:00:58.060> say

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
let's give this values like let's say

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.180 
let's give this values like let's say
this<00:00:58.810> is<00:00:59.020> 2<00:00:59.520> 3<00:01:00.750> 4<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:02.140> lut<00:01:02.920> values<00:01:03.430> like<00:01:03.820> 1<00:01:04.690> 0

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
this is 2 3 4 and lut values like 1 0

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.050 
this is 2 3 4 and lut values like 1 0
and<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:06.460> on<00:01:06.490> negative<00:01:07.410> now<00:01:08.820> thinking<00:01:09.820> about

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
and so on negative now thinking about

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.570 
and so on negative now thinking about
this<00:01:10.240> in<00:01:10.450> terms<00:01:10.660> of<00:01:11.020> what<00:01:11.770> this<00:01:11.920> means<00:01:12.220> it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
this in terms of what this means it

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.760 
this in terms of what this means it
means<00:01:12.640> I'm<00:01:13.060> looking<00:01:13.210> at<00:01:13.450> all<00:01:13.690> values<00:01:14.290> that<00:01:14.619> are

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
means I'm looking at all values that are

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.469 
means I'm looking at all values that are
less<00:01:15.009> than<00:01:15.070> 2<00:01:15.940> so<00:01:16.780> here's<00:01:17.050> 2<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:18.759> not<00:01:19.240> going<00:01:19.420> to

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
less than 2 so here's 2 I'm not going to

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.600 
less than 2 so here's 2 I'm not going to
be<00:01:19.540> including<00:01:20.110> 2<00:01:20.320> because<00:01:20.680> it's<00:01:20.860> less<00:01:21.130> than<00:01:21.430> so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
be including 2 because it's less than so

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.420 
be including 2 because it's less than so
I'm<00:01:21.700> going<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:21.910> do<00:01:22.030> less<00:01:22.330> than<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:23.160> then<00:01:24.160> all

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
I'm going to do less than and then all

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.200 
I'm going to do less than and then all
values<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:26.140> come<00:01:26.380> under<00:01:26.590> this<00:01:26.920> so<00:01:27.759> any<00:01:27.940> value

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
values that come under this so any value

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.120 
values that come under this so any value
on<00:01:28.479> this<00:01:28.750> my<00:01:29.110> number<00:01:29.470> line<00:01:29.500> maybe<00:01:29.860> I'll<00:01:30.010> pick

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
on this my number line maybe I'll pick

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.880 
on this my number line maybe I'll pick
another<00:01:30.369> color<00:01:30.670> so<00:01:30.790> it'll<00:01:31.030> be<00:01:31.150> easier<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.510> see

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
another color so it'll be easier to see

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.039 
another color so it'll be easier to see
any<00:01:32.890> values<00:01:33.460> on<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:34.060> number<00:01:34.330> line<00:01:34.510> here<00:01:35.020> that

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
any values on this number line here that

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.280 
any values on this number line here that
are<00:01:35.350> less<00:01:35.619> than<00:01:35.799> or<00:01:35.920> equal<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.670> 2<00:01:37.510> could<00:01:38.140> be

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
are less than or equal to 2 could be

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.770 
are less than or equal to 2 could be
contenders<00:01:39.720> now<00:01:40.720> if<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:41.140> was<00:01:41.380> equal<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.540> just

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
contenders now if it was equal if I just

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.270 
contenders now if it was equal if I just
did<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:43.960> line<00:01:44.170> like<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.799> would<00:01:44.890> read<00:01:45.070> X

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
did a line like that that would read X

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.120 
did a line like that that would read X
could<00:01:45.549> be<00:01:45.610> less<00:01:45.939> than<00:01:46.299> or<00:01:46.479> equal<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.110> 2<00:01:47.320> in<00:01:47.560> that

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
could be less than or equal to 2 in that

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.120 
could be less than or equal to 2 in that
case<00:01:48.189> right<00:01:48.729> there<00:01:48.760> this<00:01:49.299> dot<00:01:49.740> becomes<00:01:50.740> fully

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
case right there this dot becomes fully

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.820 
case right there this dot becomes fully
circled<00:01:51.790> in<00:01:51.939> because<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:52.990> means<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.350> includes

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
circled in because it means it includes

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.910 
circled in because it means it includes
the<00:01:54.130> two<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:58.090> I<00:01:58.119> look<00:01:58.540> at<00:01:58.689> this<00:01:58.869> problem<00:01:59.140> here

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
the two when I look at this problem here

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.940 
the two when I look at this problem here
I<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:01.210> some<00:02:01.540> value<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.080> this<00:02:02.229> 2<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.770> really

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
I have some value and this 2 is really

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.100 
I have some value and this 2 is really
throwing<00:02:03.310> me<00:02:03.549> off<00:02:03.670> but<00:02:04.060> but<00:02:04.420> let's<00:02:04.600> overlook

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
throwing me off but but let's overlook

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.679 
throwing me off but but let's overlook
the<00:02:05.320> 2<00:02:05.560> for<00:02:05.890> this<00:02:06.220> value<00:02:07.000> for<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.270> moment<00:02:07.600> this

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
the 2 for this value for a moment this

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.039 
the 2 for this value for a moment this
is<00:02:07.750> 2x<00:02:08.200> for<00:02:08.440> moments<00:02:08.829> I<00:02:09.299> think<00:02:10.299> it's<00:02:10.450> important

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
is 2x for moments I think it's important

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.140 
is 2x for moments I think it's important
to<00:02:11.110> just<00:02:11.799> looking<00:02:12.280> at<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.579> very<00:02:12.760> quickly

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
to just looking at this very quickly

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.220 
to just looking at this very quickly
realize<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.019> this<00:02:14.799> value<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.610> two<00:02:16.420> x<00:02:16.450> value

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
realize that this value this two x value

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.199 
realize that this value this two x value
is<00:02:17.410> going<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.040> be<00:02:18.160> greater<00:02:18.489> than<00:02:18.610> equal<00:02:18.910> to

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
is going to be greater than equal to

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.590 
is going to be greater than equal to
something<00:02:19.750> unless<00:02:20.440> than<00:02:20.650> something<00:02:21.040> else<00:02:21.600> so

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
something unless than something else so

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.240 
something unless than something else so
if<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.840> were<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.140> be<00:02:23.440> thinking<00:02:23.769> about<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.070> in

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
if I were to be thinking about it in

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.440 
if I were to be thinking about it in
terms<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:25.829> would<00:02:26.829> know<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.549> first<00:02:27.850> this

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
terms I would know that the first this

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.090 
terms I would know that the first this
value<00:02:28.959> here<00:02:29.440> would<00:02:30.190> be<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.610> closed<00:02:31.120> circle<00:02:31.780> and

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
value here would be a closed circle and

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.039 
value here would be a closed circle and
this<00:02:33.100> value<00:02:33.519> here<00:02:33.549> would<00:02:34.269> be<00:02:34.389> an<00:02:34.480> open<00:02:34.630> circle

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
this value here would be an open circle

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.699 
this value here would be an open circle
and<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:36.430> my<00:02:36.790> value<00:02:37.329> whatever<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.139> two<00:02:38.290> x's

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
and that my value whatever the two x's

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:39.120 
and that my value whatever the two x's
would<00:02:38.919> be

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
would be

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.120 
would be
following<00:02:39.400> somewhere<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:39.880> between<00:02:41.130> that's

circle means less than then we'd be

looking for the prop the problems that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.620 
looking for the prop the problems that
our<00:03:20.350> struct<00:03:20.710> structured<00:03:21.640> so<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:21.970> we're<00:03:22.390> have

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
our struct structured so that we're have

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.950 
our struct structured so that we're have
a<00:03:22.660> term<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.410> our<00:03:24.100> unknown<00:03:24.580> is<00:03:24.850> greater<00:03:25.780> than

a term and our unknown is greater than

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.600 
or equal to some value less than another
which<00:03:28.390> means<00:03:28.600> we<00:03:28.750> could<00:03:28.840> eliminate<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.010> D

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
which means we could eliminate a and D

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.030 
which means we could eliminate a and D
just<00:03:30.910> because<00:03:31.630> they<00:03:32.350> have<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> different

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
just because they have a different

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.270 
just because they have a different
structure<00:03:33.850> with<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.180> inequalities

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.340 
structure with the inequalities
alright<00:03:36.420> we're<00:03:37.420> jumping<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.810> gun<00:03:37.870> just

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
alright we're jumping the gun just

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.730 
alright we're jumping the gun just
slightly<00:03:39.360> if<00:03:40.360> I<00:03:40.630> want<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.110> deal<00:03:41.350> with<00:03:41.380> this

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
slightly if I want to deal with this

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.950 
slightly if I want to deal with this
inequality<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.700> best<00:03:42.940> way<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.510> best<00:03:43.720> way<00:03:43.840> to

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
inequality the best way the best way to

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.490 
inequality the best way the best way to
do<00:03:44.200> it

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
do it

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.560 
do it
to<00:03:44.890> clarify<00:03:45.130> everything<00:03:45.790> is<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.090> get<00:03:46.240> rid<00:03:46.420> of

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
to clarify everything is to get rid of

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.420 
to clarify everything is to get rid of
the<00:03:46.690> two<00:03:46.960> so<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.620> have<00:03:47.740> X<00:03:48.010> all<00:03:48.220> by<00:03:48.250> itself

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
the two so I have X all by itself

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.450 
the two so I have X all by itself
because<00:03:49.420> that's<00:03:49.690> throwing<00:03:50.050> me<00:03:50.170> off<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:51.310> what

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
because that's throwing me off so what

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.060 
because that's throwing me off so what
I'm<00:03:51.550> gonna<00:03:51.730> do<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.090> I'm<00:03:52.240> gonna<00:03:52.330> divide<00:03:52.660> by<00:03:52.900> two

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna divide by two

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.840 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna divide by two
each<00:03:54.070> term<00:03:54.580> so<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.120> keep<00:03:55.360> everything<00:03:55.720> balanced

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
each term so I keep everything balanced

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.250 
each term so I keep everything balanced
well<00:03:57.850> it's<00:03:58.030> gonna<00:03:58.180> become<00:03:58.600> negative<00:03:59.080> three

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
well it's gonna become negative three

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.150 
well it's gonna become negative three
divided<00:03:59.590> by<00:03:59.740> two<00:03:59.830> is<00:04:00.280> actually<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.790> negative

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
divided by two is actually a negative

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.000 
divided by two is actually a negative
1.5<00:04:04.290> still<00:04:05.290> greater<00:04:05.800> than<00:04:05.920> or<00:04:06.190> equal<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.850> X<00:04:08.010> but

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
1.5 still greater than or equal to X but

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.210 
1.5 still greater than or equal to X but
less<00:04:09.430> than<00:04:09.959> 0.5<00:04:10.959> everything<00:04:11.590> gets<00:04:11.770> divided<00:04:12.040> by

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
less than 0.5 everything gets divided by

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.780 
less than 0.5 everything gets divided by
two<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:13.240> inequalities<00:04:14.050> don't<00:04:14.380> flip<00:04:14.790> you

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
two the inequalities don't flip you

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.240 
two the inequalities don't flip you
would<00:04:15.940> only<00:04:16.330> flip<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.780> inequalities<00:04:17.500> if<00:04:17.739> you

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
would only flip the inequalities if you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.630 
would only flip the inequalities if you
were<00:04:18.370> dividing<00:04:18.670> by<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:19.390> negative<00:04:20.049> two<00:04:20.560> if<00:04:21.340> you

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
were dividing by a negative two if you

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.550 
were dividing by a negative two if you
were<00:04:21.760> dividing<00:04:21.970> by<00:04:22.150> negative<00:04:22.240> two<00:04:22.840> what<00:04:23.380> that

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
were dividing by negative two what that

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.440 
were dividing by negative two what that
would<00:04:23.710> do<00:04:23.860> is<00:04:23.980> that<00:04:24.010> would<00:04:24.190> flip<00:04:24.640> these<00:04:24.880> values

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
would do is that would flip these values

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.680 
would do is that would flip these values
and<00:04:25.720> then<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.710> would<00:04:26.830> become<00:04:26.980> X<00:04:27.910> is<00:04:28.240> less<00:04:28.660> than

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
and then it would become X is less than

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.100 
and then it would become X is less than
or<00:04:28.900> equal<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.560> negative<00:04:30.250> 1.5<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.960> know

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
or equal to negative 1.5 and you know

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.050 
or equal to negative 1.5 and you know
less<00:04:32.590> than<00:04:32.820> 0.5<00:04:34.950> so<00:04:35.950> that<00:04:36.100> you<00:04:36.190> only<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.910> only

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
less than 0.5 so that you only you only

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.750 
less than 0.5 so that you only you only
flip<00:04:37.540> when<00:04:37.690> it's<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.900> negative<00:04:38.340> all<00:04:39.340> right<00:04:39.580> so

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
flip when it's a negative all right so

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.660 
flip when it's a negative all right so
what<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.660> have<00:04:40.990> here<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.650> new<00:04:41.950> statement<00:04:42.990> X<00:04:43.990> is

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
what I have here is a new statement X is

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.280 
what I have here is a new statement X is
greater<00:04:45.670> than<00:04:45.970> or<00:04:46.180> equal<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.780> negative<00:04:46.960> one

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
greater than or equal to negative one

what<00:04:52.539> would<00:04:52.659> that<00:04:52.689> look<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.370> well<00:04:54.370> I'm<00:04:54.639> gonna

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
what would that look like well I'm gonna

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.469 
what would that look like well I'm gonna
graph<00:04:55.150> it<00:04:55.360> now<00:04:55.539> practice<00:04:56.379> graphing<00:04:56.860> it<00:04:57.479> let's

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
graph it now practice graphing it let's

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.820 
graph it now practice graphing it let's
see<00:04:58.750> here<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.259> my<00:04:59.439> key<00:04:59.710> points<00:05:00.219> are<00:05:01.830> negative

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
see here and my key points are negative

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.170 
see here and my key points are negative
one<00:05:03.099> point<00:05:03.400> five<00:05:03.639> and<00:05:04.949> one<00:05:05.949> positive<00:05:06.340> 1/2

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.249 

pause<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.479> what<00:05:10.629> happened<00:05:11.099> and<00:05:12.870> what<00:05:13.870> what<00:05:14.199> do

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
pause it what happened and what what do

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.100 
pause it what happened and what what do
I<00:05:14.319> know<00:05:14.439> about<00:05:14.590> those<00:05:15.039> points<00:05:15.780> well<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.810> know

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
I know about those points well I know

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.140 
I know about those points well I know
that<00:05:17.289> X<00:05:17.770> here<00:05:18.189> is<00:05:18.280> going<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.460> be<00:05:18.580> greater<00:05:18.939> than

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
that X here is going to be greater than

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.020 
that X here is going to be greater than
or<00:05:19.240> equal<00:05:19.419> to<00:05:20.189> 1.5<00:05:21.189> so<00:05:21.460> what<00:05:21.610> does<00:05:21.699> that<00:05:21.729> mean

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
or equal to 1.5 so what does that mean

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.080 
or equal to 1.5 so what does that mean
open<00:05:22.419> or<00:05:22.509> closed<00:05:23.099> greater<00:05:24.099> than<00:05:24.340> equal<00:05:24.909> to

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
open or closed greater than equal to

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.959 
open or closed greater than equal to
means<00:05:25.419> that<00:05:25.629> it's<00:05:25.779> closed<00:05:26.229> and<00:05:26.789> it's<00:05:27.789> going<00:05:27.909> to

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
means that it's closed and it's going to

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.740 
means that it's closed and it's going to
be<00:05:28.090> values<00:05:28.539> that<00:05:28.810> are<00:05:29.020> greater<00:05:29.710> than<00:05:29.860> that

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
be values that are greater than that

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.589 
be values that are greater than that
well<00:05:32.159> then<00:05:33.159> it<00:05:33.370> says<00:05:33.669> X<00:05:34.090> is<00:05:34.650> less<00:05:35.650> than<00:05:35.680> 0.5<00:05:36.599> now

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
well then it says X is less than 0.5 now

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.529 
well then it says X is less than 0.5 now
it's<00:05:37.930> less<00:05:38.469> than<00:05:38.770> which<00:05:38.979> means<00:05:39.219> it's<00:05:39.430> open<00:05:40.000> and

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
it's less than which means it's open and

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.540 
it's less than which means it's open and
then<00:05:41.529> all<00:05:41.680> values<00:05:42.189> that<00:05:42.400> are<00:05:42.550> less<00:05:42.819> than<00:05:44.550> so

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
then all values that are less than so

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.429 
then all values that are less than so
basically<00:05:46.000> my<00:05:46.300> X<00:05:46.569> is<00:05:46.779> going<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:46.990> fall<00:05:47.289> in

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
basically my X is going to fall in

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.570 
basically my X is going to fall in
between<00:05:47.620> these<00:05:48.009> two<00:05:48.310> points<00:05:50.159> now<00:05:51.159> because

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
between these two points now because

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.149 
between these two points now because
we've<00:05:51.819> already<00:05:52.029> analyzed<00:05:52.689> the<00:05:53.409> inequalities

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
we've already analyzed the inequalities

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.369 
we've already analyzed the inequalities
right<00:05:54.460> here<00:05:54.819> and<00:05:55.240> this<00:05:55.360> is<00:05:55.419> closed<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:56.259> this

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.379 
right here and this is closed and this

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.829 
right here and this is closed and this
is<00:05:56.529> open<00:05:56.889> we've<00:05:57.129> been<00:05:57.279> able<00:05:57.430> to<00:05:57.580> eliminate<00:05:58.000> you

00:05:58.829 --> 00:05:58.839 
is open we've been able to eliminate you

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.740 
is open we've been able to eliminate you
know<00:05:58.960> pretty<00:05:59.169> quickly<00:06:00.150> answer<00:06:01.150> choices<00:06:01.389> like

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
know pretty quickly answer choices like

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.510 
know pretty quickly answer choices like
a<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:03.150> D<00:06:04.199> I'm<00:06:05.199> looking<00:06:05.710> for<00:06:05.860> a<00:06:05.889> starting<00:06:06.339> point

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
a and D I'm looking for a starting point

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.079 
a and D I'm looking for a starting point
of<00:06:06.669> negative<00:06:06.879> 1.5<00:06:07.919> which<00:06:08.919> I<00:06:09.639> think<00:06:09.879> lends

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.089 
of negative 1.5 which I think lends

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.149 
of negative 1.5 which I think lends
itself<00:06:10.449> to<00:06:10.569> this<00:06:10.810> point<00:06:11.080> here<00:06:11.469> that's

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
itself to this point here that's

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.219 
itself to this point here that's
somewhere<00:06:12.759> negative<00:06:13.210> 1.5<00:06:13.690> is<00:06:13.900> somewhere

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
somewhere negative 1.5 is somewhere

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.519 
somewhere negative 1.5 is somewhere
between<00:06:14.440> 0<00:06:14.949> and<00:06:15.099> negative<00:06:15.250> 2<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.969> a<00:06:16.629> end<00:06:17.139> point

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
between 0 and negative 2 and a end point

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:21.390 
between 0 and negative 2 and a end point
at<00:06:17.830> less<00:06:18.430> than<00:06:18.460> 1/2<00:06:19.419> which<00:06:20.319> lends<00:06:20.889> itself<00:06:21.219> to

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
at less than 1/2 which lends itself to

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.070 
at less than 1/2 which lends itself to
