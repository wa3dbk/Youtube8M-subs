00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.670
 Limited access queen of flirting with 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.970
 firewood where they play 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.130
 the player and help themselves to capture new 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.600
 content and experiments that still not 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.300
 they are ready for launch 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.300
 in some cases they may not be 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.820
 finish 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.340
 ask us why we have the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.930
 baby in the mission above the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.149
 video game company that best 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.360
 worried about the games and a lot of 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.970
 this is to ensure that we hear from 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 listen to our comments what 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.750
 helps us to improve everything possible in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.850
 the experience of the lic force the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 time to look for the programs to try 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.829
 new idea and deconstruct the game 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.240
 The more information we send 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:14.460
 up soon you receive it we do not 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 it will be the final result 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.869
 the pp allows us to have a group 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.299
 of the passionate player of the link or laws 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.310
 to try everything we bring between 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.750
 hands while we're still 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.120
 working on them is to say what 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:35.300
 the pp in a room where he is putting 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.030
 continuous patches every week can be 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.040
 that put two or three parts were going 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.800
 testing things things exactly what 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.920
 finally on the official server 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.170
 we continue and another question is how 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.510
 the system works 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.930
 as we will often invite a 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.970
 small group of candidates for a tester 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.280
 selected according to several criteria 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.100
 until attacking the content again for 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.050
 a cycle of specific pp the testers 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.020
 guests will create an account instead of 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.190
 download the pp client and it will get 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.810
 hands to play 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.030
 when you have them to the pd you will be able to try and 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.190
 give opinions on the new champions 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.370
 game options and other content 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.650
 to help us be ready for the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.320
 official launch after the end of 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.510
 a pp cycle the testers go back to the 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.370
 list of the candidate from which we will draw 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.470
 a new group of testers for the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.840
 next cycle we do this for 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.580
 make sure that we choose the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.820
 suitable frets for what we are 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.200
 designing at this time as well as 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.580
 also increase the number of 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.590
 participants that directly influences 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.349
 in leaf of legends 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.150

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.700
 main requirements is to have a 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.940

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.310
 which means you'll have to be at a 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.739
 weather 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.910
 it takes me about two more to what 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.579
 you will have to do is review 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.290
