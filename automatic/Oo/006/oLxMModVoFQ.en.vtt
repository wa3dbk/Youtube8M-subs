00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 the gaming market here from finland 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:10.769
 It really pays 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:11.940
 Well as you know I take a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.160
 big decision in my life 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.590
 recently that it was to drop my 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.020
 work gives a piti my job and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.580
 invest in studies again as you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.080
 Do you know how I am trained in audiovisuals? 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.359
 but now I want to graduate in media like this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.730
 the media course a branching pro 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.619
 side of production of games game design 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.269
 finally several specifications inside 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.489
 Like all this information for you 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.350
 a lot of people ask me how the market is 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.850
 of games here of finland good by 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.010
 time I live here and could already 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.969
 observe that the market for games 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.000
 mostly mobile games 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.530
 smartphone these things is very strong is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.390
 very large even a lot of people are 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.940
 producing and one of the reasons 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.890
 encourages this is that in schools you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.539
 can take a course at last a course 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.969
 basic to learn for example 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.770
 game design then illustration and all that 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.050
 It's free you do not have to pay anything in 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.579
 for example a person of 23 years 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.590
 24 years who played videogame to life 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.350
 whole and have the opportunity to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.430
 learn how to make your own games 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.320
 free businessman spend a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.820
 penny of your pocket should spend with 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 the equipment but the schools 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 computers are of the latest generation to 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 who has seen my oldest videos 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.619
 where you want to show a little of the studio 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 editing room of my college when 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.060
 I was doing it and they could see that I had 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.369
 computer seven everything all end of line 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.170
 for you, your learning can not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.600
 You will be limited to life or 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.640
 tool you are using so I 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.500
 I think one of the main reasons that the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 games market more games for 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.280
 smartphones is so great because this 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.079
 tool is accessible to anyone 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.729
 yes you can win it has the interest of 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.369
 running behind the course makes your application 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.320
 who needs to be better without knowing 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.060
 bn about the subject you have a 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.009
 chance to enter was to try every 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.479
 I'm mistaken for two attempts and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.100
 can every year because there are two 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.479
 years of schooling so if the guy 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.549
 want to even enter the gaming market 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.659
 even if it's games for smartphone and me 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.060
 I think Finland is a great pole 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.100
 that all trained professionals 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.450
 in the gaming market 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.159
 So that was a decision I made. 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.810
 I really want to start getting into the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.840
 gaming market , even if it is 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.940
 from below even starting with games in 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.800
 most basic smartphones and my years 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.140
 personal games and everything to learn a 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.930
 little more about the market know 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.549
 what are the areas 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.530
 I fit better and do not really have 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.819
 a lot of notion about the process of 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.409
 creation of a game 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.879
 what are the areas for example in the area 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.219
 of the audiovisual work area 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.980
 creation I know all the steps all 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.629
 the professions all areas of my 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.010
 profession then I know which area 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.329
 I fit better of course I am 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.069
 more productive look I 'm less 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.659
 productive with the area I know what it is 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.489
 the area that I do not know then I need 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.200
 enter the gaming market and be able to know 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.400
 which area I fit the best and 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.019
 I believe the course that I'm going to do 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.639
 now the media will open my head 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.189
 for the gaming market 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.959
 as you begin to have more contact with 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.879
 the most contact with the market 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.129
 in five the companies that produce everything 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.239
 I'll start bringing the staff. 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.489

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.930

 games to start 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.290
 I think my great difficulty 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.030
 nowadays and not knowing where to go for 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.280
 col clear that I should specialize 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.629
 because I do not have the subject so I 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.120
 I want to start from the very basics 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.739
 understand how everything works and then with 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.060
 head more open with the area I 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.919

 I have the intention of showing a 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.030
 A little closer to the gaming market 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.579
 in another game that is recent but not 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.810
 so much so that the clash fans province 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.049
 must have heard that it's a game 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.340
 super addictive for iphone ipad e 16 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.780
 also trying to droid who me 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.220
 accompanies in instagram for example already 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.139
 saw some photos of the game 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.370
 long time ago because I was 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.719
 supervising the game simply 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.460
 I stopped playing because I was not 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:26.320
 achieving more is to reconcile the two 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.700
 things woke up already the library getting 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.100
 past 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.510
 only in the wholesale anyway the game is super 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.970
 addictive I recommend you want 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.070
 look for a game that looks like hell 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.860
 clash of kansas is one of them and the producer 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.540
 the game is super sky is being a burst 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.580
 here in the end is every corner that you 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.840
 For you will hear about super sky. 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.940
 nowadays one of the largest 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.610
 references on how to grow the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.620
 games in finland guys are leaving 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.020
 two days in a row 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.870
 most famous of funad with three pages of 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.270
 of respect respect the guys sold 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.830
 part of the franchise in Japan now 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.690
 then the company grew 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.520
 absurdly I think in the beginning of 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.290
 get an investment from a bank 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.270
 I do not know what was not to have information 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.980
 about this but they 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.840
 have achieved an investment of 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.430
 eight million euros and in today's 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.290
 one of the founders of the company has actions 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.210
 which are worth more than 60 million euros 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.750
 so the guys really revolutionized 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.130
 the gaming market for smartphones 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.720
 here in Finland another company is 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.160
 growing up here there are few 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.440
 people have heard that grand cru 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.850
 that the company is making super game 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.380
 naldo if I'm not mistaken I think the 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.660
 I'm a hygiene reviewer a long time 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.600
 ago and someone who knew my channel 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.340
 Send Felipe is a game that will leave 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.510
 a Finnish company and the company is 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.670
 very large and now I have also 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.680
 government investment and the company 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.900

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.340
 well cool brand of them soon and one 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.080
 company that I intend to do as well 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.790

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.020

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.430
 The companies I told you I intend to 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.810
 know more closely the market of 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.570
 work to understand how to 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.890
 power works in a certain way 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.300
 trying to enter this market also sees 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.460
 What area do I fit the best? 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.600
 finally, how is the production process 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.440
 I want to get in touch with these 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.970
 companies 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.890
 If you have any business in Brazil, let 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.260

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.370
 Brazil that you are interested in anyway 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.350
 entering the gaming market begins to 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.610
 look for local businesses and see for 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.290
 where cars start with you 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.060

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.800
 fits better if you want to play 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.000

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.530
 production of a game 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.090

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.680
 with these guys I'm sure if
