00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.029
 then win again at home as 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.420
 you wake up after entering 14 times here 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.530
 before your good audience I think it will be 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.750
 just do not believe that the last 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.309
 commitments too much things well 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.500
 and well there we had not been given 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.160
 the results but good yesterday thanks to 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.060
 this is achieved by playing well and winning the 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.250
 three points that was the most important thing 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.340
 choose to return the urban of the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.350
 first dates you agree with that 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.850
 well the truth is I do not know people say that 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.340
 that he was playing very badly 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.010
 I did not see him saying it out there I 'm not going to 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.379
 have a round night there and it looked like a 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.690
 little opaque but let's hope it is 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.460
 the starting point for many 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.140
 good things that will come for 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.210
 me and for the team so that change of 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.700
 immediate coming 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 interesting yes good we know that that already 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.840
 monterrey already happened now we are 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.310
 thinking about smoking that our next 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.540
 rival 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.540
 the equipment that covers more 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.020
 without doubly we know that monterrey is 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.670
 a team that was going to propose the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.740
 two months that comes to put back 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.790
 calculate then out there for me to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.370
 me for the whole team will be able to 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.380

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.090

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.390

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.719

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.280

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.340

 goals 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.830

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.180
