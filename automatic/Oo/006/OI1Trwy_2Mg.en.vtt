00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.240 
like this but you know it makes it
difficult<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:41.400> uh<00:01:41.430> yeah<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.840> using<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
difficult but uh yeah I'm using it and I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.740

really fast and it's kind of a lot of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.109 
really fast and it's kind of a lot of
recoil<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.290> kills<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> guy<00:01:56.100> pre<00:01:56.640> pretty

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
recoil but it kills the guy pre pretty

recoil but it kills the guy pre pretty
quickly<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.740> not<00:01:58.799> hard<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> kill<00:01:59.280> a

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
the game for a long time in a lot more

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.199 
the game for a long time in a lot more
weapons<00:02:40.939> like<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.659> the<00:02:42.049> UMP<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.920> p90<00:02:43.670> all

weapons like the the UMP the p90 all
those<00:02:44.540> weapons<00:02:44.780> are<00:02:45.109> probably<00:02:45.439> going<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.069> be

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
those weapons are probably going to be

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.910 
those weapons are probably going to be
very<00:02:46.459> effective<00:02:46.849> I've<00:02:47.359> heard<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.920> pp-2000

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
very effective I've heard the pp-2000

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.569 
very effective I've heard the pp-2000
with<00:02:49.159> my<00:02:49.340> peepee<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:50.329> is<00:02:50.480> pretty<00:02:50.720> good<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
with my peepee it is pretty good but the

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.080 
with my peepee it is pretty good but the
AEK<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.389> provides<00:02:53.840> what<00:02:54.079> I'm<00:02:54.200> looking<00:02:54.590> for<00:02:54.889> and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
AEK it provides what I'm looking for and

AEK it provides what I'm looking for and
what<00:02:56.090> I'm<00:02:56.209> looking<00:02:56.599> for<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.109> a<00:02:57.139> gun<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:57.769> can

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
what I'm looking for is a gun that can

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.490

shoot long distance and mid-range

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.520

makes you upset any button to anything
and<00:05:07.280> that's<00:05:07.940> already<00:05:08.720> implemented<00:05:09.560> on<00:05:09.680> a<00:05:09.710> lot

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
and that's already implemented on a lot

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.610 
and that's already implemented on a lot
of<00:05:10.130> games<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:10.760> are<00:05:11.000> out<00:05:11.150> like<00:05:11.479> green<00:05:11.870> gran

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
of games that are out like green gran

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.159 
of games that are out like green gran

so<00:05:15.380> I'm<00:05:15.710> trying<00:05:15.919> to<00:05:16.070> figure<00:05:16.220> out<00:05:16.430> why<00:05:16.639> they

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
so I'm trying to figure out why they

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.250 
so I'm trying to figure out why they
haven't<00:05:17.030> implemented<00:05:17.539> it<00:05:17.780> in<00:05:17.810> these<00:05:18.020> other

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
haven't implemented it in these other

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.370 
haven't implemented it in these other
games<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:19.310> really<00:05:19.520> wouldn't<00:05:19.820> affect<00:05:20.570> too<00:05:21.110> much

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
games it really wouldn't affect too much

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.020 
games it really wouldn't affect too much
if<00:05:21.620> they<00:05:21.770> just<00:05:21.979> took<00:05:22.190> some<00:05:22.430> time<00:05:22.729> and

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
if they just took some time and

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.930 
if they just took some time and
establish<00:05:23.750> something<00:05:24.010> so<00:05:25.010> if<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:25.520> guys<00:05:25.639> could

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940
