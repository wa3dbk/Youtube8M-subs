00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689 
would just brush it back all of it going

would just brush it back all of it going
back<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.819> you're<00:03:50.030> going<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.209> dry<00:03:50.480> it<00:03:50.510> about

back and you're going to dry it about

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.869 
back and you're going to dry it about
85%<00:03:52.959> just<00:03:53.959> holding<00:03:54.499> it<00:03:54.620> like<00:03:54.799> this<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.310> just

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
85% just holding it like this and just

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:05.450 
85% just holding it like this and just
drying<00:03:56.359> it<00:03:56.650> 85

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.500 

I<00:04:06.740> don't<00:04:07.740> recommend<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.280> brushing<00:04:09.210> out<00:04:09.480> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
I don't recommend you brushing out the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.930 
I don't recommend you brushing out the
piece<00:04:09.870> when<00:04:10.110> it's<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.500> wet<00:04:10.770> because<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.400> just

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
piece when it's so wet because that just

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.480 
piece when it's so wet because that just
pick<00:04:12.420> up<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.470> just<00:04:13.800> pull<00:04:14.100> on<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.310> base

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
pick up that you just pull on the base

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.300 
pick up that you just pull on the base
cab<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.090> that's<00:04:15.360> not<00:04:15.540> very<00:04:15.690> good<00:04:16.020> for<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:19.310> okay

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
cab and that's not very good for it okay

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.220 
cab and that's not very good for it okay
so<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.550> can<00:04:20.850> brush<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:21.510> back<00:04:23.720> maybe<00:04:24.720> dry<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.170> a

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
so you can brush it back maybe dry it a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.190 
so you can brush it back maybe dry it a
little<00:04:25.410> bit<00:04:25.560> more<00:04:25.770> or<00:04:26.160> you<00:04:26.700> can<00:04:26.880> start

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
little bit more or you can start

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.440

clipping<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.770> start<00:04:29.280> drying<00:04:29.910> it<00:04:30.120> under

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
clipping it and start drying it under

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.980 
clipping it and start drying it under

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
with the round brush show you how to do

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.950 
with the round brush show you how to do

it
clip<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.680> just<00:04:41.040> blow<00:04:41.280> dry

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.309 

and<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.210> same<00:04:53.449> way<00:04:53.629> your<00:04:53.870> going<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.080> do

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
and the same way your going to do

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.939 
and the same way your going to do
throughout<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.520> sections<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.360> once<00:04:57.349> you<00:04:57.620> get

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
throughout the sections and once you get

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.879 
throughout the sections and once you get
to<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.310> top<00:04:58.639> but<00:04:59.569> I<00:04:59.599> would<00:04:59.960> do<00:05:00.139> is<00:05:00.440> I'm<00:05:00.710> going

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
to the top but I would do is I'm going

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.420 
to the top but I would do is I'm going
to<00:05:00.979> grab<00:05:01.159> the<00:05:01.370> brush<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:02.919> round<00:05:03.919> brush<00:05:04.159> it

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
to grab the brush and round brush it

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.420 
to grab the brush and round brush it
going<00:05:04.789> back<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.629> maybe<00:05:06.379> kind<00:05:06.740> of<00:05:06.860> angle<00:05:07.280> to

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
going back and maybe kind of angle to

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.029 
going back and maybe kind of angle to
the<00:05:07.580> direction<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.210> want<00:05:08.449> it<00:05:08.629> to<00:05:08.750> go<00:05:08.960> so<00:05:09.800> maybe

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
the direction you want it to go so maybe

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:37.510 
the direction you want it to go so maybe
I<00:05:10.430> would<00:05:10.970> do<00:05:11.180> it<00:05:11.740> something<00:05:12.740> like

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.830 

so<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.669> is<00:05:38.789> something<00:05:39.000> like<00:05:39.150> a<00:05:39.330> finished

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
so this is something like a finished

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.369 
so this is something like a finished
look<00:05:40.909> however<00:05:41.909> if<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:42.449> want<00:05:42.629> to<00:05:42.720> make<00:05:42.930> it<00:05:43.110> more

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
look however if you want to make it more

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.490 
look however if you want to make it more
flatter<00:05:44.189> or<00:05:44.759> more<00:05:45.360> straight<00:05:45.840> you<00:05:46.139> can<00:05:46.319> use<00:05:46.469> a

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
flatter or more straight you can use a

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.619 
flatter or more straight you can use a
little<00:05:46.800> bit<00:05:46.860> of<00:05:46.919> flat<00:05:47.189> iron<00:05:47.300> maybe<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.449> little

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:48.629 
little bit of flat iron maybe a little

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.770 
little bit of flat iron maybe a little
bit<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.900> her<00:05:49.080> spring<00:05:49.409> not<00:05:49.800> so<00:05:50.009> strong<00:05:50.780> and

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
bit of her spring not so strong and

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.689 
bit of her spring not so strong and
maybe<00:05:52.110> some<00:05:52.409> shine<00:05:52.710> but<00:05:53.039> it<00:05:53.129> really<00:05:53.310> doesn't

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
maybe some shine but it really doesn't

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.450 
maybe some shine but it really doesn't
the<00:05:54.330> piece<00:05:54.599> already<00:05:54.930> has<00:05:55.349> a<00:05:55.379> natural<00:05:55.919> shine<00:05:56.159> to

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
the piece already has a natural shine to

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.119
