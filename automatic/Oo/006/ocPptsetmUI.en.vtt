may<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.770> fishing<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.310> pond<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.970> I've<00:00:18.330> got

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
may be fishing a pond like I've got

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.000 
may be fishing a pond like I've got
right<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.050> front<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.380> me<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.800> might<00:00:19.980> be

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
right in front of me here you might be

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.990 
right in front of me here you might be
fishing<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.640> little<00:00:20.880> stream<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:22.789> some<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
fishing a little stream and some of the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.670 
fishing a little stream and some of the
techniques<00:00:24.449> are<00:00:24.750> obviously<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> little<00:00:25.529> bit

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
techniques are obviously a little bit

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.099 
techniques are obviously a little bit
different<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.390> first<00:00:27.630> thing<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.930> want

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
different and the first thing you want

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.570 
different and the first thing you want
to<00:00:28.140> do<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.500> you're<00:00:28.680> fishing<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.130> pond<00:00:29.369> I'm

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
to do if you're fishing a pond I'm

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.530 
to do if you're fishing a pond I'm
assume<00:00:29.910> you're<00:00:30.119> fishing<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> small<00:00:30.840> pond<00:00:31.140> are<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
assume you're fishing a small pond are a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.850 
assume you're fishing a small pond are a
little<00:00:33.540> lake<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.140> you're<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.440> fish<00:00:34.649> off

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
little lake and you're going to fish off

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.360 
little lake and you're going to fish off
the<00:00:34.890> bank

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the bank

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.299 
the bank
well<00:00:35.760> don't<00:00:36.480> walk<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> bank<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:38.129> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
well don't walk up to the bank like I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.490 
well don't walk up to the bank like I
just<00:00:38.370> did<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.600> because<00:00:40.050> there's<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
just did right there because there's a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.790 
just did right there because there's a
darn<00:00:41.040> good<00:00:41.219> chance<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.840> fish<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.379> right

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
darn good chance that the fish are right

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.580 
darn good chance that the fish are right
here<00:00:44.340> most<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> people<00:00:45.660> come<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
here most of the people come out to the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.180 
here most of the people come out to the
bank<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.100> they<00:00:47.700> rare<00:00:48.539> back<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.590> throw

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
bank and they rare back and they throw

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.639 
bank and they rare back and they throw
it<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.550> far<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.079> see

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
it as far as they can out there I see

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.910 
it as far as they can out there I see
that<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> time<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:55.050> splashes<00:00:55.530> out

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that all the time and it splashes out

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.470 
that all the time and it splashes out
there<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.789> know<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.030> happens

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
there and then I don't know what happens

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.160 
there and then I don't know what happens
after<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> point<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.649> there's<00:00:59.059> the<00:01:00.170> right

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
after that point but there's the right

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470 
after that point but there's the right
now<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.620> very<00:01:01.890> unlikely<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.760> fish<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.359> out

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
now it's very unlikely the fish are out

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.969 
now it's very unlikely the fish are out
there<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> middle<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.530> unless

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
there in the middle of that unless

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.280 
there in the middle of that unless
there's<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.369> brush<00:01:06.299> pile<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.900> something

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
there's a brush pile or something

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.399 
there's a brush pile or something
they're<00:01:07.560> right<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.040> look<00:01:08.280> at<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> grass

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
they're right here look at the grass

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.990 
they're right here look at the grass
look<00:01:10.409> at<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.560> grass<00:01:10.650> all<00:01:11.189> along<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.670> Bank

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
look at the grass all along this Bank

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
look at the grass all along this Bank
look<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.659> neat<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.140> point<00:01:13.500> right

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
look at that neat little point right

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.980 
look at that neat little point right
there<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.950> nice<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.640> point<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.240> little

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
there a nice little point here little

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.090 
there a nice little point here little
bit<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.439> where<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> ought<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.920> be

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
fishing you ought to fish the heck out

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.390 
fishing you ought to fish the heck out
of<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.040> I've<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> little<00:01:20.909> small

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
of this and I've got a little small

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.060 
of this and I've got a little small
plastic<00:01:23.479> stick<00:01:24.479> bait<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.619> thing<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
plastic stick bait on in the thing I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520 
plastic stick bait on in the thing I
would<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.330> would<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.689> walk<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.200> Bank

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
would do is I would just walk this Bank

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190 
would do is I would just walk this Bank
fishing<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.790> bank<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.750> there

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
fishing down the bank not out in there

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.249 
fishing down the bank not out in there
and<00:01:31.500> I'd<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.939> worm<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> grass<00:01:33.900> or

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and I'd have that worm in that grass or

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.010 
and I'd have that worm in that grass or
in<00:01:34.320> front<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> grass<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.689> where<00:01:36.990> I

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
in front of the grass and that's where I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.780 
in front of the grass and that's where I
would<00:01:37.320> catch<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.770> bass<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.340> yours

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
would catch that bass this is yours

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.469 
would catch that bass this is yours
shears<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:40.320> at<00:01:40.670> some<00:01:41.670> point<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.150> would

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
shears can be now at some point I would

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.090 
shears can be now at some point I would
start<00:01:42.840> throwing<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.409> crank<00:01:43.680> bait<00:01:43.920> out

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
start throwing a little crank bait out

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.219 
start throwing a little crank bait out
there<00:01:44.130> I'd<00:01:45.119> do<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.479> same<00:01:45.750> thing<00:01:45.780> with<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
there I'd do that same thing with a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.249 
there I'd do that same thing with a
crank<00:01:46.560> bait<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.640> found<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.540> brush

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
crank bait and if I found up a brush

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.950 
crank bait and if I found up a brush
pile<00:01:49.619> out<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.130> then<00:01:50.340> I'd<00:01:50.520> fish<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.270> but
