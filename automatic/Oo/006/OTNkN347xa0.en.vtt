00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380

experience<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:08.099> nice<00:00:08.280> thing<00:00:08.309> about<00:00:08.550> it

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
experience and the nice thing about it

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.459 
experience and the nice thing about it
too<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.300> mean<00:00:09.450> even<00:00:09.719> though<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.960> twins<00:00:10.230> can

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
too is I mean even though the twins can

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.810 
too is I mean even though the twins can
aim<00:00:10.650> their<00:00:10.889> dive<00:00:11.070> kick<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.460> many<00:00:11.670> directions

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
aim their dive kick in many directions

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.509 
aim their dive kick in many directions
if<00:00:12.750> they<00:00:12.929> aim<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.380> just<00:00:13.830> right<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.309> it

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
if they aim it just right so that it

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.010 
if they aim it just right so that it
hits<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.969> top<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.299> your<00:00:15.450> head<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.839> beat

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
hits you on the top of your head to beat

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.779 
hits you on the top of your head to beat
your<00:00:16.170> jab<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.770> means<00:00:17.010> they're<00:00:17.220> too<00:00:17.400> high<00:00:17.609> up

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
your jab that means they're too high up

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.939 
your jab that means they're too high up
to<00:00:17.970> combo<00:00:18.359> right<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.020> hit<00:00:19.500> low<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> have

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
to combo right so you hit low to have

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.160 
to combo right so you hit low to have
them<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.490> could<00:00:20.640> maybe<00:00:20.789> throw<00:00:21.180> them<00:00:21.420> well<00:00:21.930> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
them you could maybe throw them well you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.840 
them you could maybe throw them well you
probably<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.529> throw<00:00:22.710> them<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.430> should<00:00:23.670> be

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
probably can throw them you should be

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.250 
probably can throw them you should be
able<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.119> throw<00:00:24.330> some<00:00:24.689> people<00:00:24.990> might<00:00:25.109> be

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
able to throw some people might be

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.929 
able to throw some people might be
overthrown<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:25.680> they<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.519> he<00:00:26.580> hits<00:00:26.789> really

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
overthrown but they if he hits really

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.330 
overthrown but they if he hits really
high<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.869> better<00:00:28.109> yet<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.439> mean<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:28.859> they<00:00:28.920> try

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
high but better yet I mean if they try

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.859 
high but better yet I mean if they try
to<00:00:29.400> combo<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.939> fail<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.359> might<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.630> able<00:00:30.689> to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
to combo and fail you might be able to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.889 
to combo and fail you might be able to
uppercut<00:00:31.289> fadc<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.099> between<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.480> yeah

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
uppercut fadc in between like that yeah

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.299 
uppercut fadc in between like that yeah
for<00:00:34.200> sure<00:00:34.230> you'll<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.680> able<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.160> your
