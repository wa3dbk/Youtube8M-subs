instance if you look at multiple top
player<00:01:38.070> scores<00:01:38.549> you'll<00:01:39.150> see<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.079> tried

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
player scores you'll see that they tried

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.850 
player scores you'll see that they tried
multiple<00:01:40.860> multiple<00:01:41.790> hundreds<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> times<00:01:42.869> to

multiple multiple hundreds of times to

multiple multiple hundreds of times to
get<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.220> map's<00:01:44.520> score<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.780> might<00:01:46.020> be

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
get that map's score now you might be

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.170 
get that map's score now you might be
saying<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.890> shippi<00:01:47.250> they're<00:01:47.579> top<00:01:47.820> players

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
saying but shippi they're top players

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.899 
saying but shippi they're top players
they're<00:01:48.659> top<00:01:48.930> plays<00:01:49.320> yes<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.490> they're<00:01:50.610> so

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
they're top plays yes but they're so

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.760 
they're top plays yes but they're so
pushing<00:01:51.299> themselves<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.470> much<00:01:52.619> as

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
pushing themselves just as much as

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.230 
pushing themselves just as much as
another<00:01:53.009> player<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.610> trying<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.119> their

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
another player is trying to get their

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.330 
another player is trying to get their
top<00:01:54.450> score<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:55.170> anything<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> top<00:01:56.070> player

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
top score if anything the top player

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.550 
top score if anything the top player
might<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.700> pushing<00:01:56.850> themselves<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:58.409> bit

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
might be pushing themselves a little bit

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.950 
might be pushing themselves a little bit
harder<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.610> still<00:02:00.060> means<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.689> both

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
harder but that still means that both

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660 
harder but that still means that both
players<00:02:01.290> are<00:02:01.500> pushing<00:02:01.860> themselves<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
players are pushing themselves to get a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
players are pushing themselves to get a
score<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.119> they're<00:02:03.240> both<00:02:03.329> working<00:02:03.659> towards

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
score and they're both working towards

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.830 
score and they're both working towards
it<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.500> why<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.490> bad<00:02:05.670> player<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.240> blame<00:02:06.540> for

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it so why is the bad player to blame for

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.859 
it so why is the bad player to blame for
retrying<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.770> song<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.910> only<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.629> top

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
retrying a song the only way that top

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.300 
retrying a song the only way that top
players<00:02:10.110> are<00:02:10.289> different<00:02:10.410> from<00:02:10.679> any<00:02:10.860> farmers

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
players are different from any farmers

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.280 
players are different from any farmers
is<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:12.060> their<00:02:12.239> scores<00:02:12.510> are<00:02:12.720> worth<00:02:12.959> more

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
is that their scores are worth more

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.069 
is that their scores are worth more
and<00:02:13.560> are<00:02:13.950> looked<00:02:14.250> at<00:02:14.430> as<00:02:14.610> more<00:02:14.909> impressive<00:02:15.480> so

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
and are looked at as more impressive so

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.690 
and are looked at as more impressive so
people<00:02:16.379> don't<00:02:16.560> really<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:17.219> about<00:02:17.340> how<00:02:17.579> much

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
people don't really think about how much

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.819 
people don't really think about how much
times<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.239> top<00:02:18.390> players<00:02:18.629> really<00:02:18.930> retry<00:02:19.560> for

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
times the top players really retry for

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.220 
times the top players really retry for
their<00:02:19.950> scores<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.489> mean<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.849> instance<00:02:21.230> Ruchi

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
their scores I mean for instance Ruchi

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.849 
their scores I mean for instance Ruchi
has<00:02:22.409> hundreds<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.959> retries<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.230> some<00:02:25.530> songs

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
has hundreds if retries on some songs

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.800 
has hundreds if retries on some songs
just<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.459> get<00:02:26.609> top<00:02:26.819> scores<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.390> people<00:02:27.659> don't

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
just to get top scores but people don't

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.360 
just to get top scores but people don't
put<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.349> into<00:02:28.530> account<00:02:28.680> they're<00:02:29.069> like<00:02:29.189> Oh

like that's all they think they don't

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.990

think oh but this man tried three

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.990

thousand times to get this score retry

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.660 
thousand times to get this score retry
youi<00:02:39.299> know<00:02:39.659> they<00:02:40.099> there's<00:02:41.099> nothing<00:02:41.430> wrong

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
youi know they there's nothing wrong

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.420 
youi know they there's nothing wrong
with<00:02:42.030> people<00:02:42.599> like<00:02:43.200> they<00:02:43.560> don't<00:02:43.739> care<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.040> he

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
with people like they don't care that he

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.220 
with people like they don't care that he
tries<00:02:44.670> multiple<00:02:45.180> times<00:02:45.389> to<00:02:45.569> get<00:02:45.659> a<00:02:45.720> score<00:02:45.989> just

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
tries multiple times to get a score just

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.399 
tries multiple times to get a score just
because<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.799> top<00:02:47.040> score<00:02:47.750> that's<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.989> only

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
because it's a top score that's the only

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.979 
because it's a top score that's the only
difference<00:02:49.799> between<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.459> top<00:02:51.090> player<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
difference between a top player and a

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.649 
difference between a top player and a
farmer<00:02:52.409> that<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.430> only<00:02:53.669> difference

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
farmer that is the only difference

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.839 
farmer that is the only difference
now<00:02:55.530> another<00:02:55.769> reason<00:02:56.040> why<00:02:56.340> people<00:02:56.700> think

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
now another reason why people think

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.030 
now another reason why people think
farming<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.569> such<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> bad<00:02:58.169> thing<00:02:58.200> which<00:02:58.769> is

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
farming is such a bad thing which is

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.789 
farming is such a bad thing which is
kind<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.430> weird<00:02:59.579> um<00:02:59.939> they<00:03:00.840> think<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.290> takes<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
kind of weird um they think it takes the

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.679 
kind of weird um they think it takes the
fun<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.189> the<00:03:02.340> game<00:03:02.370> now<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:03.359> know<00:03:03.569> if
