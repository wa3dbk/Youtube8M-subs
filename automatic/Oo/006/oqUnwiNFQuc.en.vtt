00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.070
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.850
 I'll show you how to use a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.670
 USB memory instead of a hard drive 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.250
 for our wifi mainly due 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.070
 that hard disks are a bit 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.199
 expensive sometimes we get more 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.110
 easy to use a usb since we have 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:50.010
 better access to it I 'm going to show you 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.410
 how to start using it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.949
 the first step will be to go to the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.300
 console configuration we 're going to 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.300
 go to data management 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.850
 let's put in the part that says 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.300
 format a usb device 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.960
 storage 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.970
 is going to format the usb device 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.970
 so that it can be used with the console 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.329
 then we connect in the bottom 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.479
 here we have our usb memory is 8 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.200
 gigas and we will insert it in the part 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.200
 from here back 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.820
 ready 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.310
 in the gamepad we will continue 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.320
 is checking the device has been 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.390
 connected a usb device 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.430
 storage that is not configured 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.950
 to use with this console you want 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.170
 format it follow 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.659
 the save data will be deleted 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.549
 This USB device once erased does not 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.899
 you can recover for sure you want 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.899
 format it yes 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.640
 completed process 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.770
 then let's try it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.610
 and here it appears in our 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.890
 usb device 1 the amount of megabytes 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.240
 available 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.030
 for use there is no data we are going to 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.080
 transfer some of our memory 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.080
 of the wii 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.219
 we catch 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.620
 dt glass roll we give in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.720
 transfer or copy several 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.720
 let's transfer prince royce 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.980
 and we are going to transfer 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.130
 lux that is we never use it then 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.130
 we put in transfer 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.030
 has to transfer all the data of 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.080
 programs selected to the device 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.680
 usb 1 yes 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.370
 here is transmitting us we are waiting for 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.370
 I finished 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.130
 once it is over we will appear this 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.510
 the data has been transferred to 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.050
 USB device 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.050
 we are going to need 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.890
 and it already appears here on the device 1 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.459
 our data 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.890
 this super mario bros transfer 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.220
 and we select them 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.220
 to transfer 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.770
 we give the yes 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.660
 it's the same procedure with any 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.260
 Program 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.580
 then right now we are going to start it 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.580
 so they can see how it works 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.900
 we accept 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.050
 we go back 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.240
 this helps us to free up space in 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.870
 the hard drive of our guild and we 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.520
 our games appear in the same way 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.550
 but the difference is that they are already 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.940
 within memory this is a way 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.370
 to use a usb instead of a disk 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.750
 hard 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.850
