00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.290
 and 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.470
 or not 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.160
 today is one of those days in which life 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.660
 nothing gives me today is one of those days 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.910
 in which I deserve a cake of which 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.860
 I care today is a cloak day today and 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.450
 I do not see the light they changed the door of the 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.880
 Tunnel making me immune to your magnificent 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.560
 attitude today is a day feeling cut 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 the leaves and the wind I feel that without 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.559
 Looks god charges me promptly 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.600
 the lease of this body of 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.250
 rent that they have not allowed me to choose 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.200
 see I did not come here to complain but it's 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.030
 it's hard to watch the time run today is 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.130
 an empty day of which I do not know and I'm staying 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.780
 in bed today is a lost day I'm 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.370
 made a mess in front of this panorama in 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.140
 the slope that goes up to your house there is a 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.030
 dog that barks if you pass alone wants 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.760
 sleep on your branch and make your bed a 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.739
 tabula rasa pass spend the hours pass 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.180
 and they devastate with everything that 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.610
 somehow remember the warmth of your house 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.770
 behind this shell there is no trace of 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.140
 my heart lost the reason a trick for 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.360
 the threats of a better future I would 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.400
 I imagine she was sent by divine order 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.800
 it's true that your body did not work well for me 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.110
 trance came to me so I do not guess another 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.790
 way to continue to complain once 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.080
 in and to mask what always in 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.540
 rap form today is a day 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.580
 no end all things go wrong everything 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.620
 it is dark only cyanide as a remedy 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.080
 traditional today is that I do not care 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.940
 I swear it's a total step so that I burn 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.710
 blood if it is impossible well then stop 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.660
 to be today is one of those days in which 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.280
 it seems that it never dawns to stay in the 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.020
 Sleeping bed is the only sit that I 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.090
 I feel like today I feel like a whipper 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.860
 my boss touched me because 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.440
 has preferred to make this Friday a 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.330
 fucking bad of sheen grow grow grow up 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.040
 my breasts seem to grow once 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.320
 walk through a world different from this one that 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.420
 it happens to us today I do not feel like it 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.070
 raised in a very good mood it seems that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.740
 I started that neither god nor the judges 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.300
 you hear my silly voice so much older point 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.740
 but I'm such a fool for now 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.720
 look like a month and then you have to see what 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.370
 I'm sorry I assume it and I face it 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.470
 but it is impossible to stay to look 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.150
 when without warning and suddenly I write a 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.250
 day when everything is going bad today 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.290
 I present my division could with me this 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.900
 fun that pollutes my canines 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.060
 persuasion maneuvers I'm one more of the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.160
 bunch of this walking herd 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.590
 irremediably and watch the years go by 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.140
 I'm still broken here at times and today 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.550
 is one of them like being happy with this 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.860
 rope tied on the neck 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.290
 as being the owner of my life I'm not 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.280
 I who decide the moments to be 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.350
 happy or not 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.090
 tell me how long this madness lasts 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.880
 transitory because I think I 've 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.920
 tired of traveling on the wheel if today 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.290
 I only know that it would be better for me 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.740
 take refuge one of these days in the heat of 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.740
 your mattress 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.850
 ah
