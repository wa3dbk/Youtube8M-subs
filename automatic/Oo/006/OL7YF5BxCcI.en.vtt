00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.959
 welcome to this tutorial where I'm going 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.490
 show you how to cover a book and 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.380
 especially in this period of re-entry 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.480
 how to cover a textbook 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.080
 since you know it at each school year 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.730
 all textbooks must be covered 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.300
 to start you need three things 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.460
 a piece of protective plastic a 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.970
 pair of good scissors a roll of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 Scotch 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.200
 if you need it you can 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 also use a clipboard me 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.059
 I used taxes to be able to hold 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.120
 the plastic for the plastic and you 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.920
 have a lot of kinds store of course 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 never take self-adhesive paper 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.879
 it tears and covers when I 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 finally withdraws from friends so avoid too 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 the first prices that go and and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.429
 very very hungry plastic granular and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 who are not going to adhere to the books and 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.370
 who will tear themselves away very quickly in 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.469
 satchels so preferred rather in 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.070
 somewhat thicker plastic and the appearance 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.900
 smooth it will be fine we go 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.440
 so start 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.440
 we will unroll the plastic 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.520
 there is coming that use fangs of the small 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:25.620
 paperweight to be able to hold it 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:28.890
 you will put your book on the 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.100
 plastic taking care to leave to 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.260
 about 5 cm on each side of the book 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.490
 down on the side then you turn 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.250
 the book to have its exact size 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.540
 same thing let you 5 cm down on 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.190
 the side and bone 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.670
 so we could then cut your 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.670
 plastic 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.710
 then, as we are in the autumn period 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.960
 you may have a lot 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.610
 book to cover and textbooks 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.060
 are generally about the same 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.790
 cut 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.670
 so when you understand you 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.410
 can then as the past you 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.020
 just cut in order to cut the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.500
 other pieces 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:28.370
 I will then place the book on the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:36.050
 plastic with the back of the book against 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:38.750
 I'm going to take both sides of 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.930
 plastic one connected together to make 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.930
 like a little pouch I'll put 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:51.350
 the book first place and then I'm going 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.850
 use the pair of scissors with the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.520
 scissors I'm going to make a triangle in 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.310
 done i'm going to cut here cut in 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.340
 under the same thing on the other side 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.750
 done the same I cut the see here are 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.480
 cut the book of course and the bottom 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.200
 like that I put the back of the book 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.530
 against me I take the first sheet 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.080
 of plastic and I'm going to slip it under 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.650
 the first of france book champion 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.519
 and I'm going well folded here it's the same 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.140
 thing behind 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.140
 I turn my god 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.030
 once I did that I'm going to prepare 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.740
 my scotch I took anti 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.060
 rollers that is not weighted so when 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.060
 I will take it automatically 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.320
 he will fall so to help me I 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.730
 precut my scotch 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.730
 if I stick them to the edges of the same 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:05.480
 then here I take the side I do I 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:11.100
 make a triangle compliant the plastic 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:17.730
 I'm fine then I'll flip the 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:19.580
 side inside then we have greenhouse have 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.770
 very practical 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.890
 I take the tape and I will stick it 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.170
 on the plastic and not on the book 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.640
 if there is information here about 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.680

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:47.820
 I'm doing it and on the other side I'm doing 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:54.510
 and where I bend well and bring everything back to 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:58.680
