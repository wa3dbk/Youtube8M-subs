 typical of france the quiche lorraine 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.469
 to an infinite number of variants entered choice 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.469
 a 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.490
 we begin to brown the bacon with the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.170
 his fat on a low heat 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.000
 as soon as it has reached a beautiful 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.150
 colorful turn off and leave 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.220
 cool we grate the mentals in 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.270
 this way to make it then merge well 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.400
 during cooking 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.840
 we can also cut it to small 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.970
 cubes if we prefer, I call it the eggs 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.000
 with pepper and a sprinkle of walnut 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.000
 nutmeg 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.690
 add the milk for one 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.800
 lighter preparation of the recipe 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.540
 original includes the cream from the kitchen 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.730
 open the brisÃ¨ pasta that one foderiamo 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.159
 baking mold does not need to be buttered 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.530
 because we use the parchment paper of pasta 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:08.960
 same the original recipe requires in 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.940
 reality twice the first is pasta 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.460
 brisÃ¨ with beans inside and la 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.479
 second putting the shelf on it for us 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.010
 we will do all together first 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.070
 let's start putting emmental cheese 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.400
 on the bottom without crushing it then the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.400
 bacon 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:34.369
 and finally the eggs with the milk we beat 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.350
 good for smoking near this point 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.540
 we cut the pasta in excess e 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.539
 we fold the one left to form a 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:50.240
 world we prick the bottom with a 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:52.009
 knife and here is our result 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.170
 sister is ready to go to the oven at 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.170
 180 degrees for about 30 minutes 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.460
 once cooled we can 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.649
 implant it and then serve it as a dish 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.190
 unique or if we prefer for an aperitif 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.190
 among friends 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.489
