Hi everybody, it's Freddy Fazbear!

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.760
I wanted to do this first little annoucement

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.240
at first to tell you some important things

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:18.060
and to try this kind of videos even if it don't really need a lot of experience. ^^

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.100
So I begin with the important things.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.400
so!

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.933
This is primarily about Survive The Night.

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:30.233
A lot of you asked me to do an animation on this song.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.540
Well, it's my favourite FNAF song so

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.780
I had, as soon I begin, the project to do an animation for Survive The Night.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.860
BUT...

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.640
For people who don't see my last post on the preview,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.960
I am actually waiting for the MandoPony's authorization

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.120
before continuing my work.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.660
Simply for my conscience

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.880
and simply to respect the MandoPony's work.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.300
So it's may be... uh...

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.980
It may be the same for some of my next projects

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.140
like The Show Must Go On

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.660
(what are the others &gt;&lt;)

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.840
It's Time To Die,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.673
It's Been So Long.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.000
Well.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.640
So, Survive The Night is not canceled

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.380
I am continuing to try to contact MandoPony

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.940
he still doesn't answer me.

00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:43.113
(So I will continue to try...)

00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:45.493
I won't abandon Survive The Night.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.580
So you may have other videos before his release

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.620
because I will begin some projects I have in my mind

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.400
and which were supposed to be released after.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.980
That's all for the news.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.140
I want to thank you for the 10.000 subscribers!

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.660
We probably passed them now.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.573
It's...

00:02:07.573 --> 00:02:08.753
It's incredible

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:09.953
I really want to thank you all.

00:02:09.953 --> 00:02:11.713
I never thought it will increase so fast!

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.680
Incidentally, I never thought it would increase.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.920
Simply.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.960
I really really want to thank you!

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.820
To do so, I had an idea

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.440
I will upload a questionnaire

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.920
in the description.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.480
Then you can vote for the video you want me to do next.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.633
It may be...

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:36.813
a FNAF short,...

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:37.933
a SFM tutorial,...

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:41.273
I will give you some option of course.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.720
And you will vote for the next video you want to see.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.700
It will be the next video after this one

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.000
So it will be a little video before my next big project!

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.660
So i really wanted to thank you,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.440
that's really incredible.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.500
Then...

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.520
That's all I wanted to say.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.060
I want to thank you again and again

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.360
I hope that...

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.800
I hope you won't be too disappointed

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.520
to know that Survive The Night is in pause but you have to know that I am

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.480
I had so ideas. TwT

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.300
It's a problem among some others.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.860
But I won't give up, I hope Mandopony will hear me

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.794
and I hope Survive The Night will be released in the future.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.260
So, I leave you now and I'll see you soon on Freddy Fazbear's SFM!

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.040
Good bye guys!
