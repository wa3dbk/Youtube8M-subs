all of them only available for the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
all of them only available for the
operator<00:01:31.829> class<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.429> is<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> little<00:01:33.359> bit<00:01:33.479> odd

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
operator class which is a little bit odd

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.639 
operator class which is a little bit odd
when<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.929> would<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.140> been<00:01:34.229> better<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.469> they

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
when it would have been better if they

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.380 
when it would have been better if they
spread<00:01:34.979> them<00:01:35.069> out<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.700> they're

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
spread them out a little bit but they're

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.380 
spread them out a little bit but they're
only<00:01:36.509> available<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:38.130> class<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.210> let's

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
only available for one class so let's

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.450 
only available for one class so let's
take<00:01:39.569> a<00:01:39.600> look<00:01:39.840> at<00:01:40.020> each<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> those<00:01:40.710> weapons<00:01:41.039> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I'm gonna leave that for separate videos

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.319 
I'm gonna leave that for separate videos
when<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.319> go<00:01:49.499> over<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.889> weapons<00:01:50.329> individually

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
when I go over the weapons individually

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.779 
when I go over the weapons individually

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
so let's start off with the l85 first

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.520 
so let's start off with the l85 first
thing<00:01:53.969> that<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.149> noticed<00:01:54.569> was<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> reload<00:01:55.289> time

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
thing that I noticed was the reload time

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.940 
thing that I noticed was the reload time
and<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.780> horribly<00:01:57.780> okay<00:01:58.319> it<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.499> horrible

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and it is horribly okay it is horrible

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.139 
and it is horribly okay it is horrible
when<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.280> run<00:01:59.429> out<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.579> bullets

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
when you run out of bullets

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.660 
when you run out of bullets
it<00:02:00.270> takes<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.810> 4.2<00:02:01.560> seconds<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> reload

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it takes up to 4.2 seconds to reload

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.669 
it takes up to 4.2 seconds to reload
that's<00:02:02.819> a<00:02:02.969> lot<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.270> time<00:02:03.479> especially<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
that's a lot of time especially in a

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.620 
that's a lot of time especially in a
hardline<00:02:05.100> where<00:02:05.340> things<00:02:05.670> go<00:02:05.999> a<00:02:06.030> lot<00:02:06.329> faster

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
hardline where things go a lot faster

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.199 
hardline where things go a lot faster
including<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> time<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.920> kill<00:02:08.160> compared<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
including the time to kill compared to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.210 
including the time to kill compared to
battlefield<00:02:09.840> 4<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.560> having<00:02:10.740> an<00:02:10.890> assault<00:02:11.160> rifle

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
battlefield 4 so having an assault rifle

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.520 
battlefield 4 so having an assault rifle
that<00:02:11.670> takes<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:12.060> long<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> reload<00:02:12.930> isn't

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that takes that long to reload isn't

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.980 
that takes that long to reload isn't
really<00:02:13.920> worth<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.640> my<00:02:14.700> opinion<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.780> fire

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
really worth it in my opinion the fire

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.290 
really worth it in my opinion the fire
rates<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.710> l8

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
rates on the l8

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.410

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
is 670 rounds per minute which is good

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.510 
is 670 rounds per minute which is good

a3<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.790> that's<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.180> for<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> l85<00:03:05.990> let's<00:03:06.320> move

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
a3 so that's it for the l85 let's move

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.670 
a3 so that's it for the l85 let's move
on<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.130> next<00:03:07.250> one<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.760> car<00:03:08.170> 556<00:03:09.170> that's<00:03:09.530> a

on to the next one the car 556 that's a

new one straight away you're gonna see

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.680 
new one straight away you're gonna see
it<00:03:12.350> has<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.620> strong<00:03:13.250> resemblance<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.360> ace23

it has a strong resemblance to the ace23

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.080 
it has a strong resemblance to the ace23
from<00:03:15.230> battlefield<00:03:15.680> 4<00:03:15.740> and<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.160> know<00:03:16.250> what<00:03:16.490> it

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
from battlefield 4 and you know what it

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.330 
from battlefield 4 and you know what it
actually<00:03:17.120> performs<00:03:18.110> pretty<00:03:18.350> damn<00:03:18.740> similar<00:03:19.070> to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
actually performs pretty damn similar to

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.210 
actually performs pretty damn similar to
it<00:03:19.460> as<00:03:19.550> well<00:03:19.790> it's<00:03:20.390> got<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.660> fire<00:03:20.960> rates<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.500> 700

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
it as well it's got a fire rates of 700

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.670 
it as well it's got a fire rates of 700
rpm<00:03:22.760> which<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.120> ideal<00:03:23.510> at<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:23.959> ranges<00:03:24.200> it's

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
rpm which is ideal at all ranges it's

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.800 
rpm which is ideal at all ranges it's
very<00:03:25.190> accurate<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.850> very<00:03:26.150> easy<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.540> control

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
very accurate and very easy to control

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.620 
very accurate and very easy to control
and<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.410> reload<00:03:27.740> times<00:03:28.040> are<00:03:28.250> ok<00:03:28.940> they're<00:03:29.360> ok

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
and the reload times are ok they're ok

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.610 
and the reload times are ok they're ok
they're<00:03:29.660> not<00:03:29.930> good<00:03:30.140> they're<00:03:30.290> not<00:03:30.320> bad<00:03:30.590> they're

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
they're not good they're not bad they're

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.520 
they're not good they're not bad they're
ok<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.060> just<00:03:32.180> one<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.540> those<00:03:32.810> really<00:03:33.350> good

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
ok so it's just one of those really good

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.190 
ok so it's just one of those really good
