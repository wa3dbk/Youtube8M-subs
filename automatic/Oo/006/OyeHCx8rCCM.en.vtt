second<00:00:50.969> part<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.719> piece<00:00:52.070> when<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> did<00:00:53.280> was

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
second part of the piece when I did was

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.910 
second part of the piece when I did was
to<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> shooter<00:00:54.270> every<00:00:54.510> three<00:00:54.780> seconds<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.890> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
to the shooter every three seconds so I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.729 
to the shooter every three seconds so I
i<00:00:56.190> shouldn't've<00:00:57.090> select<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> sixties

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
i shouldn't've select out of the sixties

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.139 
i shouldn't've select out of the sixties
photographs<00:00:59.609> to<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.539> 24<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.980> she<00:01:02.879> thought

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
photographs to about 24 that she thought

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.109 
photographs to about 24 that she thought
made<00:01:03.390> sense<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.899> terms<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.710> giving<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:05.820> kind

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
made sense in terms of giving some kind

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
made sense in terms of giving some kind
of<00:01:06.260> idea<00:01:07.260> about<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> sequence<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
of idea about the sequence of the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.719 
of idea about the sequence of the
movements<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.299> she<00:01:09.360> did<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
movements so she did and then I and the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.469 
movements so she did and then I and the
work<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.200> made<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.439> 12<00:01:13.860> sets<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.580> couple<00:01:15.240> two

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
work was made up of 12 sets a couple two

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
work was made up of 12 sets a couple two
photographs<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.610> actually<00:01:17.610> followed<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
photographs that actually followed the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.499 
photographs that actually followed the
secrets<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> dance<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.790> plotting<00:01:21.150> system

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
secrets of the dance the plotting system

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.830 
secrets of the dance the plotting system
is<00:01:21.630> simply<00:01:22.430> bought<00:01:23.430> into<00:01:23.580> shape<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.659> the

is simply bought into shape of the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320 
is simply bought into shape of the
object<00:01:24.960> over<00:01:25.470> time<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
object over time but it's all in the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.609 
object over time but it's all in the
large<00:01:27.570> piece<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.259> plot<00:01:28.560> them<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.920> deep<00:01:29.040> actual

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
large piece I plot them and deep actual

time sequence of the dance and in these

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.390 
time sequence of the dance and in these
I<00:01:36.350> randomize<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.560> sequence<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> photographs

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
I randomize the sequence of photographs

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.469 
I randomize the sequence of photographs
and<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.290> did<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> same<00:01:40.560> climbing<00:01:41.130> system

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
and I and I did the same climbing system

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
and I and I did the same climbing system
