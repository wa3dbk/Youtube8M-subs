00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello dear friends of the daughter of this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.400
 a new rubric on the channel in which i and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.319
 my friends will check various 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.660
 myths and interesting tricks related to 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.969
 the mechanics of the game dota 2 and 1 myth narrates 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 that tranquil boots and work is 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.130
 continues to heal properly, we'll go 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.109
 it seems rather strange and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.210
 Now we check it I have 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.019
 tranquils as you see and now you are me 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.599
 do hang your ultu and as you see 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.220
 thought to take health away but including 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.189
 including my 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.140
 continue to heal that is tranquillo 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.260
 they work properly they don’t get lost 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.920
 and only punches me so hard 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.230
 because 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 worship house is on the third level 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.030
 pumping, that is, if he had ulta 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.340
 there was a first level maybe a tank would lead 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.770
 interrupted ulta completely and she 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.390
 actually less wear no damage 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.520
 but if this damage of course was he 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.100
 would be insignificant and can be safely 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.910
 say something that tranquil boots and some 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.489
 degrees 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.590
 kontrit an ulta of a thought why so 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.439
 it happens quite interesting and I 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.640
 he did not immediately figure it out as 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.080
 ulta doom blocks inability 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.290
 item abilities but not his 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 characteristic as for example take 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.670
 manta that is if doom hang on us 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.549
 we have an ulta manta we ca n't 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.100
 use her ability to add 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.810
 us 2 illusions however boost to speed 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.170
 from manta will work as it is 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.979
 boost is her characteristic also her 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.150
 countries curves 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.960
 that is, this origen is a characteristic 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.630
 tranquillo 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.000
 and so she work continues to work 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.790
 also 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.860
 ulta duma knocks a gene and you ask but 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.750
 why probably a coward is a theme 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.990
 characteristic no it really 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.560
 also his abilities are therefore doom 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.479
 blocks this gene and think with this myth 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.100
 you can finish it was pretty 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.840
 interesting I think it can be real 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.149
 somehow abuzit in the pub and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.490
 and we continue and the next myth sounds 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.799
 so you can not finish the enemy tank 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.780
 its ability uos now we have it and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.550
 check for this we need it ourselves 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.580
 shadows with his ability 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.260
 any other character ally but this 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.959
 for this purpose may be suitable 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.959
 and in principle, and a diver who can 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:23.040
 finish off the natural 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.299
 Now we’ll go through this little bit 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.720
 let's leave a little hepe 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.540
 and you will see if you can finish this product 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.769
 skill shadow 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.150
 can now be demonstrated 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.909
 I throw in the arch and 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.560
 Why does the commodity achieve it? 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:45.209
 actually happening 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.000
 The fact is that this skill despite 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.060
 the fact that he has a magic damage and then I lie 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.150
 has magic resistance to this skill 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.340
 is unique meaning we throw in 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.769
 arch and well and any other character and 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.549
 deals like damage around and since 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.079
 we do not throw the goods of it creep 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:10.739
 and therefore the damage as if she is worn around 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:13.430
 This is also achieved with the help of this feature 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.010
 you can exchange your goods 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.829
 enemy all you want it can 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.930
 somehow useful to you in a real game 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.359
 because sometimes here you see what 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.370
 the enemy wants to zadeenit product and you 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.989
 We must find time and go dangerously close 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.480
 you can just throw a squeak and 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.060
 finish this tower get a gold for it 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.560
 Here is such a myth, we continue the third 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.449
 The last myth today says that 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.549
 furniture can teleport poof to 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.970
 its illusions to check 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.549
 this 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.889
 and no we will need mipo itself and its 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.449
 illusion some kind of illusion 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.560
 meaning it can be like an illusion from 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:52.650
 manty as in my case or just runes 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.590
 and people so we take the illusion away 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.980
 all of these we don’t need 50 aside 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.750
 but yuzaem second skill on this illusion, we 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.750
 we see that we are not yet successful 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.459
 teleporting mean this truthful myth 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.470
 This is quite a useful feature that 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.250
 can really help because the enemies 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.449
 can once divorce this illusion and 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.310
 you can send it somewhere 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:20.150
 on reconnaissance and teleport to her 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.709
 without risking your life and 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.690
 today we have everything 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.639
 the myths turned out to be true but it is not 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.960
 will prevent us from exposing the future and 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.500
 false to speculation 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 many doters and there are certainly many 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.870
 next release you can put 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.039
 Like if you liked the video 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.210
 subscribe to the channel leave your 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.099
 comment in which you can 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.729
 to express their opinions suggestions 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:46.220
 wishes and 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.800
 while I offer a bonus to your attention 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.560
 and this one bonus will be this bonus 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.570
 which can really help you in 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:00.320
 normal game and teach you a few things that the 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.550
 that will be useful to any mid-market and for 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.099
 the performance of this trick we need 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.020
 than and pak as you know most 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.180
 cases while goes to mid or less 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.979
 hardline and how most mide rf is needed 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.380
 bottle since it is huge 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.990
 help and on the center line for 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.630
 that the battle was always full to us 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.509
 need to control the runes or abuzit kuru 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:25.039
 but since abu speedy takes 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:27.229
 a lot of time and runes and not 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.210
 it is always possible to control successfully 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.190
 how the enemy might just be 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.530
 faster than you or as a typical situation 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.270
 for a pub you just won't have wards and 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.340
 you will not know where the rune appeared 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.810
 and check about is a waste of time we 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.400
 we can run the battle without leaving the media 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.469
 give on this we need as i have 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.630
 said what and pack ochi well us 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:50.270
 it will be his third skill that is needed 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.909
 teleport and here it is very important to turn 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.219
 attention to the delay for heroes 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:57.919
 teleportation that is on the first level 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:06:00.500
 it's six seconds at 2 5 on the third 4 and 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.750
 at the last level it's three seconds in 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.690
 what is the general meaning of this trick 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.940
 the fact is that here for example 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.310
 empty bottle we need it quick 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.500
 zabuzit and now without leaving the media yes I 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.659
 it will do the fact is that after 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.050
 how will we teleport us 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.750
 need to 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.500
 when will the teleport end 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.909
 somewhere a second or less throw an arba 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.650
 sideways now demonstrate it 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:28.009
 leave me empty bottle more often started 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.199
 port than come on 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.939
 I throw an arba teleport to base 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.469
 teleporting corby and as you see 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:36.689
 the bottle is filled up now 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:39.330
 happened to those who still do not understand 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:41.969
 after what I teleported me 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.009
 I threw the arba and since how to teleport 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:46.050
 At the base I was on the base of the field 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.490
 a little health and a bottle of mine 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.279
 filled as it is filled 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.550
 almost instantly and after that before 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:55.289
 the moment I was at the base of my arbo 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.909
 still flying and i just 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:59.309
 teleported to her that is 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:01.319
 I get one for a split second there 

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:03.059
 visited the base replenished freedom and 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:05.279
 let's move a little health but she me 

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:07.979
 was bad and so I had it to 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:10.080
 what and so can this be often 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.639
 just do the same as the rule 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.529
 it is not difficult to farm the forest here 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.819
 these sports just go and teleport 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:17.279
 we are the only ones we can 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.529
 dominate the line with this 

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:20.909
 chips since we will always be complete 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:22.769
 bottles can always lean back 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:24.569
 his work can always be occupied 

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:27.300
 If anything happens, we will not necessarily be 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:30.869
 lower the hen and spend a lot on it 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.539
 time of course when enthusiastically 

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:34.589
 level pumping teleport is small 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:36.449
 will be engaged 

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:38.909
 take a little longer time but this 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:40.409
 anyway very useful also possible 

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:42.899
 put using this somehow but 

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:45.449
 each come up with their own application of this 

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:47.729
 ability well now i can you 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:50.959
 wish only good luck wait for new ones 

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:50.959
 releases and see you soon
