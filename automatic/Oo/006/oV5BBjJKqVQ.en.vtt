pan over a medium to high heat and to

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.710 
pan over a medium to high heat and to
that<00:00:21.779> I'm<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.470> add<00:00:22.910> 75<00:00:23.910> grams<00:00:24.119> of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
that I'm going to add 75 grams of

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.320 
that I'm going to add 75 grams of
unsalted<00:00:25.289> butter<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:26.910> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.090> use

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
unsalted butter and we're going to use

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.200 
unsalted butter and we're going to use
that<00:00:28.010> making<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.340> little<00:00:29.550> bit<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.000> melts

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
that making a little bit so it melts

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.600 
that making a little bit so it melts
quicker<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.410> butter<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.800> almost<00:00:32.070> melted

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
quicker so the butter is almost melted

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
starting to thicken and that is because

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.640 
starting to thicken and that is because
the<00:02:09.039> flour<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:10.030> butter<00:02:10.209> are<00:02:11.110> cooking

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
here now you'll see we're almost smooth

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.650 
here now you'll see we're almost smooth
add<00:02:20.650> some<00:02:21.010> more<00:02:21.160> milk<00:02:21.630> then<00:02:22.630> we'll<00:02:22.810> go<00:02:22.930> again

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
add some more milk then we'll go again

now you do have to have strong arms or
strong<00:02:28.269> risks<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:29.050> this<00:02:29.230> because<00:02:29.500> they<00:02:29.769> do

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
strong risks for this because they do

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.309 
strong risks for this because they do
get<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> bit<00:02:30.340> tired<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.750> can<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.080> do<00:02:32.200> what

I do and just swap arms okay so we're

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.130 
I do and just swap arms okay so we're
going<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.420> add<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:39.010> last<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.760> milk<00:02:40.140> must

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
going to add the last of the milk must

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.170 
going to add the last of the milk must
be<00:02:41.440> flush<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:43.299> let's<00:02:43.660> correct<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.970> is

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
be flush and let's correct it this is

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.840 
be flush and let's correct it this is
quite<00:02:46.900> time-consuming<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:48.160> it's<00:02:48.370> not<00:02:48.549> fun

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
quite time-consuming and it's not fun

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.729 
quite time-consuming and it's not fun
standing<00:02:49.330> over<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.630> stove<00:02:49.870> with<00:02:49.900> skin<00:02:50.380> whisking

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
standing over a stove with skin whisking

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.280 
standing over a stove with skin whisking
with<00:02:50.920> skin<00:02:51.160> but<00:02:51.850> it's<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.420> worth<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.140> there

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
with skin but it's so worth it and there

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.750 
with skin but it's so worth it and there
are<00:02:53.380> different<00:02:53.739> consistencies<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.640> your

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
are different consistencies to your

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.110 
are different consistencies to your
sauce<00:02:54.940> like<00:02:55.180> for<00:02:55.569> now<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.190> perfect

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
sauce like for now this is perfect

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.660 
sauce like for now this is perfect
if<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.359> were<00:02:58.480> making<00:02:58.660> macaroni<00:02:59.170> cheese<00:02:59.670> this

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
if you were making macaroni cheese this

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.390 
if you were making macaroni cheese this
is<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.880> perfect<00:03:01.329> consistency<00:03:01.769> in<00:03:02.769> which<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.250> add

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
is a perfect consistency in which to add

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.539 
is a perfect consistency in which to add
your<00:03:03.700> cheese<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.799> then<00:03:05.799> your<00:03:05.980> sauce<00:03:06.160> won't<00:03:06.370> be

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
your cheese and then your sauce won't be

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.759 
your cheese and then your sauce won't be
too<00:03:06.730> thick<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.209> gloopy<00:03:07.450> but<00:03:08.410> for<00:03:08.590> something

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
too thick and gloopy but for something

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.259 
too thick and gloopy but for something
like<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> fish<00:03:09.310> pie<00:03:09.489> we<00:03:09.730> want<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.090> get<00:03:10.209> a

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
like a fish pie we want it to get a

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.780 
like a fish pie we want it to get a
little<00:03:10.450> bit<00:03:10.720> thicker<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:12.070> coats<00:03:12.310> all<00:03:12.609> those

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
little bit thicker so it coats all those

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.199 
little bit thicker so it coats all those
lovely<00:03:13.090> pieces<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.720> fish<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.790> forms<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:15.970> peas

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
in there okay so this is the consistency

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.229 
in there okay so this is the consistency
