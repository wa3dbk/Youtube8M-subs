00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.080

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.620
 day of June 1st, 2015 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.620
 naturally then for this gameplay 10 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.750
 so I'm going to take the young ones I 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.760
 will show you my foot every 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:38.300
 weapons so start with the first 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:42.360
 here I wanted to put then visor 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.500
 multi recognized and time to change on 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.640
 will do that pretty much with all your 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.640
 friends here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.210
 then this one is my favorite I 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.800
 test in zombies she is 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.910
 incredibly amazing everything 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.550
 just we're a guy I did not 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.950
 took the time to fuck that's the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:20.250
 next that I like too festive 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 and enchaÃ®nements it's a little more 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.950
 long than the others to avenches me years 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.950
 I 'm fighting for their future 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:44.429
 elton john deere 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.710
 so for this update we had 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.200
 also molotov cocktails and ccas 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.869
 grenade is also a new vehicle 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.140
 but I did not buy because I 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.909
 am a sacred time in time 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.170
 temporary so I will not buy it 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.459
 these dogs g / kg uefi tank 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.970
 so that's going to give me the time to 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:08.009
 speak I'm mostly testing the wool 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:15.270
 the news for new types of 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:18.090
 grenades cocktails molotov and edu so 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.800
 on one side it is monotonous and there it is as 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.260
 roma then the pomegranate cs 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.640
 look at it's a kind of like the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.390
 smoke do not know what they could have me 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.879
 gene 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.620
 except that it's toxic actually it's 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.530
 extremely much damage but 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.670
 unfortunately I can not show you 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.920
 it's a lot of damage 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.010
 advise to put it to the spawn of msi 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.300
 so after we have the molotov cocktail 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.690
 so it's a bit like that except it 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.030
 burns and its demand is more 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.140
 Stylish so I make climbs it's 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.030
 more stylish tell us menchov but I 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.240
 want to say it's me i'm going to show you 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.040
 it's me it's less damage 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.560
 me finally here it is finally it is our 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.340
 dynamic there is me I find I prefer 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.410
 the csh the audience here it is stylish 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.660
 when I say how I'm going 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.020
 launch these styles and the damage there are 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.020
 very weak 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.160
 I made a lie 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:22.239
 ok but then pushes yes so he 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.100
 there is a new potato launcher that it is 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.260
 rather not bad anyway 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.489
 so there are four ammunition what is 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.670
 huge compared to the big shows 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.980
 free of charge by your resources 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.050
 team it's paying not out you in 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.760
 have that in tunisia 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.760
 here you have that it is really not bad 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.690
 then you have new blocks 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.910
 but that I did not show them 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.950
 unfortunately because I forgot I 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.150
 cross beds show I wanted 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.280
 show in an upcoming video 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.110

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.940
 rent that he told me dark and three years 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.700
 after the crush surely then you 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.510
 can see that there I 'm not big 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.430
 thing I know what to play here that's me 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.230
 leave when we spoke then this bet 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.940
 up to date she was not bad but 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.280
 I would have liked a new trailer 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.260
 would have been a little 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.160
 well better if they have not been 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:22.500
 well then I would have done it directly 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:26.140
 would have been better just what but 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.100
 it must be said that what is 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.479
 there are others what is there 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.910
 others I do not know if there is 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.289
 new maps that I have not looked at and 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.820
 anyway the updates on blocks and 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.530
 I can tell you that it is rather rare 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.169
 but this is my first update 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.320
 since which two sleeves of the day but 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.479
 good it's not huge and you tell him 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.140

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.810
 really not bad 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:51.070
