typically a lot of security issues with
those<00:01:46.950> servers<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.409> performance<00:01:49.860> just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
those servers and the performance just

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.520 
those servers and the performance just
isn't<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.939> there<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.439> you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
isn't going to be there so what you

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.530 
isn't going to be there so what you
really<00:01:52.890> want<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.520> look<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.240> more

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
really want to do is look for a a more

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.330 
really want to do is look for a a more
dedicated<00:01:55.079> type<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> host<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.070> doesn't

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
dedicated type of a host and it doesn't

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.289 
dedicated type of a host and it doesn't
mean<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> dedicated

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
mean that you have to have a dedicated

mean that you have to have a dedicated

other common mistakes one of them is
planning<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:37.260> mean<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.220> sounds<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.520> a<00:03:38.640> really

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
planning I mean it sounds like a really

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.550 
planning I mean it sounds like a really
fundamental<00:03:39.300> basic<00:03:40.020> thing<00:03:40.170> right<00:03:40.350> but<00:03:40.470> if

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
fundamental basic thing right but if

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.830 
fundamental basic thing right but if
you're<00:03:40.680> gonna<00:03:40.800> build<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.160> website<00:03:41.600> spend<00:03:42.600> some

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
you're gonna build a website spend some

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.540 
you're gonna build a website spend some
time<00:03:43.050> really<00:03:43.440> planning<00:03:43.800> out<00:03:44.010> your<00:03:44.040> site<00:03:44.370> do

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
time really planning out your site do

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.010 
time really planning out your site do
some<00:03:44.700> research<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.180> sites<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.750> like

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
some research on sites that you like

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.680 
some research on sites that you like
that<00:03:46.410> are<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.680> your<00:03:46.860> industry<00:03:47.510> don't<00:03:48.510> tell

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
that are in your industry don't tell

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
single day right right out of the gate

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.510 
single day right right out of the gate
and<00:03:51.989> don't<00:03:52.110> tweet<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.560> either<00:03:52.770> yeah<00:03:53.250> because

people get ambitious right in the and I
that's<00:03:56.250> awesome<00:03:56.730> but<00:03:57.600> they<00:03:58.050> start<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.530> know

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
they start off the first week and they

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.340 
they start off the first week and they
it's<00:04:01.680> like<00:04:02.480> yeah<00:04:03.480> then<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.840> next<00:04:04.020> week<00:04:04.140> maybe

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
it's like yeah then the next week maybe

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.720 
it's like yeah then the next week maybe
they<00:04:04.530> get<00:04:04.650> busy<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:04.950> they<00:04:05.130> only<00:04:05.220> write<00:04:05.400> three

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
they get busy so they only write three

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.210 
they get busy so they only write three
things<00:04:05.760> I've<00:04:06.180> been<00:04:06.420> there<00:04:06.660> done<00:04:06.870> guys

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
things I've been there done guys

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.320 
things I've been there done guys
eventually<00:04:08.220> their<00:04:08.370> site<00:04:08.580> just<00:04:08.820> kind<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.150> goes

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
eventually their site just kind of goes

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.360 
eventually their site just kind of goes
dormant<00:04:09.570> right<00:04:09.900> because<00:04:10.410> I'm<00:04:10.530> time<00:04:10.860> for<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.250> or

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
dormant right because I'm time for it or

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.509 
dormant right because I'm time for it or
they<00:04:11.519> just<00:04:12.000> kind<00:04:12.300> of<00:04:12.470> went<00:04:13.470> so<00:04:13.890> fast<00:04:14.190> out<00:04:14.489> of

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
they just kind of went so fast out of

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.800 
they just kind of went so fast out of
the<00:04:14.640> gate<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.970> they<00:04:15.060> sort<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.330> wore<00:04:15.450> out<00:04:15.630> on

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
the gate that they sort of wore out on

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.360 
the gate that they sort of wore out on
so<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.109> definitely<00:04:16.290> want<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.680> be<00:04:16.769> careful<00:04:17.160> be

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
so you definitely want to be careful be

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.830 
so you definitely want to be careful be
careful<00:04:17.400> with<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.850> plan<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.330> out<00:04:18.450> being

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
careful with that plan it out being

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.379 
careful with that plan it out being
realistic

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
realistic

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.149 
realistic
and<00:04:20.629> know<00:04:20.810> what<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.169> want<00:04:21.379> and<00:04:21.680> kind<00:04:21.979> of<00:04:22.039> where

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
and know what you want and kind of where

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.890 
and know what you want and kind of where
you're<00:04:22.280> going<00:04:22.310> before<00:04:22.759> you<00:04:22.969> even<00:04:23.330> engage<00:04:23.870> a

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
you're going before you even engage a

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.570 
you're going before you even engage a
developer<00:04:24.439> designer<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:25.069> planning<00:04:25.430> is

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
developer designer so planning is

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.029 
developer designer so planning is
another<00:04:25.849> big<00:04:26.030> one<00:04:26.650> how<00:04:27.650> people<00:04:27.889> handle

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
another big one how people handle

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.490 
another big one how people handle
pictures<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:29.389> huge

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
pictures is huge

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.589 
pictures is huge
you<00:04:30.680> do<00:04:30.830> not<00:04:30.979> want<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.460> dynamically<00:04:32.090> resize

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
you do not want to dynamically resize

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.409 
you do not want to dynamically resize
pictures<00:04:33.050> in<00:04:33.319> most<00:04:33.500> cases<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:34.610> if<00:04:34.939> you<00:04:35.210> have<00:04:35.389> a

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
pictures in most cases so if you have a

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.339 
pictures in most cases so if you have a
thumbnail<00:04:36.080> image<00:04:36.409> that's<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:38.210> space<00:04:38.449> is<00:04:38.689> 150

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
thumbnail image that's the space is 150

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:40.659 
thumbnail image that's the space is 150
pixels<00:04:39.530> wide<00:04:39.860> by<00:04:39.889> a<00:04:40.159> hundred<00:04:40.370> and<00:04:40.400> fifty

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
pixels wide by a hundred and fifty

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.610 
pixels wide by a hundred and fifty
pixels<00:04:40.849> tall<00:04:41.180> then<00:04:41.719> the<00:04:41.870> image<00:04:42.139> that<00:04:42.289> goes<00:04:42.409> in

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
pixels tall then the image that goes in

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.439 
pixels tall then the image that goes in
there<00:04:42.710> should<00:04:42.889> be<00:04:43.009> 150<00:04:43.430> by<00:04:43.550> 150<00:04:43.849> don't<00:04:44.180> upload

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
there should be 150 by 150 don't upload

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.749 
there should be 150 by 150 don't upload
a<00:04:44.569> large<00:04:44.840> 400<00:04:45.439> by<00:04:45.560> 300<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.250> gets<00:04:46.370> shrunk<00:04:46.550> down

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
a large 400 by 300 that gets shrunk down

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.760 
a large 400 by 300 that gets shrunk down
right<00:04:47.180> because<00:04:47.659> that's<00:04:47.780> slowing<00:04:48.469> your<00:04:48.560> page

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
right because that's slowing your page

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.450 
right because that's slowing your page
load<00:04:49.039> down<00:04:49.870> it's<00:04:50.870> adding<00:04:51.409> you're<00:04:52.069> using<00:04:52.280> more

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
load down it's adding you're using more

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.679 
load down it's adding you're using more
bandwidth<00:04:52.819> than<00:04:52.849> you<00:04:53.029> need<00:04:53.180> to<00:04:53.210> do<00:04:53.389> all<00:04:53.539> that

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:53.689 
bandwidth than you need to do all that

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.179 
bandwidth than you need to do all that
kind<00:04:53.870> of<00:04:53.930> stuff<00:04:54.050> there's<00:04:54.710> also<00:04:54.889> a<00:04:54.979> great

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:55.189 
kind of stuff there's also a great
