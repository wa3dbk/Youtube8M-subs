while<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.960> doing<00:00:31.050> spacewalks<00:00:31.619> building

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
while I was doing spacewalks building

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.100 
while I was doing spacewalks building
cannon-armed<00:00:32.969> at<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.390> point<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.660> got<00:00:33.690> vertigo

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
cannon-armed at one point I got vertigo

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.319 
cannon-armed at one point I got vertigo
I<00:00:34.489> thought<00:00:35.489> that's<00:00:35.610> weird<00:00:35.880> why<00:00:36.030> don't<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> get

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180 
I thought that's weird why don't I get
vertigo<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.960> realized<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.680> when<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.950> sit

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
vertigo and I realized like when you sit

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.770 
vertigo and I realized like when you sit
beside<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.550> truck<00:00:38.879> at<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.090> stoplight<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
beside a truck at a stoplight and it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.119 
beside a truck at a stoplight and it
starts<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.230> move<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> feel<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:40.860> you're

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
starts to move and you feel like you're

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
starts to move and you feel like you're
moving<00:00:41.219> backwards<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.940> you're<00:00:42.030> dizzy<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
moving backwards and you're dizzy for a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.450 
moving backwards and you're dizzy for a
second<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.079> looked<00:00:43.649> over<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.190> because

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
second I looked over and it was because

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.060 
second I looked over and it was because
Africa<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.420> by<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.899> thought<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
Africa was going by I thought that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.209 
Africa was going by I thought that
that's<00:00:47.640> new<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.090> me<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.780> extremely

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
that's new for me it's extremely

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.500 
that's new for me it's extremely
distracting<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.520> work<00:00:50.730> during<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.239> spacewalk

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
distracting to work during a spacewalk

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
distracting to work during a spacewalk
and<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> wrench<00:00:52.590> yourself<00:00:53.100> away

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
and you have to wrench yourself away

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
and you have to wrench yourself away
from<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.940> wonder<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> beauty<00:00:55.530> of
