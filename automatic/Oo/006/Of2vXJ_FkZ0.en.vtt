truck from the street but this thing
here<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.669> doesn't<00:04:51.300> seem<00:04:51.479> like<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.780> get<00:04:51.990> a

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
here it doesn't seem like you get a

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.800 
here it doesn't seem like you get a
whole<00:04:52.289> lot<00:04:52.530> for<00:04:52.889> a<00:04:52.949> hundred<00:04:53.340> dollars<00:04:53.810> it's

whole lot for a hundred dollars it's
it's<00:04:55.229> nice<00:04:55.560> but<00:04:56.250> when<00:04:56.850> you<00:04:56.880> factor<00:04:57.210> in<00:04:57.449> how

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
it's nice but when you factor in how

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.890 
it's nice but when you factor in how
much<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:58.139> have<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.560> throw<00:04:58.860> into<00:04:59.400> it<00:04:59.550> too<00:05:00.240> well

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
much you have to throw into it too well

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.040 
much you have to throw into it too well
you<00:05:01.110> can<00:05:01.289> pick<00:05:01.470> up<00:05:01.650> on<00:05:01.889> relatively<00:05:03.050> cheap

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
you can pick up on relatively cheap

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.950 
you can pick up on relatively cheap
between<00:05:04.500> fifty<00:05:04.919> sixty<00:05:05.880> dollars<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:06.660> eBay

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
between fifty sixty dollars on eBay

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.689 
between fifty sixty dollars on eBay
maybe<00:05:07.349> even<00:05:07.710> cheaper<00:05:07.919> if<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.250> caught<00:05:08.520> the

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
maybe even cheaper if you caught the

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.560 
maybe even cheaper if you caught the
right<00:05:08.820> auction<00:05:09.500> but<00:05:10.669> maybe<00:05:11.669> it's<00:05:11.940> greed<00:05:12.330> old

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
right auction but maybe it's greed old

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.800 
right auction but maybe it's greed old
not<00:05:12.960> being<00:05:13.940> present<00:05:14.940> with<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.300> set<00:05:15.539> either

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
not being present with the set either

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.990 
not being present with the set either
that<00:05:16.139> that<00:05:16.349> does<00:05:16.590> take<00:05:16.889> away<00:05:17.160> from<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.580> I<00:05:17.699> think

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
that that does take away from it I think

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.570 
that that does take away from it I think
it's<00:05:18.539> something<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.199> be<00:05:19.320> said<00:05:19.590> when<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.280> can't

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
it's something to be said when you can't

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.390 
it's something to be said when you can't
give<00:05:20.849> it<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.180> full<00:05:21.770> impact<00:05:22.770> so<00:05:23.099> I'll<00:05:23.250> be

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
give it the full impact so I'll be

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.430 
give it the full impact so I'll be
definitely<00:05:24.000> looking<00:05:24.300> forward<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.660> Greedo<00:05:25.020> as

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
the foam so that that was something that

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.480 
the foam so that that was something that
did<00:05:33.659> turn<00:05:33.930> me<00:05:34.080> off<00:05:34.110> a<00:05:34.289> little<00:05:34.650> bit<00:05:34.919> and<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.460> don't
