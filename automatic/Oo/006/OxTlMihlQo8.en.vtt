00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.720
 ah 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.670
 hello my name is josé jiménez garrido and 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.800
 we are demolishing by making a 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.420
 agronomic observation activity for 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.220
 put in value the night sky of that 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.720
 name what we intend is 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.239
 that the experience of observing 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.860
 firmament is an experience that 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.230
 do from the point of view of 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.550
 enjoy not talking with another series of 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.440
 things for example today we are here in the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.180
 mill the ship and while we've 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.800
 given a short introductory talk 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.150
 to astronomy while they prepare 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.100
 the telescopes the people are 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.440
 enjoying a gastronomic sample 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.140
 of typical products here 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.140
 glass of wine and so on and so the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.239
 heat from a light to a thing that to day of 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.649
 today it is very difficult to find and we have 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.030
 a very good tourist infrastructure 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.829
 sierra molina that we believe we can 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.170
 put to service in the studio showed 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.170
 I do not mico and do one thing really 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.170
 striking 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 sierra molina is an area is a 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.090
 includes very large natural extension in 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.400
 four provinces of huelva sevilla 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.160
 Córdoba and Jaén Zones is not three of those 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.450
 those 42 respective provinces is true 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.130
 than in Andalusia and other places that 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.960
 they also have very good conditions 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.820
 good but it will be molina could not pass 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.740
 the opportunity to be declared as 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.510
 starlight reserve and this is going to be the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.610
 largest astronomical reserve in the 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.500
 good planet because that tells us that 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.360
 I know the way in the special zone because 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.610
 we do not just talk about that nature 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.250
 fantastic but we talk about a 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.600
 dimension in an extension that is very 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.790
 hard to find in the context 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.470
 European that those that we have were 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.660
 endorsed in the sense that they are 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.820
 scientific studies do not go beyond 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.370
 a personal projection 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.140
 Perhaps the most positive feature is 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.150
 that the heavens from that are 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.180
 good are armored in the sense of 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.280
 that we have legislation at the level 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.619
 Andalusian who protects our skies this 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.880
 generous sky and that launches a series of 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.920
 recommendations obligation to 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.990
 councils that are going to get in the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.760
 process of overcoming luminaries by 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.840
 which you can expect the endings and 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.090
 of the mill and the set of Andalusia 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.480
 in terms of cinema they will go even 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.480
 best 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.849
 in astronomy is a science one 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.409
 hobby that is responsible for the study of 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.260
 the celestial bodies that are visible 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.360
 from our planet comets planets 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.459
 nebulae galaxies in customers that 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.409
 is responsible for knowing how it works 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.689
 they evolve and what are those objects that 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.159
 we can prepare to talk about 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.989
 astronomy we always put in 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.420
 value a phrase that said albert eistein 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.430
 which said that the most incomprehensible of 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.019
 universe is that it is understandable and 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.189
 really a phrase that is published very 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.220
 well what we intend to put in value 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.689
 with this project and is the amount of 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.730
 sensations that awakens and the 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.200
 advertising that awakens lean out the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.780
 window that assumes the saw skies 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.060
 brunette and check that everything you see 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.400
 when he leaves they do not stop calling you 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.989
 advertising and from level even give it more 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.090
 the deepest roots of the 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.680
 curiosity in the human being then 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.239
 we create with very informative activity 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.250
 that has great values ​​that 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.989
 they contribute that can be shared with 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.760
 family with friends and that really 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.670
 You can enjoy an experience that 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.770
 goes far beyond the tourist enjoyment 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.770
 even he gets to play like people 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.250
 ever 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.400
 for me, astronomy is a step 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.380
 natural in the sense that they have 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.390
 studied environmental science 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.240
 I am passionate about nature and 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.100
 astronomy even though it is so 

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.690
 forgotten within the world of 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.450
 conservation of the environment is a 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.070
 fundamental part 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.600
 the species and the animals that we have 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.300
 our natural spaces during 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.790
 millions of years have been ruled by 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.740
 a few natural cycles of light and darkness 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.410
 apart from that for me to put myself to look 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.720
 with a telescope and observe what the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.230
 wonders that can be offered to us 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.510
 the universe 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.420
 the feeling of satisfying your curiosity 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.210
 observing that thing in a joy and I 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.650
 it seems that it was one of the things that everything 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.230
 the world should ever try 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.180
 this life 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.650
 the moment you step inside and 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.420
 really know your position in the 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.550
 universe at a time when you give yourself 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.500
 account how small you are in front of 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:07.820
 things so great a hobby very 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.820
 mortifying in that sense 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.010
 we are in a very historical epoch 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.780
 interesting in the sense that the 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.860
 Last year the discoveries 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.380
 are doing in the world of 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.480
 astronomy are fascinating and not for 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.490
 solve a question we always end 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.590
 raising another seven of you 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.080
 more questions that are even more 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.760
 complex magritte matica what we 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.730
 remains to be discovered in the coming years 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.140
 surely they are going to be things that are going to 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.900
 get us out of our standard 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.330
 extraordinary of what we know of the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.430
 universe then from the point of 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.920
 ordinary view looking through a telescope 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.690
 and be up to date on the things that you see 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.950
 of the last study of the last ones that 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.410
 is being discovered to be 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.510
 updated knowledge as 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.420
 species we have from the site where we 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.730
 we live now very interesting things in 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.150
 this type of activities solve the 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.150
 people
