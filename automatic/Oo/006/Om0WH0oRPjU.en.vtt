00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:12.280
 Put how part 1 new no knitting of delicious coffee for beginners 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:13.730
 The dependency of story that does not drink coffee because difficult to say the April Women's coffee today 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.900
 Listen often 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:24.190
 Certainly though it's difficult to think Well difficult 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:30.120
 Easy to very coffee when you put in for beginners is easy 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:33.930
 So I decided to improve how to make coffee for beginners 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:38.230
 First of all , there are many people who talk about coffee pods 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:43.400
 Coffee pods would be nice to think as for Advanced Users 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:48.380
 It is sufficient in a teapot if the novice is making coffee 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.490
 Coffee pods Which date so will create an delicious coffee is better not subjected to fire 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.430
 It is together 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:01:00.010
 I think that it is anxious at first but I think it is easy to understand if there is a measurement 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.360
 So what you need is a dripper 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.240
 And it is a taper filter 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.230
 It would be useful to have a fat porch at first 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:17.430
 First sometimes entertain coffee 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:22.850
 It is recommended that you use good coffee ingredients rather than tools . 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:28.940
 Good material is ready delicious coffee be treated rough 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:36.000
 So for the first time it's better to use something good 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:42.850
 It finished the delicious coffee better to use a good coffee only for beginners 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:48.780
 For example, if it is delicious fish, it will be delicious at noon 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:54.620
 If you use delicious lectures, hot water will make you delicious coffee 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.500
 Use good things of coffee beans rather than thinking simple and putting on tools 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.340
 It is recommended 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.510
 Let's look at a simple extraction using a good coffee 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.409
 here you go 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.929
 Let's plan the amount of win first 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.590
 Put a cup and set zero 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.590
 Put in water 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.860
 Generally this cup should be considered full with 240 cc 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.570
 Empty the cup and let the dripper 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.570
 Fold the end of the paper 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:34.800
 Open and set on the dripper 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:38.070
 The kind of dripper uses the Hario type today, but any kind is the same 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.100
 At that time small size 01 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:45.450
 And there is a large size 02 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:50.190
 If you mix 120 c 01 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:56.750
 Please choose like 02 if it is more than that 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.750
 Now I think it easier to use 02 because there are more of curtain win 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.990
 Let's work to the amount of coffee beans 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:10.400
 There is a fine calculation method, but for beginners 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:17.200
 I think it would be nice to look like using 10% of the amount of coffee extracted 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.200
 Today we use the 24g of coffee because it is 240 c 4 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:36.040
 Because the temperature of hot water is too high , coffee tends to be bitter 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.720
 At first put hot water in the teapot and let the temperature cool a little 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.840
 Pull coffee 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.840
 Please do this when using ground flour 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.210
 Flatten 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:56.160
 0 to Align 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:00.280
 Please pour the same amount of hot water after this first first shot 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.130
 At that time, the size of a 10-yen coin in the middle 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:10.610
 It is a tribe's knack in the size of 10 yen coin 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:13.130
 How to read a lot of extraction care so as not to get hot water to God so as not to wet the hair until the end 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.330
 Please attach 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.980
 Let's pour 24g of hot water first 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.980
 24g in the middle 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.720
 So please do not worry if a little more 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.230
 I will plan for about 30 seconds 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.569
 It is the power of beans to go to Fukura uncle 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:42.689
 I think that beans often don't swell when you buy small pots 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.689
 Even if it does not swell, please wait for these 30 seconds exactly 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:52.409
 It stood 30 seconds 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:55.340
 Return the balance to zero and pour 140 cc of hot water from there 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:59.810
 It is 240 cc from the middle 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.720
 It is better to pour it in the middle 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.760
 I can not write on paper 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.760
 I will pour it as it is 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:16.389
 Let's pour until you become 240 officers while watching him 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.389
 I can not write in a nap 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.920
 A little more 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.920
 246 c 4 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.920
 Hmm 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.620
 I will leave this way 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.460
 It will be completed if you drop it to the end 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.449
 Let's look at the taste 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:06:00.409
 We went up to a little easily eye and from the way it should be 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:00.409
 However, the individuality is coming out well and I think that this is a delicious coffee 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.409
 It earlier method of extraction and for it 2 times the extraction is complete 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:14.340
 Extraction time will be short 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:19.500
 Therefore the taste of coffee will be slightly thinner 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:21.009
 But I do not think is a bad and say whether it is bad 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.099
 actually 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:28.670
 I saw it in Los Angeles in 2010 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:35.630
 Famous third wave cafes etc. were this way of extraction 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:39.289
 Delicious coffee is completed even in this kind of simple extraction method If you're beans 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:45.190
 I would like to know that the 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:47.230
 Well that shop is now stirred with a spoon in the first shot 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:53.790
 Eyes in two dogs 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.790
 That's why I'm replacing coffee of a little more firm size 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:01.169
 In the case of Americans , stir with a spoon to increase extraction efficiency 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.800
 Give concentration 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:09.050
 Though it seems to be shaped like that 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.070
 Control the extraction time there properly 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.639
 Make the node solid 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:20.969
 Extract sentences 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:23.180
 I think that such a type of extraction method that brings out all the taste of coffee may be good 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.180
 I will 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.439
 The way is easy 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:39.710
 Let's pour hot water with 240 cc affiliation place 3 to 2 division 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:41.420
 Inherit 240 cc in 3 times and 3 times 80 cc 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:46.580
 In other words 

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:54.440
 There are 24 c and 430 seconds at first, and 80 c 4 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:56.139
 Wait a little more 80 c 4 Wait a little more 80 parent and child like that 80 new 3 times 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.860
 By pouring 

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:05.229
 It is a way of thinking to try to increase the extraction concentration 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:10.200
 part 1 is here so far and part 2 is divided into three times and inherited 

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:12.980
 Let's have a look at how to make the country stronger 

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.980
 In addition, in
