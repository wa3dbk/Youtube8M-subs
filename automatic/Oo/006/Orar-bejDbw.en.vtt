was<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.439> thinking<00:01:10.650> behind<00:01:10.830> this

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
was the thinking behind this

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.390 
was the thinking behind this
well<00:01:12.030> back<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.750> 2003<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.830> had<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.040> temporary

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
well back in 2003 we had a temporary

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.190 
well back in 2003 we had a temporary
walkway<00:01:14.850> made<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.270> scaffolding<00:01:15.689> poles<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
walkway made of scaffolding poles and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
walkway made of scaffolding poles and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
boards and it was so incredibly popular

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.120 
boards and it was so incredibly popular
we<00:01:18.840> realized<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.350> had<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.740> something<00:01:19.979> more

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
we realized we had to do something more

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
we realized we had to do something more
permanent<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.570> we're<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:21.990> some<00:01:22.200> sort<00:01:22.350> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
permanent and we're not some sort of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.179 
permanent and we're not some sort of
concern<00:01:22.970> about<00:01:23.970> second<00:01:24.570> 400<00:01:25.259> tons<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.770> steel

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
concern about second 400 tons of steel

course<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.490> will<00:01:30.360> work<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
course but we will work with the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
architects to do ground radar so we've

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.359

fewer<00:01:44.130> adjustments<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> trees<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.509> were

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
fewer adjustments to the trees we were

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.480 
fewer adjustments to the trees we were
able<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.560> walkway<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.159> straight

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
able to get the walkway going straight

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.889 
able to get the walkway going straight
through<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.850> canopy<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.299> most<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> trees

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
through the canopy of most of the trees

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
through the canopy of most of the trees
so<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> hoping<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.369> members<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
so what are you hoping that members of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
so what are you hoping that members of

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the public can get out of this sort of

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.340 
the public can get out of this sort of
way<00:01:52.950> well<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> know<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.270> 14,000<00:01:55.200> trees

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
way well you know we have 14,000 trees

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
way well you know we have 14,000 trees
in<00:01:55.560> Kew<00:01:55.680> Gardens<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.399> see<00:01:56.579> nearly<00:01:56.790> all<00:01:56.969> of

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
in Kew Gardens but you see nearly all of

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.090 
in Kew Gardens but you see nearly all of
them<00:01:57.299> from<00:01:57.570> underneath<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.770> totally

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
them from underneath and it's a totally

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.249 
them from underneath and it's a totally
different<00:01:59.159> world<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.790> here<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.960> want<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259

different world up here we want to
explain<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.770> world<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.280> how<00:02:02.490> trees<00:02:02.939> grow

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
explain the world of how trees grow

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.010 
explain the world of how trees grow
using<00:02:03.750> atmospheric<00:02:04.229> carbon<00:02:05.630> water<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

using atmospheric carbon water and
nutrients<00:02:07.649> from<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.860> grounds<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.849> can

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
nutrients from the grounds and you can

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.999 
nutrients from the grounds and you can
see<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.330> happening<00:02:09.720> up<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.920> you
