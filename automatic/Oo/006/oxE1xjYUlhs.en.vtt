in<00:07:08.060> this<00:07:08.270> particular<00:07:08.629> rice<00:07:09.110> I<00:07:09.379> guess<00:07:09.590> with<00:07:09.770> the

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:09.889 
in this particular rice I guess with the

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.879 
in this particular rice I guess with the
humidity<00:07:10.810> three<00:07:11.810> and<00:07:11.960> a<00:07:12.020> quarter<00:07:12.259> cups<00:07:12.650> would

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:12.889 
humidity three and a quarter cups would

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.010 
humidity three and a quarter cups would
have<00:07:13.009> been<00:07:13.129> enough<00:07:13.430> you<00:07:13.550> can't<00:07:13.759> have<00:07:13.909> to<00:07:14.060> play

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
have been enough you can't have to play

have been enough you can't have to play
with<00:07:15.229> that<00:07:15.379> a<00:07:15.440> little<00:07:15.529> bit<00:07:15.800> I<00:07:16.039> think<00:07:16.400> this<00:07:16.669> is

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789 
with that a little bit I think this is

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:20.189 
with that a little bit I think this is
going<00:07:16.909> to<00:07:17.000> turn<00:07:17.210> out<00:07:17.389> real<00:07:17.659> nice<00:07:17.870> for<00:07:18.199> us

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
going to turn out real nice for us

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:23.589 
going to turn out real nice for us

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 
alright now we see the liquid it's

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.379 
alright now we see the liquid it's
almost<00:07:23.990> totally<00:07:24.919> absorb<00:07:24.949> I<00:07:25.699> don't<00:07:26.180> mind
