00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and float around you very much look like

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.259 
and float around you very much look like
Emperor<00:00:27.750> Palpatine<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:29.250> Star<00:00:29.490> Wars<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.210> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the I'm using an auto rifle and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
the I'm using an auto rifle and
traditionally<00:00:59.460> ever<00:00:59.940> since<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.629> auto<00:01:00.719> rifles

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
traditionally ever since the auto rifles

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.780 
traditionally ever since the auto rifles
got<00:01:01.289> nerfed<00:01:01.879> they<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.600> aren't<00:01:03.840> very<00:01:03.960> great

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
got nerfed they just aren't very great

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.480 
got nerfed they just aren't very great
so<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:06.420> what's<00:01:06.689> happening<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:08.280> at

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so what what's happening now is or at

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.740 
so what what's happening now is or at
least<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> purposes<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.570> video

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
least for the purposes of this video

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.590 
least for the purposes of this video
when<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.470> were<00:01:10.590> capturing<00:01:11.100> they<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:12.119> tuned

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
when we were capturing they they tuned

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.109 
when we were capturing they they tuned
the<00:01:13.020> all<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> guns<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.460> have

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the all the guns so that they would have

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.840 
the all the guns so that they would have
roughly<00:01:16.080> around<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.560> same<00:01:16.619> amount<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.340> uh<00:01:17.400> I'm

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
roughly around the same amount of uh I'm

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.850 
roughly around the same amount of uh I'm
sorry<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> same<00:01:18.390> time<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.810> kill<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
sorry the same time to kill so if it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
sorry the same time to kill so if it
looks<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.340> auto<00:01:20.490> rifles<00:01:20.939> are<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> little

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
looks like the auto rifles are a little

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
looks like the auto rifles are a little
bit<00:01:21.450> stronger<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.320> video<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.830> that's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
bit stronger in this video then that's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.520 
bit stronger in this video then that's
why<00:01:23.310> i<00:01:23.640> asked<00:01:24.420> them<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.840> comment<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.350> whether

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
why i asked them to comment on whether

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.560 
why i asked them to comment on whether
or<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.799> they<00:01:25.979> had<00:01:26.130> any<00:01:26.280> plans<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.909> buffing<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
or not they had any plans on buffing the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.390 
or not they had any plans on buffing the
auto<00:01:27.750> rifles<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> future<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> they

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
auto rifles in the future and they

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.390 
auto rifles in the future and they
didn't<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.820> any<00:01:29.939> comment<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:31.340> at<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
didn't have any comment on that at that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.179 
didn't have any comment on that at that
time<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.810> had<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.200> guess<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.680> would<00:01:34.710> say<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
time if I had to guess I would say that

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
time if I had to guess I would say that
I<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.390> buff<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.780> probably<00:01:37.229> coming

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I I think a buff is probably coming

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.920 
I I think a buff is probably coming
eventually<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> how<00:01:39.630> poor

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
eventually just because of how poor

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.090 
eventually just because of how poor
they're<00:01:40.110> performing<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.710> now<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.979> their

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
they're performing right now in their

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.639 
they're performing right now in their
current<00:01:41.280> form<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> can't<00:01:43.409> say<00:01:43.590> for

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
current form but but I can't say for

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.889 
current form but but I can't say for
sure<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.390> give

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
sure and and I don't want to like give

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.120 
sure and and I don't want to like give
you<00:01:45.990> guys<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> impression<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.740> was<00:01:46.799> told

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you guys the impression that I was told

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.770 
you guys the impression that I was told
this<00:01:47.869> definitively<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.290> there's<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.369> um

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
this definitively so there's that um

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
this definitively so there's that um
this<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> felt<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:52.920> probably<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.549> second

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
this was I felt like probably the second

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300 
this was I felt like probably the second
strongest<00:01:54.240> class<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> solar<00:01:55.920> Titan

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
strongest class I think the solar Titan

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.340 
strongest class I think the solar Titan
is<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:57.270> I've<00:01:57.659> already<00:01:57.780> said<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.170> think

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
is is but I've already said that I think

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.840 
is is but I've already said that I think
the<00:01:58.439> solar<00:01:58.619> Titan<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> best<00:01:59.310> new<00:01:59.490> subclass

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the solar Titan is the best new subclass

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.980 
the solar Titan is the best new subclass
as<00:02:00.180> far<00:02:00.360> as<00:02:00.450> PvP<00:02:00.869> goes<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
as far as PvP goes and that the the the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.170 
as far as PvP goes and that the the the
new<00:02:04.140> hunter<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.189> yeah<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> new<00:02:05.850> hunter

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
new hunter the the yeah the new hunter

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.809 
new hunter the the yeah the new hunter
class<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.630> uh<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.350> weakest<00:02:08.340> when<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.580> came<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
class is uh the weakest when it came to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.050 
class is uh the weakest when it came to
PvP<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.050> um<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.099> behind<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.819> solar

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
PvP this is um this is behind the solar

PvP this is um this is behind the solar

i posted before on the solar titans this
is<00:02:21.569> this<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:21.989> game<00:02:22.200> type<00:02:22.379> called<00:02:22.560> mayhem

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
is this is a game type called mayhem

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.759 
is this is a game type called mayhem
clash<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.659> basically<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> game<00:02:25.530> type

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
clash and it is basically a game type

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.990 
clash and it is basically a game type
where<00:02:26.069> your<00:02:26.340> grenades<00:02:27.209> melee<00:02:28.049> and<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:29.040> super

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
where your grenades melee and a super

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.330 
where your grenades melee and a super
recharge<00:02:30.599> at<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.019> three<00:02:31.319> times<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.799> normal

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
recharge at like three times the normal

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.280 
recharge at like three times the normal
rate<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.299> just<00:02:33.450> constant<00:02:33.810> needs

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
rate so it's just constant needs

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.069 
rate so it's just constant needs
constant<00:02:34.829> super<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:36.090> was<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> lot<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.569> fun<00:02:36.720> i<00:02:36.870> was

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
constant super it was a lot of fun i was

super into it uh and yeah you know i

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.649 
super into it uh and yeah you know i
don't<00:02:41.040> think<00:02:41.370> i<00:02:41.459> have<00:02:41.640> too<00:02:41.849> much<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.269> say<00:02:42.299> about

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
don't think i have too much to say about

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.960 
don't think i have too much to say about
about<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.680> actual<00:02:43.890> subclass<00:02:44.370> i<00:02:44.579> just<00:02:44.790> sort<00:02:44.909> of

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
about the actual subclass i just sort of

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.520 
about the actual subclass i just sort of
let<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.540> gameplay<00:02:45.900> speak<00:02:46.109> for<00:02:46.260> itself

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
let this the gameplay speak for itself

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.740 
let this the gameplay speak for itself
it's<00:02:47.190> obviously<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:47.879> a<00:02:48.030> really<00:02:48.329> good<00:02:48.480> class

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
it's obviously like a really good class

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.050 
it's obviously like a really good class
I<00:02:49.109> mean<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.650> I'm<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.190> mind<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.549> warlocks

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
I mean I I'm of the mind that warlocks

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.490 
I mean I I'm of the mind that warlocks
didn't<00:02:51.359> really<00:02:51.569> need<00:02:51.720> any<00:02:51.900> help<00:02:52.049> when<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.319> came

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
didn't really need any help when it came

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.849 
didn't really need any help when it came
to<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.769> stuff<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.940> think<00:02:54.510> right<00:02:55.019> now<00:02:55.260> warlocks

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
to this stuff I think right now warlocks

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.559 
to this stuff I think right now warlocks
are<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.129> best<00:02:56.310> for<00:02:56.489> PvP<00:02:56.849> some<00:02:57.120> people<00:02:57.390> just

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
are the best for PvP some people just

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.059 
are the best for PvP some people just
insist<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.530> hunter<00:02:58.829> with<00:02:58.859> the

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
insist that it's the hunter with the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.000 
insist that it's the hunter with the
their<00:02:59.519> blade<00:02:59.819> dancers<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.569> in<00:03:01.470> golden<00:03:01.859> guns

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
their blade dancers and in golden guns

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.500 
their blade dancers and in golden guns
but<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.489> completely<00:03:02.670> disagree<00:03:03.390> i<00:03:03.420> think

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
but I just completely disagree i think

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.640 
but I just completely disagree i think
the<00:03:03.810> Warlocks<00:03:04.230> melee<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:06.650> grenades

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
the Warlocks melee and grenades

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.930 
the Warlocks melee and grenades
completely<00:03:08.220> make<00:03:08.340> up<00:03:08.459> for<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.640> fact<00:03:08.670> that

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
completely make up for the fact that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.089 
completely make up for the fact that
it's<00:03:09.150> super<00:03:09.510> maybe<00:03:09.750> isn't<00:03:10.260> as<00:03:10.440> strong<00:03:10.799> as<00:03:11.069> a

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
it's super maybe isn't as strong as a

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.220 
it's super maybe isn't as strong as a
blade<00:03:11.400> dancer<00:03:11.819> but<00:03:12.329> even<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.659> Sun<00:03:12.690> singer

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
blade dancer but even the Sun singer

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.500 
blade dancer but even the Sun singer
super<00:03:13.709> like<00:03:14.340> at<00:03:14.519> first<00:03:14.579> when<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.329> game<00:03:15.480> first

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
super like at first when the game first

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.819 
super like at first when the game first
came<00:03:15.780> out<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.019> thought<00:03:16.079> it<00:03:16.319> was<00:03:16.409> like<00:03:16.590> super

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
came out I thought it was like super

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.170 
came out I thought it was like super
shitty<00:03:17.129> and<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.400> wasn't<00:03:17.639> that<00:03:17.700> great<00:03:17.910> but

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
shitty and it wasn't that great but

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.539 
shitty and it wasn't that great but
after<00:03:18.540> making<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.290> warlock<00:03:19.620> getting<00:03:19.919> it<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.130> 34

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
after making a warlock getting it to 34

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.220 
after making a warlock getting it to 34
and<00:03:20.700> then<00:03:20.819> playing<00:03:21.120> as<00:03:21.359> both<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.630> Sun<00:03:21.930> singer

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
and then playing as both the Sun singer

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.900 
and then playing as both the Sun singer
and<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.440> void<00:03:22.620> Walker<00:03:22.889> those<00:03:23.549> are<00:03:23.730> both

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
and the void Walker those are both

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.039 
and the void Walker those are both
totally<00:03:24.299> fine<00:03:25.010> PvP<00:03:26.010> classes<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.450> know<00:03:27.930> I

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
totally fine PvP classes so I know I

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.869 
totally fine PvP classes so I know I
think<00:03:28.349> warlocks<00:03:28.739> already<00:03:29.069> were<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.549> best<00:03:29.730> in

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
think warlocks already were the best in

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.270 
think warlocks already were the best in
PvP<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.599> so<00:03:31.109> with<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.379> new<00:03:31.440> subclass<00:03:31.919> it's

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
PvP and so with this new subclass it's

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.890 
PvP and so with this new subclass it's
just<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.579> mean<00:03:32.609> it's<00:03:32.940> nothing<00:03:33.269> new<00:03:33.389> it's<00:03:33.569> it's<00:03:33.750> I

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
just I mean it's nothing new it's it's I

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.449 
just I mean it's nothing new it's it's I
think<00:03:34.319> it's<00:03:34.530> going<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.799> be<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:34.980> top-tier

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
think it's going to be a top-tier

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.400 
think it's going to be a top-tier
subclass<00:03:36.000> when<00:03:36.599> this<00:03:36.720> finally<00:03:37.079> comes<00:03:37.260> out

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
subclass when this finally comes out

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.319 
subclass when this finally comes out
it's<00:03:38.040> also<00:03:38.160> pretty<00:03:38.400> curious<00:03:38.730> when<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.090> think

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
it's also pretty curious when you think

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.960 
it's also pretty curious when you think
about<00:03:39.419> it<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:40.069> they<00:03:41.069> originally<00:03:41.579> didn't

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
about it that they originally didn't

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.569 
about it that they originally didn't
plan<00:03:42.239> on<00:03:42.480> doing<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.900> third<00:03:43.109> subclass<00:03:43.650> for<00:03:44.430> each

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
plan on doing a third subclass for each

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.180 
plan on doing a third subclass for each
for<00:03:45.419> each<00:03:45.449> class<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.109> game<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.889> third

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
for each class in the game the third

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.129 
for each class in the game the third
little<00:03:47.549> slot<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.359> see<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:48.930> was

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
little slot that you see that was

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.659 
little slot that you see that was
actually<00:03:49.470> an<00:03:49.560> old<00:03:49.769> feature<00:03:50.099> that<00:03:50.370> was<00:03:50.489> in<00:03:50.609> the

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
actually an old feature that was in the

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.789 
actually an old feature that was in the
game<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.690> was<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.169> was<00:03:52.199> a<00:03:52.410> feature<00:03:52.680> that

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
game and it was it was a feature that

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.319 
game and it was it was a feature that
you<00:03:53.010> could<00:03:53.160> do<00:03:53.310> where<00:03:53.549> you<00:03:53.669> could<00:03:53.819> like<00:03:54.000> lock

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
you could do where you could like lock

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.330 
you could do where you could like lock
in<00:03:54.660> your<00:03:54.720> skill<00:03:55.379> tree<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:55.859> you<00:03:55.919> could<00:03:56.129> pick

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
in your skill tree so you could pick

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.819 
in your skill tree so you could pick
like<00:03:57.269> all<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.690> skills<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:58.379> wanted<00:03:58.680> and

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
like all the skills that you wanted and

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.229 
like all the skills that you wanted and
all<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:59.010> perks<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.549> wanted<00:03:59.849> within

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
all the perks that you wanted within

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.539 
all the perks that you wanted within
your<00:04:00.480> sub<00:04:01.139> classes<00:04:01.620> like<00:04:01.769> little<00:04:02.040> power-ups

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
your sub classes like little power-ups

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.670 
your sub classes like little power-ups
and<00:04:02.760> then<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.389> locked<00:04:03.720> them<00:04:04.049> if<00:04:04.470> you

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
and then if you locked them if you

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.319 
and then if you locked them if you
locked<00:04:05.010> those<00:04:05.310> in<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.730> didn't<00:04:05.940> give<00:04:06.060> yourself

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
locked those in and didn't give yourself

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.240 
locked those in and didn't give yourself
a<00:04:06.389> choice<00:04:06.599> anymore<00:04:06.840> then<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.739> gave<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:08.010> some

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
a choice anymore then it gave you some

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.979 
a choice anymore then it gave you some
kind<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.579> bonus<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.209> then<00:04:09.419> they<00:04:09.540> took<00:04:09.750> that

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
kind of bonus and then they took that

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.770 
kind of bonus and then they took that
out<00:04:10.019> after<00:04:10.579> before<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.790> game<00:04:11.910> actually<00:04:12.359> came

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
out after before the game actually came

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.199 
out after before the game actually came
out<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:14.220> it's<00:04:14.430> kind<00:04:14.579> of<00:04:14.609> curious<00:04:14.910> when<00:04:15.120> you

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
out so it's kind of curious when you

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.270 
out so it's kind of curious when you
think<00:04:15.359> about<00:04:15.419> it<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.769> cool<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.010> they

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
think about it and it's cool that they

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.860 
think about it and it's cool that they
made<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.760> effort<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.180> make<00:04:18.419> these<00:04:18.570> subclasses

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
made the effort to make these subclasses

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.849 
made the effort to make these subclasses
I<00:04:19.169> don't<00:04:19.289> know<00:04:19.349> how<00:04:19.470> long<00:04:19.620> they've<00:04:19.829> been

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
I don't know how long they've been

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.830 
I don't know how long they've been
working<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.310> them<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.639> have<00:04:21.150> no<00:04:21.359> idea<00:04:21.539> how<00:04:21.719> to

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
working on them I have no idea how to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.380 
working on them I have no idea how to
guess<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.640> another<00:04:23.640> thing<00:04:23.760> about<00:04:23.849> mayhem<00:04:24.210> is

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
guess that another thing about mayhem is

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.209 
guess that another thing about mayhem is
that<00:04:24.510> is<00:04:24.659> that<00:04:24.750> heavy<00:04:25.110> ammo<00:04:25.440> comes<00:04:25.740> like<00:04:25.979> three

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219 
that is that heavy ammo comes like three

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.990 
that is that heavy ammo comes like three
times<00:04:26.400> as<00:04:26.580> often

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
times as often

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.440 
times as often
so<00:04:27.060> um<00:04:28.400> yeah<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.460> know<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:29.700> I<00:04:29.850> do<00:04:30.060> want<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.360> make

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
so um yeah you know I I do want to make

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.730 
so um yeah you know I I do want to make
a<00:04:30.510> video<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.810> talk<00:04:31.020> about<00:04:31.290> because<00:04:31.500> i<00:04:31.590> made<00:04:31.710> a

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
a video and talk about because i made a

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.200 
a video and talk about because i made a
video<00:04:31.890> talking<00:04:32.250> about<00:04:32.520> kind<00:04:32.730> of<00:04:32.760> like<00:04:32.940> ranting

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
video talking about kind of like ranting

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.450 
video talking about kind of like ranting
on<00:04:33.450> feminism<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:34.320> couple<00:04:34.830> days<00:04:34.950> ago<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.370> how<00:04:35.430> I

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
on feminism a couple days ago and how I

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.800 
on feminism a couple days ago and how I
didn't<00:04:35.760> see<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:35.880> as<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.030> bad<00:04:36.210> thing<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:36.690> hope

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
didn't see it as a bad thing and I hope

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.360 
didn't see it as a bad thing and I hope
that<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.110> younger<00:04:37.440> generation<00:04:37.920> don't<00:04:38.130> think

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
that the younger generation don't think

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.580 
that the younger generation don't think
don't<00:04:38.850> take<00:04:39.060> things<00:04:39.270> like<00:04:39.510> Menon<00:04:40.230> astir

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
don't take things like Menon astir

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.890 
don't take things like Menon astir
mechanism<00:04:41.160> too<00:04:41.430> seriously<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.120> like<00:04:42.390> that

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
mechanism too seriously and like that

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.270 
mechanism too seriously and like that
they<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.260> view<00:04:43.530> it<00:04:43.560> as<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.710> joke<00:04:43.980> and<00:04:44.040> that

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
they just view it as a joke and that

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.670 
they just view it as a joke and that
they<00:04:44.490> don't<00:04:45.090> forget<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.480> Bennett<00:04:46.080> feminism

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
they don't forget that Bennett feminism

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.350 
they don't forget that Bennett feminism
in<00:04:46.830> itself<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.250> not<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.400> bad<00:04:47.550> thing<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:48.210> was

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
in itself is not a bad thing that was
