00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.520
 I really like this room she gave me a 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.010
 little caprichito although the book does not 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.910
 took until August and I bought them are white 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.530
 plays of the system as it is said and 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.959

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 euros and I do not intend to do it 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.180
 but it's true that I really want 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.770
