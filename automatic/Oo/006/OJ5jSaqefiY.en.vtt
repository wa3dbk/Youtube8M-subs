jersey jerseys pretty cool so this was
made<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> scale<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.969> little<00:02:00.210> bigger

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

then maybe some figures you've seen the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.679 
then maybe some figures you've seen the
past<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:04.079> they<00:02:04.530> mass<00:02:04.860> produce<00:02:05.329> so<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
past that they mass produce so it's a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.070 
past that they mass produce so it's a
little<00:02:06.840> bigger<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.920> thicker<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:09.239> everything
