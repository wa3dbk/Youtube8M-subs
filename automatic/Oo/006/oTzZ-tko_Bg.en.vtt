in fact diffusing high wind situations
he<00:00:37.680> could<00:00:37.829> actually<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.160> ahead<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> just

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
he could actually go ahead and just

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.069 
he could actually go ahead and just
stake<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.180> corner<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.079> tent<00:00:40.290> and

stake out one corner of the tent and

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.930 
stake out one corner of the tent and
spread<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.290> poles<00:00:43.500> through<00:00:43.739> set<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> up

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
spread all the poles through set it up

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.069 
spread all the poles through set it up
by<00:00:45.120> himself<00:00:45.420> without<00:00:45.600> having<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.930> whole

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
by himself without having the whole

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.389 
by himself without having the whole
thing<00:00:46.260> blow<00:00:46.469> away<00:00:48.649> see<00:00:49.649> by<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> size<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
thing blow away see by the size of the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.470 
thing blow away see by the size of the
fly<00:00:50.640> how<00:00:51.360> big<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.719> thing<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> be

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.360 

okay<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.750> carefully<00:00:58.649> laying<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.130> tent

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
okay just carefully laying out the tent

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.729 
okay just carefully laying out the tent
so<00:00:59.970> that<00:01:00.000> he's<00:01:00.210> got<00:01:00.540> all<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.230> tunnels

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
so that he's got all the the tunnels

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.640 
so that he's got all the the tunnels
laid<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.790> in<00:01:02.970> a<00:01:03.030> nice<00:01:03.180> flat<00:01:03.510> position<00:01:03.989> makes<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
laid out in a nice flat position makes a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.649 
laid out in a nice flat position makes a
pull<00:01:05.210> insertion<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.270> lot<00:01:06.420> easier<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:09.390> notice

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
pull insertion a lot easier you notice

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.000 
pull insertion a lot easier you notice
that<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.869> he's<00:01:10.020> threading<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> poles<00:01:10.710> through

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that as he's threading the poles through

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.780 
that as he's threading the poles through
he's<00:01:12.410> assembling<00:01:13.410> the<00:01:13.560> poles<00:01:13.800> rather<00:01:14.670> than

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
he's assembling the poles rather than

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.719 
he's assembling the poles rather than
having<00:01:14.940> them<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.509> long<00:01:15.840> piece<00:01:16.729> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
having them in one long piece that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.340 
having them in one long piece that
certainly<00:01:18.000> makes<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> easier<00:01:18.420> when<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.290> in

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
certainly makes it easier when you're in

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499 
certainly makes it easier when you're in
tight<00:01:19.759> conditions<00:01:20.759> rather<00:01:21.150> than<00:01:21.270> having<00:01:21.479> one

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
tight conditions rather than having one

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.180 
tight conditions rather than having one
big<00:01:21.810> pole<00:01:22.050> that's<00:01:22.259> dangling<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
big pole that's dangling out there and

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.980 
big pole that's dangling out there and
slapping<00:01:23.640> people<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> face<00:01:26.810> slides<00:01:27.810> each

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
slapping people in the face slides each

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
slapping people in the face slides each
pole<00:01:28.289> all<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.100> way<00:01:29.190> into<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> end<00:01:29.580> of<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
pole all the way into the end of the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.749 
pole all the way into the end of the
tunnel

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.360 

he's<00:01:35.759> got<00:01:35.940> three<00:01:36.240> poles

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
he's got three poles

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.480 
he's got three poles
that<00:01:38.940> go<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.660> three<00:01:39.960> hoop<00:01:40.140> poles<00:01:40.320> go<00:01:41.220> across

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that go the three hoop poles go across

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
that go the three hoop poles go across
the<00:01:41.760> tent<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.510> one<00:01:42.900> Ridge<00:01:43.200> pull<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:45.020> can't

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the tent in one Ridge pull and can't

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.210 
the tent in one Ridge pull and can't
quite<00:01:46.230> see<00:01:46.410> from<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:46.830> moving<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.100> little

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
quite see from here I'm moving a little

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.010 
quite see from here I'm moving a little
closest<00:01:47.640> thing<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.750> each<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:48.990> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
closest thing see it but each one of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.630 
closest thing see it but each one of
these<00:01:49.140> poles<00:01:49.850> is<00:01:50.850> color-coded<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
these poles is color-coded and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.920 
these poles is color-coded and
color-coded<00:01:53.640> appropriately<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.420> matched<00:01:54.630> on

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
color-coded appropriately and matched on

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780 
color-coded appropriately and matched on
the<00:01:55.080> sleeve<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> little<00:01:56.190> terracotta

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the sleeve it was a little terracotta

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.030 
the sleeve it was a little terracotta
colored<00:01:57.180> sleeve<00:01:57.540> liner<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.710> know<00:01:58.890> exactly

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
colored sleeve liner so you know exactly

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.850 
colored sleeve liner so you know exactly
what<00:01:59.400> goes<00:01:59.580> into<00:01:59.940> what<00:02:00.150> area<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.740> he's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
what goes into what area and he's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.080 
what goes into what area and he's
sliding<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.310> all<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.610> way<00:02:05.700> into<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.970> end

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
sliding it all the way into the end

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.340 
sliding it all the way into the end
socket<00:02:06.960> sets<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.740> nice<00:02:07.980> and<00:02:08.010> cleanly

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
socket sets it up nice and cleanly

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.850 
socket sets it up nice and cleanly
that's<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.440> final<00:02:10.740> assembly<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.160> pole<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
that's the final assembly of the pole I

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.590 

this<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.600> third<00:02:32.960> of<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.830> hoop<00:02:34.010> holes<00:02:34.600> goes

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
this is the third of the hoop holes goes

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.660 
this is the third of the hoop holes goes
