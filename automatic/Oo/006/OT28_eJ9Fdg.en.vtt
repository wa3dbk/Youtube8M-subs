00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello dear friends with you I am 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.880
 grew blah lighting and today i want 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.910
 talk about the personal feelings of the game in 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.830
 world of tanks blitz on android which 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.990
 appeared the fourth in google 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.990
 the market and so went 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 it is worth starting with the fact that I am extremely 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.340
 watched little what happens to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.860
 saucers in general and even never played 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.150
 in them since I am not the owner 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.970
 apple technology 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.879
 but just recently I heard in passing 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.250
 information that finally 4 numbers 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.640
 the game will be available to all owners 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.309
 android backgrounds and here is the day I will give 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.140
 gave up the appearance of the game in the google market and 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.900
 put it on download 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.960
 immediately after installing and running the game to me 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.059
 offered to be trained and since I 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.370
 a man who is pretty little i played in 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.739
 this kind of game decided it was better not 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.110
 tempt fate in general as it turned out 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.300
 training is very short and in fact 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.640
 understand the game is not difficult 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.409
 about bulgaria this is what i can do in it 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.659
 I think itâ€™s not worth talking much 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.780
 I will only say that everything is very convenient and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.780
 intuitive for those who are not at all 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.670
 played in the tank there is great and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.200
 unobtrusive training which highlights and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 shows what's what 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.070
 if you go to the settings, we will see the menu 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.290
 sound adjustments 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.080
 camera sensitivity setting 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.140
 interface word you are able to it 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.510
 change as it will be convenient for you and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.200
 tank display markers can also be 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.020
 twist up 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.520
 Now the most important thing is how to play 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.160
 world of tanks blitz 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.590
 Personally, I am in the first battle still slightly 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.200
 accustomed to management and not quite 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.660
 understanding the changed cards could do 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.300
 about three frags and get a few 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.150
 medalek managing me more than 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.220
 arranged and the only thing i would like to have 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.370
 ability to zoom in and out 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.530
 from the tank otherwise adapting to 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.379
 management has passed absolutely no problems 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.959
 especially pleased avtopritsel and how 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.940
 it works if in computer tanks 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.970
 you push a button and it fires 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.220
 auto-aiming then in this case 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.069
 autorun works automatically but he 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.620
 not tied to a tank and are you able 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.140
 that a little bit fix the sight on seeing 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.690
 his leg is a piece of tower well or vulnerable 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.130
 place graphic component of me in 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.200
 Overall I was pleased it certainly was not 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.170
 wait model but visually looks 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.270
 quite nice though i would like to 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.250
 introduced graphics filters and it was possible 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.670
 put there photo chronic or 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.370
 soft colors sounds of shots of hits and 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.180
 the voice of the crew is also very pleased 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.760
 the battle itself is in 7 to 7 format, taking into account 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.000
 that almost all the cards have been changed and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.400
 there were absolutely new this more than 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.070
 enough the game itself goes through quite 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.440
 dynamically and in every fight that I was 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.720
 there was a constant mesilovo 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.090
 one of the features of mobile tanks 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.610
 that all of your machines have a built-in 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.070
 light bulb and and no need to download that 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.740
 quite useful completely forgot to say that 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.740
 all haters of artillery class 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.620
 holiday since there is no art in blitz 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.500
 so that all the rage bus arta may already 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.270
 run and download mobile tanks if 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.090
 of course your device is capable of them 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.710
 support exactly which characteristics 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.410
 need to play comfortably 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.720
 blitz I do not know the site is only written 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.140
 that for all owners of the android version 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.920
 40 and higher on my meizu mx4 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.520
 the game goes absolutely without lag 50 60 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.890
 fps 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.020
 how good is it with the owners 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.480
 budget smartphones I can not say 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.000
 but as stated in one of 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.280
 official videos now mobile tanks 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.770
 work with over 700 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.110
 various devices and what is the result 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.530
 if your mobile phone is enough 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.440
 powerful yes faster run swing and thunder i 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.260
 I am sure that most will like it 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.959
 even if not then at least try 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.150
 definitely worth it I personally even managed 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.370
 for the first half hour of the game buy straight 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.910
 account because it offered to carry 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.100
 some with a huge discount lured me 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.920
 really would like to find the cons of mobile 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.990
 version but could not except minimap 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.870
 for me is not too clear and 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.480
 maybe I still played a little but 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.760
 this moment is a great adaptation 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.830
 tank in the mobile world in which you can 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.470
 play when you have free 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.490
 time she was with you all Yaroslav 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.590
 lighting 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.750
 if you already played blitz on android 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.550
 necessarily 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.130
 share your opinion in the comments 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.440
 I think many who doubt whether 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.050
 try this game your comment will be 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.650
