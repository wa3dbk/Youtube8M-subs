00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
I think it's very light but you could

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.030 
I think it's very light but you could
build<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.149> very<00:02:03.450> silky<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.890> can

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
build it it's very silky and you can

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
build it it's very silky and you can
wear<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.280> by<00:02:05.399> itself<00:02:05.430> or<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.750> wear<00:02:06.869> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
over powder it is a foundation powder so

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.190 
over powder it is a foundation powder so
it's<00:02:09.479> gonna<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:10.580> coverage

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200
