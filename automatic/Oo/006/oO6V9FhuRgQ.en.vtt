00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.570
 good afternoon dear viewers today we are with 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.700
 we'll talk and look at a very 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.380
 beautiful plant which is called 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.260
 glue 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.000
 Now she's really all in the bud, but when 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.610
 all the arrow will come out 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.890
 each flower will look like 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.140
 a little orange gram donut is very 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.440
 beautiful and the most important thing that it blooms 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.829
 a very long field should not have or 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.149
 it scatters light but if it stands on 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.230
 direct sunlight 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.180
 here is how a leaf lies like in many plants 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.890
 there is a light streak here it will be 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.879
 part will be bright under it 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.879
 dark green 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.949
 so avoid bright light but 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.560
 good lighting must 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.250
 to be scattered so that she is whole 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.830
 if you put it in the summer of late spring 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.429
 earlier autumn and summer while on the street 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.340
 temperature somewhere up to 16 degrees on 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.470
 the street she feels very good in 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.960
 first secondly in gratitude for it 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.509
 release the next arrow flower 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.880
 if she stands in the apartment by the rest period 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.250
 can last about a year if she 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.500
 faded and faded you put on 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.810
 the street can get this much 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.630
 less 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.150
 nod question she doesn't need leathery 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.880
 very hard sheet it is in itself 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.509
 beautiful even when it does not bloom 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.909

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.840

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.950
