00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
it's pretty accurate but all this is

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
it's pretty accurate but all this is
that<00:01:54.390> chance<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.020> missing<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.469> I<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.740> just

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that chance of missing so I was just

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.760 
that chance of missing so I was just
kind<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.670> concerned<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.899> anyways

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
kind of concerned about that so anyways

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.469 
kind of concerned about that so anyways
heat<00:01:59.039> wave<00:01:59.159> hits<00:01:59.369> again<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.210> burn

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
heat wave hits again I'm like don't burn

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.599 
heat wave hits again I'm like don't burn
please<00:02:01.020> don't<00:02:01.289> burn<00:02:01.500> don't<00:02:01.890> burn<00:02:02.039> too<00:02:02.340> burned

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
please don't burn don't burn too burned

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:03.140 
please don't burn don't burn too burned
over

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
over

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.320 
over
and<00:02:03.540> didn't<00:02:04.200> burn<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.940> not<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.210> you

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
and didn't burn so it's not like you

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.180 
and didn't burn so it's not like you
just<00:02:06.480> crunch<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> amazing<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
just crunch and this is amazing like I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.040 
just crunch and this is amazing like I
guess<00:02:08.520> since<00:02:08.790> you<00:02:09.030> know<00:02:09.149> returns<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:09.810> weak

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
guess since you know returns so weak
