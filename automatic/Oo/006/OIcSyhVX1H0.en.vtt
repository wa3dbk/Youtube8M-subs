00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
pretty well out of this bunch but hey

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.410 
pretty well out of this bunch but hey
this<00:03:29.280> guy<00:03:29.459> was<00:03:29.579> running<00:03:29.640> cover<00:03:29.940> for<00:03:30.209> pretty

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
this guy was running cover for pretty

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.020 
this guy was running cover for pretty
much<00:03:30.510> our<00:03:30.690> game<00:03:31.130> majority<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.190> game<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.820> the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
much our game majority the game and the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.789 
much our game majority the game and the
thing<00:03:33.209> about<00:03:33.269> cover<00:03:33.690> for<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.049> takes<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.739> takes

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
thing about cover for it takes it takes

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.330 
thing about cover for it takes it takes
some<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.579> guess<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.630> determination<00:03:37.530> or<00:03:37.709> just

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
some I guess the determination or just

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.920 
some I guess the determination or just
focus<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.060> get<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.660> got<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.840> take

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
focus is you get a you got to take

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.569 
focus is you get a you got to take
your<00:03:39.989> underneath<00:03:40.380> routes<00:03:40.650> if<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.340> sit<00:03:41.549> down

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
your underneath routes if you sit down

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.220 
your underneath routes if you sit down
this<00:03:41.790> way<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.180> some<00:03:42.299> long<00:03:42.510> route<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.840> develop

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
this way for some long route to develop

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.870 
this way for some long route to develop
you're<00:03:43.980> probably<00:03:44.130> gonna<00:03:44.310> take<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.489> coverage

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
you're probably gonna take a coverage

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.880 
you're probably gonna take a coverage
saxo<00:03:45.390> but<00:03:45.660> there's<00:03:45.930> only<00:03:46.019> easily<00:03:46.410> one<00:03:46.620> hook

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
saxo but there's only easily one hook

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.800 
saxo but there's only easily one hook
zone<00:03:47.160> or<00:03:47.400> yellow<00:03:47.579> zone<00:03:47.880> underneath<00:03:48.329> look<00:03:48.540> so

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
zone or yellow zone underneath look so

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.420 
zone or yellow zone underneath look so
I'm<00:03:48.900> what're<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.109> gonna<00:03:49.200> call<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:50.070> if<00:03:50.280> you

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
I'm what're you gonna call it so if you

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.860 
I'm what're you gonna call it so if you
just<00:03:50.549> flood<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.030> zone<00:03:51.060> underneath<00:03:51.660> whole

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
just flood the zone underneath whole

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.599 
just flood the zone underneath whole
bunch<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.170> short<00:03:52.350> crossing<00:03:52.620> routes<00:03:53.010> I'm<00:03:53.430> just

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
bunch of short crossing routes I'm just

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.490 
bunch of short crossing routes I'm just
thinking<00:03:54.060> Duncan<00:03:54.450> get<00:03:54.959> yards<00:03:55.140> after<00:03:55.350> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
thinking Duncan get yards after the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.720 
thinking Duncan get yards after the
catch<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.010> that's<00:03:56.190> definitely<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.670> would

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
catch so that's definitely I would

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.430 
catch so that's definitely I would
suggest<00:03:57.269> right<00:03:57.720> here<00:03:57.840> would<00:03:57.959> roll<00:03:58.170> out<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.380> a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
suggest right here would roll out of a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.289 
suggest right here would roll out of a
pocket<00:03:58.650> he's<00:03:59.310> running<00:03:59.670> cover<00:03:59.880> for<00:04:00.150> wait

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
pocket he's running cover for wait

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.420 
pocket he's running cover for wait
really<00:04:00.540> we<00:04:01.109> passed<00:04:01.380> up<00:04:01.590> our<00:04:01.739> Dinka<00:04:02.100> dump<00:04:02.310> her
