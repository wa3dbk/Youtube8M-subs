00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello to everything we find ourselves 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.009
 today for a new tutorial of 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.660
 ultra fast nail art I just wanted 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.019
 show you how to make flakes 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.460
 snow very simply on your nails 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.410
 so I start of course by applying 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.000
 my step which is the blondness of home 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.220
 aurÃ©lie you start to know her 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.840
 laundering in all my videos and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.550
 and then I thought I was going 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.920
 to make a small gradient of varnish 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.279
 holographic so I used 3g 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.189
 use jewels from sir than dancing 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.040
 with the red hood schering india and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.630
 the other I do not remember 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.860
 it's still a circus and I'm 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.809
 more of his name I would put him in the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.280
 bar of pure anyway the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.780
 last holographic degrade very 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.950
 well he could do a test before on 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.809
 angliers to see if they are well 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.879
 covering have no less layers the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.739
 enough quote if ever for you it's 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.539
 not enough you put a black base 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.120
 or at the limit the blue as I did 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.360
 in blue below and it works very 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.399
 well 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.079
 so I did not protect but I'm told 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.449
 all that I just had laziness in 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.739
 do but lolo graph it goes away 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.239
 pretty much of course the skin so that's because 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.590
 that a poem obviously I encourage you 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 still protect your nails before 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.320
 to make your gradient you will gain 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.320
 cleaning time etc 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.800
 then I took a white liner from the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.330
 brand color club I would put you a 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.570
 binding to find them in the bar 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.460
 info for me these are the liners the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.320
 better since they finally have what 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.330
 really well cut otherwise we could 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.520
 take the impasse on white with a 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.750
 hot weather or a white polish but 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.790
 it's a bit harder to handle 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.380
 for the drawing of the crazy I leave you 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.430
 watch the video since explained 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 it's a bit complicated 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.010
 I will finish by putting the top coat 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.570
 so I use the brand poacher 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.980
 mow which is an accelerator of 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.090
 drying that I really like you I 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.310
 would put a link in the info bar 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.380
 if you want a site to find it 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.640
 I hope his universe will have you all 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.230
 please do not hesitate to leave your 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.680
 comment right below this 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.330
 video 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.740
 I hope you do Christmas 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.910

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.120
