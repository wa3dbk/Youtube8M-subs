00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
arkham origins multiplayer if here i'm

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.559 
arkham origins multiplayer if here i'm
actually<00:02:47.040> going<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.459> go<00:02:47.580> ahead<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.850> get<00:02:48.239> into

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
actually going to go ahead and get into

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.990 
actually going to go ahead and get into
a<00:02:48.600> little<00:02:48.810> bit<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.470> if<00:02:50.310> you're<00:02:50.850> going

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
a little bit of it but if you're going

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.250 
a little bit of it but if you're going
to<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.330> taking<00:02:51.780> down<00:02:52.640> Batman<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.150> Robin<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.959> I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
to be taking down Batman and Robin so I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.850 
to be taking down Batman and Robin so I
guess<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.920> might<00:02:56.190> confirm<00:02:56.519> Robin<00:02:57.060> also<00:02:57.860> it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
guess that might confirm Robin also it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.280 
guess that might confirm Robin also it
could<00:02:59.040> be<00:02:59.220> really<00:02:59.400> weird<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.239> because<00:03:00.750> one<00:03:01.049> is

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
could be really weird and because one is

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.470 
could be really weird and because one is
it<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.769> be<00:03:01.860> like<00:03:01.890> Maps<00:03:02.489> or<00:03:02.819> is<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.239> going

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
it going to be like Maps or is it going

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.979 
it going to be like Maps or is it going
to<00:03:03.569> be<00:03:03.720> like<00:03:03.750> small<00:03:04.880> contained<00:03:05.880> arenas<00:03:06.660> like

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
to be like small contained arenas like

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.280 
to be like small contained arenas like
it<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.739> on<00:03:08.160> batman<00:03:08.910> arkham<00:03:09.299> city<00:03:09.690> by<00:03:09.900> confiding

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
it is on batman arkham city by confiding

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.199 
it is on batman arkham city by confiding
in<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.590> gameplay<00:03:10.980> right<00:03:11.190> now<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.760> there<00:03:12.120> gonna

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
in the gameplay right now is there gonna

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.570 
in the gameplay right now is there gonna
be<00:03:12.299> something<00:03:12.690> like<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.260> or<00:03:13.560> are<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.370> going

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
be something like that or are we going

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.390 
be something like that or are we going
to<00:03:14.700> be<00:03:14.880> fighting<00:03:15.060> across<00:03:15.569> a<00:03:15.930> huge<00:03:16.290> area<00:03:16.650> like

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
to be fighting across a huge area like

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.810 
to be fighting across a huge area like
let's<00:03:17.819> say<00:03:17.940> all<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.900> arkham<00:03:19.560> city<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.310> maybe

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
let's say all of arkham city and maybe

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.940 
let's say all of arkham city and maybe
get<00:03:21.150> maybe<00:03:21.480> i<00:03:21.630> don't<00:03:21.870> know<00:03:22.940> 6v6<00:03:23.940> i<00:03:24.510> guess<00:03:24.720> and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
get maybe i don't know 6v6 i guess and

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.220 
get maybe i don't know 6v6 i guess and
fight<00:03:25.950> over<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.430> area<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.690> i<00:03:27.720> think<00:03:27.989> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
fight over that area so i think that

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.500 
fight over that area so i think that
would<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.620> really<00:03:28.650> awesome<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.390> know

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
would be really awesome but you know

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.500 
would be really awesome but you know
honestly<00:03:30.780> i<00:03:31.290> don't<00:03:31.799> think<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.100> will<00:03:32.400> happen

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
honestly i don't think that will happen

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.240 
honestly i don't think that will happen
um<00:03:33.510> i<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:33.959> it's<00:03:34.350> gonna<00:03:34.440> be<00:03:34.680> like<00:03:34.859> a<00:03:34.890> small

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.250 
origins like fighting style in a
multiplayer<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:48.150> could<00:03:48.390> be<00:03:48.510> really<00:03:48.810> confusing

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
multiplayer it could be really confusing

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.560 
multiplayer it could be really confusing
because<00:03:49.560> players<00:03:49.950> would<00:03:50.280> be<00:03:50.430> simply<00:03:51.150> beating

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
themselves and it wouldn't really work

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.270 
themselves and it wouldn't really work
if<00:03:54.690> they<00:03:55.049> were<00:03:55.109> goodnight<00:03:55.560> it'd<00:03:55.829> have<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:56.100> go

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
if they were goodnight it'd have to go

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.840 
if they were goodnight it'd have to go
to<00:03:56.459> like<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:57.109> like<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.140> like<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:59.370> fighting<00:03:59.819> game
