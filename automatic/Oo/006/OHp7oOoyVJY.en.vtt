I am the sort of person that looks at a

I am the sort of person that looks at a
shopping<00:00:19.829> trolley<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.520> wonders<00:00:20.910> whether<00:00:21.090> it

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
will drift around my local tesco I don't

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.609 
will drift around my local tesco I don't
have<00:00:24.329> a<00:00:24.360> shopping<00:00:24.689> trolley<00:00:25.079> with<00:00:25.290> me<00:00:25.470> here

or<00:00:27.000> actually<00:00:27.360> I<00:00:27.779> sort<00:00:28.200> of<00:00:28.349> do<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.669> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
or actually I sort of do it's this the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.440 
or actually I sort of do it's this the
Renault<00:00:31.020> Twizy<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.669> highly<00:00:33.090> relevant

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
Renault Twizy so the highly relevant

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.130 
Renault Twizy so the highly relevant
question<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.679> it<00:00:34.829> drift<00:00:35.840> let's<00:00:36.840> face<00:00:37.109> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
question is will it drift let's face it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.770 
question is will it drift let's face it
the<00:00:37.890> electrically<00:00:38.309> powered<00:00:38.579> Twizy<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.449> not

just be able to drift the best of which

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.200 
just be able to drift the best of which
are<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.589> rear-wheel<00:01:05.129> drive<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:06.180> a

are that it's rear-wheel drive and has a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.090 
are that it's rear-wheel drive and has a
chassis<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.140> signed<00:01:07.380> off<00:01:07.560> by<00:01:07.619> Renault

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
chassis that was signed off by Renault

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.050 
chassis that was signed off by Renault
Sport<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.899> do<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.079> think<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.159> or

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
Sport so what do you think will it or

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
Sport so what do you think will it or
won't<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.069 

guess<00:01:20.890> what<00:01:21.429> on<00:01:21.969> the<00:01:22.090> right<00:01:22.270> kind<00:01:22.539> of<00:01:22.600> surface

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
guess what on the right kind of surface

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.310 
guess what on the right kind of surface
are<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.770> one<00:01:23.950> with<00:01:24.100> no<00:01:24.369> grip<00:01:24.700> whatsoever<00:01:25.509> and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
are you one with no grip whatsoever and

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.380 
are you one with no grip whatsoever and
with<00:01:26.439> big<00:01:26.710> enough<00:01:26.920> idiots<00:01:27.490> behind<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.000> wheel

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
with big enough idiots behind the wheel

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.590 
with big enough idiots behind the wheel
ie<00:01:28.780> this<00:01:29.170> one<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:30.009> Twizy<00:01:30.369> turns<00:01:30.759> out<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.179> be<00:01:31.210> a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
ie this one the Twizy turns out to be a

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.200 
ie this one the Twizy turns out to be a
complete<00:01:32.380> peach<00:01:33.069> when<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.640> comes<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:34.030> going

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
complete peach when it comes to going

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.200 
complete peach when it comes to going
sideways<00:01:35.039> as<00:01:36.039> you<00:01:36.219> can<00:01:36.369> see<00:01:36.549> there's<00:01:36.789> loads<00:01:37.060> of

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
sideways as you can see there's loads of

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.419 
sideways as you can see there's loads of
steering<00:01:37.630> lock<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.049> bags<00:01:38.709> are<00:01:38.860> balanced<00:01:39.250> from

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
steering lock and bags are balanced from

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.910 
steering lock and bags are balanced from
the<00:01:39.610> mid-engine<00:01:39.909> chassis<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.619> long<00:01:41.740> as<00:01:41.829> you

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
the mid-engine chassis so long as you

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.350 
the mid-engine chassis so long as you
keep<00:01:42.100> its<00:01:42.310> throttle<00:01:42.700> welded<00:01:43.179> to<00:01:43.329> the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
keep its throttle welded to the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.260 
keep its throttle welded to the
floorboards<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.110> fact<00:01:44.439> it'll<00:01:45.100> drift<00:01:45.459> all<00:01:45.819> day

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
floorboards in fact it'll drift all day

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.350 
floorboards in fact it'll drift all day
long<00:01:46.630> or<00:01:47.200> at<00:01:47.409> least<00:01:47.679> until<00:01:48.490> its<00:01:48.640> battery<00:01:49.149> runs

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
long or at least until its battery runs

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.719 
long or at least until its battery runs
out<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.719> puff<00:01:50.039> which<00:01:51.039> will<00:01:51.189> happen<00:01:51.429> in

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
out of puff which will happen in

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.729 
out of puff which will happen in
approximately<00:01:52.539> 10<00:01:52.929> minutes<00:01:53.200> flat

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:53.739 
approximately 10 minutes flat

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.899 
approximately 10 minutes flat
if<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.700> drive<00:01:54.939> about<00:01:55.239> this<00:01:56.489> let's<00:01:57.489> see<00:01:57.729> that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
if you drive about this let's see that

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:07.070 
if you drive about this let's see that
again<00:01:57.939> in<00:01:58.500> gratuitous<00:01:59.500> slow-motion

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.109 

so<00:02:08.080> if<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.350> original<00:02:08.440> question<00:02:09.040> was<00:02:09.430> will<00:02:10.000> it

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
so if the original question was will it

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.100 
so if the original question was will it
drift<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:11.530> answer<00:02:11.920> is
