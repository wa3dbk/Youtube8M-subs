believe<00:05:14.169> Whitaker<00:05:14.740> started<00:05:15.099> today<00:05:15.310> although

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
believe Whitaker started today although

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.029 
believe Whitaker started today although
he<00:05:16.210> didn't<00:05:16.539> play<00:05:16.630> too<00:05:16.750> badly<00:05:17.199> but<00:05:17.650> that<00:05:17.830> was

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
he didn't play too badly but that was

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.649 
he didn't play too badly but that was
because<00:05:18.280> he<00:05:18.909> didn't<00:05:19.240> really<00:05:19.389> have<00:05:19.630> much

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
because he didn't really have much

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.960 
because he didn't really have much
pressure<00:05:20.199> on<00:05:20.349> him<00:05:20.530> I<00:05:20.680> still<00:05:21.340> want<00:05:21.580> Bennett<00:05:21.880> to
