rule which I don't I don't go with the
parallel<00:01:22.890> universe<00:01:23.280> crab<00:01:23.520> external<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.270> think

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
parallel universe crab external I think

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.010 
parallel universe crab external I think
terminal<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.830> land<00:01:26.070> east<00:01:26.970> thing<00:01:27.840> let

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
terminal is just a land east thing let

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.740 
terminal is just a land east thing let
me<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.259> where's<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> coke<00:01:29.009> UT<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.490> ya<00:01:29.790> its

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
me think where's the coke UT for ya its

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.069 
me think where's the coke UT for ya its
east<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:32.240> powerful<00:01:33.240> effect<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.869> like

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
east of a powerful effect just like

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.230 
east of a powerful effect just like
we're<00:01:34.619> done<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.400> any<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> Lance<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
we're done or any of the Lance is in the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.380 
we're done or any of the Lance is in the
alleged<00:01:39.509> assault<00:01:39.780> alone<00:01:40.020> um<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:42.930> course<00:01:43.200> I

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
alleged assault alone um of course I

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.700 
alleged assault alone um of course I
think<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:48.110> they<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.380> counterparts

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
think that they do have counterparts

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.090 
think that they do have counterparts
like<00:01:50.159> uh<00:01:50.399> uh<00:01:52.310> yeah<00:01:54.409> same<00:01:55.409> rest<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> them<00:01:55.920> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
like uh uh yeah same rest of them in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.260 
like uh uh yeah same rest of them in
there<00:02:00.710> let's<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.860> his<00:02:02.159> man<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.909> actually

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
there let's see his man is actually

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.850 
there let's see his man is actually
supposed<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.659> be<00:02:03.780> more<00:02:04.020> evil<00:02:04.200> than<00:02:04.409> Majora's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
supposed to be more evil than Majora's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.709 
supposed to be more evil than Majora's
it's<00:02:05.159> plus<00:02:05.369> being<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.790> more<00:02:05.969> powerful<00:02:06.119> evil

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
it's plus being a more powerful evil

it's plus being a more powerful evil
which<00:02:07.469> gets<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> point<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:10.250> doesn't

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
which gets to the point that doesn't

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.530 
which gets to the point that doesn't
make<00:02:11.310> sense<00:02:11.370> like

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
make sense like

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.780 
make sense like
dieting<00:02:13.730> cause<00:02:14.730> anything<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:16.290> would<00:02:17.280> see
