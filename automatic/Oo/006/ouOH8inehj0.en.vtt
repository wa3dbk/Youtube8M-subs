would essentially involve outsiders

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.699 
would essentially involve outsiders

think<00:04:04.859> that<00:04:05.190> one<00:04:05.370> has<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:05.669> make<00:04:05.790> the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
think that one has to make the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.430 
think that one has to make the
distinction<00:04:06.299> between<00:04:06.599> an<00:04:06.870> independent

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
distinction between an independent

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.830 
distinction between an independent
process<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.099> in<00:04:08.220> international<00:04:08.879> process<00:04:09.269> we

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
process and in international process we

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.349 
process and in international process we
respect<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.409> sovereign<00:04:10.769> rights<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.359> Britain

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
respect the sovereign rights of Britain

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.990 
respect the sovereign rights of Britain
of<00:04:12.599> every<00:04:13.349> other<00:04:13.440> country<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.129> we<00:04:14.609> expect<00:04:14.970> you

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
of every other country and we expect you

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.539 
of every other country and we expect you
to<00:04:15.209> respect<00:04:15.599> ours<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.560> we<00:04:16.590> are<00:04:16.889> sovereign<00:04:17.250> an

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
to respect ours so we are sovereign an

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.909 
to respect ours so we are sovereign an
independent<00:04:18.120> state<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.599> naturally<00:04:19.529> we<00:04:19.650> apply

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
independent state and naturally we apply

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.159 
independent state and naturally we apply
the<00:04:19.979> same<00:04:20.570> courtesies<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.930> would

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
the same courtesies that you would

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.490 
the same courtesies that you would
expect<00:04:22.800> us<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.039> apply<00:04:23.400> for<00:04:23.639> your<00:04:23.729> country

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
expect us to apply for your country

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.730 
expect us to apply for your country
so<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:24.890> different<00:04:25.130> from<00:04:25.400> an<00:04:25.550> international

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
so it is different from an international

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.810 
so it is different from an international
inquiry<00:04:27.740> we<00:04:28.070> do<00:04:28.250> have<00:04:28.460> an<00:04:28.580> independent

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
inquiry we do have an independent

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.670 
inquiry we do have an independent
inquiry<00:04:29.480> and<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:30.140> think<00:04:30.380> many<00:04:30.590> people

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
inquiry and I think many people

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.940 
inquiry and I think many people
initially<00:04:31.460> criticized<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.870> LLRC<00:04:33.380> process

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
initially criticized the LLRC process

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.370 
initially criticized the LLRC process
until<00:04:34.400> they<00:04:34.580> actually<00:04:34.760> sweet<00:04:35.750> when<00:04:36.080> they<00:04:36.200> saw

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
until they actually sweet when they saw

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.080 
until they actually sweet when they saw
it<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.650> was<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.830> three<00:04:37.070> hour<00:04:37.160> native<00:04:37.550> page

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
it it was a three hour native page

it it was a three hour native page
document<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.720> was<00:04:38.840> critical<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.350> government

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
document it was critical of government

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.890 
document it was critical of government
and<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.550> president<00:04:40.970> not<00:04:41.180> only<00:04:41.210> released<00:04:41.720> it
