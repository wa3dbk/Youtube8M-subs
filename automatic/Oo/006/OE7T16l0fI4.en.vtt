00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.520
 hello to all these marcia I hope that 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.170
 you're fine then I'm coming back 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.060
 today not to talk to you about 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.800
 images that you could see right before 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.260
 so that is my hair loss 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.760
 so so I had a happy event 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.409
 which has produced benefit in my 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.060
 hair but who just after ben did 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.420
 more produces benefit in my 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.300
 hair 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.890
 so I decided to talk to you about it 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.700
 because it's a bit of a phase 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.830
 particular particular forgiveness to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.790
 level of our hair so I decided 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.420
 to tell you about it anyway so here 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.730
 to tell you about it so as you have 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.420
 could see I'm losing a lot of hair so 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.880
 in just 1 2 combs and ben 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.530
 and just pulls the tip of my 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 hair down I already have a lot of hair 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.180
 who leave and at the end of the disentangling 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.100
 July this is a big mass of 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.170
 hair I really do not used to 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.820
 lose so much hair when even 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.709
 after looking for a 13 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.989
 week I'm not used to losing 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.720
 so much hair here is so it's a 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.239
 a special phase that I hope 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.709
 will not last very long 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.220
 and for that in fact I have already started a 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.200
 treatment 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.640
 so I've already passed a first 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.700
 times by hair loss 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.130
 so I intend to use all that 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.799
 I learned at the first time 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.519
 to be able to decrease shorten the 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.870
 fall time as much as possible and that's it 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.209
 that I have two the least fall 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.250
 possible in fact so the first one when 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.200
 of the first hair loss this has a 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.670
 price about nine months so that the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.260
 fall completely stops 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.549
 so here this time I do not know 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.959
 how long will it take and in 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.410
 all cases I hope it was very 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.450
 very quickly 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.720
 so so for that I actually started 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.280
 by taking magnesium b6 so be 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.660
 attentive in fact compared to the magne 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.370
 magnesium magnesium of the six in fact there 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.410
 was prescribed to me by my doctor you do not 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.120
 can not take it as free it does not 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.400
 you have been prescribed by your doctor 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.660
 in any case this one after do not know 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.190
 not if there are others you can 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.019
 to see without a prescription in a pharmacy 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.760
 we must try to see but in all 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.799
 the cases out of ten it was prescribed by the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.470
 doctor and I can take it without any 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.730
 worries so stops and vitamins but 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.769
 it's also a medicine we need 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.920
 pay attention to the way that 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.530
 so we take it on the note 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.849
 this information they indicated that 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.830
 could not take it for several 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.450
 month in a row so here I was 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.950
 already used for a month because 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.989
 my fall started about a month ago 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.209
 so there so it's been about a month 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.550
 I take it already I will continue 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.870
 a second month with and I will stop 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.750
 then that's because I do not want 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.350
 have worries so I'll be two months 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.160
 maximum with magnesium b6 so a little 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.800
 magnesium b6 I also do my 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.900
 onion oil with olive oil 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.340
 chica case then place of chica case and 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.320
 it's the only oil I had left in 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.720
 my closet 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.060
 I made my lula link with so I 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.970
 cut onion rings that I have 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.520
 put in a glass jar and I put 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.160
 to the world eight dechy kaka and overcoat 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.110
 have onions and then I have 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.900
 left in the fridge macerate for four 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.510
 days here then and then bagis 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.330
 extreme oil of kayes chic and I 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.440
 got rid of onions so 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.240
 how am I going to use 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.760
 this oil so I'm going to use 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.380
 simply and only on the leather 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.669
 hairy and not on all my hair sees 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.620
 not on everything but length why 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.539
 because kayes chic oil has a 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.070
 smell already strong enough so with more 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.990
 the onion so it's even stronger 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.479
 the dart is even stronger 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.100
 so I'm really going to focus on 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.270
 the scalp I do not need to 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.070
 apply on my long hours 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.700
 I will use other care on my 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.190
 long hours so that's so each 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.850
 week so I would leave or ask 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.860
 All night long 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.320
 or just half a day here so 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.560
 it will be either all night or half 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:41.520
 day and then that I will raise in 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.860
 doing champlain and and proceeding to 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:52.380
 my usual routine 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:56.820
 so here I am so I have my medium b6 and in 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.830
 chica oil here and then so if 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.200
 I see that my fall does not stop 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.820
 despite these two treatments and ben I 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.130
 think to take a dietary supplement 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.389
 anti fall to test but because 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.580
 I never tested supplements 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.680
 food and non- food 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:16.120
 fall arrest past couples 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.270
 food supplement so here is so 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.320
 I count tested one I do not know 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.750
 not yet if you have any 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.130
 recommendations to give me to daisy though 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.960
 you know who works 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.180
 go ahead you even have recipes or 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.650
 things against hair loss at 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.729
 the grabbing issues of everything he 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.750
 must because hair loss 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.199
 frankly it's really not a 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.820
 joke 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:37.860
 and so that's definitely 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.030
 some consequences 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.669
 the first time I lost it anyway 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.190
 lost my little hair de van damme 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:49.000
 has front teeth hair actually 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.860
 was well balding and it was not very 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.259
 nice corner so if I could avoid 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.300
 again that's so I 'll be very 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.009
 content 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.509
 and then that's because what do I 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:00.669
 could add others ben it is 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:02.530
 all for the moment concerning my fall 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.940
 of hair so I hope she's going 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.849
 stop soon and then I'll come back 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.919
 to give news of how that 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:11.460
 is happening so see you soon girls 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:11.460
