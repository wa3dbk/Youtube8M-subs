00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.519
 in a recent video on bee removal 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 fixed creeps hives creak it 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.820
 factory replaced only tape there was 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.189
 metal native he has a video 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.869
 me propylenovye here is such a she herself 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.840
 scream he has such look he consists 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.960
 two parts 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.930
 they are hinged together 1 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.050
 such a part of the top 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.260
 has a branch and jumper and 2 on 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.530
 the loops are bent around innocence 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:50.850
 rotates back and forth it can like this 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.469
 fold it up just like that in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.039
 this side it is not so you will not lie 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:03.840
 only in this metal tape she 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.519
 just regretted and fell apart I found 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.090
 Exit here settings found this 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.140
 client for packing building blocks 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 very strong tough not subject 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.530
 no stretching is quite successful 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 option 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.490
 I began to mount these clamps like this 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.299
 done now show 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.369
 to own properly 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.189
 need to navigate how she will 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.790
 fasten i.e. the script should 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.290
 lie there and fasten here on 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.909
 I have a video there it shows how I am 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:44.520
 did when fastening the hive therefore fasten 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:48.659
 the easiest way is to fix the tape here 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 then to fasten it then you need 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:57.000
 to thread here folded in half 2 at the end of 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.049
 I leave specifically why because 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.899
 when on the edge of creta 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:09.539
 Yes, and generally will click and fix 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:20.550
 strength will increase it put here 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:27.530
 bent in half the points help here 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.530
 money to fix a strip here from 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:38.000
 I'll show you how it all looks 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.769
 there is a tape somewhere on top of the loop and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.790
 passes under the bottom of the free end 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.040
 goes under the bottom of the main tape there for sure 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.810
 also here 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.019
 the free end goes under the main 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.750
 the tape in this is the effect that 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.470
 the main tape clamps the free end 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.739
 her and and does not let her stretch it and 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.790
 holds holds everything here desirable 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.659
 to control 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.519
 but to still be in the center of the tape 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.540
 tapes were centered so as not to 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.400
 it was skewed otherwise 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.950
 happen and opening for large 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.239
 colors means how the process happens 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.319
 closing this 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.360
 It looks like this this tape 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.360
 pulls up here on this 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:32.760
 and leaves the center strengthening avent 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.099
 are obtained to come at the same level can 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.720
 be even this one below this and 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.200
 happens 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.200
 closing this lock 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.600
 but when I fasten the hives 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.970
 i do a little slack about here in 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.520
 this position fix tape 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.380
 not buttoned up and then close 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.450
 otherwise 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.530
 it is very difficult to close it happens so even 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.470
 smash covers on hives when with 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:16.829
 this position closed so strong 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:19.950
 The tension turned out well and the tape was broken 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.830
 this of course is unreal it is very durable 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.500
 material 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:31.080
 by the way the thickness of the wire on this is held together 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.210
 6 millimeters in total at manufacturing 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.240
 probably need to take into account the distance between 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.300
 this hinge and this jumper 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.810
 this is the key 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.400
 when reaching when stretching this tape 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.750
 probably the smaller the distance from the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.790
 it turns out more than more power 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.110
 are applied throughout this tape and 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.360
 the easier it will be for you 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.400
 zip it up the higher this one 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.600
 jumper here 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:05.090
 the more movement the harder it is to pull 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.090
 this tape will be on and it's harder for you to do 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.700
 something like that
