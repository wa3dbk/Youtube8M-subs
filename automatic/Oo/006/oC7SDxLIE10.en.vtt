so let's get one more class here and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.680 
so let's get one more class here and
let's<00:02:18.130> go<00:02:18.250> with<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> fully<00:02:18.970> automatic<00:02:19.420> weapon

here<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.459> five<00:02:57.880> round<00:02:58.090> burst<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.109> think

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
here is a five round burst and I think

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.110 
here is a five round burst and I think
even<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.889> the<00:02:59.980> five<00:03:00.160> round<00:03:00.400> burst<00:03:00.609> we're<00:03:00.940> going

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
even on the five round burst we're going

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.629 
even on the five round burst we're going
to<00:03:01.209> allow<00:03:01.359> you<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.630> fully<00:03:02.620> auto<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.489> whole

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
to allow you that fully auto the whole

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.690 
to allow you that fully auto the whole
time<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:04.959> doesn't<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.440> lot<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.950> controllers

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
time so it doesn't a lot of controllers

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.259 
time so it doesn't a lot of controllers
out<00:03:06.819> there<00:03:07.000> will<00:03:07.569> stop<00:03:08.230> your<00:03:08.590> your<00:03:09.519> automatic

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
sitting here as I release still there

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.500 
sitting here as I release still there
another<00:03:27.040> really<00:03:27.430> cool<00:03:27.700> little<00:03:27.940> feature<00:03:28.090> about

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
another really cool little feature about

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.479 
another really cool little feature about
this<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:28.870> we<00:03:28.989> have<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.109> feather<00:03:29.380> control<00:03:29.889> the

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
this is we have a feather control the

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.129 
this is we have a feather control the
feather<00:03:30.730> control<00:03:31.150> means<00:03:31.359> if<00:03:31.599> you<00:03:31.750> just<00:03:31.959> pull

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
feather control means if you just pull

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.379 
feather control means if you just pull
that<00:03:32.169> thing<00:03:32.470> barely<00:03:32.739> back<00:03:33.040> just<00:03:33.940> barely<00:03:34.180> you

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
that thing barely back just barely you

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.530 
that thing barely back just barely you
just<00:03:34.419> tap<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:34.930> it'll<00:03:35.739> only<00:03:35.859> fire<00:03:36.160> once<00:03:36.519> so<00:03:37.419> the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
just tap it it'll only fire once so the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.289 
just tap it it'll only fire once so the
chip<00:03:37.750> reset<00:03:38.139> is<00:03:38.290> one<00:03:38.560> one<00:03:38.919> shot<00:03:39.190> which<00:03:40.090> is

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
chip reset is one one shot which is

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.020 
chip reset is one one shot which is
another<00:03:40.900> thing<00:03:41.169> very<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.919> don't<00:03:42.430> even<00:03:42.700> know<00:03:42.910> if

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
another thing very I don't even know if

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.050 
another thing very I don't even know if
it's<00:03:43.150> out<00:03:43.269> there<00:03:43.299> tom<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:44.669> there's<00:03:45.669> our<00:03:45.760> five
