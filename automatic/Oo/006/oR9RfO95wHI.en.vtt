no-go<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> deterrent<00:00:45.980> but<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.520> much

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
no-go like a deterrent but not so much

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.000 

he<00:00:55.880> thoughts<00:00:56.120> even<00:00:56.390> though<00:00:56.630> it<00:00:56.720> only<00:00:56.870> has<00:00:57.110> 240

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
he thoughts even though it only has 240

he thoughts even though it only has 240
horsepower<00:00:58.190> it's<00:00:59.060> made<00:00:59.300> it<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.510> an<00:00:59.600> 8-speed

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
horsepower it's made it to an 8-speed

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.640 
horsepower it's made it to an 8-speed
automatic<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:01.640> guess<00:01:02.360> what<00:01:02.600> zero<00:01:02.990> to<00:01:03.110> 60<00:01:03.470> is

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
automatic and guess what zero to 60 is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.620 
automatic and guess what zero to 60 is
still<00:01:04.070> six<00:01:04.400> point<00:01:04.699> six<00:01:04.970> seconds<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:05.510> that's

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
still six point six seconds so that's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.920 
still six point six seconds so that's
not<00:01:05.900> exactly<00:01:05.960> slow<00:01:06.620> not<00:01:07.370> too<00:01:07.670> shabby<00:01:08.060> at<00:01:08.450> all<00:01:08.480> I

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
not exactly slow not too shabby at all I

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.710 
not exactly slow not too shabby at all I
