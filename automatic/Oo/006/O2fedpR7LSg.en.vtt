to the next slide but many people think

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.660 
to the next slide but many people think
in<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> world<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> here

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
in the world that when they get to here

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.670 
in the world that when they get to here
that<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.000> over<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.750> over<00:01:46.110> because

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that it's over but it's not over because

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010 
that it's over but it's not over because
when<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.549> got<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> remember<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
when you got to remember when you get to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.350 
when you got to remember when you get to
the<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.710> part<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.369> your<00:01:50.790> children<00:01:51.240> are

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the to this part here your children are

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.920 
the to this part here your children are
here<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.869> grandchildren<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.710> here

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:03.430 
here and your grandchildren are here
I<00:02:01.180> think<00:02:02.180> many<00:02:02.330> people<00:02:02.510> are<00:02:02.780> interested<00:02:03.320> in

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
I think many people are interested in

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.800 
I think many people are interested in
the<00:02:03.800> hoop<00:02:03.980> dance<00:02:04.250> because<00:02:05.180> one<00:02:05.420> thing<00:02:05.630> that

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
the hoop dance because one thing that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.780 
the hoop dance because one thing that
they<00:02:05.960> see<00:02:06.020> as<00:02:06.380> many<00:02:06.560> different<00:02:06.890> things<00:02:07.130> in<00:02:07.580> it

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
they see as many different things in it

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.700 
they see as many different things in it
it<00:02:08.030> talks<00:02:08.240> about<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.630> story<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.960> creation<00:02:09.470> and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
it talks about the story of creation and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.800 
it talks about the story of creation and
everything<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:10.820> I<00:02:11.209> really<00:02:11.570> don't<00:02:11.720> think

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
everything and I really don't think

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.230 
everything and I really don't think
there's<00:02:12.110> any<00:02:12.670> stereotyping<00:02:13.670> about<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.000> dance

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
there's any stereotyping about the dance

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.050 
there's any stereotyping about the dance
the<00:02:14.870> hoop<00:02:15.050> dance<00:02:15.290> itself<00:02:15.770> but<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.700> think<00:02:16.940> people

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
the hoop dance itself but I think people

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.330 
the hoop dance itself but I think people
really<00:02:17.840> begin<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.140> stereotype<00:02:18.920> more<00:02:19.160> about

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
really begin to stereotype more about

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.410 
really begin to stereotype more about
dancing<00:02:20.120> Native<00:02:20.420> American<00:02:20.810> dancing<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:23.390> a

things<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:37.000> think<00:02:38.590> eliminating<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
things I think eliminating the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.930 
things I think eliminating the
stereotyping<00:02:40.250> about<00:02:40.550> what's<00:02:40.730> said<00:02:40.910> about

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
stereotyping about what's said about

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.430

these all these different emotions and I
think<00:06:30.560> one<00:06:30.680> of<00:06:30.710> the<00:06:30.830> biggest<00:06:31.010> things<00:06:31.310> is<00:06:31.460> that

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
think one of the biggest things is that

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.420 
think one of the biggest things is that
that<00:06:32.120> is<00:06:32.690> that<00:06:33.050> I<00:06:33.080> may<00:06:33.620> be<00:06:33.680> native<00:06:34.130> I<00:06:34.250> may<00:06:34.370> be

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
that is that I may be native I may be

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.640 
that is that I may be native I may be
full-blooded<00:06:35.000> Native<00:06:35.360> American<00:06:35.810> but<00:06:36.470> one

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
full-blooded Native American but one

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.590 
full-blooded Native American but one
thing<00:06:36.830> that<00:06:36.950> we<00:06:37.070> must<00:06:37.220> really<00:06:37.550> realize<00:06:38.390> is

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
thing that we must really realize is

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.300 
thing that we must really realize is
that<00:06:38.750> we're<00:06:38.960> all<00:06:39.230> from<00:06:39.560> the<00:06:39.650> same<00:06:39.830> race<00:06:40.100> and

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
that we're all from the same race and

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.640 
that we're all from the same race and
that's<00:06:40.430> basically<00:06:40.850> the<00:06:41.090> human<00:06:41.270> race<00:06:41.570> we<00:06:42.470> need

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
that's basically the human race we need

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.410 
that's basically the human race we need
to<00:06:42.710> rebuild<00:06:43.040> our<00:06:43.280> world<00:06:43.490> and<00:06:43.790> be<00:06:43.940> the<00:06:44.090> best<00:06:44.270> we

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
to rebuild our world and be the best we

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.790 
to rebuild our world and be the best we
