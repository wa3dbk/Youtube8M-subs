worldwide coverage because there are

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
68,000 people and again the coverage was

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.660 
68,000 people and again the coverage was
limited<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.650> therefore<00:02:52.920> was<00:02:53.370> world

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
limited and so therefore was world
