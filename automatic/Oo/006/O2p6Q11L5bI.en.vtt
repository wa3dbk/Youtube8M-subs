00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.820
 first row doing the first loop 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:17.940
 the resulting loop is gaining 7 air 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:20.220
 loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 with 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.199
 connecting post close the first 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.189
 loop with the last in the ring case 3 loops 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.590
 lifting 3 loops lifting equals one 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.590
 double crochet and further like me 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.739
 told I will knit a cap of 16 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.230
 so I need to recruit another 15 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.140
 crochets with nakidov the resulting ring 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 That is, I do a cap, I enter into the ring 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 hook grabbing the working thread 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.129
 I bring 3 loops on the hook 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.050
 working thread and knitting 2 loops 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.510
 left two loops grab the worker 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.920
 thread knit two more loops this one 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.559
 double crochet further repeat 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:12.900
 second double crochet 3 with 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:19.580
 double crochet 4 crochet column with 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.580
 nakida 6 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.440
 7 double crochet 8 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 9 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.580
 ten 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:56.210
 11 12 13 14 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.850
 so how much with three loops 1 2 3 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:06.289
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 by 14 already 15 that is 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:11.690
 as if 15 and the last 16 with three loops 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:14.390
 lifting this is 16 peers connecting the first 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.970
 loop with the last in the ring pull up 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.610
 thread and so this is the first row 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.940
 Accordingly, if you and after 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.100
 you tied the sample turned out more 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.630
 let's say no sixteen archers to 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.600
 example 20 pen respectively 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.140
 type 20 double crochets in 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.140
 front row
