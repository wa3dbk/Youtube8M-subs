00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.500 
you know 5k on the market as you can see
I'll<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.809> search<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.500> show<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.550> pretty

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
I'll just search and show you I pretty

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
I'll just search and show you I pretty
much<00:00:39.629> clear<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.320> there's<00:00:40.469> only<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.250> 4.8

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
much clear that there's only one for 4.8

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.729 
much clear that there's only one for 4.8
k<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.210> think<00:00:42.690> normally<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> bit<00:00:43.320> lower<00:00:43.469> but

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
k I think normally is a bit lower but

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.279 
k I think normally is a bit lower but
I'll<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.520> put<00:00:44.730> them<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:44.910> 5k<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.780> we'll

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
I'll just put them up for 5k and we'll

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.619 
I'll just put them up for 5k and we'll
see<00:00:46.500> how<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.680> goes<00:00:47.180> sometimes<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.480> like

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
see how that goes sometimes it's like

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.170 
see how that goes sometimes it's like
good<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> take<00:00:49.140> risks<00:00:49.649> cuz<00:00:49.950> there's<00:00:50.309> there's<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
good to take risks cuz there's there's a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
good to take risks cuz there's there's a
lot<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> benefit<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.199> sometimes<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.890> go

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
lot of benefit of it sometimes can go

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.340 
lot of benefit of it sometimes can go
wrong<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.460> course<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.629> wanted<00:00:54.870> my<00:00:55.020> gut

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
wrong of course but I just wanted my gut

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.549 
wrong of course but I just wanted my gut
I<00:00:55.530> think<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.039> could<00:00:56.280> work<00:00:56.309> quite<00:00:56.760> well<00:00:56.789> so

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
I think this could work quite well so

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.770 
I think this could work quite well so
