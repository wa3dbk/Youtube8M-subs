and got really excited but you can see
here<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.039> using<00:00:50.160> my<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.550> battle<00:00:50.820> rifle

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
here and you can kind of take a look at

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
here and you can kind of take a look at
the<00:00:53.100> feel<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> map<00:00:53.699> here<00:00:53.969> um<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.570> really

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the feel of the map here um it really

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.540 
the feel of the map here um it really
shows<00:00:55.260> off<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> very

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
shows off that it this is a very

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.400 
shows off that it this is a very
faithful<00:00:56.760> remake<00:00:57.239> um<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> last

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
faithful remake um now on the last

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.959 
faithful remake um now on the last
remake<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> guys<00:00:59.100> were<00:00:59.219> requesting<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.879> it

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
remake you guys were requesting that it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.540 
remake you guys were requesting that it
would<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.180> made<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:01.070> erosion<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.399> map

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
would be made on erosion now this map

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
would be made on erosion now this map
actually<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.969> course<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.570> erosion<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:03.960> can

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
actually of course is on erosion you can

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.719 
actually of course is on erosion you can
tell<00:01:04.290> by<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> grungy<00:01:05.159> textures<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
tell by the grungy textures on the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
tell by the grungy textures on the
blocks<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.840> normally<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.740> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
blocks which I do like normally this is

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
blocks which I do like normally this is
a<00:01:07.890> very<00:01:08.070> Covenant<00:01:08.580> orientated<00:01:09.330> map

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
a very Covenant orientated map

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.090 
a very Covenant orientated map
you<00:01:09.930> know<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.439> Halo<00:01:10.590> Reach<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you know like in Halo Reach is on the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.920 
you know like in Halo Reach is on the
Covenant<00:01:11.490> ship<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.240> Halo<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.840> was

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
Covenant ship and in Halo one it was

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
Covenant ship and in Halo one it was
also<00:01:13.200> very<00:01:13.350> common<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.770> very<00:01:14.010> purple<00:01:14.340> now

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
also very common to be very purple now

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.429 
also very common to be very purple now
that's<00:01:15.030> much<00:01:15.210> harder<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> achieve<00:01:15.750> obviously

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that's much harder to achieve obviously

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.969 
that's much harder to achieve obviously
in<00:01:16.530> Halo<00:01:16.710> 4<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.650> grungy

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
in Halo 4 so I think this this grungy

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.070 
in Halo 4 so I think this this grungy
feel<00:01:20.280> although<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> same<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
feel although it's not the same as the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.070 
feel although it's not the same as the
whole<00:01:22.200> Covenant<00:01:22.680> look<00:01:22.890> um<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.580> refreshing

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
whole Covenant look um it's refreshing

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.300 
whole Covenant look um it's refreshing
because<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.530> don't<00:01:25.680> know<00:01:25.740> whenever<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
because I don't know whenever I see a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.460 
because I don't know whenever I see a
remake<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:27.990> set<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
remake I like I like it to be set in a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.870 
remake I like I like it to be set in a
different<00:01:28.680> setting<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:29.310> you're<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.610> I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
different setting because you're you I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.249 
different setting because you're you I
don't<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.810> own<00:01:30.840> personal

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
don't know that's just my own personal

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.450 
don't know that's just my own personal
preference<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.770> nice<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.130> stuff<00:01:32.369> in

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
preference but it's nice to see stuff in

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.620 
preference but it's nice to see stuff in
a<00:01:32.520> different<00:01:32.850> setting<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.600> instance

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
a different setting so like for instance

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.840 
a different setting so like for instance
if<00:01:34.079> there<00:01:34.229> was<00:01:34.350> Sevilla<00:01:34.710> snowbound<00:01:35.340> remake

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
if there was Sevilla snowbound remake

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
if there was Sevilla snowbound remake
what<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.659> were<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.930> make<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.409> on

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
what if they were to make it like on

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.530 
what if they were to make it like on
dirt<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> would<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.790> dirt<00:01:39.030> that's<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
dirt and it would be like dirt that's a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.810 
dirt and it would be like dirt that's a
terrible<00:01:39.840> idea<00:01:40.040> but<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.430> point<00:01:41.579> it's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
terrible idea but you get the point it's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.219 
terrible idea but you get the point it's
still<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> lot<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> fun<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.840> map<00:01:42.960> would<00:01:43.049> play

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
still a lot of fun the map would play

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.660 
still a lot of fun the map would play
the<00:01:43.350> same<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.920> refreshing

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the same would just be refreshing

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.590 
the same would just be refreshing
because<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> would<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> little<00:01:45.390> bit

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
because it would be a little bit

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.969 
because it would be a little bit
different<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.049> think<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.890> good

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
different I think that's actually a good

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.920 
different I think that's actually a good
idea<00:01:47.070> dirt<00:01:47.460> bound<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> idea<00:01:48.299> make

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
idea dirt bound I like that idea make

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.319 
idea dirt bound I like that idea make
that<00:01:49.079> happen<00:01:49.200> somebody<00:01:49.880> anyway<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.240> can
