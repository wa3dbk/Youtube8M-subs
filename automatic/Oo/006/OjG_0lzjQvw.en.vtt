00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.480
 i 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.029
 yes 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.690
 and you will come back to everyone is going to remove 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.190
 Welcome to a new game in sky 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.410
 war and good let's make a very 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.120
 fun especially this trap dwells is 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.070
 with an active tour button is to click 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
 click and you have the person directly 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.019
 I had to choose that 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.730
 yes the redstone kit but good i'm going 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.559
 before you and see if I find something look at 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.930
 a peak I saw very well already we started very 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.400
 well and good I will try to win the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.980
 departure is also worth there is some 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.290
 subscriber here but surely not 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.180
 whether he knew or not I know or because he has seen me 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.920
 the name of youtube good already here father 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.720
 because I'm going to try, you can see the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.390
 tits to see what's here is worth a 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.130
 bow well hey could i change i like them 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.190
 the chests to see who's around here 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.200
 the temples to watch this carefully it 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.820
 Well let's start making the trap 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.860
 that I will explain first let's go down 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.600
 one here and then two here below this what 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.520
 we do in all the traps is worth to 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.450
 that get stuck and now this is 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.479
 again I will break 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.890
 here the roof the top for 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.290
 to be comfortable more than anything is worth so that 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.170
 remote we can activate the trap 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 so then I'm going to chop around here 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.530
 also up here, you have to 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.680
 be comfortable as a large area for 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.810
 escape 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.270
 and that you see yourself like in your house I'm going to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.980
 Also remove this wall because it is not 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.290
 necessary to put as much wall and good the 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.520
 pisto will go exactly here it's worth but 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.800
 you have to put it here because it has 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.720
 to be horizontal so you see 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.990
 now we would simply place here 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.520
 Stone stone and this is going to sting 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.200
 because they have to fall to the void with the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.270
 button is ok when we now 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.160
 we put a button here the piston makes 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.290
 the push and when we remove it you see 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.570
 would fall directly into the void and this 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.030
 would be the trap worth then here it 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.980
 would place a slab and in this way you see 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.050
 then activate and deactivate look a 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.390
 little one come small for low bitterness 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.430
 you see that would be the trap to see scapita 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.720
 he only enters on his own, that is, the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.150
 I was amazed because I say but who 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.370
 is this man is worth 1 - ok let's go 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.290
 leave the area a little more comfortable and 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.320
 is without a doubt I would go into one of my top 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.850
 easier traps for sky war I know if 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.610
 I have to make a challenge to kill people 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.440
 this is one of the traps that can most 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.720
 kill people without any doubt 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.610
 we can also attack here or 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.959
 we can kill him and if we see that 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.920
 is going to kill us, we throw it into the void and 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.849
 point 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.770
 stairs and we will place them here 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.750
 ok and it would be ready the trap is 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.030
 super pretty the trap I love this 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.060
 trap is super accommodates what 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.340
 I need I is already brutal and good to see 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.900
 I'll wait for them to come I'll put 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.950
 here the slab first is valid so that 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.989
 they can jump up and this gentleman 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.569
 we're going to throw it to see little one come to 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.910
 fly on board 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.340
 my mother has a the amazing that uncle 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.069

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.920

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.120
 kill you look at it, you 're the mother 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.980
 the good neighborhood let's get into the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.840
 trap because it's coming and it has 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.180
 so much the one that quique I do not know what I'm going to 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.519
 do with this guy to see I'm going to upload 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.060
 here it is that you are not going to me piece I do not 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.380
 I can do nothing 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.630
 Look look what has it to do either 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.090

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.040
 let it be around here for my house is 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.400
 in my house I will not let him be by 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.640

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.980

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.569
 I 'm crazy around here going around 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.099
 see let's attack him a little bit 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.299
 little one can not even attack I threw myself 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.709
 back dark care that has come the 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.939
 another that has come the other is worth not 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.870
 we put the slab we hope that 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.730
 enter there we have a mega for beige 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.769
 and to fly that goes away is worth seeing what 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.750
 is uncle to see how heavy you are 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.450
 I'm going to kill you just who got him 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.159
 others I have thrown it I have thrown it towards 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.230
 down or I'm blown away but when 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.970
 pushed him or that he had push in the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.700
 peak or coconut like noses I've 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.250

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.989

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.709
 to win I'm going to win the game I'm going 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.380
 to win 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.330

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.940
 in paris campeando vale go to go 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.310
 directly with careful careful 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.050
 and we will try to win the game worth 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.880
 I want to win it with this trap I think 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.260
 this trap deserves to win the game but 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.760
 good 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.440
