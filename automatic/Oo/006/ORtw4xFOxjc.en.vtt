00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.170
 the vehicles must tighten to the right 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.549
 on the pavement and if there are several 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.619
 traffic strips 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.689
 they must travel on the band of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 right in order to cross the 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.390
 vehicles moving in the opposite direction 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.550
 by the right safely 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.439
 if the roadway is too narrow you 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.430
 can borrow the shoulder of plain 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.500
 foot 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.840
 the part of the public road situated at 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.580
 beyond this line is reserved for 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 stop and parking 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.130
 so you can not borrow it for 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.320
 to cross other vehicles 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.960
 you can not borrow the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.990
 bike path unlike the band 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.610
 bike suggested as you see here or 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.610
 on the shoulder that you can borrow 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.050
 sometimes the pavement becomes narrower 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.489
 you know 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.950
 jacques a narrowing of the pavement 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.960
 can be indicated by one of these 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.580
 danger signals 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.010
 if there are no signs that regulate the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.960
 priority the driver who meet 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.750
 the obstacle on his side of the roadway 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.250
 must yield the passage 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.380
 but the priority can also be 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.140
 determined by panels of 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.240
 signaling 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.580
 the driver who see this sign must 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.140
 give way 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.630
 the other driver then sees to his 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.479
 right this blue sign that tells him 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.520
 he has priority so he can cross 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.520
 shrink first 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.970
 you will meet on some 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.830
 pavements this road sign 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.370
 which indicates that it is a way of meaning 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.440
 unique 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.620
 you will not come across any more 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.870
 cars but be careful it is possible 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.800
 an additional sign indicates that 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.200
 some drivers 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.020
 for example cyclists or 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.510
 mopeds class to be allowed to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.420
 flow back and forth on this 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.320
 way if you're driving on a lane at 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.450
 one way 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.180
 you should normally also ride to 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.640
 right except if it is an exception 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.850
 as we explain in another 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.850
 lesson 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.200
 here is a topic we will be dealing with more 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.600
 in detail in a next lesson 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.150
 but it is important to understand from 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.510
 now the difference between these two 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.210
 panels 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.300
 the first is an indication sign 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.080
 which indicates that this way is to 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.200
 one way 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.620
 the second is a bond bill 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.280
 which forces you to follow the direction 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.050
 indicated by the arrow 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.290
 do not get trapped when 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.290
 review 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.000
 you must also cross 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.680
 vehicles on rails by the right but 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.010
 you can cross a tram by the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.410
 left 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.770
 if the crossover on the right is not 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.450
 possible because the passage is too narrow 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.000
 if there is a vehicle stationary or 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.550
 parked right or if there is a 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.960
 obstacle on the pavement of course in 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.970
 crossing from the left 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.710
 you can not interfere or put in 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.230
 danger to other users 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.450
 so it's important to make sure everything 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.170
 first, that no other vehicle 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.170
 come in the opposite direction 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.380
 in the intersections you must also 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.680
 crossed by the right 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.270
 unless the crossroads are signposted 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.270
 so that it is not possible
