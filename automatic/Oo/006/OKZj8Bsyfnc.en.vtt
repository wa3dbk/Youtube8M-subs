 england christmas after 20 years the portela airport 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:09.759
 the process 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.869
 It's complicated to stay in river fishing. 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.609
 the airport tells her 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.609
 is what offers the best in the velopark race 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.899
 thanks to weather conditions authorities on the sides 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.449
 it was not this 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.109
 to the city center 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.109

 works 365 days a year 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.280
 366 is interesting 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.180
 I am not a spiritist of these events that are constant in the table 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.110
 not only the political decision pirites does not allow to protest for as long as the 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 rest of the year in the other clubs of the river

 this painting 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.149
 with data from the European airline association - in the future 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.250
 the lisbon airport I can stay less delays due to the weather 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.550
 maxi percent athens 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.880
 madrid airports ensures delays due to bad weather 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.080
 October 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.240
 and the picture of Europe's airports is that it has always suffered the worst 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.930
 the weather mainly affects German airports causing 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.170
 twenty eight times more delays with a screen 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.330
 makes sense

 even if not 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.409
 - I thought for being one of the people that times is everything even because the mistake for 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.690
 that the port airport is not closed apart from being a port on the bank 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.840
 south that will be the future we can not lose is because she because she has 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.410
 serious challenges confinement 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.920
 despite the problems of everyday life

 at the lisbon airport 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 can be one of the most popular in europe 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.950
 nor for the porters 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.730
 perhaps because of this the bank liquidity from large companies 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.320
 they fell in the state
