new edition we have what's known as the

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.520 
new edition we have what's known as the

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
and full float up and down like this

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.880 
and full float up and down like this
rotating<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.549> position<00:01:12.150> now

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
rotating it to this position now

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.850 
rotating it to this position now
prevents<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.460> bar<00:01:14.670> from<00:01:15.170> going<00:01:16.170> flat<00:01:16.409> when

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
prevents the bar from going flat when

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.950 
prevents the bar from going flat when
you<00:01:16.890> bend<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.340> string<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.770> we<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:20.960> that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
you bend a string so we have that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.430 
you bend a string so we have that

its<00:01:50.000> playability<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.510> in<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.650> sink<00:01:53.930> in<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
its playability is in the sink in the

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.410 
its playability is in the sink in the
same<00:01:55.470> way<00:01:55.650> it<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.920> designed<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:57.120> we<00:01:57.240> don't

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
same way it was designed so we don't

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.030 
same way it was designed so we don't
want<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> change<00:01:57.870> that<00:01:58.260> design<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
want to change that design because the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.010 
want to change that design because the
builders<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.460> put<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> lot<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.940> time<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.450> how

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
builders have put a lot of time and how

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.870 
builders have put a lot of time and how
they<00:02:01.260> want<00:02:01.470> their<00:02:01.650> instruments<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.280> sound<00:02:02.370> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
they want their instruments to sound and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300 
they want their instruments to sound and
that's<00:02:03.030> why<00:02:03.440> customers<00:02:04.440> buy<00:02:04.650> them<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.130> their

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that's why customers buy them for their

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.789 
that's why customers buy them for their
tone<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:05.580> their<00:02:05.940> playability<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:07.530> don't<00:02:07.680> want

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
tone and their playability we don't want

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.639 
tone and their playability we don't want
to<00:02:07.890> change<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.670> want<00:02:09.269> to<00:02:09.420> add<00:02:09.659> to<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.110> so

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
to change that we want to add to that so

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.039 
to change that we want to add to that so
now<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.310> take<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.730> guitar<00:02:12.299> be<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.959> a
