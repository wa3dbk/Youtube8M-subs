 Well, in short, you should not be superfluous there 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.849
 password should not be entered 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:48.089

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:49.240
 no matter it don't think no 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:52.149

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:58.080

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.219
 the main thing I want to say is about to 

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:07.270
 roaming is my main mistake was 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:07.749
 first what i watched video 1 guys i 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.550
 into it 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:16.300
 noticed this error that he did not like 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.789
 on how correctly it did not seem right away 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.610
 Well, I immediately saw that he had a folder there 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.309
 everything appeared he didn’t even think about 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.219
 this means there files 

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:31.300
 I did not even understand this, and so I tell you 

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:34.839
 now I want to show here and now you 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:38.379
 can play there by the way play offline 

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:43.869
 this he does not depend on it 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:46.830
 because there will still be a game 

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:50.680
 so ordinary is the same as us 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:53.469
 put the launcher on a pirated version 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.200
 such an ordinary launcher play through it 

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:59.490
 nothing fate 

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.070
 normally goes through the network can play 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.370
 all available servers can be opened 

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:07.860
 ports create everything as usual 

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:11.240
 thank you all, I’m finishing it up with 

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.240
 have you been green yet
