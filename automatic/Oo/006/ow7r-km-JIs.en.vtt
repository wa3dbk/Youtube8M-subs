water over it so once the noodles have
cooled<00:01:33.159> down<00:01:33.399> we<00:01:33.669> just<00:01:33.909> have<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.389> apply<00:01:34.630> some

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
cooled down we just have to apply some

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.539 
cooled down we just have to apply some
oil<00:01:35.109> to<00:01:35.259> it<00:01:35.499> like<00:01:35.829> this<00:01:36.009> so<00:01:36.249> that<00:01:36.279> it<00:01:36.520> doesn't

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
oil to it like this so that it doesn't

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.679 
oil to it like this so that it doesn't
stick<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.270> each<00:01:37.389> other

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
stick to each other

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.109 
stick to each other
and<00:01:37.869> that's<00:01:38.439> very<00:01:38.619> simple<00:01:39.189> that's<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:40.029> way

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
and that's very simple that's the way

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.029 
and that's very simple that's the way
you<00:01:40.179> need<00:01:40.419> to<00:01:40.479> boil<00:01:40.840> these<00:01:41.169> noodles<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.740> keep
