00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.269
 In the US alone, around 20,000 people die uninjured annually 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.160
 lead to life-threatening injuries to the cervical spine 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.160
 Injuries can mean paralysis or even death 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.820
 According to the US Department of Transport restricted occur about 25 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 Percent of these as spinal injuries but only 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.319
 after initiator times and are thus avoidable 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 Koller is the solution to this serious problem EXCOR saves lives 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.150
 and reduces the risk of paralysis after an accident 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
 as Koller and Macs trend of a go 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.930
 In this video we want to give you the features and possibilities the Exko 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.520
 Lohr Systems introduce the first time ICANN support specifically for the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.870
 Emergency care was developed 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.530
 Aixtron appeared from above the patient's cervical spine 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.880
 Maintenance i7 both chest and side routes 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.400
 to give you a very practical impression of system efficiency 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.400
 in addition to demonstrating the application in real time 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.680
 First, a symmetrical adjustment of the rail is made so 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.850
 that the head of the patient remains in a neutral position 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.500
 then the longest pulls Fischer attitude made thus the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.140
 best possible immobilized info lies 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.340
 Finally, the crossed bands are tightened with which the creation of the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 System is completed 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.360
 when using conventional ZdK had to support before the application 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.110
 Body measurements of the injured persons are estimated so that one 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.090
 Default could not be done this Barack Koller 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.820
 necessary 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.600
 because Exko Norbert a concern to the patient directly and accurately to the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.380
 Dimensions adjusted 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.659
 Below we will discuss the differences between conventional systems and ex- 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.909
 Kollar with respect to a possible freedom of movement demonstrate 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.159
 conventional systems always allow, despite proper applications 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.840
 Still movements in the cervical vertebra are supposed to be the area whereas Exko only the head of the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.640
 injured person on the rope so fixed what the scope for health-stressed 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.970
 Restricting movements comprehensively 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.910
 Please pay attention to her patient's ear at once 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.940
 conventional system is affected 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.269
 as a Koller was also developed under ergonomic aspects 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.419
 the construction around the top allows a fast and 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:12.899
 invest safely 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.259
 Conventional systems can head the adult patient frequently 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.659
 not sure to fix in the neutral position if this is the middle of the 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.469
 Spine is the patient's head here from the optimal 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.849
 pushed out of focus 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.790
 the same happens when using a conventional system in patients 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.989
 small body size is applied 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.779
 because this is again the middle of the spine is also the head here 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.799
 the injured person was not put in the right position 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.099
 a text collage can be the head of an injured person regardless of the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.479
 Fix body measurements securely in the optimal symmetrical position 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.259
 because the injured person complains of pain when moving his head 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.669
 the head but not in the neutral position is allowed ex-kölners 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.889
 the rescue service head in the current situation or in a for 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.059
 the injured comfortable position to the mobilization 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.849
 please pay attention to the possibility of the asymmetric breast 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.969
 Adjustment here will make the head comfortable in the for the injured person 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.009
 Position at the gate so fixed 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.319
 the Kenyan flexibility of the EKZ Kollar loud the emergency service 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.489
 People with suspected cervical spine injuries in a variety of 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.489
 Positions to mobilize him then subsequent patient transport only 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.489
 still minimal manipulations can take place 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.060
 In the following scene we show you the application of the EKZ Kollar of one 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.789
 single helper at several injured of a simulated road accident 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:31.319
 with several injured extra-performance helpers enables the stabilization 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.009
 faster at several people and with lower personnel and material costs 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.219
 perform 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.189
 the idea of ​​the best possible on-site medical care 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.159
 injured persons led to the development of ACS Koller 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.420
 Clinical studies show that ex-cologne is a more effective method 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.269
 For the treatment of a cervical spine injury represents because it is the 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.159
 Position of the head mobilized on the hull team 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.950
 it would be about her own neck or her one of her relatives they would 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.029
 you definitely decide for the best available technology or 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.699
 the innovative Exko Lima resembled the ambulance an improved 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.449
 On-site medical care even if more than one victim is being cared for 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.870
 got to 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.269
 this topic application is faster than with conventional systems and 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.269
 makes a lower personnel and material costs required 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.199
 DAX Koller and Macs Blend of a World Cup now with me again 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.900
 will break from emergency forces of the United States conspirators Strauss is 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.449
 used 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.099
 In 2008, we received several for our innovative technology 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.099
 Awards from leading publications for emergency medicine 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.509
 Benefit from our free training programs
