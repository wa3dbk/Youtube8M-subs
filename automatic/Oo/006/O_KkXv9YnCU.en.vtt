00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.510
 let's hope that I'm heard because 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.940
 you know that it does not usually fail so 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.860
 let's trust that you hear do not see 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.780
 the piece of trailer that we have 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.250
 presented in the seventh installment of fast 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.940
 and the furious who has just presented 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.450
 barely 20 minutes ago half an hour in 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.670
 this macroevent for 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.550
 allow fans the questions to 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.950
 the actors the director has not 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.890
 impressed especially because to me 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.230
 love the saga be a big fan and the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.100
 video that thank you and that I had and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.809
 many of us who like this saga of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.400
 Conqueror persecutions was how 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.070
 they could film what was left of 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.430
 movie without the late actor for the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.460
 guru walker and the truth is that the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.150
 brothers caleb and cody come out in the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.020
 trailer they really look in the trailer and 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.350
 they give the pego I do not know we can really 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.600
 understand the movie mouse the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.180
 fans to see who is who 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.490
 he tells me that in the scene where he 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.130
 they see that the boys are attacking a 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.509
 armored bus with lots of 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.700
 machine gun creates awesome scene 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.520
 in fact within a saying that this is 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.090
 the movie that more action is going to have 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.409
 he sees that he falls off a cliff 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.630
 and the character 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.439
 is running over to jump and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.289
 there I believe that it escalates and has really 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.420
 surprised what it looks like in these 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:38.380
 guys without more during the action 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.330
 me but a great movie and it impresses 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.909
 a lot of these new scenes that so 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.369
 seen is a movie project is going to be 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.100
 the last of the good saga and we have 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.470
 curious how they have already returned to the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.789
 current chronology of the storm of 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.950
 saga 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.799
 I think you'll remember that I played the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.640
 third was actually the sixth movie 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.670
 and the sixth was the fifth because it arrives 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.189
 one more because because he is the brother of 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.899
 show that was the bad of the sixth paper 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.080
 interpreted by that is though as 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:15.069
 it's always going to be bright and you see that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.560
 he is the one who runs over jan in tokyo 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.400
 dream in the last causal race of the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.190
 death and call toretto to say that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.620
 I'm going after you to take revenge on your brother 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.799
 that was the bad guy in the sixth so the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.310
 sixth is the fifth the seventh in the 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.900
 sixth and the third no lie is a 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.840
 little bit messy 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:46.150
 the mushroom is the fourth plant 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.519
 Well, if the door sank brutally good 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.810
 already said gentlemen Ã ngel fraile me 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:56.400
 I would love that I flip and good and 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.400
 you if an ego gamers
