the rhythm section it's fairly simple

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.490 
the rhythm section it's fairly simple
but<00:00:31.110> like<00:00:31.440> it<00:00:31.590> went<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:31.860> um<00:00:32.870> it's<00:00:33.870> pretty<00:00:34.410> much

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
but like it went out um it's pretty much

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.970 
but like it went out um it's pretty much
the<00:00:34.559> same<00:00:34.860> power<00:00:35.160> cord<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.710> bb5<00:00:37.710> or

the same power cord on the it's a bb5 or

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.450 
the same power cord on the it's a bb5 or
whatever<00:00:39.230> third<00:00:40.230> fret<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.890> your<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.340> know

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
it's pretty self-explanatory but figure

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:24.540

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
i can play the whole river all the way
