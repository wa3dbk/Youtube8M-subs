00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
enough there these are all going to be

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.020 
enough there these are all going to be
14<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.140> just<00:01:51.500> basic<00:01:51.890> where<00:01:52.220> my<00:01:52.340> cards<00:01:52.760> do<00:01:52.910> the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
14 I just basic where my cards do the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.210 
14 I just basic where my cards do the
playing<00:01:53.300> for<00:01:53.660> me<00:01:53.840> basically<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.740> it's<00:01:54.890> just

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
playing for me basically and it's just

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.160 
playing for me basically and it's just
to<00:01:55.340> show<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.910> you<00:01:56.390> don't<00:01:56.660> have<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:57.050> do

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
to show that you don't have to do

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.110 
to show that you don't have to do
anything<00:01:57.790> really<00:01:59.020> don't<00:02:00.020> have<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.290> do<00:02:01.060> play<00:02:02.060> to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
anything really don't have to do play to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.780 
anything really don't have to do play to
why<00:02:02.540> we<00:02:03.050> do<00:02:03.260> just<00:02:03.530> have<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.890> you<00:02:04.340> do<00:02:04.520> have<00:02:04.730> to

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
why we do just have to you do have to

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.350 
why we do just have to you do have to
pick<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.210> for<00:02:06.190> this<00:02:07.190> one's<00:02:07.490> going<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.000> be<00:02:08.149> one

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
pick this for this one's going to be one

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.140 
pick this for this one's going to be one
of<00:02:08.390> easy<00:02:09.380> one<00:02:09.740> sometimes<00:02:10.369> these<00:02:10.610> things<00:02:10.670> will

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
of easy one sometimes these things will

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.470 
of easy one sometimes these things will
basically<00:02:11.750> play<00:02:12.080> themselves<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.890> know

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
basically play themselves and you know

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.590 
basically play themselves and you know
be<00:02:14.480> very<00:02:14.720> easy<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.170> take<00:02:15.410> down<00:02:16.240> other<00:02:17.240> times

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
be very easy to take down other times

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.390 
be very easy to take down other times
things<00:02:18.200> aren't<00:02:18.500> going<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.709> go<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.070> smoothly

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
things aren't going to go so smoothly

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.820 
things aren't going to go so smoothly
and<00:02:19.700> you're<00:02:19.820> going<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> be<00:02:20.180> lying<00:02:21.170> if<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.410> think

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
and you're going to be lying if I think

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.420 
and you're going to be lying if I think
I'd<00:02:22.310> stack<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> lot<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.090> time<00:02:23.390> through<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.840> and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
I'd stack a lot of time through it and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.010 
I'd stack a lot of time through it and
