so why what you'll notice here these two

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
so why what you'll notice here these two
holes<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.670> made<00:00:44.969> by<00:00:45.539> myself<00:00:45.719> this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
holes these I have made by myself this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.380 
holes these I have made by myself this
was<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.340> well<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:48.000> area

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
was not here as well as this little area

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.630 
was not here as well as this little area
where<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.629> ended<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:48.960> having<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> put<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.469> bed<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
where I ended up having to put a bed to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.840 
where I ended up having to put a bed to
skip<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.149> night<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> could<00:00:51.930> record<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> when

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
skip the night so I could record so when

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.130 
skip the night so I could record so when
you<00:00:53.940> start<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.449> world<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.840> will<00:00:54.960> have

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you start this world you will have

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.910 
you start this world you will have
nothing<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> giant<00:00:56.430> block<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.199> TNT<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> so

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
nothing but a giant block of TNT and so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.439 
nothing but a giant block of TNT and so
what<00:00:59.070> you're<00:00:59.190> gonna<00:00:59.280> want<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.879> right

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
what you're gonna want to do is right

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
away get some flint and steel you're

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.770 
away get some flint and steel you're
gonna<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> come<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.239> creative

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
gonna have to come in and creative

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.560 
gonna have to come in and creative
obviously<00:01:04.350> at<00:01:04.559> least<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:05.010> start<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.670> we're

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
obviously at least to start and we're

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
obviously at least to start and we're
gonna<00:01:06.689> dig<00:01:06.930> down<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:08.010> bit<00:01:08.159> here

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
gonna dig down just a little bit here

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.710 
gonna dig down just a little bit here
see<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.220> guess<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.210> works<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
see that like I guess that works and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.480 
see that like I guess that works and
then<00:01:12.900> we're<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.110> gonna<00:01:13.320> light<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.250> place

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
then we're just gonna light this place

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.840 
then we're just gonna light this place
on<00:01:14.820> fire<00:01:15.049> like<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.470> come<00:01:17.100> out<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> little<00:01:17.580> bit

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
on fire like so come out a little bit

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.990 
on fire like so come out a little bit
and<00:01:18.360> kaboom<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.860> whole<00:01:20.070> place<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.700> takes

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and kaboom this whole place just takes

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.870 
and kaboom this whole place just takes
off<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:23.040> didn't<00:01:23.250> work<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.400> time<00:01:23.549> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
off and it didn't work that time it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
off and it didn't work that time it
actually<00:01:23.970> kind<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.299> stopped<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:25.020> right

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
actually kind of stopped all right

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
actually kind of stopped all right
so<00:01:25.710> normally<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.310> happens<00:01:26.700> what's<00:01:27.360> supposed

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
so normally what happens what's supposed

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.359 
so normally what happens what's supposed
to<00:01:27.750> happen<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.170> when<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> put<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.250> get

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to happen is when you put one on you get

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.399 
to happen is when you put one on you get
it<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.570> creates<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.960> giant

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it going and it just creates a giant

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.490 
it going and it just creates a giant
chain<00:01:32.009> reaction<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.049> that'll<00:01:34.049> make<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
chain reaction and that'll make kind of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.410 
chain reaction and that'll make kind of
your<00:01:34.650> caves<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.549> things<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
your caves and things like that it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.850 
your caves and things like that it
doesn't<00:01:36.900> seem<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.140> want<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.380> working<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
doesn't seem to want to be working and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.469 
doesn't seem to want to be working and
it<00:01:37.950> could<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> started<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.240> other

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it could be because I started this other

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.690 
it could be because I started this other
hole<00:01:39.750> over<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.049> maybe<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.430> allowing

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
hole over here maybe that's not allowing

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.490 
hole over here maybe that's not allowing
it<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.939> burn<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.540> much<00:01:42.659> TNT<00:01:43.140> yeah<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.380> know

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it to burn so much TNT yeah I don't know

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.130 
it to burn so much TNT yeah I don't know
it's<00:01:43.649> really<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> place<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.020> see

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140

probably<00:01:56.070> still<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.000> made<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.450> like

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
probably still going on I made this like

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.139 
probably still going on I made this like
a<00:01:57.719> good<00:01:58.110> 15<00:01:58.950> minutes<00:01:58.979> ago<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.700> sure<00:01:59.729> it's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
a good 15 minutes ago and I'm sure it's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.719 
a good 15 minutes ago and I'm sure it's
still<00:02:00.390> working<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> come<00:02:02.579> through

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
still working I was kind of come through

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.920 
still working I was kind of come through
here<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.630> makes<00:02:03.780> this

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
here as you can see it just makes this

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.260 
here as you can see it just makes this
awesome<00:02:04.560> looking<00:02:04.710> texture<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> map

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
awesome looking texture this is a map

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.660 
awesome looking texture this is a map
that<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.570> pretty<00:02:06.899> sure<00:02:07.200> came<00:02:07.560> from<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.069> PCs

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
that I'm pretty sure came from the PCs

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.029 
that I'm pretty sure came from the PCs
I<00:02:08.729> made<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.660> then<00:02:10.200> exported<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
I made it on there and then exported it

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.650 
I made it on there and then exported it
tax<00:02:11.250> box<00:02:11.459> there<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.670> go<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.030> that's<00:02:12.480> probably

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
tax box there we go see that's probably

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.559 
tax box there we go see that's probably
fine<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.130> make<00:02:14.340> more<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.270> can<00:02:15.390> see

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
fine we can it make more as you can see

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.760 
fine we can it make more as you can see
it's<00:02:15.810> still<00:02:16.020> going<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:16.440> going<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.680> little

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
it's still going it's going a little

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.740 
it's still going it's going a little
slower<00:02:17.130> than<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.489> was<00:02:17.700> now<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.060> guess<00:02:18.569> because

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
slower than it was now I guess because

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.089 
slower than it was now I guess because
it's<00:02:18.959> been<00:02:19.080> going<00:02:19.410> forever<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.739> we've<00:02:19.920> got

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
it's been going forever and we've got

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.430 
it's been going forever and we've got
several<00:02:20.340> different<00:02:20.810> systems<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:22.080> on<00:02:22.170> here

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
several different systems going on here

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.110 
several different systems going on here
as<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.069> see<00:02:23.280> there<00:02:23.730> are<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> few<00:02:24.000> places

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
as you can see there are a few places

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.850 
as you can see there are a few places
like<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.989> remember<00:02:25.290> from<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.470> train

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
like this if you remember from the train

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.590 
like this if you remember from the train
map<00:02:26.130> where<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.670> hit<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.940> bottom<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
map where you hit the bottom of the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.870 
map where you hit the bottom of the
world<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.110> that's<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.040> sure<00:02:29.250> sign<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
world and that's a sure sign that this

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.440 
world and that's a sure sign that this
is<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> PC<00:02:30.540> imported<00:02:31.200> map<00:02:31.730> because<00:02:32.730> there<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.150> an

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
is a PC imported map because there is an

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.320 
is a PC imported map because there is an
actual<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:34.140> blue<00:02:34.470> bottom<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.459> I've<00:02:35.700> shown

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
actual just blue bottom like I've shown

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.850 
actual just blue bottom like I've shown
before<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:37.019> don't<00:02:37.200> really<00:02:37.380> go<00:02:37.620> anywhere
