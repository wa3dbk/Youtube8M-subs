 in Spanish each empty unit at the end 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.630

 here comes the answer of all 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.159
 units 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.620

 these are the resolved ones and this helps 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.170
 a lot of me 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.590
 this year I could not I did not enter can not 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.770
 stay to the university but next 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.230
 year that is 2013 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.830
 and August I hope I can stay that way 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.570
 I'm excluding still 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.810
 because instead of this very good is from 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.410
 conama 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.150
 the national school of mathematics and 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.610
 well 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.829
 but this will serve you completely if it is a 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:03.140
 color this are from the federal district as 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:05.510
 I'm going to the street madero del 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.640
 historic center someone have the purchase 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.549
 it cost me 500 pesos and it's updated 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.660
 for next year for election to the 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:18.620
 next and doing that over here he said 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.260
 and 2013 this does not go to the beautiful 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.620
 arts because that library of areas like 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.660
 part of being very small 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.600
 It's disgusting the service 1 minute better 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.410
 I went to 9 fine arts 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:40.380
 a little wider and they treat you very well 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.380
 and very nice I liked wood 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:52.179
 according to 2013 editions and is updated 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.179
 It cost 500 pesos and I hope so
