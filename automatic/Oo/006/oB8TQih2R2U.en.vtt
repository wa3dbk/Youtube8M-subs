on and then I'm going to heat set it
with<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:34.530> heat<00:01:35.100> gun<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.670> wanted<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
with my heat gun because I wanted to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.609 
with my heat gun because I wanted to
keep<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.750> need<00:01:36.930> those<00:01:37.079> colors<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> be

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
keep going and I need those colors to be

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.219 
keep going and I need those colors to be
dry<00:01:37.950> before<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.430> add<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.939> next<00:01:39.150> color<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
dry before I add the next color so I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.109 
dry before I add the next color so I
took<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.470> pretty<00:01:40.860> red<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> upper<00:01:41.850> right

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
took that pretty red in the upper right

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.870 
took that pretty red in the upper right
or<00:01:42.420> upper<00:01:43.320> left<00:01:43.530> corner<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.159> added<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
or upper left corner and added that to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.240 
or upper left corner and added that to
my<00:01:44.909> craft<00:01:45.329> mat<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.290> diluted<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> again

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
my craft mat and then diluted it again

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.950 
my craft mat and then diluted it again
with<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.729> water<00:01:48.030> from<00:01:48.240> my<00:01:48.390> water<00:01:48.600> brush<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
with some water from my water brush and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.810 
with some water from my water brush and
then<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.350> take<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> fresh<00:01:49.950> brand-new

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
then I'm going to take a fresh brand-new

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.330 
then I'm going to take a fresh brand-new
pencil<00:01:51.420> eraser<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> start<00:01:52.799> creating<00:01:53.040> these

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
pencil eraser and start creating these

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
pencil eraser and start creating these
dots<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:54.390> over<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> top<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
dots going over the top this is kind of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.550 
dots going over the top this is kind of
almost<00:01:55.680> an<00:01:55.920> abstract<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.560> background

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
almost an abstract kind of background

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.010 
almost an abstract kind of background
effect<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.729> as<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.600> realized

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
effect but as I was going I realized

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.139 
effect but as I was going I realized
that<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> color<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.950> too<00:02:02.250> watered<00:02:02.640> down<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
that the color was too watered down and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.270 
that the color was too watered down and
was<00:02:03.270> not<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.110> much<00:02:04.680> intensity

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
was not going to get as much intensity

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.370 
was not going to get as much intensity
and<00:02:05.579> contrast<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.420> wanted<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.049> i'm<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and contrast as I wanted so i'm going to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.320 
and contrast as I wanted so i'm going to
use<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> same<00:02:07.950> trick<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.520> take<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.879> corner

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
use the same trick and take the corner

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.020 
use the same trick and take the corner
of<00:02:09.360> my<00:02:09.869> tissue<00:02:10.560> there<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.430> wake<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
of my tissue there and just wake up the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.400 
of my tissue there and just wake up the
excess<00:02:12.420> water

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
excess water

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.320 
excess water
and<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.560> added<00:02:13.770> more<00:02:14.130> paint<00:02:14.490> color<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.240> the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and I added more paint color to the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.660 
and I added more paint color to the
palette<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.930> didn't<00:02:16.590> dilute<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.070> down<00:02:17.340> with

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
palette and didn't dilute it down with

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.370 
palette and didn't dilute it down with
as<00:02:17.940> much<00:02:18.090> water<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.870> could<00:02:18.960> go<00:02:19.200> back

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
as much water so that I could go back

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.410 
as much water so that I could go back
over<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.770> top<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> original<00:02:20.790> dots<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
over the top of the original dots and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.600 
over the top of the original dots and
then<00:02:22.020> keep<00:02:22.350> going<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.800> adding<00:02:23.160> more<00:02:23.430> to

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
then keep going and adding more to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.970 
then keep going and adding more to
create<00:02:23.880> my<00:02:24.000> little<00:02:24.240> abstract<00:02:24.900> pattern<00:02:25.800> this

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
create my little abstract pattern this

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.610 
create my little abstract pattern this
is<00:02:26.040> my<00:02:26.250> attempted<00:02:26.670> abstract<00:02:27.150> art<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.630> can't<00:02:28.440> get

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
is my attempted abstract art I can't get

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.650 
is my attempted abstract art I can't get
too<00:02:28.770> complicated<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.580> about<00:02:29.760> as<00:02:29.970> simple

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
too complicated this is about as simple

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.600 
too complicated this is about as simple
as<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.990> can<00:02:31.200> get<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.330> now<00:02:33.510> when<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.050> done

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
as I can get so now when this is done

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.400 
as I can get so now when this is done
again<00:02:35.610> I'm<00:02:35.730> going<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.910> heat<00:02:36.120> set<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.690> then

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
again I'm going to heat set it and then

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.710 
again I'm going to heat set it and then
I'm<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.860> use<00:02:38.040> some<00:02:38.070> archival<00:02:38.790> jet<00:02:39.450> black

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
I'm going to use some archival jet black

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.900 
I'm going to use some archival jet black
to<00:02:40.110> ink<00:02:40.290> up<00:02:40.440> my<00:02:40.500> sentiment<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.460> one<00:02:41.670> says

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
it in a fun stamp and I thought the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.030 
it in a fun stamp and I thought the
brush<00:02:48.900> script<00:02:49.140> lettering<00:02:49.350> would<00:02:49.680> look<00:02:49.800> really

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
brush script lettering would look really

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.650 
brush script lettering would look really
cool<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.580> that's<00:02:50.730> part<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.210> set<00:02:51.450> called

can<00:03:05.670> watercolor<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.330> because<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.660> stamped<00:03:06.990> it

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
can watercolor it because I stamped it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.080 
can watercolor it because I stamped it
with<00:03:07.170> archival<00:03:07.830> jet<00:03:08.400> black<00:03:08.610> which<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.820> bleep

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
roof and then I can just come in with

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.990 
roof and then I can just come in with
the<00:03:10.380> rest<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:10.890> red<00:03:11.130> paint<00:03:11.460> I<00:03:11.610> still<00:03:11.850> have

then<00:03:20.850> I'm<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.120> add<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.870> little<00:03:21.900> bit

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
then I'm going to add just a little bit

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.770 
then I'm going to add just a little bit
more<00:03:22.560> interest<00:03:23.070> by<00:03:23.250> making<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.760> teeny<00:03:24.120> tiny<00:03:24.420> pin

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
more interest by making a teeny tiny pin

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.190 
more interest by making a teeny tiny pin
dot<00:03:24.990> line<00:03:25.740> going<00:03:26.130> across<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.730> horizontal

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
dot line going across the horizontal

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.770 
dot line going across the horizontal
plane<00:03:28.200> there<00:03:28.890> with<00:03:29.459> my<00:03:29.730> tim<00:03:30.000> holtz<00:03:30.240> ruler<00:03:30.540> and

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
plane there with my tim holtz ruler and

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.410 
plane there with my tim holtz ruler and
one<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.260> those<00:03:31.350> faber<00:03:31.620> castell<00:03:32.240> bullet<00:03:33.240> nib

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
one of those faber castell bullet nib

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.560 
one of those faber castell bullet nib
markers<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.320> then<00:03:34.470> i<00:03:34.500> trimmed<00:03:34.890> off<00:03:35.100> the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
markers and then i trimmed off the

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.090 
markers and then i trimmed off the
excess<00:03:36.570> around<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.230> outer<00:03:37.380> edges<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:37.950> it

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
excess around the outer edges so that it

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.350 
excess around the outer edges so that it
was<00:03:38.190> about<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.430> half<00:03:38.760> an<00:03:38.940> inch<00:03:39.060> all<00:03:39.330> around

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
was about a half an inch all around

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.440 
was about a half an inch all around
smaller<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.280> panel<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.790> about<00:03:42.120> five

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
smaller so this panel is about five

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.010 
smaller so this panel is about five
inches<00:03:42.690> by<00:03:43.550> three<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:44.880> three-quarter<00:03:45.870> inches

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
inches by three and three-quarter inches

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.930 
inches by three and three-quarter inches
in<00:03:46.650> size<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.190> then<00:03:47.310> I'm<00:03:47.400> just<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.730> mount

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
in size and then I'm just going to mount

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.510 
in size and then I'm just going to mount
it<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.330> Neenah<00:03:48.660> solar<00:03:49.110> white<00:03:49.770> this<00:03:50.130> is<00:03:50.280> heavy

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
it to a Neenah solar white this is heavy

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.670 
it to a Neenah solar white this is heavy
weight<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:50.970> just<00:03:51.150> covered<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.050> whole<00:03:52.380> back

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
weight and I just covered the whole back

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.380 
weight and I just covered the whole back
there<00:03:52.950> with<00:03:53.130> adhesive<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.850> would<00:03:53.970> lay<00:03:54.150> down

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
there with adhesive so it would lay down

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.229 
there with adhesive so it would lay down
nice<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.690> flat<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.610> think<00:03:56.610> an<00:03:56.760> abstract

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
nice and flat I think an abstract

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.000 
nice and flat I think an abstract
background<00:03:57.690> like<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:58.020> is<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.230> great<00:03:58.709> way<00:03:58.950> to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
background like this is a great way to

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.040 
background like this is a great way to
showcase<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.730> brush<00:04:00.180> script<00:04:00.450> sentiment<00:04:00.930> and
