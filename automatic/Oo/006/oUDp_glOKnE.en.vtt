00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
and also they also have a Nike Zoom

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.869 
and also they also have a Nike Zoom
structure<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.379> think<00:02:31.620> 17<00:02:32.189> version<00:02:32.609> of<00:02:32.730> this

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
structure I think 17 version of this

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.589 
structure I think 17 version of this
where<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.079> inside<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:35.069> black<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.329> thought

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
where the inside is black and I thought

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.599 
where the inside is black and I thought
that<00:02:36.780> was<00:02:36.870> really<00:02:37.019> cool<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.890> thought<00:02:38.489> it

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
that was really cool so I thought it

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.589 
that was really cool so I thought it
would<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.790> been<00:02:38.879> pretty<00:02:39.090> cool<00:02:39.359> if<00:02:39.480> they

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
would have been pretty cool if they

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.789 
would have been pretty cool if they
would<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.780> done<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.079> with<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.349> Pegasus

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
would have done that with the Pegasus

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.670 
would have done that with the Pegasus
but<00:02:41.069> obviously<00:02:41.670> they<00:02:41.849> did<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:43.170> um<00:02:43.319> I
