little<00:01:14.100> wheat<00:01:14.310> seeds<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.930> meter

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
little wheat seeds in just this meter

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.429 
little wheat seeds in just this meter
now<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.970> may<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.020> crop<00:01:19.290> is

20,000<00:01:38.229> grains<00:01:38.470> so<00:01:39.430> not<00:01:39.610> only<00:01:39.759> do<00:01:39.970> we<00:01:40.060> grow

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
20,000 grains so not only do we grow

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.389 
20,000 grains so not only do we grow
food<00:01:40.540> in<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.810> field<00:01:41.079> but<00:01:41.770> we're<00:01:41.890> also<00:01:42.009> got<00:01:42.369> a
