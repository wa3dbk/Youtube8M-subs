00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.779
 Welcome to a new edition of Transport Waxman ones 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.759
 who have tried it once mostly do not want to do without it anymore 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.140
 on the MMI navigation system in the car 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.250
 a great thing also for professional drivers who are much more direct and 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.099
 short times are dependent 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.780
 but until now everyone had to deal with maps because there were trucks 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.400
 there are no electronic orientation values 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.560
 that could change now but that's just one of our topics today 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.520
 transported 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.520
 Josef Ministry is the first country for trucks 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.620
 Justice the Coens from the truck directly to the tape 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.180
 the procedure actor Dirk Heinrichs drinking cocoa 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.890
 Hard to believe that the navigation system is about for cars though 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.790
 In fact, the developers have long been lagging behind 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.620
 hard to do 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.610
 The specific information that a truck needs in a mobile system 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.280
 to work in now it has succeeded and so recently celebrated a world novelty 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.799
 Premiere the bfz Navi for truck drivers and of course I have my look on it 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.799
 thrown 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.530
 the dangers for lorries lurk everywhere, too 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.800
 would appear problematic 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.440
 if they are ignored by lack of concentration or wrong 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.500
 information 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.990
 then it's almost always right dangerous and really expensive 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.780
 an old railway bridge near Karlsruhe on one side and 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.540
 so that in one direction sufficient four meters high 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.540
 but on the other hand only three with 80 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.860
 who has driven into the establishment and urge the opposite direction wants back 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.100
 he puts an unpleasant surprise 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.880
 The Greek, however, also has much more information about their route than 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 car driver 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.550
 Metal Gear is one of many suppliers in the market 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.769
 Navigation systems for passenger cars 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.189
 Now the Karlsruhe company is the first to have a truck navigation system 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.249
 daring 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.709
 at the presentation it becomes clear what car drivers are already taken for granted 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.560
 means a real novelty for the car 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.069
 Nat 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.849
 justified until 4 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.669
 if they owned their navigation device 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:46.909
 only to steal data that were intended for cars with the percent 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.919
 For the first time, we have created a system that has been created worldwide 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:58.129
 Truck data takes into account heights and broadens, especially in trucks 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.049
 button lower than the truck is high or narrow senna 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.329
 Stackelberg stuck 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.949
 Now the operation of a PDH is not for everyone what already the full 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:10.740
 designation 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.809
 for some like IT to the system suggests 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.779
 but after a brief technical briefing, it goes to a first short 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.169
 The system can be set to different truck classes 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.079
 However, a design-related difficulty quickly becomes apparent 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.759
 Operation in a standard stop at the disc 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.849
 Kirsten truck not user-friendly 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.789
 Here, the supply industry should quickly remedy the problem and the pocket 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:42.989
 PC by special holders also in trucks in Belgium goods and eye-friendly 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.129
 bring closer 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.340
 is the goal first programmed every finally on the truck with the car 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.589
 usual comfort ahead 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:54.889
 on our entered note we move to one for heavy traffic 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.839
 closed road to 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:02.579
 the Truck Navigator rules Märgen 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:10.919
 AR most people we have the central bank but no or hardly 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.049
 come from the beat rocker clubs 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.819
 some wagons are barely covered by associations such as the Association of the Mineral Oil Industry 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.120
 or prompt associations for as well 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.490
 Bergemann Kör transported sign 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.919
 as of data are in painstaking detail for the factor Katers 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:27.790
 were collected 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.120
 and have made the paper the standard work for truck drivers 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.319
 however, the detection and fly this information is not easy 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.370
 even more than the print version behind the computer system of the quality and above 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.370
 everything from the timeliness of the data 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.210
 Of course we have a lot of problems 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.009
 Kit or the production of Paco Carglass had these problems 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.520
 that a lot of data is sovereignly popular, that means it's in trouble 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.639
 came with authorities that the data will be released 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.969
 Percent all data 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.610
 have been carried out after we have to check if that is true or not 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.110
 Right 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.949
 if you rise through such data Tel s cell quickly happens to people 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.330
 live in the environment or associations 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.379
 Do not like the truck as much as you like 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.150
 in samples which data enter pulse and the track there and Otis locked or 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.449
 the highway here is incredibly locked World Cup so that will be the percent 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.460
 Data is not credible and has to pinpoint everything and that is very very 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.460
 a lot of personal work that has to be done there 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.119
 but this work will now have to be done on an ongoing basis 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.319
 over the car system are over one million additional records 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.380
 incorporate 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.169
 and to nurture 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.479
 At the same time, you also pay for a kind of online community 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.830
 Errors in the data records should be eradicated as quickly as possible 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.629
 unplanned detours mean stress even more annoying if one of the 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.629
 Colleagues would use computers in a dead end 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:11.680
 that will work so that we on Plettenberg homepage 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.070
 to set up a position where the data can be collected data 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.360
 be verified and then round can be loaded from the internet 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.990
 on the private PC or on the guidance of the guests uncomplicated to who 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.779
 not on the buck 6 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.259
 this approach will also be the success 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.249
 that Plattner depend on Vegeta 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:35.180
 especially with customers lock if for example by the fine dust regulation 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.290
 This is a navigation system only as good as its current data finally 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.270
 we all just want to own one 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.970
 we are waiting
