00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
today let us look at FS module provided

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.460 
today let us look at FS module provided
by<00:00:03.510> node<00:00:03.840> dot<00:00:04.049> J's<00:00:05.359> note<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.569> it's<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.049> built

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
by node dot J's note that it's a built

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.910 
by node dot J's note that it's a built
in<00:00:07.680> module<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.610> node.js<00:00:09.360> because<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:10.170> reading

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
in module of node.js because it reading

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.890 
in module of node.js because it reading
and<00:00:11.099> writing<00:00:11.309> files<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.269> other<00:00:12.599> file

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
and writing files and other file

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.289 
and writing files and other file
operations<00:00:13.230> are<00:00:13.740> very<00:00:14.099> important<00:00:14.880> which<00:00:15.179> is

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
operations are very important which is

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.650 
operations are very important which is
kind<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.379> crucial<00:00:17.130> thing<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.760> real<00:00:18.060> time<00:00:18.359> web

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
kind of crucial thing in real time web

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.460 
kind of crucial thing in real time web
development

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
development

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.240 
development
so<00:00:20.369> using<00:00:20.699> FS<00:00:21.510> object<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.140> will<00:00:22.260> call<00:00:22.529> read

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
so using FS object we will call read

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.509 
so using FS object we will call read
file<00:00:23.820> sync<00:00:24.420> method<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:26.359> pass<00:00:28.070> H<00:00:29.070> TM<00:00:29.369> l

could assign this file name to that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
could assign this file name to that
variable<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.020> directly<00:00:46.530> pass<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
variable and directly pass in that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.189 
variable and directly pass in that
variable<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.899> second<00:00:49.200> parameter<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
utf-8 the character set of course and I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.580 
utf-8 the character set of course and I
will<00:00:55.079> output<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.340> content<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> our<00:00:57.590> HTML

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
will output this the content of our HTML

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250 
will output this the content of our HTML
file<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.190> console<00:00:59.579> window<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.359> will

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
file to the console window I will

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.310 
file to the console window I will
quickly<00:01:01.440> write<00:01:01.770> something<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:03.320> let's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
quickly write something here and let's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.469 
quickly write something here and let's
execute<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:06.020> file<00:01:07.020> using<00:01:08.010> command<00:01:08.340> prompt

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.450 

it<00:01:12.479> should<00:01:12.720> output<00:01:12.780> whatever<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.890> present<00:01:14.340> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it should output whatever is present in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.690 
it should output whatever is present in
that<00:01:14.610> index<00:01:15.270> dot<00:01:15.509> HTML<00:01:15.540> file<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.520> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
that index dot HTML file so this is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.630 
that index dot HTML file so this is
about<00:01:17.939> read<00:01:18.630> file<00:01:18.930> sync<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.340> want<00:01:20.580> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
about read file sync what if we want to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.140 
about read file sync what if we want to
write<00:01:21.229> well<00:01:22.229> I'll<00:01:22.490> see<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.000> only

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
write well I'll see here we have only

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.660 
write well I'll see here we have only
two<00:01:24.479> files<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.990> will<00:01:25.650> copy<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> contents<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
two files I will copy the contents of

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.060 
two files I will copy the contents of
Heth<00:01:27.570> index<00:01:28.200> dot<00:01:28.409> HTML<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:29.220> another<00:01:30.200> file<00:01:31.200> by

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
Heth index dot HTML to another file by

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.490 
Heth index dot HTML to another file by
actually<00:01:32.460> creating<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.240> file<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
actually creating that file for that I

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.429 
actually creating that file for that I
will<00:01:34.710> make<00:01:34.979> use<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.360> write<00:01:36.360> file<00:01:36.720> sync<00:01:37.140> method

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
will make use of write file sync method

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.440 
will make use of write file sync method
of<00:01:37.970> FS<00:01:38.970> object<00:01:42.649> well<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.939> obviously<00:01:44.939> takes<00:01:45.180> two

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
of FS object well it obviously takes two

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.240 
of FS object well it obviously takes two
parameters<00:01:45.990> first<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.470> being<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> file<00:01:47.070> name

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
parameters first one being the file name

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.530 
parameters first one being the file name
the<00:01:47.430> second<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:47.850> being<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> contents<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.680> be

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
the second one being the contents to be

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.139 
the second one being the contents to be
inserted<00:01:51.630> I'll<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:52.470> HTML<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
inserted I'll have HTML here that is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.780 
inserted I'll have HTML here that is
copying<00:01:54.600> whatever<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.200> present<00:01:55.770> inside<00:01:55.920> index

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
copying whatever is present inside index

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.200 
copying whatever is present inside index
dot<00:01:57.030> HTML<00:01:57.619> file<00:01:59.180> well<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:01.110> actually<00:02:01.680> returns

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
dot HTML file well it actually returns

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.690 
dot HTML file well it actually returns
undefined<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.719> guess<00:02:04.130> let's<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.549> it

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
undefined I guess let's see what it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.190 
undefined I guess let's see what it
returns<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> creates<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.030> file<00:02:09.959> called

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
returns so it creates a file called

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.380 
returns so it creates a file called
setae<00:02:10.560> store<00:02:10.800> HTML<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.489> copies<00:02:11.849> whatever<00:02:12.209> is

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
setae store HTML and copies whatever is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.190 
setae store HTML and copies whatever is
present<00:02:12.629> inside

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
present inside

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.440 
present inside
index<00:02:13.560> dot<00:02:13.770> HTML<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:15.950> well<00:02:16.950> let<00:02:17.160> us<00:02:17.310> see<00:02:18.180> if

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
index dot HTML to it well let us see if

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.640 
index dot HTML to it well let us see if
that<00:02:19.050> file<00:02:19.380> has<00:02:19.739> been<00:02:19.770> created<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.840> our<00:02:22.020> folder

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
that file has been created in our folder

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.180 
that file has been created in our folder
that<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.819> known<00:02:24.120> yeah<00:02:24.540> that's<00:02:25.050> been<00:02:25.349> created

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
that is known yeah that's been created

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.160 
that is known yeah that's been created
let's<00:02:26.670> open<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.510> look<00:02:27.720> at<00:02:27.930> its

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
let's open it and have a look at its

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.270 
let's open it and have a look at its
contents<00:02:29.330> yeah<00:02:30.330> exactly<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.500> same<00:02:31.709> as<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
contents yeah exactly the same as the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.510 
contents yeah exactly the same as the
index<00:02:32.610> dot<00:02:32.850> HTML<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.650> how<00:02:34.830> we<00:02:35.310> create

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
index dot HTML so this is how we create
