00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
I've heard on my Twitter thing I think

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.490 
I've heard on my Twitter thing I think
like<00:04:01.060> an<00:04:01.209> American<00:04:01.569> people<00:04:01.900> saying<00:04:02.049> what<00:04:02.290> does

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
like an American people saying what does

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.309 
like an American people saying what does
that<00:04:02.799> you<00:04:03.430> know<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.569> essence<00:04:05.019> of<00:04:05.139> that

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
that you know and the essence of that

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.410 
that you know and the essence of that
was<00:04:05.530> thinking<00:04:05.889> like<00:04:06.010> an<00:04:06.220> economic<00:04:06.819> migrant

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
was thinking like an economic migrant

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.569 
was thinking like an economic migrant
because<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.560> lot<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.069> you<00:04:09.549> know

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
because of the lot of you know

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.750 
because of the lot of you know
especially<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:11.049> term<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.530> 900<00:04:12.010> lot<00:04:12.609> of

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
especially the term the 900 lot of

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.759 
especially the term the 900 lot of
Americans<00:04:13.269> coming<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:13.690> for<00:04:13.930> who<00:04:14.049> Emma<00:04:14.500> groups

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
Americans coming in for who Emma groups

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.589 
Americans coming in for who Emma groups
and<00:04:14.950> they<00:04:15.010> had<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.340> energy<00:04:15.850> which<00:04:16.389> i<00:04:16.539> think

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
and they had that energy which i think

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.529 
and they had that energy which i think
is<00:04:16.959> now<00:04:17.739> slightly<00:04:18.010> built<00:04:18.370> if<00:04:18.940> not<00:04:19.209> into<00:04:19.389> your

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
is now slightly built if not into your

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.110 
is now slightly built if not into your
DNA<00:04:20.019> if<00:04:20.620> we<00:04:20.709> went<00:04:20.859> into<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.370> psyche<00:04:21.880> and

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
DNA if we went into the psyche and

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.420 
DNA if we went into the psyche and
hopefully<00:04:22.840> now<00:04:22.990> in<00:04:23.139> Europe<00:04:23.440> we're<00:04:24.160> kind<00:04:24.370> of

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
hopefully now in Europe we're kind of

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.500 
hopefully now in Europe we're kind of
doing<00:04:24.580> in<00:04:24.729> different<00:04:25.000> waves<00:04:25.240> Eastern

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
doing in different waves Eastern

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.260 
doing in different waves Eastern
Europe's<00:04:25.810> freed<00:04:26.680> itself<00:04:26.830> up<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:28.090> there's

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
Europe's freed itself up and so there's

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.879 
Europe's freed itself up and so there's
a<00:04:28.330> lot<00:04:28.450> more<00:04:28.510> possibility<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.349> I<00:04:29.440> like<00:04:29.650> that

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
a lot more possibility and I like that

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.710 
a lot more possibility and I like that
happening<00:04:30.310> in<00:04:30.430> here<00:04:30.610> I'm<00:04:30.789> very<00:04:31.240> positive<00:04:31.599> on

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
happening in here I'm very positive on

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.659 
happening in here I'm very positive on
your<00:04:31.870> open<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.410> if<00:04:32.770> we<00:04:32.919> can<00:04:33.130> sort<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.490> get<00:04:33.610> the

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
your open and if we can sort of get the

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.339 
your open and if we can sort of get the
bit<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:33.940> we<00:04:34.210> did<00:04:34.479> say<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.930> wouldn't<00:04:35.050> build

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
bit that we did say it wouldn't build

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.750 
bit that we did say it wouldn't build
this<00:04:35.500> or<00:04:35.680> make<00:04:35.860> this<00:04:36.010> or<00:04:36.190> what<00:04:36.340> could<00:04:36.430> we<00:04:36.580> do

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
this or make this or what could we do

all of one language and eventually in

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.020 
all of one language and eventually in
Europe<00:05:06.740> ideologically<00:05:07.580> think<00:05:07.820> there'll<00:05:08.000> be

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
Europe ideologically think there'll be

translated machines for televisions
which<00:05:10.160> will<00:05:10.280> instantly<00:05:10.700> translate<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.390> you

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
which will instantly translate so you

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.860 
which will instantly translate so you
could<00:05:11.630> have<00:05:11.840> in<00:05:12.680> ARCA<00:05:12.980> David<00:05:13.250> Letterman<00:05:13.640> or

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
could have in ARCA David Letterman or

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.570 
could have in ARCA David Letterman or

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
instantly translate but at the moment it

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.460 
instantly translate but at the moment it
doesn't<00:05:18.830> happen<00:05:19.070> it<00:05:19.310> is<00:05:19.670> completely<00:05:20.470> separate
