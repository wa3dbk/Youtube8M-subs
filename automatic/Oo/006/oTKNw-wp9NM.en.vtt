00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.610
 after pairing is necessary 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.429
 check if the 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.769
 drafting to do this we practice the 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.680
 palpation of the belly of the female a 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.300
 ten twelve days after mating 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.520
 this is a very delicate operation 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.099
 which must be done by experienced people 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.980
 because it can also lead to abortion 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.309
 in the event that it occurs that it is not there 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.070
 the female was fertilized after 23 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:35.379
 days is reported to the male 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.329
 following these indications we can 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.090
 call by breeding name 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.220
 traditional the rabbit is fertilized 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.350
 two three days after the end of 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.260
 weaning then giving birth 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.000
 roughly every two months 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.250
 with this method it does not exploit 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.460
 excessively the female and succeed 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.040
 to get six parts a year 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.920
 the reproductive duration of each female e 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.270
 then three years 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.280
 during this long career 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.820
 reproductive we can evaluate the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.719
 reproductive capacity of our animals 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.610
 identifying those females who 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.740
 give birth to more 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.640
 bunnies nurse them with more 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.850
 easiness 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.659
 elise veer to a greater weight from 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.880
 these females 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.549
 we will choose young people to replace them 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.750
 rabbits at the end of their career 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.790
 we said that career 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.600
 reproductive of a rabbit is approximately 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.150
 three years then in a farm 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.869
 it would be appropriate to have animals 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.720
 of females 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.010
 aet to climb one third of the animals o 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.960
 one year old 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.390
 another third of animals at two years e 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.780
 the last third to 3 years 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.320
 every year so you have to change a 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.150
 third of the animals the old animals 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.729
 of rabbits and old and those who 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.460
 they produce little need to be replaced 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.040
 in autumn September October how 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 rabbits and juveniles born in March 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.460
 previous one 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.469
