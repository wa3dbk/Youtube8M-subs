00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.220 
joyride series and he's a must-have
obviously<00:00:25.830> because<00:00:26.160> he's<00:00:26.460> Johnson<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.630> he

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
obviously because he's Johnson so he

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.800 
obviously because he's Johnson so he
stands<00:00:28.619> seven<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> half<00:00:29.670> inches<00:00:30.240> tall<00:00:30.420> so

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
stands seven and a half inches tall so

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.590 
stands seven and a half inches tall so
pretty<00:00:31.260> good<00:00:31.500> size

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
pretty good size

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.360

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
I'm sorry seven inches tall not seven

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.000 
I'm sorry seven inches tall not seven
and<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> half<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.880> thought<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.329> sounded<00:00:36.750> wrong

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
and a half I thought that sounded wrong

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.680 
and a half I thought that sounded wrong
he<00:00:38.010> has<00:00:38.100> almost<00:00:38.250> no<00:00:38.520> articulation<00:00:38.910> though<00:00:39.420> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
he has almost no articulation though so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
he has almost no articulation though so
that's<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> best<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.100> don't<00:00:41.309> know<00:00:41.489> which

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
sure the pistol he never came with but I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.779

have<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.360> anyway<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> don't<00:00:51.780> know<00:00:51.899> why<00:00:52.460> as<00:00:53.460> far

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
have it anyway I don't know why as far

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.260 
have it anyway I don't know why as far
as<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.600> figure<00:00:55.020> goes<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.949> looks<00:00:56.190> okay<00:00:56.789> but

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
as the figure goes it looks okay but

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.819 
as the figure goes it looks okay but
it's<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:57.899> too<00:00:58.140> much<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.440> an<00:00:58.530> action

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
it's really not too much of an action

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's really not too much of an action
figures<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> poseable<00:01:00.030> statue<00:01:00.390> he

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
figures more of a poseable statue he

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.759 
figures more of a poseable statue he
only<00:01:01.530> has<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> swivel<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> neck<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.350> old<00:01:04.350> and

only has a swivel in the neck a old and
old<00:01:04.920> school<00:01:05.189> ball<00:01:05.400> disc<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> shoulder<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070

single jointed elbow and the wrist
swivel<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.040> put<00:01:11.280> together<00:01:11.369> means

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
swivel so all of that put together means

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.280 
swivel so all of that put together means
you're<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.330> gonna<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.659> too<00:01:12.689> much<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you're not gonna do too much with that

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
you're not gonna do too much with that
arm<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.770> one's<00:01:13.979> even<00:01:14.130> worse<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.850> it's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
arm this one's even worse because it's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
arm this one's even worse because it's
sculpted<00:01:15.630> sideways<00:01:16.170> he's<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> same

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310

shoulder<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.880> same<00:01:18.030> elbow<00:01:18.360> joint<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
shoulder in the same elbow joint but a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.410 
shoulder in the same elbow joint but a
sculpted<00:01:19.470> twisted<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.729> he's<00:01:20.939> got<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> same

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
sculpted twisted and he's got the same

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
sculpted twisted and he's got the same
wrist<00:01:21.689> articulation<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.530> all<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.950> arm<00:01:23.130> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
wrist articulation but all that arm is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.999 
wrist articulation but all that arm is
good<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.700> holding<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.270> rifle<00:01:25.080> here's<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
good for is holding a rifle here's the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.179 
good for is holding a rifle here's the
waist<00:01:26.220> twist<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.850> ankle<00:01:27.810> pivots<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.159> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
waist twist and ankle pivots that's it I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.580 
waist twist and ankle pivots that's it I
think<00:01:29.610> maybe<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.240> used<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> swivel<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.470> they

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
think maybe is used to swivel but they

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
think maybe is used to swivel but they
won't<00:01:31.770> move<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.549> don't<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> purpose

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
won't move now and I don't see a purpose

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
won't move now and I don't see a purpose
for<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:34.380> there's<00:01:34.530> no<00:01:34.619> purpose<00:01:34.979> for

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
for that really there's no purpose for

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.780 
for that really there's no purpose for
the<00:01:35.369> ankle<00:01:36.180> pivots<00:01:36.509> either<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:38.340> sculpt<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the ankle pivots either the sculpt is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.240 
the ankle pivots either the sculpt is
okay<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> mean<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.420> looks<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.720> Johnson

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
okay I mean it looks like Johnson

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
okay I mean it looks like Johnson
there's<00:01:41.250> almost<00:01:41.430> no<00:01:41.729> paint<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.380> obviously

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
there's almost no paint on it obviously

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.749 
there's almost no paint on it obviously
I<00:01:43.409> mean<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:43.710> painted<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> details<00:01:44.670> that

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I mean they painted the details that

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.249 
I mean they painted the details that
they<00:01:44.850> needed<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> battle<00:01:45.930> damage

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
they needed to but the battle damage

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.469 
they needed to but the battle damage
looks<00:01:46.500> pretty<00:01:46.890> rough<00:01:47.130> especially<00:01:47.820> around<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
looks pretty rough especially around the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.899 
looks pretty rough especially around the
chest<00:01:48.780> looks<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:49.710> bad<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.579> there's<00:01:50.790> no

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.340 
chest looks pretty bad then there's no
shading<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.420> anything<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.810> face<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.200> okay

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
shading or anything the face is okay

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.350 
shading or anything the face is okay
it's<00:01:52.740> definitely<00:01:53.000> recognizable<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.090> Johnson

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it's definitely recognizable as Johnson

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.109 
it's definitely recognizable as Johnson
but<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.680> expect<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.549> wowed<00:01:56.790> by<00:01:56.820> this

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
but don't expect to be wowed by this

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.859 
but don't expect to be wowed by this
figure<00:01:58.820> he's<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.180> only<00:02:00.329> good<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:00.719> one

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
figure he's really only good for one

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.959 
figure he's really only good for one
thing<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:02.460> him<00:02:02.579> standing

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
thing and that is to have him standing

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.389 
thing and that is to have him standing
there<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> gun<00:02:03.659> pointing<00:02:04.020> forward<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
there with a gun pointing forward so the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.560 
there with a gun pointing forward so the
fingers<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.850> made<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> softer

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
fingers are made out of a softer

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.089 
fingers are made out of a softer
material<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.350> get<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> guns<00:02:07.920> in

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
material so you can get the guns in

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.010 
material so you can get the guns in
there<00:02:08.280> pretty<00:02:08.459> easily<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.349> go<00:02:10.349> ahead

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
there pretty easily so go ahead

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.640 
there pretty easily so go ahead
and<00:02:11.110> put<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> gun<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.040> his<00:02:12.340> hand<00:02:13.590> starting<00:02:14.590> to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and put a gun in his hand starting to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.340 
and put a gun in his hand starting to
think<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:14.920> maybe<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:16.180> sniper<00:02:16.870> didn't<00:02:17.200> come

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
think that maybe the sniper didn't come

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.250 
think that maybe the sniper didn't come
with<00:02:17.500> him<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:19.330> just<00:02:19.540> busted<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:21.810> okay<00:02:22.810> so

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
with him and I just busted it okay so

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.300 
with him and I just busted it okay so
don't<00:02:23.500> do<00:02:23.770> that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
don't do that

it looks pretty good just to have him
standing<00:02:36.220> there<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:36.610> don't<00:02:36.820> expect<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.180> pose

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
him too much I mean you can get a little

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.120 
him too much I mean you can get a little
bit<00:02:39.250> out<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.460> it<00:02:39.670> but<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:40.720> pretty<00:02:41.260> limited<00:02:41.860> so

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
bit out of it but it's pretty limited so

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.340 
bit out of it but it's pretty limited so
he's<00:02:42.370> more<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.760> statue<00:02:43.000> he<00:02:43.270> looks<00:02:43.450> fine<00:02:43.690> but

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
he's more of a statue he looks fine but

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.110 
he's more of a statue he looks fine but
he's<00:02:44.500> an<00:02:44.620> easy<00:02:44.800> pass<00:02:45.130> unless<00:02:45.430> you're<00:02:45.790> trying

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
he's an easy pass unless you're trying

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.210 
he's an easy pass unless you're trying
to<00:02:46.180> get<00:02:46.360> some<00:02:46.990> of<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.140> main<00:02:47.320> characters<00:02:47.830> from
