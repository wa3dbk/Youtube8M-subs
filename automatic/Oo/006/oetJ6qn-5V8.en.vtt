00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.809 
farmer flames at the end of the song we
actually<00:02:52.620> break<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:52.950> string<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.459> broke<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
actually break the string I broke the

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.190 
actually break the string I broke the
string<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> album<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.660> we<00:02:54.720> left<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.080> there

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
string on the album and we left it there

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.260

think<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.540> break<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> string<00:02:58.020> now<00:02:58.200> but

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
think I can break the string now but

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.060 
think I can break the string now but
let's<00:02:58.590> try<00:02:58.739> it
