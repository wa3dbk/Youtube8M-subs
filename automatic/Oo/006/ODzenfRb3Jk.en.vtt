00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 an international team of astronomers between 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.690
 which researchers are headed to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.790
 alessandra de rosa and stefano bianchi 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.340
 giorgio matt of the university of roma tre 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.799
 has discovered a powerful gas flow that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.929
 comes out at high speed from the regions 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.590
 next the supermassive black hole in the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.029
 heart of the galaxy ngc 55 48 that yes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.180
 located in the direction of the constellation 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.250
 of bots and 240 million light years from 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.710
 us the presence of this violent 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.199
 breath that spreads to 18 million 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.030
 kilometers per hour obscures much of the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.190
 region where the black hole and puts the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.200
 more energetic radiation arriving at 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.969
 block 90 percent of ics rays 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.590
 products and most of them 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.540
 ultraviolet 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.489
 the study published in science is one 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.350
 convincing observational confirmation at 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.570
 theories that provide for the expulsion of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.129
 powerful 20 of gas and dust by 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.350
 of the central areas of the galactic nuclei 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.850
 active as the boss explains himself 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.949
 interviewed by the media inaf 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.989
 however this is a black hole suppose 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.719
 that it is a black hole what it is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.789
 astronomers really know is that in addition to 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.629
 dropping the matter as well as falling into it 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.369
 the black hole 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.920
 in reality it is also partially expelled 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.380
 pushed out far from this black hole 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.360
 so a little the material revolves around the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.869
 black hole and falls inside a little comes 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 ejected pushed out far from this 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.570
 this is a black hole in a form of wind 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.350
 wind a wind how could it be one 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.170
 bora 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.700
 only that while the bora pushes to 100 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.979
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.350
 these winds are accelerated to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.960
 five thousand kilometers per second 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.299
 five thousand kilometers seconds are 15 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.850
 million 20 million kilometers per hour 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.680
 to better study these events 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.170
 we have organized a campaign 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.100
 observational on a nearby galaxy 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.890
 together negishi 55 48 which has a hole 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.900
 important active black well known e 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.729
 we used six satellites 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.159
 orbit of NASA and ESA in 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.590
 xmm newton detail of the agency 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.350
 European Space with which we have 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.980
 discovered in an absolutely unexpected way 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.560
 that these 20 are colder and more 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.720
 fast than we expected of 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.569
 find besides being more faithful more 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.690
 fast we think these events are 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.819
 products again unexpectedly much 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.640
 near the black hole to the car 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.819
 central that in addition to eating so much 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.340
 matter expels at high speed 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.620
 this wind and therefore this is matter 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.989
 which is simply expelled into 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.180
 interstellar medium of the galaxy that 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.180
 hosts this supermassive black hole
