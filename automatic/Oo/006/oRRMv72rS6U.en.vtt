00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.700
 good boys here like on said 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.700
 before here you see I do not know if you see 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:19.810
 min 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.810
 here I am formerly because that 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.560
 with the feet, the 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.340
 wineries in the most good methods 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.740
 modern 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.050
 here I 'm not going to put on maybe like in 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.690
 a small amount good good the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.719
 same qatar method to step on but 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.460
 with fists in his hands but this 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.039
 We can use the green cuffs to 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.980
 paste the pachorra to the wine we already make 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.850
 sport and we save energy 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 it's an example 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:02.570
 here we are billing there are two things 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:06.170
 very important for this of the wine and 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.130
 wine in general for some things and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.320
 others for red wine 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.420
 one for red wine you know that you 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.490
 I said that there is for the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.000
 fermentation has to be all 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.640
 let's say in the same container both 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.150
 sorcerers the digital skins like 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.940
 the engine you already know always taking away what 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.700
 which is the woody part of the bunch or what 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.700
 what is the wood or in the wood 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.560
 and good guys, as I'm telling you 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.619
 there are some asuntillos for example this 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.700
 wine that this wine, let's say, look 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.890
 of pruning as I said before would have a 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.240
 inconvenient to do it in most 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.159
 of the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.159
 of the sites let's say for example 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.990
 and I did not have the stove here because I did not 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.240
 it would be possible to do this because the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.510
 temperature at this time is already 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.510
 too low for fermentation that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.420
 now the red wine from let's say 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.190
 from about 22 23 degrees to about 30 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.110
 degrees approximately is a good 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.080
 temperature for good to have that 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:36.530
 that fermentation 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:40.280
 that is the engine process and hence the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.750
 mothers of wine then it is in 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.000
 that in having a good temperature 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.450
 because if not in this time you realize 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.370
 already in the time that we are 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.980
 that four days are over we are in 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.260
 Christmas and well then 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.190
 thank you in your favor here I can do 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.190
 say I have my cacharrito d 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:08.400
 of wine to make wines 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.360
 Well guys, here we are going to do 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.360
 the theme 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.400
 the second step since it is 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.900
 you always know that I recommend you 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.950
 recipients a way of 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.650
 to use them let's say is to serve us counted 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:36.280
 with thyme and rosemary 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.280
 they are used we already have the grape 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.300
 milled 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.060
 we already have the most ground grape 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:55.680
 we have the solid part and the part 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:58.980
 liquid already good revolves together but 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.049
 no riots before they were together and 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.530
 revolts and now already so together but not 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:08.790
 then revolt then the second step 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.180
 I would already say pass it to a container 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.180
 metal 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.019
 always trying that 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.169
 the container is enough 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.160
 big enough for it to be hollow for 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.969
 good the hat that is said ah good to 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.679
 that 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:41.769
 fermentation of that solid part of the 

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:43.849
 fermentation that remains in the 

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:47.529
 surface 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:50.520
 and what we say is 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:55.020
 the part 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:05:01.129
 that will give you all your 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:04.979
 let's say benefit all your juice all your 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:07.680
 substance to this engine that I already tell you 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.680
 that even with these same mothers if 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:16.280
 white must was added then 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.280
 reality I would still have red wine 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:24.260
 I already say that this is to make a 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.480
 flowers a small amount for 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.990
 give him a point 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.980
 something that I give point gallant now 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.550
 for the moment in this step because I say 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.550
 we see that 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.099
 this step is easy 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.920
 to help the fermentation we are going to 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.220
 throw 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.830
 a little bit to realize that this more 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.520
 or less you have to throw 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:01.180
 imagine that a gram 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.389
 between a gram and a half for every ten 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.530
 kilos of grapes or imagine that I have 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:11.319
 more or less would have about five kilos of 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.500
 grape approximately because in reality it 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.900
 I'm going to take that, not even a gram 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.729
 I'm going to throw here a little 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.070
 and then there are different products that 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:27.680
 they have always been thrown out before 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:32.810
 he was thrown 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:35.870
 let's say sulfur today the acid good 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.100
 sulphurous the methane and sulfite that is 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.400
 this 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.070
 what good provided by here more or 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.840
 less is not very complicated they found 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.569
 which is increasingly complicated by 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.279
 containers that bring 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:55.610
 mostly so you can understand me kind 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:58.099
 spray or dental bottle then then 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.770
 to get a small amount where 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:03.139
 it's not because of the cost, because actually 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.509
 You must annular beyond having 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:10.189
 let's say think portals in some warehouse 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:13.779
 I already say this product would be for the 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.779
 fermentation will be fought 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.199
 we will not return 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.820
 and we will leave it then 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.430
 here at a relative distance in which 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.590
 those degrees 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.720
 continually 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:37.400
 and start at any time 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.199
 and very important 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:45.889
 is that this cell you have to have 

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:48.620
 let's say of this pay although it is better 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:52.070
 because if not, that's going to be 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.919
 mosquitoes of stories is better to put 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.800
 for example a gauze a mosquito net or 

00:07:54.919 --> 00:08:00.199
 something like that like I'm going to do 

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.750
 work later but in reality the process 

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:05.509
 of cessation and good guys, we have already 

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:10.389
 seen here another little thing about this 

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:10.389
 make him wine we're a sob
