 As I promised I said to you. 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.720
 I was doing a nursery and such 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.059
 I made a living my way here more 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.040

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:46.830

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:55.379

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.479

 is seeing those well-off and 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.310
 very big step but as I said 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.630
 when you do not need a lot of space 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 You too, and I'll go. 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.010

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.450
 I listened more or less to see the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:34.270
 actually the top compartment 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.950
 I have not even finished what it is 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.230
 they can move from one side to the other. 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.520

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:48.720

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.850

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.400

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:06.080
 Look how many stayed here. 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:16.290

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.620

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.530

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:30.210

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:36.590
 Brazil table but today I finished making 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:40.260
 Living this day 16 in is getting fat 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:46.080
 quite because when they arrived here 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.620

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.620
 my creation 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.170
 I hope you enjoyed this there 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:59.520
 Little living in what I did and 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.630
 We'll get back to you soon. 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.480
 I actually went back 22 eaters 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.400
 each side I picked two pet bottles 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.830
 small and placed one on each side 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.570
 She does not study there, does not study much. 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.120
 wanting to eat right? 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.100
 I put one on each side that does not water me 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.180
 I always change it every half hour. 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.600
 hour 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:30.810
 I change and it's the way I wanted it 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:34.010
 and chubby people are placing wines with 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:39.570
 I'm sure it's lying here that the male 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.720
 What a boy and a girl in 17 woman for a 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.730
 men 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.150
 so this is it folks I'm going to buy more 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.860

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.770

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.080
 and then I'll buy more than 12 eu 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.370
 I want to stay with 24 12 over use 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.720
 low level and we will slowly 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.910
 People are going to buy because of course 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.810
 I will not stop buying 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.200
 I really want to make a great creation 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.560
 and I'm sure I can get Nasa arrived 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.200
 over there 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.580
 the lamp here that I always put on 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.820
 At night it's 7 o'clock to your book 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.650
 to complete the 16 hours daily 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.010
 It's like you do not know when she 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:31.500
 You need 16 hours of light as 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.570
 we only have 12 hours when the sun rises 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.640
 when the sun goes down 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.940
 so I put another four or five 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.810
 hours to complement these lights that 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.870
 The one I think I need to understand is 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.260
 It's good afternoon people, I hope you 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.470
