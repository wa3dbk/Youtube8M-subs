the<00:01:06.360> way<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.630> works<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:08.780> what<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.990> just

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the way this works is what I'm just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.750 
the way this works is what I'm just
changing<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.710> couple<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.100> things<00:01:11.369> show<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
changing a couple of things show you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.780 
changing a couple of things show you
exactly<00:01:12.090> how<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.390> play<00:01:13.220> what<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> do

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
exactly how I play what you have to do

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.469 
exactly how I play what you have to do
is<00:01:16.009> have<00:01:17.009> four<00:01:17.460> things<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.880> cooldown<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.360> all

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
is have four things on cooldown at all

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.050 
is have four things on cooldown at all
times<00:01:18.750> basically<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.799> what<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.700> summon

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
times basically so what I do is I summon

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.700 
times basically so what I do is I summon
my<00:01:21.210> zombie<00:01:21.540> dogs<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:22.080> wait<00:01:22.259> about<00:01:22.470> 30

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
my zombie dogs then wait about 30

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
my zombie dogs then wait about 30
seconds<00:01:23.159> since<00:01:23.310> I'm<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:23.729> gargantuan<00:01:24.119> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
seconds since I'm in my gargantuan that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.300 
seconds since I'm in my gargantuan that
means<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.049> when<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.320> come<00:01:25.530> off<00:01:25.650> cooldown<00:01:25.920> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
means that when they come off cooldown I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.039 
means that when they come off cooldown I
won't<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> summon<00:01:27.210> them<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.509> exactly<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
won't have to summon them at exactly the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.179 
won't have to summon them at exactly the
same<00:01:28.080> time<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:28.890> kind<00:01:29.040> of

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
same time because that's kind of

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.749 
same time because that's kind of
annoying<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:29.970> bad<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:31.020> ideal

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
annoying it's not bad but it's not ideal

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.160 
annoying it's not bad but it's not ideal
fetish<00:01:32.759> armies<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> 90<00:01:33.420> second<00:01:33.720> cooldown<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
you can just kind of blow that when you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.740

rune<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.900> I've<00:01:46.170> been<00:01:46.380> using<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.830> one<00:01:46.860> that

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
rune is I've been using the one that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.480 
rune is I've been using the one that
makes<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.170> last<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.590> 60<00:01:49.920> seconds<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.430> I

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
makes it last for 60 seconds but I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.040 
makes it last for 60 seconds but I
realized<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.330> wasn't<00:01:51.540> necessary

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
realized that that wasn't necessary

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.930 
realized that that wasn't necessary
since<00:01:52.290> I'm<00:01:52.440> casting<00:01:52.650> it<00:01:52.920> basically<00:01:53.280> every<00:01:53.580> 15

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
since I'm casting it basically every 15

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.710 
since I'm casting it basically every 15
seconds<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.550> i<00:01:56.580> just<00:01:56.670> decided<00:01:56.910> now<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
seconds so i just decided now to do the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.460 
seconds so i just decided now to do the
60-second<00:01:58.470> slow<00:01:58.800> down<00:01:59.810> what<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.990> allows<00:02:01.260> you

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
60-second slow down what this allows you

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.260 
60-second slow down what this allows you
to<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.100> once<00:02:02.520> you've<00:02:02.700> got<00:02:02.880> four<00:02:03.119> on

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to do is once you've got four on

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.320 
to do is once you've got four on
cooldown<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.050> literally<00:02:04.410> spam<00:02:05.190> your<00:02:06.000> two

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
cooldown you can literally spam your two

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.999 
cooldown you can literally spam your two
choices<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:07.080> damage<00:02:07.380> abilities<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.890> have

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
choices for damage abilities I have

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.040 
choices for damage abilities I have
firebats<00:02:08.520> because<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> me<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:09.479> do<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.869> most

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
firebats because to me they do the most

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.750 
firebats because to me they do the most
damage<00:02:10.170> two<00:02:10.860> hundred<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.190> twenty<00:02:11.400> percent

damage two hundred and twenty percent

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.479 
damage two hundred and twenty percent
for<00:02:12.000> 40<00:02:12.330> yards<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.840> crazy<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.770> then<00:02:14.370> of

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
for 40 yards it's crazy and then of

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.210 
for 40 yards it's crazy and then of
course<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.850> acid<00:02:15.209> cloud<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.840> make<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.130> that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
course the acid cloud I make it so that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.040 
course the acid cloud I make it so that
it<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.520> means<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.820> spreads<00:02:18.090> out<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.330> 24<00:02:18.750> yards

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
it that means it spreads out to 24 yards

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.690 
it that means it spreads out to 24 yards
which<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.290> huge<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.800> kills<00:02:20.010> everything<00:02:20.370> almost

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
which is huge it kills everything almost

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.990 
which is huge it kills everything almost
instantly<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.860> here<00:02:23.250> I'll<00:02:23.370> show<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.640> how<00:02:23.850> it
