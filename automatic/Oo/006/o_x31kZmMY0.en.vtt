there aren't brand splits you know there
isn't<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> draft<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.680> now<00:02:46.829> they're<00:02:47.099> going<00:02:47.250> to

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
isn't a draft so now they're going to

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.009 
isn't a draft so now they're going to
put<00:02:47.489> as<00:02:47.610> much<00:02:47.819> time<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.329> effort<00:02:48.420> into<00:02:48.750> not

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
put as much time and effort into not

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.229
