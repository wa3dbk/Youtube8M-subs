00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello everyone is me and was born new and by 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:11.250
 I bring you the review or review or 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.769
 book movie of the model instruments 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.020
 site bones or shadow hunters 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.150
 city bone mold and instruments 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.270
 lyon bombs is a film based on the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.190
 shadow hunters book 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.910
 cassandra clare the movie I think it's 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.220
 by constantin films and was distributed 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.830
 by sportzone and in the United States and by 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.690
 diamond films in latin america 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.090
 what is good about, just like the book 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.850
 It's about Cali Frei who lives in new 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.239
 york she thinks is that she has a life 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.220
 common but a certain day in a club goes with 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.350
 your friend Simon and discover that there are 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.840
 weird guys that only she can 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 see from here is where she begins to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.399
 discover that she is not what she believed 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.050
 be and that his mother kept more than one 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.610
 secret clearly how is a 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.350
 adaptation we can not ask it to be 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.270
 faithfully the book then now we're going 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.040
 to talk about the things that change a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.049
 little between the book and the key movie 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.170
 frei that is to understand interpreted by 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.750
 lily collins I find that sometimes he could 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.400
 about acting a little the scenes inside 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.200
 that they are an extraordinary performance 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.299
 but because it's bad but I find that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 came to the paper or to the essence of what 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.200
 it's key even though there were things that did not 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.689
 they showed but that was already talked the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.890
 more day of the director with james should I 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.049
 say that I was from the people that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.880
 they hated jamie he did not want him to be 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.549
 for james he did not imagine emirates but 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.789
 I think it was the opposite of what happened 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.340
 with with lee but I really liked the 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.890
 interpretation I could arrive and feel that 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.690
 it was James to make it a little sweeter 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.920
 but he still has the irony of that 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.840
 so I think that from there I got very 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.610
 good to paper is to talk about the things that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.220
 I liked them 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.450
 is the thing that I liked the most was the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.180
 exchange of what we treated that were 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.440
 the four as I said another thing that I 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.490
 like a lot 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.910
 magnus I think maybe more acting 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.860
 godfrey 's it was not like so 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.770
 stunning or as crazy as is the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.380
 real hands but watching the movie 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.030
 as it was, it would have to be like that because if 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.310
 not people would not understand why 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.320
 it was like that since it came out very little 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.300
 another thing is what I liked flowers of 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.010
 special effects had demons 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.290
 although they were not the demons described in 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 the book but the visual experts were 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 very well the battle scenes I think that 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.900
 maybe the movie to exaggerate a bit 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.060
 and they are leaving battles every three minutes 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.590
 but I really liked this change 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.910
 because I'm the people who do not 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.190
 much like the stories as 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.780
 harmonics so even though it seems weird but 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.780
 I do not like the movies make me 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.640
 slow and I get bored a lot now 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.230
 things that I did not like I saw the movie 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.580
 five times if I had not noticed 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.470
 of the things that I do not really 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.230
 they liked it so much but a friend who 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.820
 call the value that thank you very much 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.680
 sent as web by whatsapp things 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.910
 that he did not like the movie and 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.260
 later I realized that 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.140
 and more things I have not liked 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.180
 one of the first things is that the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.060
 movie was going so fast that we did not know 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.250
 who was clark and we did not suffer his likes 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.350
 we did not know that otaku as he says it in 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.450
 the book things were going very 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.560
 quick on the link in the movie we 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.390
 they showed that we were going to 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.480
 transform into vampire and for 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.150
 people were like 16 was was of 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.250
 more since they did not say anything about the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.200
 movie of that this was like for a 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.320
 but then do not explain anything your 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.470
 mark the people were like flying in 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.410
 this aspect another thing that I did not like 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.080
 so much is the way how do you find out about 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.420
 that are brothers that does not happen in the book 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.630
 they do not find out so I think the end was 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.420
 very cheesy and not to say that there are parts 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.400
 very cheesy that I did not read in the book in 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.570
 the part of the greenhouse he imagined 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.880
 something tender that happened but those five 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.010
 from the greenhouse to here 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.380
 I got here Simon declares his 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.970
 love were the 10 minutes of movie 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.630
 more clichÃ© that could not be cheesy 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.980
 of what there was and how it could rain 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.740
 although they say they are the sprinklers 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.990
 irrigators is the most I do not think that the 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.180
 director wanted to gather many things from 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.520
 different movies we can notice that 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.370
 the part of the weight of the greenhouse is very 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.470
 Disney we can see that there are things that one 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.600
 it could get to jump because you 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.940
 scared then it was a combo of 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.430
 movie was like the harry mix 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.580
 potter twilight this level 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.390
 and many strange things even with the 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.610
 exorcist 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.760
 a mix that I think can be the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.280
 criticism gave him a point or a note so 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.790
 low with respect to the note if I 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.580
 I had to give I would give from 1 to 10 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.370
 would give maybe a 7 because as I am 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.810
 fine maybe my criteria I like more and 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.360
 maybe if I had not read the book at 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.020
 Care less a tip if you have not read 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.210
 the books is to not read them before 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.980
 see the movie and if they are reading and have 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.290
 read only 1 do not see the movie 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.570
 until they finish on the 3rd or they will take 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.490
 millions and millions of spoilers this is 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.220
 I want to tell you that it is the book of 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.530
 shadow hunters from 1 to 5 plus the 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.690
 saga of the origins brings it is our 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.760
 the planet so I also wanted to give it 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.400
 thanks again for sending me this 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.689
 exemplary that is beautiful and I want to read 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.029
 again 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.219
 and that has been everything I hope that you have 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:25.849
 liked it well that I have a new page 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:27.619
 on Facebook and the mortals that leaves them 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.169
 the link here and I hope you have them 

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:31.909
 I hope you like my background 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.979
 because it 's totally sensual where it 's 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:37.309
 misused but that's all I hope will 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.429
 have liked and see you next time 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:39.429
 bye 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.979
 does not exist 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.490
 in saying it 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.490
 good structural
