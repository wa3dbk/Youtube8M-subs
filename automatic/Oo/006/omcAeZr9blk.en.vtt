as<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:31.970> parent<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.660> think<00:03:32.930> it's<00:03:33.049> just<00:03:33.230> important

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
as a parent I think it's just important

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.569 
as a parent I think it's just important
that<00:03:33.739> people<00:03:33.980> parent<00:03:34.910> their<00:03:35.420> children<00:03:35.870> so

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
that people parent their children so

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.410 
that people parent their children so
that's<00:03:37.579> basically<00:03:37.730> where<00:03:38.090> I'll<00:03:38.209> leave<00:03:38.390> that
