a change over the state i did you have a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.210 
a change over the state i did you have a

point you do now keep you people know
but<00:02:55.370> i<00:02:55.430> guess<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.030> good<00:02:56.180> thing<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.870> guess

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
but i guess the good thing is I I guess

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.289 
but i guess the good thing is I I guess
our<00:02:57.650> thinking<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.459> we're<00:02:58.760> at<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.970> table

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
our thinking is that we're at the table

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.699 
our thinking is that we're at the table
we<00:02:59.360> run<00:02:59.480> our<00:02:59.570> pajama<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.200> we<00:03:00.320> actually<00:03:00.500> don't

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
we run our pajama so we actually don't

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.530 
we run our pajama so we actually don't
even<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.160> get<00:03:01.340> up<00:03:01.519> we<00:03:02.060> could<00:03:02.209> just<00:03:02.299> pass

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
even have to get up we could just pass

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.620 
even have to get up we could just pass
out<00:03:02.720> at<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.930> table<00:03:03.290> after<00:03:03.620> we<00:03:03.860> eat

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
out at the table after we eat

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.930 
out at the table after we eat
so<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.500> take<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.460> won't<00:03:06.640> be<00:03:06.760> wearing

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.190 
so I take it that you won't be wearing
