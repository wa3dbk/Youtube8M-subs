especially we have any kind of power up
it'll<00:04:34.840> be<00:04:34.900> pretty<00:04:35.140> easy<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.620> actually<00:04:36.010> shoot

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250

the<00:04:38.920> most<00:04:39.130> obnoxious<00:04:39.340> part<00:04:39.940> about<00:04:40.150> this

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
the most obnoxious part about this

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.760 
the most obnoxious part about this
battle<00:04:40.660> is<00:04:40.780> easily<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.260> balls<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.620> are

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770
