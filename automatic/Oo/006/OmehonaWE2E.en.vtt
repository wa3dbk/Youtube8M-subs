00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.570
 hello you are on the sheet victory.com dot 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.559
 reporter bike bar and today I go 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.809
 comment 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.560
 two incidents that occurred in the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.190
 with me on this first incident 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.029
 Can you repair it if it scratches? 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.400
 pass between me and a car in the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.789
 left it tightened in every way 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.619
 to pass and I was occupying the track 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.680
 precisely so as not to fail to make a 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.340
 dangerous overtaking and he still 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.559
 managed to get in the car. 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.980
 left lane and bicycles can 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.290
 to repair and that I had to make a 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.840
 evasive maneuver to the right to 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.899
 avoid shock 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.340
 a second video revealed the sandero the 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.110
 wolves with a headlamp and did not 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.940
 distance from the rear of the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.110
 bicycle wheel bicycle 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.300
 you can see in the video excerpt 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.970
 the distance between the ball and the bumper 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.290
 front of the car arrived just one 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.600
 span of about 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.360
 then what should be done is not how the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.140
 maneuvers should have been made in 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.140
 first place in the case of the Corsican Corsican 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.830
 should not have forced in the passage 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.270
 between the bike and the car that was 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.729
 in the left lane 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.410
 He should have waited behind me. 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.990
 I was waiting for a moment when the 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.979
 left was free and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.540
 with safety 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.000
 Rafael was happening to you. 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.770
 I was pedaling in the middle of the track. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.619
 You should get there in the corner. 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.619
 resolved it would not have solved the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.410
 The answer is emphatic, not if I had 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.509
 pedaling in that driver's corner 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.910
 would have taken a line from me the same 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.729
 and it would be worse because I would not have 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.660
 space to make an elusive maneuver that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.790
 I made 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.750
 in the second case what should have been 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.090
 done 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.729
 the driver should have respected a 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.459
 distance from the rear of the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.980
 bicycle rear wheel bicycle 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:19.860
 I should have expected to complete the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:25.620
 and then turn right at the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.989
 least not right to not cut me to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.040
 enter right by them just waiting for the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.920
 wrong band 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.720
 he waited for me, wavering from the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.730
 asking me to leave the road, this does not 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.890
 it's right this can cause accidents 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.690
 Can you kill the cyclist I ask? 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.260
 strongly urge that the prefecture of 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.739
 win the state government make in 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.900
 an emergency campaign. 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.810
 guidance to drivers because the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.209
 drivers do not know these rules 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.420
 they do not know that the bicycle can 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.260
 be on the right lane 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.340
 so please please mayor 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.220
 governor 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.720
 Look at us Look at us bikers 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.550
 so that more deaths will not happen 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.550
 other thanks
