00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.980
 my very first car was a renault 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.500
 clio 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.130
 At that time I was driving as before 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.580
 ten years 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.130
 and now I drive a x6 m 50 d this 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.849
 jersey promoter this mother goes there 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.339
 really good 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.339
 quite frankly, my favorite car 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.660
 Being the champion feels 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.539
 really nice that's a thing 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.309
 that every day you realize that again 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.530
 It takes a little while to get up 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.840
 you realize that completely and not 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.329
 Everything comes before everything 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.699
 this is also the first bmw master to be 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.820
 something very special for me after 20 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.010
 years no bmw in the dtm water that is 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.239
 really very special is that has the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.969
 It has taken a bit of time for 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.379
 me until I realize that, but now 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.969
 during the day sometimes forget that 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.379
 of course, because I have a lot to do, of course 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.179
 But sometimes I have already 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.400
 a little voice in the head tells me to do that 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.079
 as champions this year so that's 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.299
 actually a beautiful a nice one 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.450
 feeling and of course that makes very good 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.450
 mood 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.540
 I have 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.220
 many favorite tracks actually 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.590
 norisring is really the one me on 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.750
 I like it a lot because I have it often 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.160
 won because I often podium and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.240
 I think the mood was sensational 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.050
 but of course all the others 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.060
 plug in 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.460
 I also like hockenheim a lot 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 nÃ¼rburgring that lausitzring him so much 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.150
 really my favorite track now 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.100
 Of course, so too, of course 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.100
 a bit of preference for norisring 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.360
 that's actually good for him as that 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.850
 In any case that compliments the course 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.740
 a few times I heard that one 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.840
 killer but it is true that everyone 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.479
 the compliment and I'm like 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.430
 said one of the very hard 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.880
 all his goals are always fighting everything 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.890
 gives and annoys sometimes and very much 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 goal-oriented and I always do everything 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.880
 to achieve my goals 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.510
 dtm he has two races this year 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.090
 a white roof because it was just very 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.000
 Hot if my car is dull black and 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.070
 makes a bright roof or white roof 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.860
 so three to four just made a difference in the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.480
 cockpit and that 's natural 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.180
 decisive because if it is in 60 degrees 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.920
 cockpit then a bit a few degrees 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.420
 winning is of course always good and 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.750
 It was in the weekend as I said very 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.270
 very hot and we had the team 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.970
 helped and given a white coffin 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.330
 that I have a bit of fresh air 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.330
 Has 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.260
 on 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:01.260
 made and that was a 17 years old 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.950
 was and it snowed the day can 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.950
 I still remember 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.920
 behind 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.830
 such a small people, although a disco 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.319
 Dance means that this is a sponsor 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.840
 I had ten or fire from me 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.180
 actually 15 years ago in go kart the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.560
 was clad then and then I have 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.519
 of course I asked if I logo 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.069
 can take 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.500
 because this has me so I like logo 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.319
 The logo was cool and that was a good one 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.879
 friend of mine he told me yeah 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.650
 can you keep the logo and this 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.360
 logo I have now for more than 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.340
 fifteen years on my helmet because of 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.810
 is just super cool and now 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.810
 also a small lucky charm for me
