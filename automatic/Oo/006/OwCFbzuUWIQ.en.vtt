your nose and it kind of just rounds
everything<00:05:00.860> out<00:05:03.370> so<00:05:04.370> that<00:05:04.520> is<00:05:04.820> it's<00:05:05.090> really

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
everything out so that is it's really

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.520 
everything out so that is it's really
simple<00:05:06.190> start<00:05:07.190> out<00:05:08.170> applying<00:05:09.170> the<00:05:09.380> color

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
simple start out applying the color

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.470 
simple start out applying the color
lighter<00:05:10.040> than<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.430> really<00:05:10.790> think<00:05:11.060> it's<00:05:11.240> going

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
lighter than you really think it's going

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.830 
lighter than you really think it's going
to<00:05:11.540> need<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.870> be<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:12.550> then<00:05:13.550> you<00:05:13.790> can<00:05:13.970> work<00:05:14.210> it's

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
to need to be and then you can work it's

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.690 
to need to be and then you can work it's
always<00:05:15.170> easier<00:05:15.500> to<00:05:15.530> add<00:05:15.740> more<00:05:16.100> color<00:05:16.280> than<00:05:16.460> it

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
always easier to add more color than it

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.730 
always easier to add more color than it
is<00:05:16.820> to<00:05:16.970> take<00:05:17.120> color<00:05:17.450> away<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.680> know

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
is to take color away and I know

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.040 
is to take color away and I know
everybody<00:05:19.430> says<00:05:19.490> that<00:05:19.730> but<00:05:19.970> honestly<00:05:20.600> it<00:05:20.870> is

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
everybody says that but honestly it is

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.550 
everybody says that but honestly it is
just<00:05:22.060> be<00:05:23.060> careful<00:05:23.330> not<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.840> put<00:05:24.020> too<00:05:24.050> much<00:05:24.320> on

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
just be careful not to put too much on

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.190 
just be careful not to put too much on
at<00:05:24.740> first<00:05:24.950> and<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.910> really<00:05:26.240> helps<00:05:26.720> shape<00:05:26.960> your

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
at first and it really helps shape your

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.810 
at first and it really helps shape your
face<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:27.710> don't<00:05:27.860> want<00:05:28.010> only<00:05:28.130> do<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.490> but<00:05:28.790> I

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
face I don't want only do it but I

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.000 
face I don't want only do it but I
probably<00:05:29.150> should<00:05:29.600> because<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.680> could<00:05:30.830> probably

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
probably should because I could probably

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.640 
probably should because I could probably
do<00:05:31.190> some<00:05:31.340> cheekbones<00:05:32.290> thank<00:05:33.290> you<00:05:33.440> for
