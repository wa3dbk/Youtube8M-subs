 In this video of our classes today we are going to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.580
 be learning how to do the installation 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.710
 of motorcycles carlos ricardo ismael and let's go 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.530
 start downloading the first one 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.900
 player guys and then let's be let's go 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.090
 lower a north to reinstall in case 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.220
 that use a bmw bmw m5 like 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.320
 demonstration of our video lesson and let's 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.070
 arrive that pedro carlos we will betray 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.600
 He is going to create a short one. 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.700
 let's get this player car and copy and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.160
 we paste inside the folder of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.210
 indicators were failed or date with 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.610
 son 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.329
 Let's talk here in this folder with 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.270
 daughter 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.190
 Let's copy and paste it is worth remembering 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.379
 this expensive campaign file is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.120
 necessarily only once for 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.440
 to install only once is 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.579
 necessary to make the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.739
 molds 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.960
 now always download other ways not 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.479
 it was no longer necessary to install 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.760
 more copied this expensive player 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.240
 modified to be able to install new 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.740
 in-game modes 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.180
 now let's get the bmw let's extract 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.400
 rose bush away from her 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.220
 Let's get these two these two folders. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.950
 of turisforte export and we will copy 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.470
 Let's paste the patient with Adrian into 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.700
 queen of peace in brazil 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.450
 there to do it always ready 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.570
 we see Angop now have fenced and Vuk 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.640
 data is a document 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.190
 in our lines on ips Tuesday 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.580
 growth and let's take that aside 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.930
 up here down here select 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.930
 how should we copy 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:01.700
 Let's already say that oxy already passes through 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.600
 do as undated we go from your 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.400
 daughter 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.650
 Now let's get the file to a 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.530
 Little bit now, let's not paint. 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.780
 entitled to one year 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.110
 done here in this list goes 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.870
 have this one little arrow from these is 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.270
 had people hit the enter a 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.380
 Instead of pressing the enter twice and 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.709
 now we can paste that hunting is done 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.170
 Cup remember that among the seven lines and 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.580
 here the code has to have ones because it has 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.450
 a blank line as we are 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.530
 We are seeing here in our virtual distance 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.930
 and catharsis and cars have to be two lines 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.489
 just as it is now in our 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.880
 virtual is made aol the time joke the 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.820
 files of the car but the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.250
 code here from the car that inside the game 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.860
 inside this firecracker type we are in 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.620
 file and we will save 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.400
 now let's do a simulation of how 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.320
 would be to install two modules 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.209
 now we have to go get it here if it is 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.510
 this for example you imagine that I 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.390
 I got another code already made the copy of the 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.910
 game on that in the main agent folder 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.150
 You 'll always get back on the scoreboard. 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.170
 How do you look and let's press enter 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.299
 turn 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.670
 and now let's paste the code again 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.409
 in case I'll use the same code as 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.989
 example but it will be another right 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.549
 will be another way will be another cut let's 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:38.579
 vote here we pretend it is 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:40.680
 dodge challenger is done that we 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.970
 have to remember that from the distance 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.870
 between faces and faces of two lines is 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.150
 done, just save again and the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.739
 mode are already in the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.500
 working 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.569
 the game still inside the game and come back 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.690
 within the line installed where you 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.370
 choose to start the game 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.019
 well, that's it then hope it 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.700

 if you liked that little joie to help in the 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.810
 to favorites as well as 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.150
