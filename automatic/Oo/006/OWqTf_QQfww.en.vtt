00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello and welcome youtube 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.300
 at your frank wpt under reger and we 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.230
 have today in the upper middle class 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.950
 the razer black shark in battlefield 3 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.870
 design 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.570
 I think very nice part so 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.560
 usually these are branded 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.550
 things gaming design is not always that top 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.019
 stylish or sometimes a bit 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.699
 questionable so you can go behind it too 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.990
 man says if the game is currently up to date 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.820
 I really want to stop that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.610
 But putting on the part here may think 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.380
 I look pretty so except for that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.410
 battlefield logo on top of it, it's just 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.460
 style in such a pilot and I have to 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.350
 Now again I confess I know it too 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 already and I think it's very cool 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.059
 the whole part 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.850
 how can you ever see again 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.230
 very cool packed by razer it gives it 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.829
 whole part also in riesa look in black 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.940
 green 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.820
 I like but frankly that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.350
 Battlefield design with the orange 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.239
 much better handle ball out 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.760
 especially since I have to say it's worth it 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.030
 because nowhere so all this 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500
 this whole case drowned 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.320
 that's okay now you can see here 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.700
 course about me but here 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.850
 installation cd and in there 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.220
 you can see what's ok in the pop there 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.500
 If you come with it you can not do that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.390
 could be a little something for 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.640
 lost some girls and then 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.590
 spare wheel I do not know says 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.590
 I tried to get out of it 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:32.990
 Come on out you shit that's what one for 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.340
 justin that could i could 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.510
 do not use the headset 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.400
 if we do not use the microphone 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.830
 That's what you want here 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.170
 can exchange and here a firm 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:47.120
 bolt the wacken the beautiful village 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.800
 hunt heavy packing that's it 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.900
 only thing reminiscent of battlefield 3 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.110
 but that's just it 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.240
 otherwise left absolutely like it 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.640
 so on the one hand is a bit like loose 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:05.500
 so maybe I find many cables 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:08.630
 here on the side too small ear-shell 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.450
 so it's right where I realize I know 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.830
 not that is so or so I simply 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.120
 Of course, such thick rags can be 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.630
 I would not be me now 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.350
 express 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.709
 I already have the philistines 8 and 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.709
 definitely 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.270
 It is very much decided now 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.070
 why do I become so loud? 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.470
 you have that biggest but you can see that 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.180
 It is very important to Africa 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.739
 So, like I said, this is here now 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.630
 nothing moves here everything is part 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.900
 of sex are just these the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.959
 Do not bother yourself in old school and 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.420
 I have to say what I like 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.140
 this this metallic microphone 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.800
 that she is cool 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.590
 so with the joints here if 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.910
 one then that is already cool so that has 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.670
 so this retro style 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.840
 Of course I already give it but me 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.610
 I've never had it in the battlefield before 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.690
 design but I definitely have it 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.200
 ever the black-green design 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.340
 been wearing 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.630
 that's actually such a headset 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.880
 she can not really decide where 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.489
 is the update yes that 's really mega 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.420
 hardly what is there to me by the 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.830
 Lastly, something can not really work 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.570
 it wants to decide on the ears 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.610
 or do you want to be fluent at it 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.760
 somewhere a bit at the moment but so 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.480
 it's all down so that's it 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.370
 even the title test looks pretty 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.550
 everything on the spot test or me 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.410
 think for me now does not look silly 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.459
 So I really need it with me 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.989
 kinda try a little bit that 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.080
 we cleverly set one can do that 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.790
 Wear here 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.080
 that's probably the case again 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.910
 I can not find it now 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.410
 I must say uncomfortable but it is one 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.030
 Strange feeling because it is on the front 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.070
 ears are lying exactly and then in the 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.570
 It is definitely going to be millions again 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:51.540
 on the pc headset yes with jack adapter 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.680
 double jack so I like from the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.240
 optics actually quite good because it stops 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.800
 so a bit out of the design 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.300
 falls out of the usual style here 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.680
 we have a point and if 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.840
 all you imagine now time 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.210
 is there are not even two meters 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.360
 one and a half spared that means you have to 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.710
 with this headset in any case the pc 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.630
 have very close or best one 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.750
 have laptop where only part connect 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.190
 Could because the range is very much 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.530
 limited if I introduce myself to myself 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.870
 at home my pc is down there i here 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.790
 above 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.440
 there can not bend so yes that is 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.210
 In any case , ever a shortcoming like 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.860
 the remaining maneuvers look like or whether 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.500
 really still ding after the solid 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.980
 hire throughout the industry farmer 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.260
 the excellent rating yes 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.580
 racer black shark that could not 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.560
 So really agree on whether that part 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.570
 is good or bad that likes to sit 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.580
 now maybe on the head shape or on 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.440
 the ears greetings lie 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.610
 In general, the good part with the 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.830
 Battlefield 3 design is simply a very 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.169
 bass-heavy stereosound headset at the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.330
 I say it right on the ears 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.980
 So now I found that part 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.890
 So just so predestined 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.020
 is for ego or physics recruiter games 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.910
 So where are you doing right where explosions 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.580
 are and so there is so easy 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.380
 full throttle and it just sounded to me 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.630
 really liked 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.390
 it was not cheap now either 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.310
 Headset but horny sound and extreme 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.840
 cool look how can you find one 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.650
 Actually do not complain about what the 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.370
 warrior says so 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.500
 the razer black shark has idol good 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.680
 Sound sound therefore exists here for 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.900
 four earlobes of wearing comfort well 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.870
 it is very shaky to finally quite 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.050
 the techno snacks from the commander 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:38.919
 That's why there are only three rappen here 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:42.460
 The equipment is okay average 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:47.460
 three girls and the microphone with 35 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.460
 fold the micro is rated
