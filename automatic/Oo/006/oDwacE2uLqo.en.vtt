00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.520
 a new video is being maintained today 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.170
 and for the best anime from the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.130
 this autumn it was not 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.900
 quite simply you write in the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.550
 Comment your personal favorites 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.690
 from the current season you can 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.590
 between 1 and 5 1 it went into the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.630
 Write comments 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.859
 I will then evaluate that and the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.119
 then most will be called 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.410
 Of course, final place eleventh 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.300
 I'll get a top10 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.619
 video from it create in future have 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.699
 I prepare this format in every season 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.500
 to bring and then it goes altogether 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 four videos a year that 's not so 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.900
 a lot but I think it is quite useful 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.460
 if you like such a tip 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 from the current or a past 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.130
 season you can look for this 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.450
 watch the top 10 video or synonymous 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.800
 Generally if you are anime again 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 you can search so looking 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.550
 I like that and that was from 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.660
 most felt very good 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.059
 maybe I'll look there sometimes 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.510
 podcast purely these, there is further 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.610
 give 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.960
 I know many of you do not stand 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.910
 so on the podcast that I acknowledge 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.469
 the clicks and also the likes but 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.700
 I personally always find something nice 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.469
 and I know there are a few under 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.090
 you guys are in that mood 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.469
 a little bit longer about anime what 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.610
 but for most is 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.859
 it's just too long anyway 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.420
 continue to give this podcast 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.030
 even if I know that there are many under 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.899
 you do not give them the podcasts now 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.610
 so celebrate 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.869
 if you are not at anime 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.159
 but you are certainly out of the current 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.659
 season is then just write 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.890
 anyway in the comments I will 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.540
 then check and if he stops 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.560
 not from the current season is then 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.280
 i'll just drop him off the list 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.950
 cross out 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.450
 important may still be anime 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.070
 I count all of the current season 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.840
 in the current autumn this 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.189
 that is what they have started 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.560
 just keep walking or something 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.909
 long time animes wikis that could then 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.710
 yes every month and wrote one 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.850
 just do not tell, only the ones count 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.610
 one in the current season 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.930
 started 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.340
 otherwise we had to say 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.810
 until the end of each time I will 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.759
 still counted out with finally 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.150
 and next to it a nice ten top 10 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.250
 to make a video 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.210
 and i hope you like the idea i 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.470
 in principle, do not think the idea 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.330
 bad because it's good on the one hand 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.530
 On the other hand, there are also tips 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.150
 a good overview of the whole 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.950
 season and always feel so season 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.030
 Surveys made that I have now 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.230
 not done for a while and that 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.920
 in that sense it is also a substitute 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.110
 for this 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.000
 and yes next week I have to go ahead 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.650
 I have to do the barracks review 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.210
 on facebook also already announced the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.170
 should come up then i was the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.760
 chilled a little bit last week 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.200
 that's why it has a bit longer 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.010
 taken as I have planned 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.330
 maybe it was in my voice 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.350
 now a bit of what I do 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.240
 so a bit cold 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.430
 I think it's okay, too 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.260
 and yes, the comments makes sense what 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.650
 what inspired you in this season 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.120
 you liked and so far only 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.280
 one is or if he calls equal to five 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.200
 It does not really matter but you have to do it that way 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.180
 if you call one that is that 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.010
 so he is more valuable because he is 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.240
 then no one because then no one 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.620
 get another anemic voice and 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.240
 this value then automatically in the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.610
 better represented 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.530
 I hope so hard in the boat over 100 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.209
 comments I will need my wish 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.650
 yes a strong engines lie or that 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.180
 is also such a meaningful list 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.540
 are actually so weighed few more 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.240
 become 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.739
 and that's what it's all about for today 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.989
 diligently in the comments to you the 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.709
 finger glow and bye and bye 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.709
 next time
