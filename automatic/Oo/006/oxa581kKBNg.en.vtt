00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.819 

okay<00:00:00.420> so<00:00:00.480> we're<00:00:00.810> gonna<00:00:00.930> be<00:00:01.050> loud<00:00:01.230> allowing

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
okay so we're gonna be loud allowing

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.770 
okay so we're gonna be loud allowing
users<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.449> authenticate<00:00:03.449> without

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
users to authenticate without

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.950 
users to authenticate without
application<00:00:04.879> using<00:00:05.879> Google<00:00:06.420> authentication

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
application using Google authentication

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.230 
application using Google authentication
basically<00:00:07.680> I'm<00:00:08.429> going<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.670> show<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:08.910> how<00:00:09.090> this

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
basically I'm going to show you how this

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.000 
basically I'm going to show you how this
works<00:00:09.540> then<00:00:09.960> we'll<00:00:10.080> dive<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.710> look<00:00:10.860> at<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
works then we'll dive in and look at the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.919 
works then we'll dive in and look at the
database<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.759> how<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.330> stored<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:12.840> we

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
database and how this is stored so we

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.209 
database and how this is stored so we
are<00:00:13.049> doing<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.380> little<00:00:13.559> bit<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.769> database

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
are doing a little bit of database

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.279 
are doing a little bit of database
storage<00:00:14.670> as<00:00:14.820> well<00:00:14.870> once<00:00:15.870> we've<00:00:16.080> authenticated

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
storage as well once we've authenticated

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.740 
storage as well once we've authenticated
will<00:00:16.859> store<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.220> Google<00:00:17.550> ID<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.119> email

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
will store the Google ID and the email

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.019 
will store the Google ID and the email
address<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.289> authenticated<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.039> into

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
address that I authenticated with into

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.900 
address that I authenticated with into
the<00:00:21.240> database<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.529> when<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.279> hit<00:00:23.460> sign<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.820> with

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
the database so when I hit sign in with

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.089 
the database so when I hit sign in with
Google<00:00:24.300> what<00:00:24.689> we're<00:00:24.930> basically<00:00:25.199> doing<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.769> we

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
Google what we're basically doing is we

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.730 
Google what we're basically doing is we
are<00:00:26.369> passing<00:00:27.019> while<00:00:28.019> we're<00:00:28.230> being<00:00:28.500> redirected

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
are passing while we're being redirected

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.609 
are passing while we're being redirected
to<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:30.000> URL<00:00:30.269> here<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.869> various<00:00:31.289> bits<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to this URL here with various bits and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.490 
to this URL here with various bits and
pieces<00:00:31.859> if<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.969> inspect<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.989> element<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
pieces if we inspect this element you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.049 
pieces if we inspect this element you
can<00:00:34.620> automatically<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.760> has<00:00:35.910> been

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
can automatically see this has been

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.660 
can automatically see this has been
generated<00:00:36.600> will<00:00:37.140> generate<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.680> using<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
generated will generate this using the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.090 
generated will generate this using the
Google<00:00:39.180> Earth<00:00:39.270> API<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:40.980> be

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
Google Earth API so this will all be

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.459 
Google Earth API so this will all be
done<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.460> us<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:42.870> complicated<00:00:43.079> as

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
done for us it's not as complicated as

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190 
done for us it's not as complicated as
it<00:00:43.530> looks<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> when<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> click<00:00:45.870> sign-in<00:00:46.110> with

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
it looks so when I click sign-in with

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.760 
it looks so when I click sign-in with
Google<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.920> basically<00:00:47.399> prompted<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.770> accept

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
Google I'm basically prompted to accept

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.880 
Google I'm basically prompted to accept
how<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.940> app<00:00:51.090> once<00:00:51.329> used<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:51.719> details<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
how this app once used my details at the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.200 
how this app once used my details at the
moment<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.340> we're<00:00:53.610> doing<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:54.180> just

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
moment all we're doing is we're just

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750 
moment all we're doing is we're just
reading<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> email<00:00:55.320> address<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.579> there's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
reading the email address so there's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790 
reading the email address so there's
nothing<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.539> much<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.440> here

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
nothing really much going on here

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.229 
nothing really much going on here
if<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.129> hit<00:00:59.280> accept<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
if I hit accept this is going to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.599 
if I hit accept this is going to
redirect<00:01:00.539> us<00:01:00.870> back<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.980> we're<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.190> logged<00:01:02.399> in

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
redirect us back and we're now logged in

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.490 
redirect us back and we're now logged in
simple<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.899> didn't<00:01:04.229> see

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
simple as that and what you didn't see

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
simple as that and what you didn't see
is<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.309> sending<00:01:05.670> back<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> code<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
is this is sending back a code so the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.990 
is this is sending back a code so the
way<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.140> works<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.950> code<00:01:08.369> will<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.640> sent

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
way this works is a code will be sent

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820 
way this works is a code will be sent
back<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:09.840> run<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.260> through<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> Google

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
back we then run that through the Google

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.130 
back we then run that through the Google
Earth<00:01:11.100> API<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.330> will<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.689> AIT's<00:01:12.960> our

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
Earth API and that will think AIT's our

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
Earth API and that will think AIT's our
session<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:13.890> set<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> session<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> we

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
session we can then set a session and we

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.090 
session we can then set a session and we
logged<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.740> isn't<00:01:16.920> that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
logged in it really isn't that

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.920 
logged in it really isn't that
complicated<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.939> all<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.360> has<00:01:18.540> been<00:01:18.720> made

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
complicated at all this has been made

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.679 
complicated at all this has been made
really<00:01:19.619> easy<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:21.030> let's<00:01:21.180> take<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.330> look<00:01:21.450> inside

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
really easy and let's take a look inside

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.170 
really easy and let's take a look inside
of<00:01:21.750> our<00:01:21.900> database<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.650> well<00:01:22.880> because<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.000> have

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
of our database as well because we have

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
of our database as well because we have
this<00:01:24.299> table<00:01:24.630> called<00:01:25.110> Google<00:01:25.560> users<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.820> we

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
this table called Google users so if we

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.280 
this table called Google users so if we
do<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> select<00:01:28.020> everything<00:01:28.619> from<00:01:28.970> Google<00:01:30.290> users

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
do a select everything from Google users

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.899 
do a select everything from Google users
on<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.369> we're<00:01:32.460> storing<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
on this you can see that we're storing a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.810 
on this you can see that we're storing a
Google<00:01:33.240> ID<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.780> an<00:01:34.320> email<00:01:34.560> address<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.579> if

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
Google ID and an email address so if

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.609 
Google ID and an email address so if
you're<00:01:36.000> authenticating<00:01:36.750> users<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.470> your

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you're authenticating users for your

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
you're authenticating users for your
application<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:38.939> might<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.299> into<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
application this lot might go into a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.840 
application this lot might go into a
main<00:01:39.900> users<00:01:40.409> table<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.549> might<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
main users table you might have a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420 
main users table you might have a
separate<00:01:42.299> table<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:43.500> entirely<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.159> you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
separate table it's entirely up to you
