00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.500
 Digital SLRs like these 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.429
 can have great photos and hd videos 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.139
 take up 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.260
 In addition, they have one 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.869
 Timelapse feature a movie is one 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.150
 sequence of individual photos shows 25 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.939
 Recordings per second are generated with it 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.680
 the impression of a flowing movement 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.510
 a timelapse movie is one 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.640
 sequence of photos over one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.080
 longer period and after 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.679
 the recording combined to a movie 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.679
 were 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.579
 with the time lapse technique you can use the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.200
 full range of photographic possibilities 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.090
 use the different ones 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.489
 closing times and iso settings 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.590
 what with the usual film soja 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.730
 is not possible 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.020
 when playing in normal 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.449
 Speed ​​will be the time 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.149
 compressed and slow movements in 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.390
 the motives are made visible 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.390
 follow for example 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.290
 whether day or night city ​​or country man 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.850
 suddenly sees things with others 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.840
 eyes and always discovers new ones 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.509
 options for time-lapse photography 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.100
 it takes time minutes hours days 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.649
 sometimes even longer 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.360
 That's why you should think of a few things 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.970
 to avoid disappointment 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 A sturdy tripod is indispensable 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.440
 but most important is one 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 Remote release with interval functions 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.430
 This device activates the trigger in 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.110
 at certain intervals over one 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.890
 period you for your movie 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.929
 to adjust 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 the attitudes can be the motive 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.179
 adapt and the film you make 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.990
 would like to bring the camera in 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.200
 position 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.360
 here we use the five d-mark 3 and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.280
 the 6d to the film by changing 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.560
 make perspectives more interesting 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.539
 Set the lens to manual 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.759
 focus so that the sharpness between 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.619
 the receptacles are not changed 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.780
 lighting conditions relatively constant 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.119
 put your camera on manually 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.550
 the light should change significantly 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.979
 switch to av or tv to 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.789
 Example of a sunset 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.550
 put the blind on the 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.959
 then the desired depth of a 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.060
 Closing time for the desired 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.410
 sharpness or blur and the iso 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.489
 sensitivity for the right one 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.080
 set the exposure 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.390
 It is worth a few 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.280
 you have to take the test shots 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.890
 You still have to take photos for a movie 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.450
 put together a good one 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.610
 image editing software can 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.230
 process image sequences and with 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.319
 program you can then in movies 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.540
 convert 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.609
 the most important thing is to 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.439
 experiment and have fun 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.439
 There are so many possibilities
