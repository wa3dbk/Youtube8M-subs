out this really cool duel booster pedal

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.620 
out this really cool duel booster pedal
by<00:00:09.809> max<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.800> db10<00:00:11.519> pedal<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.450> is

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
by max on this is the db10 pedal this is

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.810 
by max on this is the db10 pedal this is
basically<00:00:13.019> two<00:00:13.349> independent<00:00:14.250> clean<00:00:14.580> boost

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
basically two independent clean boost

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.720 
basically two independent clean boost
pedals<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.560> get<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> vintage<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.520> a

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
pedals in one so you get a vintage and a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.460 
pedals in one so you get a vintage and a
clean<00:00:18.029> channel<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.600> clean<00:00:18.869> channel<00:00:19.230> keeps

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
clean channel the clean channel keeps

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.529 
clean channel the clean channel keeps
your<00:00:19.650> signal<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.520> was<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.000> makes<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
your signal as it was and just makes it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.230 
your signal as it was and just makes it
much<00:00:21.840> much<00:00:22.170> louder<00:00:22.560> up<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> 30<00:00:23.189> DB<00:00:23.609> which<00:00:23.880> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
much much louder up to 30 DB which is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.779 
much much louder up to 30 DB which is
really<00:00:24.779> loud<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.260> will<00:00:25.619> push<00:00:25.859> an<00:00:26.070> amp<00:00:26.220> over<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
really loud it will push an amp over the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
really loud it will push an amp over the
edge<00:00:27.000> without<00:00:27.810> question<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.769> really

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
edge without question it's it's really

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.700 
edge without question it's it's really
that<00:00:29.429> loud<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.750> vintage<00:00:30.960> channel<00:00:31.529> over

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that loud and the vintage channel over

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.490 
that loud and the vintage channel over
here<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.340> well<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.510> other<00:00:33.540> side<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.290> what

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
here as well on the other side now what

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.720 
here as well on the other side now what
this<00:00:34.680> will<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:34.950> will<00:00:35.130> give<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.340> more<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.550> that

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
this will do will give you more of that

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000 
this will do will give you more of that
vintage<00:00:36.270> sound<00:00:36.750> obviously<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.829> actually

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
vintage sound obviously but it actually

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.619 
vintage sound obviously but it actually
rolls<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:38.879> bit<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> high<00:00:39.390> end

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
rolls out a little bit of the high end

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.180 
rolls out a little bit of the high end
much<00:00:39.870> kind<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.440> how<00:00:40.590> chip<00:00:40.829> screamers

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
much kind of like how chip screamers

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.380 
much kind of like how chip screamers
work<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> tube<00:00:42.120> screamer

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
work but it's not a tube screamer

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
work but it's not a tube screamer
circuit<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.020> simply<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:44.100> volume<00:00:44.430> boost

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
circuit it's simply just a volume boost

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.229 
circuit it's simply just a volume boost
with<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.840> slight<00:00:46.140> EQ<00:00:46.829> curve<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.640> end<00:00:47.879> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
with a slight EQ curve on the end it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.090 
with a slight EQ curve on the end it's
really<00:00:48.510> cool<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.050> thing<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.410> super<00:00:49.770> loud<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
really cool this thing is super loud and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
really cool this thing is super loud and
if<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.520> haven't<00:00:50.760> seen<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> video<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.510> did<00:00:51.780> with

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
will push a tube amp over the edge no

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.150 
will push a tube amp over the edge no
problems<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.050> super<00:01:01.530> loud<00:01:01.680> let's

65 deluxe reverb amplifier at a
relatively<00:01:17.700> low<00:01:17.820> volume<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.900> let's<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.439> what

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
relatively low volume so let's see what

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
relatively low volume so let's see what
the<00:01:19.890> pedal<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:21.180> you've<00:01:21.330> seen<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the pedal can do and if you've seen the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.630 
the pedal can do and if you've seen the
other<00:01:21.689> video<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.110> did<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.530> dr.<00:01:23.159> Rick<00:01:23.340> you'll

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
other video I did with dr. Rick you'll

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520 
other video I did with dr. Rick you'll
know<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.720> get<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
know that this can really get going and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
know that this can really get going and
it<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.280> loud<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:27.030> starting<00:01:27.420> on

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479

the<00:02:04.800> clean<00:02:05.010> side<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.610> pedal<00:02:05.910> is<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.720> fact

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the clean side of this pedal is the fact

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.660 
the clean side of this pedal is the fact
that<00:02:07.050> it<00:02:07.410> doesn't<00:02:07.830> actually<00:02:08.130> affect<00:02:08.430> your

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
that it doesn't actually affect your

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
tone in any way so let's try this let's

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:32.070 
tone in any way so let's try this let's
go<00:02:19.680> ahead<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.980> turn<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.100> up<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.490> more

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.960 

so<00:02:33.080> nice<00:02:33.379> and<00:02:33.620> big<00:02:33.830> nice<00:02:34.129> and<00:02:34.370> round<00:02:34.580> sounding

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
and it's pushing it over the edge

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.130 
and it's pushing it over the edge
already<00:02:36.860> let's<00:02:37.459> go<00:02:37.610> ahead<00:02:37.700> now<00:02:37.970> crank<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.959> up<00:02:39.019> a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
already let's go ahead now crank it up a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:03:02.250 
already let's go ahead now crank it up a
little<00:02:39.260> more<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:48.579> all<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.700> way<00:02:49.790> up

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
so while I'm at room volume if you can

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.940 
so while I'm at room volume if you can
imagine<00:03:05.090> playing<00:03:05.600> with<00:03:05.990> your<00:03:06.110> amp<00:03:06.380> cranked

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
and you hit a pedal like this it's going

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.720 
and you hit a pedal like this it's going
to<00:03:09.290> just<00:03:09.440> push<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.890> right<00:03:10.040> over<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.550> edge<00:03:10.700> for

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
to just push it right over the edge for

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.600 
to just push it right over the edge for
some<00:03:11.630> great<00:03:11.900> amp<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.890> know<00:03:13.040> natural

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
some great amp you know natural

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.790 
some great amp you know natural
overdrive<00:03:14.240> so<00:03:14.600> let's<00:03:14.810> go<00:03:14.930> ahead<00:03:15.050> now<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.590> try

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
overdrive so let's go ahead now and try

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:54.630 
overdrive so let's go ahead now and try
the<00:03:15.860> dual<00:03:16.160> booster<00:03:16.520> with<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.910> max<00:03:17.150> on<00:03:17.330> OD<00:03:17.690> 808

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:11.990 

swith<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.730> off

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.149 

so<00:04:13.000> as<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:13.420> can<00:04:13.599> hear<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.140> really<00:04:14.560> compliments

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
so as you can hear it really compliments

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.860 
so as you can hear it really compliments
an<00:04:15.310> overdrive<00:04:15.760> pedal<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.389> that<00:04:16.630> would<00:04:16.750> work

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
an overdrive pedal and that would work

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.960 
an overdrive pedal and that would work
with<00:04:17.109> any<00:04:17.320> overdrive<00:04:17.769> pedal<00:04:18.100> max<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:18.910> the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
with any overdrive pedal max on the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.159 
with any overdrive pedal max on the
stuff<00:04:19.180> seems<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.570> sound<00:04:19.780> great<00:04:19.989> together

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
stuff seems to sound great together

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.350 
stuff seems to sound great together

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:52.940 

a<00:04:40.490> little<00:04:41.389> bit<00:04:41.479> more

more<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.320> vintage<00:04:56.560> sound<00:04:57.010> so<00:04:57.190> it's

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
more of that vintage sound so it's

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.520 
more of that vintage sound so it's
rolling<00:04:57.760> off<00:04:57.970> a<00:04:58.420> little<00:04:58.630> bit<00:04:58.750> of<00:04:58.840> high<00:04:58.960> end<00:04:59.230> but

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
rolling off a little bit of high end but

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.620 
rolling off a little bit of high end but
what<00:04:59.800> you<00:04:59.920> get<00:05:00.070> in<00:05:00.370> turn<00:05:00.610> is<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.910> really<00:05:01.330> smooth

what you get in turn is a really smooth
sound<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.260> it<00:05:03.100> will<00:05:03.310> work<00:05:03.340> great<00:05:04.000> for

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
sound so it will work great for

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.730 
sound so it will work great for
