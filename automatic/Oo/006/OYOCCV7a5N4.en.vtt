00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.170 

but<00:00:11.230> it's<00:00:11.380> slower<00:00:11.710> than<00:00:12.010> Western<00:00:12.460> it's<00:00:12.820> slower

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
but it's slower than Western it's slower

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.470 
but it's slower than Western it's slower
than<00:00:13.450> just<00:00:13.660> taking<00:00:13.809> a<00:00:14.170> pill<00:00:14.410> and<00:00:15.480> surpassing

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
than just taking a pill and surpassing

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.230 
than just taking a pill and surpassing
it<00:00:16.660> so<00:00:17.320> you<00:00:17.380> have<00:00:17.619> to<00:00:17.800> come<00:00:17.980> in<00:00:18.250> for<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:18.580> while<00:00:18.880> to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
it so you have to come in for a while to

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.750 
it so you have to come in for a while to
be<00:00:19.390> able<00:00:19.660> to<00:00:19.779> redirect<00:00:20.200> the<00:00:21.070> energy<00:00:21.099> and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
be able to redirect the energy and

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.990 
be able to redirect the energy and
rebalance<00:00:22.480> and<00:00:22.689> that<00:00:23.320> takes<00:00:23.650> a<00:00:24.009> period<00:00:24.970> of

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
rebalance and that takes a period of

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.240 
rebalance and that takes a period of
time<00:00:25.150> what<00:00:25.810> I<00:00:25.840> understand<00:00:26.470> because<00:00:26.619> of<00:00:26.920> what

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
time what I understand because of what

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.660 
time what I understand because of what
you<00:00:27.400> just<00:00:27.430> said<00:00:27.820> if<00:00:28.630> any<00:00:29.380> problem<00:00:29.859> emotionally

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
you just said if any problem emotionally

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.470 
you just said if any problem emotionally
spiritual<00:00:31.539> physical<00:00:31.869> takes<00:00:32.500> time<00:00:33.100> to<00:00:33.340> develop

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
spiritual physical takes time to develop

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.990 
spiritual physical takes time to develop
yes<00:00:34.480> so<00:00:34.809> it's<00:00:35.019> a<00:00:35.170> kind<00:00:35.379> of<00:00:35.559> silly<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:36.220> pretend

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
yes so it's a kind of silly to pretend

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.299 
yes so it's a kind of silly to pretend
to<00:00:37.570> like<00:00:37.600> it<00:00:37.840> doesn't<00:00:38.260> show<00:00:38.350> it<00:00:38.500> overnight<00:00:38.890> yes

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
to like it doesn't show it overnight yes

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.210 
to like it doesn't show it overnight yes
so<00:00:39.550> that's<00:00:39.760> why<00:00:39.940> you<00:00:39.970> need<00:00:40.449> it<00:00:41.199> is<00:00:41.860> time<00:00:42.190> to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
so that's why you need it is time to

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.540 
so that's why you need it is time to
forget<00:00:42.729> it<00:00:43.449> see<00:00:43.629> that<00:00:43.809> two<00:00:44.199> people<00:00:44.440> have<00:00:45.100> same

do people need different things or
longer<00:00:54.610> period<00:00:55.089> of<00:00:55.210> treatment<00:00:55.390> and<00:00:55.839> they<00:00:56.620> are

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
longer period of treatment and they are

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.009 
longer period of treatment and they are
different<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:58.120> people<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.540> same<00:00:58.720> sometimes

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019

yes<00:00:59.680> one<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.430> going<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.790> act<00:01:01.449> very<00:01:01.900> quickly<00:01:02.260> to

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
yes one is going to act very quickly to

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.369 
yes one is going to act very quickly to
acupuncture<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.729> one<00:01:04.089> is<00:01:04.239> not<00:01:04.479> at<00:01:04.750> all<00:01:04.960> and

acupuncture and one is not at all and

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.580 
acupuncture and one is not at all and
the<00:01:05.560> reason<00:01:05.770> for<00:01:06.190> that<00:01:06.490> is<00:01:06.970> because<00:01:07.360> one<00:01:08.350> is

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
the reason for that is because one is

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.430 
the reason for that is because one is
ready<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:09.070> make<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.369> changes<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.229> ready

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
on the resistance they could be very

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.550 
on the resistance they could be very
spiritual<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:36.909> very<00:01:37.719> open<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.170> everything

but then they still have a lot of

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.910 
but then they still have a lot of
resistance<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.899> are<00:01:41.020> not<00:01:41.229> ready<00:01:41.469> to<00:01:41.649> look<00:01:41.829> at

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
resistance and are not ready to look at

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
reacts very quickly to it but usually

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.350

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
to the same kind of pattern of thinking

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.530 
to the same kind of pattern of thinking
because<00:03:45.370> we're<00:03:45.549> actually<00:03:45.699> moving<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.359> from

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
one pattern to a more open pattern it's

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.300 
one pattern to a more open pattern it's
like<00:03:50.079> some<00:03:50.260> people<00:03:50.530> come<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:50.859> and<00:03:50.979> they<00:03:51.069> could

little<00:03:56.199> bit<00:03:56.590> more<00:03:56.919> and<00:03:57.629> opens<00:03:58.629> up<00:03:59.250> mostly<00:04:00.250> it's

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
little bit more and opens up mostly it's

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.649 
little bit more and opens up mostly it's
all<00:04:00.790> about<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:02.739> thought<00:04:02.949> patterns<00:04:03.419> good<00:04:04.419> burn
