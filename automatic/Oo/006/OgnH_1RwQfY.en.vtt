 Hi everyone I am rockets in this 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.179
 video I will show you how to make these 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.779
 super pucciosi Christmas nails with 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:23.840
 rudolph the red-nosed reindeer that 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:28.210
 what you need is a wood or base with lo 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:32.569
 white enamel a light brown enamel 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:39.889
 a red nail polish and a brown nail polish 

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:43.719
 dark with the brush up or a 

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:46.639
 indelible brown and let's start 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.449
 first we apply the peach on 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:50.799
 all the rage 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.799
 let's wait for it to dry 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.750
 then we take the white enamel and it 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.640
 we feel on all nails then 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.670
 wait for this to dry as well 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670
 completely 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.659
 then we take brown enamel 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.610
 clear to make the rudolf facet e 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.659
 what we need to do is a small square 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.680
 in the middle of the nail like this and then 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.119
 add an orecchiette here 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.119
 an orecchietta from there 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.030
 and we repeat on all the nails 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.390
 then we take the dark brown enamel or 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.519
 the indelible brown and make two 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.519
 so diagonal lines 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.680
 and then we add two small arms 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.980
 how to draw a chicken foot 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.530
 one from here and one from there and voila 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.150
 we made the horns of the arena 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.520
 and then we review on other obvious like 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.490
 see you need some space beyond the 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.410
 reindeer head so remember to 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.060
 leave it when you first do the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.709
 small square with clear mark enamel 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.360
 moreover it is fine if the horns come 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.400
 a little different from each other 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.140
 because even in nature I am not 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.140
 perfectly symmetrical 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.010
 then with red enamel 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.010
 add the nose and as you can see is 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.010
 easy 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.980
 final step the little eyes you can 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.210
 do with dark brown enamel or with 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.210
 an indelible brown black 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:53.000
 and this is the final result 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.969
 if you make them pay me on instagram 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.050

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:05.969
 zeros 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.039
