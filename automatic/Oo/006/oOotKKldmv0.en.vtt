00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.160
 nice guys here sector and welcome back 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 seen committing on black ops two for 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.780
 accuracy this is the first commit 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.550
 of this new year of this 2013 and me 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.230
 sorry if I failed to report 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.460
 a video on the channel where in fact the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.619
 wishes you a happy new year 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.960
 only that time was reduced on 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 time was poor so I'm not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.830
 managed to find those five ten 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.170
 minutes to dedicate to the channel and today 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.090
 precisely even if they are a little late 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.670
 here to wish you a happy new year a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 happy 2013 i hope i can give you 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.550
 all the happiness of the world but 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 especially the whole pussy of the world that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.219
 sincerely puts I think it's the thing 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 However, all of us are more interested in a 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.100
 part jokes 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.559
 before starting I had a moment 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.960
 inform you that unboxing unfortunately does not 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.000
 will be uploaded to the channel because it is a 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.739
 couple of days ago I was forced to 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.469
 format my computer and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.059
 consequently all do all the data are 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.949
 be blessed though 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.899
 fortunately I managed to 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.090
 recover some moderated fashions between three 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.710
 since I had built them on 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.899
 key for the rest as already reiterated 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.400
 that has erased everything 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.580
 so today I'm here to offer you 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.439
 this double chalmer made with mass 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.689
 and media ac evening with the senator e 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.159
 quick charger a combination of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.439
 very valid accessories that deserves 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 very much indeed if you haven't yet 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.820
 proven given a chance why 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.680
 precisely splits and pro a moment talking 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.360
 of serious things guys I don't know if you have 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.530
 already done chaos if you've already noticed but 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.750
 I guess so 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.060
 this game played on on xbox 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.680
 360 was in fact the theme on which 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.170
 the unboxing had to go on being based however 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.479
 go well this details this console e 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.369
 I received it as a gift for Christmas and 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.470
 as you know, however, I have always had 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.000
 passion 3 so now i care about 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.350
 specify that I have neither sold the dates 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.200
 absolutely borrow the play 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.880
 still nutty but I'll be honest in the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.619
 say that from now on most 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.950
 some of the time they spend on this 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.420
 new console is also why anyway 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.340
 there are also various youtuber so I will have 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.000
 also a way to make greenhouses with them 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.369
 in fact we are already organizing 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 a little bit now I don't want to tell you 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.329
 nothing not to anticipate anything pro maybe 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.890
 if you have ideas to give us e 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.049
 report the episode in the comments that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.140
 however they can always be useful 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.700
 important and on the pay guys 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.540
 don't worry maybe I'll come back 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.799
 maybe one day I'll wake up saying 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.530
 today I want you I want to go back to play 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.760
 I'll be back with the psn doctors 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.560
 I absolutely do not exclude this 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.019
 possibility for god's sake 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.709
 however still being gal being 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.959
 a new thing 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.060
 I think it's also a foregone thing that gives 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.469
 now I'll spend more time on xbox 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.510
 also because I am very happy with it 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.739
 there are some fantastic people too 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.689
 on the central plague for god's sake 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.950
 pro new people so I'm doing 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.510
 even new friendships are really 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.189
 satisfied 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.379
 now I would not like these circumstances 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.269
 maybe they came to create a war 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.549
 between consoles as is usual in these 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.530
 opportunities for however not why not 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.750
 go guys absolutely but but why 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.280
 I find it a stupid thing to do 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.870
 children with this to say better 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.329
 This compared to this console 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.220
 certain reasons now drink I believe that 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.560
 everyone has their own each there 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.510
 do your own opinions and then me 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.370
 I ask this not a star here 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.930
 maybe offend certain things or 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.519
 certain people only because 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.040
 they pass from one side to the other all here 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.900
 I did not go either on xbox in the super 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.629
 show trash or both so I do not 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.159
 this is an absolutely pro problem 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.450
 before the video finishes guys 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.400
 I wanted the moment to inform you of something 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.489
 important is that this 2013 for me 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.699
 really starts with the best foot 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.949
 because I can finally tell you later 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.780
 so long that jinba network accepted 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.669
 my video or better my if areas that 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.769
 I will propose on that channel I really am 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.239
 satisfied because anyway I have it 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.989
 worked really hard he spent 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.919
 a lot of time and I have to say anyway 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.000
 which is a kind of how to say of 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.470
 thanks for what I did 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.690
 because in any case we expect so much 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.430
 time and I'll be honest to tell you that 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.799
 however on that channel there are gods 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.940
 video with a certain base of the 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.669
 gameplay that have a base in 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.930
 substrate already developed with a 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.220
 a little bit more so here I am 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.129
 really satisfied that they have me 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.169
 accepted that video and now I wo n't tell you 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.180
 what of that will treat that series 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.129
 maybe when the video comes out there 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.599
 I will communicate both on the facebook page and 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.759
 anyway here on the channel I'll tell you 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.349
 no guys anyway if you have any 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.790
 questions if you have any concerns 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.379
 doubts to ask write below in 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.079
 comments that I will answer to you 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.759
 however this swarm does not know how to do 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.769
 all the vast things he had to do because 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.950
 yemen being himself is a perth map though 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.120
 however having so many houses then how 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.220
 you will also see during the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.930
 in the first round most of the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.360
 team not to say almost everything has 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.860
 then pointed or disgraced we said one 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.900
 swarm though I hope this anyway 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.430
 gameplay that I can hopefully hope so 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.740
 up and maybe soon there 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.120
 I will also bring more beautiful gameplay and 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.470
 nothing we feel like working at 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.479
 next gameplay I wish you one again 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.479
 good 2013 and nothing hello champions
