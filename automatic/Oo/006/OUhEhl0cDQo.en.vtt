00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
2ds review alright so the very first

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
2ds review alright so the very first
thing<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.510> want<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> talk<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.320> screen

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
thing I want to talk about is the screen

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.240 
thing I want to talk about is the screen
now<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.730> doesn't<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.180> 3d<00:00:36.719> hence<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.530> 2ds<00:00:37.890> name

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
now it doesn't do 3d hence the 2ds name

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.340 
now it doesn't do 3d hence the 2ds name
but<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> exact<00:00:39.420> same<00:00:39.660> size<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
but it is the exact same size as the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.459 
but it is the exact same size as the
other<00:00:40.680> 3ds<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.670> too<00:00:41.820> 3dsxl<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> 3ds

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
other 3ds not too 3dsxl but just the 3ds

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.560 
other 3ds not too 3dsxl but just the 3ds
so<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.670> doesn't<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> plus<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so this really doesn't get a plus or a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
so this really doesn't get a plus or a
minus<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> review<00:00:46.500> category<00:00:47.039> as<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.399> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
minus in the review category as it is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.970 
minus in the review category as it is
just<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.059> exact<00:00:48.329> same<00:00:48.510> screen<00:00:48.870> minus<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> 3d

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
just the exact same screen minus the 3d

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.619 
just the exact same screen minus the 3d
now<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> second<00:00:51.000> thing<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.420> talk

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.750

about is the comfort of this device as
it<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:55.020> different<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.610> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it is a little bit different now it is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.430 
it is a little bit different now it is
kind<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.210> weird<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.750> pick<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.289> for

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
kind of weird when you pick it up for

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.529 
kind of weird when you pick it up for
the<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.710> first<00:00:58.920> time<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.969> odd<00:01:00.210> in

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the very first time it's a little odd in

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479 
the very first time it's a little odd in
your<00:01:00.660> hand<00:01:00.930> takes<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.829> second<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> figure<00:01:02.280> out

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
your hand takes a second to figure out

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
your hand takes a second to figure out
exactly<00:01:02.910> how<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.149> want<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.539> hold<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> thing

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
exactly how you want to hold the thing

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
exactly how you want to hold the thing
and<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:05.220> check<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> back<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.420> is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and you check out the back and there is

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
and you check out the back and there is
no<00:01:06.799> triggers<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:07.920> anything<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> put<00:01:08.580> your
