come to get a great research experience

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.630 
come to get a great research experience
a<00:02:01.630> great<00:02:01.840> training<00:02:02.229> experience<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:03.009> great

a great training experience a great

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.460 
a great training experience a great
exposure<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.299> clinical<00:02:04.689> medicine<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:05.350> know

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
exposure to clinical medicine you know

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.490 
exposure to clinical medicine you know
to<00:02:05.530> really<00:02:06.040> do<00:02:06.610> incredibly<00:02:07.420> well<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:08.019> get<00:02:08.350> the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
to really do incredibly well and get the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.259 
to really do incredibly well and get the
highest<00:02:08.709> grade<00:02:08.890> possible<00:02:09.519> during<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.850> clinical

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
highest grade possible during a clinical

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.340 
highest grade possible during a clinical
training<00:02:10.450> they<00:02:10.690> expect<00:02:11.079> you<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.260> be

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
training they expect you to be

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.199 
training they expect you to be
functioning<00:02:12.010> at<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.250> level<00:02:12.579> of<00:02:12.670> an<00:02:12.820> intern

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
functioning at the level of an intern

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.449 
functioning at the level of an intern
and<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:14.200> think<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.590> says<00:02:14.799> a<00:02:14.829> lot<00:02:15.100> about<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and I think that says a lot about the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.550 
and I think that says a lot about the
school<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.150> how<00:02:16.600> they<00:02:16.750> want<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.049> functioning

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
school and how they want you functioning

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.110 
school and how they want you functioning
clinically<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.430> also<00:02:18.579> gives<00:02:18.910> us<00:02:18.970> an

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
clinically it also gives us an

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.850 
clinically it also gives us an
opportunity<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.660> do<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> lot<00:02:20.079> of<00:02:20.140> research<00:02:20.680> in

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
opportunity to do a lot of research in

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.590 
opportunity to do a lot of research in
the<00:02:20.920> fourth<00:02:21.160> year<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.060> was<00:02:22.299> able<00:02:22.570> to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
the fourth year and so I was able to

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.960 
the fourth year and so I was able to
conceive<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.799> project<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.519> started<00:02:24.730> with

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
conceive of a project that started with

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.240 
conceive of a project that started with
a<00:02:25.030> patient<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.630> saw<00:02:25.840> during<00:02:26.500> my<00:02:26.620> ophthalmology

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
a patient I saw during my ophthalmology

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.420 
a patient I saw during my ophthalmology
rotation<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.530> develop<00:02:29.530> basically<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.250> new

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
rotation and develop basically a new

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.420 
rotation and develop basically a new
model<00:02:30.790> system<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.180> help<00:02:31.989> characterize<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
model system to help characterize the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.530 
model system to help characterize the
type<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.640> disease<00:02:34.030> at<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.300> particular

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
type of disease at this particular

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.680 
type of disease at this particular
patient<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.830> clinical<00:02:36.040> training<00:02:36.459> in<00:02:36.790> for

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
because this is one of the best

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.449 
because this is one of the best
pediatric<00:02:55.810> programs<00:02:56.379> in<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.980> world<00:02:57.190> so

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
pediatric programs in the world so

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.400 
pediatric programs in the world so
people<00:02:57.489> want<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.120> come<00:02:58.360> here<00:02:58.750> one<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
people want to come here one of the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.670 
people want to come here one of the
feedback<00:03:00.060> pieces<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.300> get<00:03:01.720> over<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.500> over

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
feedback pieces that I get over and over

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.589 
feedback pieces that I get over and over
again<00:03:02.769> as<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.160> travel<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.580> country<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:04.269> that

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
again as I travel the country is that

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.979 
again as I travel the country is that
our<00:03:05.040> students<00:03:06.040> are<00:03:06.640> better<00:03:06.970> prepared<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.840> go

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
our students are better prepared to go

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.250 
our students are better prepared to go
into<00:03:08.170> residency<00:03:08.950> than<00:03:09.840> many<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.080> other

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
into residency than many of the other

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.320 
into residency than many of the other
colleges<00:03:12.069> of<00:03:12.190> medicine<00:03:12.550> around<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.910> country

colleges of medicine around the country

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.660 
colleges of medicine around the country
I<00:03:13.450> think<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:13.959> really<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.680> evident<00:03:15.190> by<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
I think that really is evident by the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.520 
I think that really is evident by the
fact<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.180> our<00:03:16.300> students<00:03:16.959> match<00:03:17.170> with<00:03:17.410> the

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
fact that our students match with the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.890 
fact that our students match with the
best<00:03:17.739> residences<00:03:18.459> across<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:19.060> nation<00:03:19.540> we

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
best residences across the nation we

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.670 
best residences across the nation we
absolutely<00:03:20.319> need<00:03:20.950> physician<00:03:21.610> scientists<00:03:22.269> who

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
absolutely need physician scientists who

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.949 
absolutely need physician scientists who
understand<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.010> see<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.730> daily<00:03:25.120> problems

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
understand and see the daily problems

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.500 
understand and see the daily problems
and<00:03:26.230> at<00:03:26.409> the<00:03:26.530> bedside<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:27.580> also<00:03:28.030> understand

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
and at the bedside but also understand

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.420 
and at the bedside but also understand
this<00:03:28.690> incredible<00:03:29.290> flow<00:03:29.530> of<00:03:29.739> knowledge<00:03:29.950> and

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
this incredible flow of knowledge and

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.880 
this incredible flow of knowledge and
technology<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.659> that<00:03:31.690> we<00:03:31.840> can<00:03:32.200> bridge<00:03:32.470> and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
technology so that we can bridge and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.729 
technology so that we can bridge and
take<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.730> technology<00:03:34.390> not<00:03:34.810> just<00:03:35.200> for

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
take that technology not just for

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.440 
take that technology not just for
elegant<00:03:36.159> papers<00:03:36.519> that<00:03:36.760> we<00:03:36.879> are<00:03:37.000> reading<00:03:37.150> in
