00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.670
 decisive platform of the future 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.350
 they did not react so enthusiastically 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.939
 several kickstarter supporters 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.130
 the message on the side of the project 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.969
 You could get a lot of negative comments like 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.710
 read this 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.539
 i have the concept in hope 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.079
 supported that they have something wonderful 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.670
 create 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.499
 Unfortunately, they are just wonderful 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.869
 made rich and also minecraft 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.889
 Amused made after the announcement of the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.299
 deals directly with the 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.340
 Personal facebook pretty scary 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.289
 it should not be minecraft 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.359
 give version for cars right 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.219
 By the way, the stock exchange also reacted quite well 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.689
 fast the share price of facebook 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.499
 be shortly after the announcement of the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.209
 takeover by seven percent learning the 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.920
 man had the studio oddworld contains 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.259
 ins has this week in the course of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.719
 interviews to the new location news see 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.369
 let off a lot of steam 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.170
 On the question of whether we in principle 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.940
 a cooperation with big ones 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.979
 publishers in question would he gave 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.080
 opposite how the tears flowed 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.880
 few memorable words to protocol 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.260
 shit on the business i want in 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.459
 no longer participate in this business 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.870
 You can only lose 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.430
 I would rather develop the game 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.110
 give up completely before I'm a bitch 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.640
 his stock company will go into 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.459
 Its shareholders are more important than 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.110
 its customer since ended up being far 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.060
 not finished yet , he lay down 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.340
 grossly beyond the usual release 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.450
 practices from publisher on and had it 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.830
 in particular on ea and the in 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.959
 autumn published battlefield 4 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.340
 Apart from why can Battlefield 4 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.379
 the developer team even out there 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.000
 must have written down yet 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.950
 the system clearly knew that the title 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.150
 but not ready for it but then 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.830
 Has anyone decided that 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.050
 shareholders are more important than the customers 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.519
 how can something just mess up how can 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.840
 it's so easy to take a dante piece of jewelry 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.680
 and then it totally gets dirty on the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.989
 market 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.790
 who now asks why lining 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.560
 just with publisher ea so hard 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.170
 The court goes into his 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.390
 past found the 2005 was of the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.799
 Worlds Rangers was in his time 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.959
 namely expelled from here 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.510
 Manning had ea sabotage at the time 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.590
 accused of play 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.690

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.079
 catch up 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.510
 you will find the link in the description 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.799
 in pixels, new york becomes retro 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.690
 attacked game characters 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.610
 an idea which now has the attention of 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.290
 Hollywood has already aroused in the summer 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.630
 This year, the concept should be out 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.079
 pixels adapted for the big screen 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.670
 become 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.049
 if you have the intended 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.280
 actor might like, however 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.709
 be a matter of taste 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.750
 adam sandler kevin james and jazz cats 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.920
 should stand in the main roles 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.410

 week a very good start to the sales 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.590
 that more parts in the popular 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.450

 he does not necessarily see it as developed 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.960
 curse because the concert of infamous 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.090
 many possibilities left open 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.650
 According to fox could future parts of the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.930
 playstation exclusive gimmicks 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.610
 other time periods play similar to the

 changing setting of the assassin's creed 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.250

 He could become spiritual follower 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.850
 imagine against connections he of the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.280
 a platform 1 and a bioshock 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.750
 infinite without directly match the story 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.880
 continue the predecessor 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.490
 an internal one in a ninja samurai or 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.630
 pfizer thinks is not unthinkable 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.630
