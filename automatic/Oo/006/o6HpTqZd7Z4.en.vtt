00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
you want to think about and I see your

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.170 
you want to think about and I see your
curve<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.560> little<00:01:21.800> bit<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:21.980> same<00:01:22.160> as<00:01:22.340> mine<00:01:22.520> a

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
curve is a little bit the same as mine a

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.900 
curve is a little bit the same as mine a
little<00:01:23.840> bit<00:01:23.930> of<00:01:24.020> tone<00:01:24.200> curve<00:01:24.410> so<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:25.490> can<00:01:25.640> use

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
little bit of tone curve so you can use

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.630 
little bit of tone curve so you can use
you<00:01:26.420> can<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.990> once<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.800> get<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.250> drag

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
you can you once you get you so you drag

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.670 
you can you once you get you so you drag
the<00:01:28.790> pocket<00:01:29.150> in<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.900> little<00:01:30.260> bit<00:01:30.380> from<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
the pocket in a little bit from the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.400 
the pocket in a little bit from the
outside<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.310> we're<00:01:32.210> going<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:32.900> got<00:01:33.080> that

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
outside and we're going to it got that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.110 
outside and we're going to it got that
pops<00:01:33.710> momentum<00:01:34.250> it's<00:01:34.430> going<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.640> help<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:34.970> get

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
pops momentum it's going to help you get

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.210 
pops momentum it's going to help you get
a<00:01:35.330> good<00:01:35.630> release<00:01:35.960> ack<00:01:36.320> ack<00:01:36.530> bus<00:01:36.830> is<00:01:36.980> going<00:01:37.130> to

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
a good release ack ack bus is going to

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.650 
a good release ack ack bus is going to
make<00:01:37.340> them<00:01:37.460> much<00:01:37.880> harder<00:01:38.210> for<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.450> goalie

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
make them much harder for the goalie

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.350 
make them much harder for the goalie
when<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.200> change<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.620> angle<00:01:40.150> from<00:01:41.150> out<00:01:41.330> here

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
when you change the angle from out here

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.480 
when you change the angle from out here
in<00:01:41.690> here<00:01:41.960> it's<00:01:42.560> already<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.010> big<00:01:43.160> difference

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
in here it's already a big difference

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.650 
in here it's already a big difference
for<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.700> goalie<00:01:43.910> and<00:01:44.120> he's<00:01:44.270> going<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.450> have<00:01:44.630> to

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
for the goalie and he's going to have to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.360 
for the goalie and he's going to have to
move<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.200> it's<00:01:45.350> going<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.590> be<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:46.250> your

advantage big time so think about having
the<00:01:48.530> puck<00:01:48.800> close<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.190> your<00:01:49.310> body<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:51.100> once

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
the puck close to your body and once

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.830 
the puck close to your body and once

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
once you have the puck where you want it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.150 
once you have the puck where you want it
you<00:01:54.590> look<00:01:54.830> at<00:01:54.980> your<00:01:55.100> target<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:56.830> aim<00:01:57.830> and

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
you look at your target and you aim and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:07.250 
you look at your target and you aim and
