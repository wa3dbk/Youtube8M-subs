we<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.830> CCM<00:00:26.279> speed<00:00:26.609> blade<00:00:26.820> stainless

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we do have the CCM speed blade stainless

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.179 
we do have the CCM speed blade stainless
steel<00:00:27.480> runners<00:00:27.720> now<00:00:28.590> these<00:00:28.890> are<00:00:29.010> all

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
steel runners now these are all

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.950 
steel runners now these are all
connected<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> big<00:00:30.269> upgrade<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.840> we

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
connected to a big upgrade that we

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.229 
connected to a big upgrade that we
didn't<00:00:31.199> see<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> 5052<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
didn't see in the 5052 this is the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.350 
didn't see in the 5052 this is the
carbon<00:00:33.600> fiber<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> fiberglass<00:00:34.820> outsole<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
carbon fiber and fiberglass outsole so

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
carbon fiber and fiberglass outsole so
it's<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.899> much<00:00:37.290> more<00:00:37.500> stiff<00:00:37.829> much

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it's going to be much more stiff much

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.190 
it's going to be much more stiff much
more<00:00:38.430> rigid<00:00:39.180> than<00:00:39.390> what<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.719> saw<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.079> those

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
more rigid than what we saw in those

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.619 
more rigid than what we saw in those
5050<00:00:40.860> twos<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.790> gives<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.090> more<00:00:42.329> power

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
5050 twos so that gives you more power

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.869 
5050 twos so that gives you more power
and<00:00:42.960> better<00:00:43.020> energy<00:00:43.440> transfer<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.640> also

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and better energy transfer it's also

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.060 
and better energy transfer it's also
going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.390> lighter<00:00:45.660> weight<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> bottom

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
going to be lighter weight at the bottom

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.830 
going to be lighter weight at the bottom
they<00:00:47.219> did<00:00:47.370> include<00:00:47.640> some<00:00:47.850> exhaust<00:00:48.210> holes<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
they did include some exhaust holes so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.690 
they did include some exhaust holes so
this<00:00:48.989> allows<00:00:49.289> moisture<00:00:49.770> escape<00:00:50.340> out<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
this allows moisture escape out of the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.549 
this allows moisture escape out of the
bottom<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> boot<00:00:51.420> decreasing<00:00:52.320> drying

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
bottom of the boot decreasing drying

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.930 
bottom of the boot decreasing drying
time<00:00:52.800> once<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> get<00:00:53.250> done<00:00:53.370> playing<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
time once you get done playing but it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.850 
time once you get done playing but it
also<00:00:54.059> keeps<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.600> feet<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.500> bit<00:00:55.620> drier

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
also keeps your feet a little bit drier

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.830 
also keeps your feet a little bit drier
while<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.219> playing<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> game<00:00:56.780> getting<00:00:57.780> in

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
while you're playing the game getting in

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
while you're playing the game getting in

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.770 
deep in there it's not gonna be sliding
out<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:11.489> take<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> look<00:03:11.970> at<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> footbed<00:03:12.510> and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
out so take a look at the footbed and

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.970 
out so take a look at the footbed and
this<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.019> what<00:03:13.140> they<00:03:13.230> call<00:03:13.409> their<00:03:13.560> fit<00:03:13.769> system

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
this is what they call their fit system

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.580 
this is what they call their fit system
footbed<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.730> has<00:03:15.150> some<00:03:15.690> perforation<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
footbed it has some perforation to the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.349 
footbed it has some perforation to the
center<00:03:16.920> here<00:03:17.129> so<00:03:17.159> like<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:18.000> saw<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.299> that

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
center here so like we saw in that

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.449 
center here so like we saw in that
outsole<00:03:18.959> it's<00:03:19.290> gonna<00:03:19.380> allow<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.739> moisture

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
outsole it's gonna allow the moisture

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.159 
outsole it's gonna allow the moisture
and<00:03:20.819> sweat<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.120> travels<00:03:21.599> through<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> footbed

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
and sweat to travels through the footbed

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.830 
and sweat to travels through the footbed
and<00:03:22.410> out<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.889> bottom<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> boot<00:03:23.549> now<00:03:24.540> going

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
and out the bottom of the boot now going

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.909 
and out the bottom of the boot now going
to<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> overall<00:03:25.319> fit<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.680> skate

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
to the overall fit of the skate

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.589 
to the overall fit of the skate
generally<00:03:26.639> speaking<00:03:27.000> it's<00:03:27.209> going<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.419> have<00:03:27.569> a

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
generally speaking it's going to have a

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.720 
generally speaking it's going to have a
medium<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.139> high<00:03:28.290> volume<00:03:28.349> fit<00:03:28.889> in<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.489> toe<00:03:29.700> box

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
medium to high volume fit in the toe box

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.000 
medium to high volume fit in the toe box
across<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.599> top<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.959> forefoot<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:31.410> in

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
across the top of the forefoot and in

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.740 
across the top of the forefoot and in
that<00:03:32.190> heel<00:03:32.370> pocket<00:03:32.639> so<00:03:33.090> it's<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.359> medium

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
that heel pocket so it's that medium

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.050 
that heel pocket so it's that medium
average<00:03:34.260> type<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.799> fit<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.400> then<00:03:35.700> compared

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
average type of a fit and then compared

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.089 
average type of a fit and then compared
to<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.269> our<00:03:36.419> Musil<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:36.959> it's<00:03:37.590> gonna<00:03:37.769> have<00:03:38.069> a

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
to that our Musil on it's gonna have a

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.190 
to that our Musil on it's gonna have a
more<00:03:38.700> narrower<00:03:39.000> fit<00:03:39.359> in<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.750> forefoot<00:03:40.139> area

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
more narrower fit in the forefoot area

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.990 
more narrower fit in the forefoot area
it's<00:03:40.889> also<00:03:41.040> going<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.250> fit<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.489> little<00:03:41.849> more

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
it's also going to fit a little more

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.119 
it's also going to fit a little more
anatomically<00:03:42.660> as<00:03:42.840> well<00:03:43.049> so<00:03:43.530> for<00:03:43.739> even<00:03:43.889> more

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
anatomically as well so for even more
