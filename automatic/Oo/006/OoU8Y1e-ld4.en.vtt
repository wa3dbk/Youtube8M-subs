00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.380 
the red mixture into the mini angel food
pan<00:01:58.070> make<00:01:59.070> sure<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.369> next<00:01:59.580> color<00:01:59.880> does<00:02:00.180> not

would<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.259> pipe<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.860> mixture<00:02:05.280> into<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
would just pipe the mixture into the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.029 
would just pipe the mixture into the
mini<00:02:06.060> angel<00:02:06.509> food<00:02:06.630> pan<00:02:06.900> instead<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
mini angel food pan instead so the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:21.979 
mini angel food pan instead so the
