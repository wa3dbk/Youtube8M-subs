that<00:01:14.610> these<00:01:14.910> guys<00:01:15.150> were<00:01:15.480> kind<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> first

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that these guys were kind of the first

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.020 
that these guys were kind of the first
people<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.520> we're<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.760> to<00:01:17.850> take

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
people to do that so we're going to take

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
people to do that so we're going to take
it<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.660> to<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.080> bottom<00:01:19.260> and<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:20.550> how

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it all the way to the bottom and see how

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
it all the way to the bottom and see how
low<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.120> go<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.540> percent<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.560> that's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
low we can go at one percent so that's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.230 
low we can go at one percent so that's
kind<00:01:22.980> of<00:01:23.040> what<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.280> looks<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.850> its<00:01:24.000> lowest

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
kind of what it looks like at its lowest

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.480 
kind of what it looks like at its lowest
level<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.500> both<00:01:25.710> still<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.160> at<00:01:26.370> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
level they are both still on at this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.240 
level they are both still on at this
point<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.910> aura<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:28.070> doesn't<00:01:29.070> come

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
point and that aura is it doesn't come

up here the lights kind of harsh where

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.010 
up here the lights kind of harsh where
the<00:01:56.850> lights<00:01:57.060> kind<00:01:57.300> of<00:01:57.390> coming<00:01:57.660> out<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the lights kind of coming out of the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
bezel but on the Kobo aura it's very

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.860 
bezel but on the Kobo aura it's very
consistent<00:02:01.260> there's<00:02:01.770> no<00:02:02.070> splashing<00:02:02.970> there's

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
consistent there's no splashing there's

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.050

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
it's a very consistent white glow yeah I

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.690 
it's a very consistent white glow yeah I
mean<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.720> think<00:02:09.959> one<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.710> big<00:02:10.920> reasons<00:02:10.950> why

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
mean I think one of the big reasons why

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.020 
mean I think one of the big reasons why
the<00:02:11.760> Kobo<00:02:12.540> aura<00:02:12.930> HD<00:02:13.650> looks<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.610> little<00:02:14.820> bit

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
the Kobo aura HD looks a little bit

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.740 
the Kobo aura HD looks a little bit
cleaner

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
cleaner

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.620 
cleaner
in<00:02:15.810> terms<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.640> white<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.300> how<00:02:18.450> it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
in terms of the the white and how it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.330 
in terms of the the white and how it
looks<00:02:18.870> way<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.590> doesn't<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:19.950> any<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.250> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
looks way and it doesn't have any of the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.130 
looks way and it doesn't have any of the
discoloration<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.300> when<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.780> look<00:02:21.960> in<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
discoloration is when you look in the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.450 
discoloration is when you look in the
Nook<00:02:22.290> menu<00:02:22.620> there's<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> lot<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.130> black

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
Nook menu there's a lot of black

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.930 
Nook menu there's a lot of black
happening<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.840> top<00:02:25.140> bar<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.670> UI

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
happening the top bar a lot of the UI

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.600 
happening the top bar a lot of the UI
elements<00:02:27.750> they're<00:02:27.930> all<00:02:28.050> black<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.130> you

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
elements they're all black and so you

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.449 
elements they're all black and so you
kind<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.940> see<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.870> discoloration<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:32.340> a

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
kind of see that discoloration it's a

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.850 
kind of see that discoloration it's a
little<00:02:32.730> bit<00:02:32.880> more<00:02:33.030> evident<00:02:33.510> whereas<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.500> Kobo

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
little bit more evident whereas the Kobo

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.699 
little bit more evident whereas the Kobo
aura<00:02:34.980> HD<00:02:35.160> most<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.120> its<00:02:36.240> UI<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.780> completely

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
aura HD most of its UI is completely

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.890 
aura HD most of its UI is completely
white<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.640> kind<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.120> don't<00:02:39.300> see<00:02:39.690> that

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
white so you kind of don't see that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.350 
white so you kind of don't see that
discoloration<00:02:40.440> although<00:02:41.310> i<00:02:41.550> think<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.240> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
discoloration although i think that the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.660 
discoloration although i think that the
aura<00:02:42.570> has<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.260> more<00:02:43.590> refined<00:02:44.070> front<00:02:44.459> front

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
aura has just more refined front front

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.430 
aura has just more refined front front
light<00:02:44.880> where<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.660> Simple<00:02:45.990> Touch<00:02:46.020> reader

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
light where is the Simple Touch reader

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.010 
light where is the Simple Touch reader
with<00:02:46.620> glowlight<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.430> bit<00:02:47.610> outdated

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
with glowlight it's a bit outdated

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.380 
with glowlight it's a bit outdated
technology<00:02:49.020> it's<00:02:49.530> certainly<00:02:49.950> no<00:02:50.310> slouch

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
technology it's certainly no slouch

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.330 
technology it's certainly no slouch
there<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.660> isn't<00:02:51.900> many<00:02:52.410> readers<00:02:52.830> with<00:02:53.070> front

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
there just isn't many readers with front

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.400 
there just isn't many readers with front
leg<00:02:53.520> technology<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.050> see<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
reason why that barnes and nobles

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.090 
reason why that barnes and nobles
literally<00:02:57.630> giving<00:02:58.140> these<00:02:58.230> away<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:58.770> free

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
literally giving these away for free

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.800 
literally giving these away for free
with<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> purchase<00:02:59.820> of<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.390> note<00:03:00.600> tablet

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
with the purchase of a note tablet

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.870 
with the purchase of a note tablet
