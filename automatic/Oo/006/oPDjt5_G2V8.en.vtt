00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
lungs have a double circulatory system

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.300 
lungs have a double circulatory system
both<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.049> human<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.650> Frog<00:02:27.980> have<00:02:28.280> a

both the human and the Frog have a

membrane surrounding their hearts so

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.319

what's<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.380> difference<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.760> human<00:02:35.120> heart

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
what's the difference the human heart

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.060 
what's the difference the human heart
consists<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.989> right<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.380> left<00:02:36.530> atrium

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
consists of the right and left atrium

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.590 
consists of the right and left atrium
and<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.370> right<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.730> left<00:02:37.880> ventricle<00:02:38.450> and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
and the right and left ventricle and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.199 
and the right and left ventricle and
therefore<00:02:39.170> has<00:02:39.380> four<00:02:39.650> chambers<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.940> frog

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
therefore has four chambers the frog

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.849 
therefore has four chambers the frog
heart<00:02:41.510> consists<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.320> right<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.680> left

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
heart consists of the right and left

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.310 
heart consists of the right and left
atrium<00:02:43.430> but<00:02:43.790> only<00:02:44.090> has<00:02:44.239> one<00:02:44.510> ventricle<00:02:44.930> and

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
atrium but only has one ventricle and

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
atrium but only has one ventricle and
therefore<00:02:45.829> has<00:02:46.070> three<00:02:46.400> chambers<00:02:48.340> another

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
therefore has three chambers another

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.979 
therefore has three chambers another
important<00:02:49.820> difference<00:02:50.000> between<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.630> humans

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989

then returns to the left atrium and is

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.400 
then returns to the left atrium and is

very efficient system which provides the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.820 
very efficient system which provides the

needs in the Frog the oxygenated blood

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.860 
needs in the Frog the oxygenated blood
flows<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.280> left<00:03:24.670> atrium<00:03:24.880> like<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.510> human

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
flows to the left atrium like the human

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.750 
flows to the left atrium like the human
and<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.290> deoxygenated<00:03:26.740> blood<00:03:27.070> flows<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.550> the

only difference is that the two types of

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.420 
only difference is that the two types of
blood<00:03:31.660> flow<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.380> same<00:03:32.590> ventricle<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.310> are

blood flow to the same ventricle and are

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.670 
blood flow to the same ventricle and are
mixed<00:03:33.790> then<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.990> blood<00:03:35.170> exiting<00:03:35.590> the
