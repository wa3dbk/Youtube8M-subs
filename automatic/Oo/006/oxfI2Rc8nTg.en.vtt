00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.350
 dark as a roof is going that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.659
 usually my strength that is just that is 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.659

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.620

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.350
 Almere brands

 I wanted to work with lights on light 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.320
 its a little nicer yes let's see how 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.320
 looks like 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:12.510
 Ferrari and so on and there is another one 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.450

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.510
 ship and we go to visit 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.350
 ted rocking ship of drink succeeds 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.810
 every yes you want him a little bit after 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.989
 to build it is also pretty successful 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.820
 rain is going to be my teleportation 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.820
 you just lie is offers a go 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.980
 and i hope can do this 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.290
 who does not suspect anything like it 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.410
 nice out yes and close in this hole 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.270
 so nice construction video boys no 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.250
 Speedbuild in just a nice relax 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.959
 building 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.370
 and it seems fun to those windows 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.950
 darken here and I do one 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.489
 brown before I'll go see how that 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.130
 looks like 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.900
 you can always adjust very simply 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.390
 and what i also built today is the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.519
 slide and I have my whole parfait 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.470
 schools say a lot of creepy and want 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.709
 it really was a lot of work 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.860
 I made all my schematics to 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.130
 to do it as well as possible and me 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.910
 so it will show it June 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.530
 well that's over and over and hello 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.790
 The tea cups come also to me 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.079
 they are going to look because it is round 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.850
 domes 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.610
 and those are also white cups so I go 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.590
 see if I can post that but 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.780
 at least the layout is almost 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.840
 ready this is the slide he is one 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.000
 little yes in itself is great but me 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.340
 I think I still build him big because this one 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.739
 barn is too small for mcdonald's 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.120
 reforms can be tractors tractors 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.489
 fewer places and there is none at all 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.760
 space for just a few critters 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:00.330
 who stole in to put down and as you see 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.129
 but again that yes this is the aisle to 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.069
 to the back of the fries ring and if 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.930
 we walk through the comics through the back 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.999
 coal kit you of course still for a long time 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.170
 not finished is we come to the playground 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.900
 area 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.609
 and what should I not finish and om nma 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.720
 has made a sketch 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.030
 just look sight and rocking ship 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.530
 made that 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.990
 yes what the intention is that it goes 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.400
 and waving again and in my opinion 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.759
 i have i think big yes yes 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.979
 ship is getting bigger, I can already see that 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.870
 but what is a nice sketch that looks like 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.330
 good looking 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.800
 and then we continue to plight for a while 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.599
 so look at the back which are those 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.820
 chinese at the where that hill there 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:47.210
 starts the sentences so sheena is one 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.500
 jokes to know and is called the the 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.970
 Chinese wall 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.259
 because there have come I forget that 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.080
 name not so fast anymore he is n't either 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.210
 very hard to handle and 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.220
 and we look at here have the 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.320
 distorting mirrors win is in china 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.099
 of course that whitewater course also 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.340
 once made 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:07.039
 this splash water course 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.330
 then we have the bumper cars we have 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.460
 the Ferris wheel 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.840
 we have the haunted house though we have one 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.699
 monorail that also goes naturally 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.139
 widen because the entire DVD is also correct 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.080
 not quite yet 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.840
 and keena go this was the previous one and 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.870
 layouts section so this was the yes it 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.199
 just say the corridor and this what you see 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.050
 that fence piece here that stands now and then 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:33.500
 you should start scaring here so this one 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.800
 turn is that piece according to my head and 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.860
 it is pretty bad because yes it is 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.659
 large and to compare and take a look 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.800
 nothing to stuffer me behind in that red 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.330
 thesis also not yet finished 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.669
 here is a roller coaster that also works 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.469
 new relationship there are cars you 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:53.030
 is also increased somewhat 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:54.469
 we have slide teacups in van 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.570
 part park immediately see it is not big 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.009
 partners humanity so through the on the 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.409
 bus that is also being adjusted 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.639
 of course and to the slide there too 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.889
 an attraction in the comes another one 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.460
 attraction center and natural entrance 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.020
 that is more or less almost finished is another one 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.349
 need some things and to 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.889
 to hear 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:16.479
 yes small little things 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:19.250
 and the entrance to 240 chain that is not 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:22.759
 yes it is already not is still 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.139
 build in with a server then you can 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.380
 very easy to go to span 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.120
 to go and then just here 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.710
 to walk and there is a very big one here 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.060
