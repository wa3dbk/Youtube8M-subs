00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
30 blocks below the surface a bedrock

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.080 
30 blocks below the surface a bedrock
was<00:02:14.360> down<00:02:14.510> there<00:02:14.690> by<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.280> 80<00:02:16.280> or<00:02:16.460> 90<00:02:16.610> blocks<00:02:16.910> I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
ever wondered what happens on their

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.610 
ever wondered what happens on their
bedrock<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.120> can<00:02:35.270> use<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.630> super<00:02:35.990> pick<00:02:36.170> come

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
bedrock you can use the super pick come

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.720 
bedrock you can use the super pick come
on<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:37.100> see<00:02:37.340> an<00:02:38.330> under<00:02:38.600> bedrock<00:02:39.020> there<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.730> wait

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
on to see an under bedrock there is wait

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.820 
on to see an under bedrock there is wait
for<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:40.970> wait<00:02:41.240> for<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.870> Wow<00:02:43.060> blue<00:02:44.060> blue<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
for it wait for it Wow blue blue and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.380 
for it wait for it Wow blue blue and
essentially<00:02:46.280> that's<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.670> bottomless<00:02:47.090> pit<00:02:47.209> I

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
essentially that's a bottomless pit I

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.790 
essentially that's a bottomless pit I
mean<00:02:47.630> once<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.870> go<00:02:47.959> down<00:02:47.990> to<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.230> blue<00:02:48.560> part

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
mean once you go down to that blue part

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.840 
mean once you go down to that blue part
you'll<00:02:49.250> die<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:50.510> just<00:02:50.660> takes<00:02:50.810> half<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.850> so

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
you'll die it just takes half of you so

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.400 
you'll die it just takes half of you so
that's<00:02:53.030> basically<00:02:53.150> i'd<00:02:53.510> say<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:54.080> world<00:02:54.290> of

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410
