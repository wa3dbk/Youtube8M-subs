00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hello this is Simon and this is man not

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.789 
hello this is Simon and this is man not
point<00:00:03.210> four<00:00:03.360> seven<00:00:03.770> so<00:00:04.770> start<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> fresh<00:00:05.279> game

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
point four seven so start a fresh game

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.080 
point four seven so start a fresh game
base<00:00:07.799> looks<00:00:08.069> like<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> usual<00:00:08.639> setup<00:00:08.970> but

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
base looks like a usual setup but

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.209 
base looks like a usual setup but
there's<00:00:09.240> one<00:00:09.360> big<00:00:09.540> change<00:00:09.750> that's<00:00:10.650> placing

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
there's one big change that's placing

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.789 
there's one big change that's placing
rooms<00:00:11.570> you<00:00:12.570> now<00:00:12.719> place<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> blueprint<00:00:13.500> which

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
rooms you now place a blueprint which

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.490 
rooms you now place a blueprint which
has<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.070> be<00:00:14.160> built<00:00:14.400> by<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.610> colonists<00:00:15.500> so

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
has to be built by the colonists so

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.090 
has to be built by the colonists so
we'll<00:00:16.830> place<00:00:17.070> down<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> workshop<00:00:17.730> as<00:00:18.210> usual<00:00:18.539> and

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
we'll place down a workshop as usual and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.070 
we'll place down a workshop as usual and
we<00:00:20.100> dig<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:20.520> some<00:00:20.730> areas<00:00:20.970> over<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.350> here

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
we dig out some areas over here and here

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.370 
we dig out some areas over here and here
yeah<00:00:26.840> she'll<00:00:27.840> give<00:00:27.960> us<00:00:28.050> some<00:00:28.199> space<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.590> build

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
yeah she'll give us some space to build

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.080 
yeah she'll give us some space to build
another<00:00:31.380> room<00:00:31.710> or<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.980> place<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> door<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.000> so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
another room or to place a door here so

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
another room or to place a door here so
we<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.360> through<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.620> notice<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
we can get through to it you notice the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.580 
we can get through to it you notice the
door<00:00:35.250> placements<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.790> lot<00:00:35.940> better<00:00:36.030> now<00:00:36.469> it's<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
door placements a lot better now it's a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.049 
door placements a lot better now it's a
rare<00:00:37.800> intersection<00:00:38.160> test<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> walls<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
rare intersection test with the walls of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.090 
rare intersection test with the walls of
the<00:00:39.180> room<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:40.110> allows<00:00:40.379> us<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.680> place<00:00:40.890> things

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the room that allows us to place things

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
the room that allows us to place things
arbitrarily<00:00:41.700> or<00:00:41.910> walls<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.750> cool

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
arbitrarily or walls which will be cool

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.139 
arbitrarily or walls which will be cool
for<00:00:43.320> things<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:43.680> lights<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.460> clocks<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
for things like lights and clocks and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.660 
for things like lights and clocks and
monitors<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.230> stuff<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.520> they

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
monitors and stuff as you see they

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.979 
monitors and stuff as you see they
placed<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.059> scaffolds<00:00:48.629> when<00:00:48.870> they're

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
placed on scaffolds when they're

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.330 
placed on scaffolds when they're
building<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> room<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:49.800> once<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> rooms

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
building a room and then once the rooms

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.500 
building a room and then once the rooms
full<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.640> scaffolding<00:00:51.149> after<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> few<00:00:52.260> seconds

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
full of scaffolding after a few seconds

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.540 
full of scaffolding after a few seconds
they'll<00:00:54.510> complete<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> room<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> be

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
they'll complete the room you have to be

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.680 
they'll complete the room you have to be
careful<00:00:56.670> about<00:00:56.910> building<00:00:57.329> doors<00:00:57.510> because

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
careful about building doors because

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
careful about building doors because
they<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.170> build<00:00:58.410> themselves<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
they can now build themselves into a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.150 
they can now build themselves into a
room<00:00:59.430> which<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.760> can't<00:00:59.969> escape<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
room which they can't escape from and so

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.410 
room which they can't escape from and so
make<00:01:02.340> sure<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.579> always<00:01:02.789> give<00:01:03.000> them<00:01:03.059> doors<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
make sure you always give them doors of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.700 
make sure you always give them doors of
ice<00:01:03.510> they'll<00:01:03.719> go<00:01:03.960> insane<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.379> these<00:01:04.500> dark

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
ice they'll go insane in these dark

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.140 
ice they'll go insane in these dark
rooms<00:01:06.830> suppose<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> nanoscale<00:01:08.250> printer<00:01:08.909> for

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
rooms suppose a nanoscale printer for

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.210 
rooms suppose a nanoscale printer for
the<00:01:09.240> Imps

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.980 

as<00:01:14.730> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.120> they've<00:01:15.300> got<00:01:15.480> a<00:01:15.630> lot<00:01:15.840> more

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
as you can see they've got a lot more

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
as you can see they've got a lot more
kind<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.260> idle<00:01:16.530> animations<00:01:17.010> now<00:01:17.190> which<00:01:18.060> means

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
kind of idle animations now which means

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640 
kind of idle animations now which means
they<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.570> things<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.050> other<00:01:19.290> than<00:01:19.500> going

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
they have things to do other than going

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.940 
they have things to do other than going
to<00:01:19.860> eat<00:01:20.010> and<00:01:20.310> drink<00:01:21.440> you'll<00:01:22.440> see<00:01:22.590> them<00:01:22.740> sitting

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to eat and drink you'll see them sitting

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950 
to eat and drink you'll see them sitting
down<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.550> floor<00:01:23.730> which<00:01:24.390> means<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.720> they

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
down on the floor which means that they

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.720 
down on the floor which means that they
can<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.800> rest<00:01:26.010> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.280> bit<00:01:26.490> they'll

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
can kind of rest a little bit they'll

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.880 
can kind of rest a little bit they'll
get<00:01:26.880> low<00:01:27.000> less<00:01:27.210> fatigued<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:28.680> they'll

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
get low less fatigued but then they'll

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.350 
get low less fatigued but then they'll
get<00:01:29.040> hypothermia<00:01:29.670> from<00:01:29.970> sitting<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.300> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
get hypothermia from sitting on the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
get hypothermia from sitting on the
floor<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.600> too<00:01:30.780> long<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.440> placing<00:01:31.770> subcellular

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
floor of too long so placing subcellular

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.480 
floor of too long so placing subcellular
is<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:33.360> i<00:01:33.390> want<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.810> show<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.490> another

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
is because i want to show you another

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.370 
is because i want to show you another
new<00:01:35.670> item<00:01:36.560> which<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:39.260> flywheel<00:01:40.260> energy

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
new item which is the flywheel energy

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.040 
new item which is the flywheel energy
storage<00:01:40.680> which<00:01:41.610> uses<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:44.600> spinning<00:01:45.600> disk<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
storage which uses a spinning disk to

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.100 
storage which uses a spinning disk to
store<00:01:46.320> energy<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.150> store<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.630> spending

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
store energy and if you store a spending

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.600 
store energy and if you store a spending
disk<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.500> vacuum<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.950> never<00:01:50.100> loses<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
disk in a vacuum it never loses that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.180 
disk in a vacuum it never loses that
rotational<00:01:51.210> energy<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.979> store

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
rotational energy and so you can store

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.830 
rotational energy and so you can store
quite<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.430> lot<00:01:53.550> of<00:01:53.610> energy<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.940> it<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.690> as

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
quite a lot of energy on it it's not as

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
quite a lot of energy on it it's not as
good<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.320> supercapacitor<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.369> does

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
good as the supercapacitor but it does

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.540 
good as the supercapacitor but it does
give<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> lower<00:01:57.300> tech<00:01:58.220> way<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.280> store

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
give you a lower tech way to store

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.530 
give you a lower tech way to store
energy<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.119> early<00:02:00.330> game<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.360> that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
energy in the early game so that

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.480 
energy in the early game so that
building<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.229> now

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.180 

so<00:02:09.490> you<00:02:09.610> can<00:02:09.820> make<00:02:10.210> a<00:02:10.270> valuable<00:02:10.660> base<00:02:10.930> now

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
so you can make a valuable base now

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.360 
so you can make a valuable base now
using<00:02:12.190> their<00:02:12.310> solar<00:02:12.520> panels<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.510> some

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
using their solar panels so that some

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.950 
using their solar panels so that some
place<00:02:15.370> living<00:02:15.700> area<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.540> can<00:02:16.600> place<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
place living area so you can place the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.390 
place living area so you can place the
beds<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.380> future<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.950> as<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> at<00:02:21.250> all

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
beds in the future so as the at all

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.500 
beds in the future so as the at all
areas<00:02:23.010> yeah<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.760> ticking<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.210> out<00:02:25.330> so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
areas yeah this is ticking that out so

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.170 
areas yeah this is ticking that out so
we<00:02:25.600> can<00:02:25.690> create<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.990> bigger<00:02:26.140> storage<00:02:26.440> room

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
we can create a bigger storage room

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.160 
we can create a bigger storage room
since<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.270> can<00:02:28.390> place<00:02:28.540> more<00:02:28.750> things<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.020> note

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
since you can place more things to note

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.880 
since you can place more things to note
we<00:02:29.260> probably<00:02:29.470> need<00:02:29.710> some<00:02:29.740> more<00:02:29.980> space<00:02:30.190> for<00:02:30.400> the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
we probably need some more space for the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.630 
we probably need some more space for the
building<00:02:32.890> materials<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.430> want<00:02:33.580> to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
building materials that we want to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.170 
building materials that we want to
collect<00:02:36.480> as<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.600> can<00:02:37.720> see<00:02:38.880> energy<00:02:39.880> storage

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
collect as you can see energy storage

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.360 
collect as you can see energy storage
system<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.570> finished<00:02:40.870> now<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.160> read

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
system is finished now because you read

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.190 
system is finished now because you read
out<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.700> grid<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.630> if<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.810> want<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.050> know

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
out of the grid so if you want to know

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.930 
out of the grid so if you want to know
how<00:02:44.320> much<00:02:44.440> energy<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.160> coming<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.730> out<00:02:45.760> of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
how much energy is coming in and out of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.650 
how much energy is coming in and out of
the<00:02:46.000> grid<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.330> can<00:02:46.360> always<00:02:46.690> mouse<00:02:47.050> over<00:02:47.380> it

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
the grid you can always mouse over it

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.180 
the grid you can always mouse over it
sted<00:02:49.660> building<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.620> think<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.890> keep

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
sted building that so I think you keep

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.770 
sted building that so I think you keep
an<00:02:51.310> eye<00:02:51.370> on<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.670> will<00:02:51.850> see<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.180> start<00:02:52.720> to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
an eye on that will see it start to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.449 
an eye on that will see it start to
charge<00:02:53.020> up<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.650> know<00:02:56.770> as<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.890> glitch<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
charge up you know as a glitch on the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.340 
charge up you know as a glitch on the
images<00:02:57.700> then<00:02:57.910> it's<00:02:58.120> caused<00:02:58.300> by<00:02:58.330> me<00:02:58.570> forcing<00:02:59.050> 30

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
images then it's caused by me forcing 30

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.920 
images then it's caused by me forcing 30
frames<00:02:59.560> per<00:02:59.680> second<00:03:00.100> for<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.510> video<00:03:01.510> capture

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930

videos<00:03:05.800> there<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:06.820> go<00:03:06.940> you've<00:03:07.180> got<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.590> power

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
videos there you go you've got the power

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.810 
videos there you go you've got the power
come<00:03:08.830> on<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.160> that's<00:03:09.400> going<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.580> start

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
come on and that's going to start

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.790 
come on and that's going to start
storing<00:03:10.060> up<00:03:10.209> energy<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:11.290> much<00:03:11.440> like<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
storing up energy and much like the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.170 
storing up energy and much like the
supercapacitor<00:03:12.519> it's<00:03:12.670> got<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.820> lighting

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
supercapacitor it's got a lighting

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.060 
supercapacitor it's got a lighting
system<00:03:13.330> so<00:03:13.720> if<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.900> want<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.110> roughly<00:03:14.830> gauge

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
system so if you want to roughly gauge

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.620 
system so if you want to roughly gauge
how<00:03:15.310> much<00:03:15.370> energy<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.970> has<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.420> always

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
how much energy it has you can always

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.910 
how much energy it has you can always
any<00:03:17.380> goats<00:03:17.560> come<00:03:17.709> on<00:03:17.880> get<00:03:18.880> started<00:03:19.180> lighter<00:03:19.920> so

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
any goats come on get started lighter so

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.160 
any goats come on get started lighter so
place<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.130> bed<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:22.060> guys<00:03:22.239> don't<00:03:22.300> die<00:03:22.630> fatigue<00:03:22.989> or

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
place a bed so guys don't die fatigue or

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.790 
place a bed so guys don't die fatigue or
hypothermia<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:25.050> let's<00:03:26.050> place<00:03:26.440> some

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
hypothermia and let's place some

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.310 
hypothermia and let's place some
hydroponics<00:03:29.800> I<00:03:29.890> think

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.430 

hydroponics<00:03:34.320> are<00:03:34.590> improved<00:03:34.980> now<00:03:35.190> they

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
hydroponics are improved now they

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.440 
hydroponics are improved now they
generate<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.470> lot<00:03:37.620> more<00:03:37.770> atmosphere<00:03:38.460> based<00:03:39.180> on

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
generate a lot more atmosphere based on

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.870 
generate a lot more atmosphere based on
how<00:03:39.720> fast<00:03:40.110> they're<00:03:40.320> growing<00:03:40.710> and<00:03:40.920> how<00:03:41.700> much

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
how fast they're growing and how much

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.880 
how fast they're growing and how much
light<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.330> energy<00:03:42.420> they're<00:03:42.810> taking<00:03:43.170> in<00:03:43.290> which

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
light and energy they're taking in which

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.580 
light and energy they're taking in which
means<00:03:44.220> they're<00:03:44.700> much<00:03:44.880> more<00:03:45.060> viable<00:03:45.590> for

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
means they're much more viable for

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.410 
means they're much more viable for
creating<00:03:47.250> atmosphere<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:47.730> your<00:03:47.760> base<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.300> you

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
creating atmosphere in your base if you

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.000 
creating atmosphere in your base if you
have<00:03:48.570> maybe<00:03:48.750> six<00:03:49.110> or<00:03:49.320> seven<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.680> them<00:03:49.830> or<00:03:49.980> a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
have maybe six or seven of them or a

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.620 
have maybe six or seven of them or a
whole<00:03:50.190> room<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.490> them<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.270> actually

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
whole room of them you can actually

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.150 
whole room of them you can actually
start<00:03:51.960> thinking<00:03:52.380> about<00:03:52.470> whether<00:03:52.770> you<00:03:53.010> could

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
start thinking about whether you could

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.490 
start thinking about whether you could
start<00:03:53.550> turning<00:03:53.910> off<00:03:54.030> your<00:03:54.500> atmosphere

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
start turning off your atmosphere

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.170 
start turning off your atmosphere
generators<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.250> you're<00:03:56.550> just<00:03:56.700> using<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
generators and you're just using the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.970 
generators and you're just using the
trees<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.720> actually<00:03:58.050> generate<00:03:58.230> enough<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.740> few

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
trees to actually generate enough a few

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.750 
trees to actually generate enough a few
guys<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.220> breathe<00:04:01.070> so<00:04:02.070> we've<00:04:02.190> just<00:04:02.220> extended

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
guys to breathe so we've just extended

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.720 
guys to breathe so we've just extended
through<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:04.590> give<00:04:04.710> us<00:04:04.830> more<00:04:04.980> room<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.430> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
through that give us more room for the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.240 
through that give us more room for the
minerals<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.480> stuff<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:10.680> notice<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.040> can

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
minerals and stuff you notice you can

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.490 
minerals and stuff you notice you can
mouse-over<00:04:11.580> bits<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:12.390> walls<00:04:12.570> now<00:04:12.780> they<00:04:13.350> go

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
mouse-over bits the walls now they go

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.660 
mouse-over bits the walls now they go
there's<00:04:13.680> one<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.920> colonists<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.490> having

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
there's one of the colonists just having

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.940 
there's one of the colonists just having
to<00:04:14.760> sit<00:04:14.910> down<00:04:15.060> on<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.270> ground<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:16.530> she'll<00:04:16.770> gain

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
to sit down on the ground so she'll gain

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.820 
to sit down on the ground so she'll gain
a<00:04:17.660> little<00:04:18.660> bit<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.959> energy<00:04:19.080> back<00:04:19.440> from<00:04:19.680> that

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
a little bit of energy back from that

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.140 
a little bit of energy back from that
but<00:04:20.070> she'll<00:04:20.250> also<00:04:20.430> get<00:04:20.760> cold<00:04:21.860> which<00:04:23.150> means

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
but she'll also get cold which means

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.480 
but she'll also get cold which means
that<00:04:24.270> she'll<00:04:24.660> spend<00:04:25.440> more<00:04:25.740> kilojoules<00:04:26.220> on

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
that she'll spend more kilojoules on

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.730 
that she'll spend more kilojoules on
thermoregulation<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.570> her<00:04:28.290> body<00:04:28.500> will

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
thermoregulation and her body will

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.960 
thermoregulation and her body will
eventually<00:04:29.220> start<00:04:29.430> moving<00:04:29.700> towards

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
eventually start moving towards

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.790 
eventually start moving towards
hypothermia<00:04:32.900> but<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:34.050> won't<00:04:34.170> die<00:04:34.320> fatigue<00:04:34.650> is

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
hypothermia but you won't die fatigue is

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.680 
hypothermia but you won't die fatigue is
quick<00:04:35.010> sown<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.120> other<00:04:36.240> things<00:04:36.360> is<00:04:36.480> you<00:04:36.540> can

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
quick sown the other things is you can

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.410 
quick sown the other things is you can
build<00:04:36.840> airlocks<00:04:37.170> now<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.790> AI<00:04:38.940> is<00:04:39.120> now

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
build airlocks now and the AI is now

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.660 
build airlocks now and the AI is now
properly<00:04:39.870> using<00:04:40.710> multiple<00:04:41.190> airlocks<00:04:41.490> and

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
properly using multiple airlocks and

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.990 
properly using multiple airlocks and
will<00:04:41.820> pass<00:04:42.000> through<00:04:42.990> them<00:04:43.140> quite<00:04:43.380> well<00:04:44.000> we

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
will pass through them quite well we

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.220 
will pass through them quite well we
don't<00:04:45.120> really<00:04:45.240> need<00:04:45.420> this<00:04:45.570> for<00:04:45.720> that<00:04:45.840> base<00:04:45.990> yet

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
don't really need this for that base yet

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.860 
don't really need this for that base yet
but<00:04:46.440> it's<00:04:46.860> worth<00:04:47.040> mentioning<00:04:47.540> so<00:04:48.540> let's<00:04:48.690> build

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
but it's worth mentioning so let's build

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.909 
but it's worth mentioning so let's build
some<00:04:49.020> hydroponics<00:04:49.500> trees

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.710 

24<00:04:54.919> now<00:04:55.039> they'll<00:04:55.939> be<00:04:55.970> good<00:04:56.180> enough<00:04:56.330> for<00:04:56.389> food

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
24 now they'll be good enough for food

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.029 
24 now they'll be good enough for food
but<00:04:56.900> not<00:04:56.960> really<00:04:57.259> enough<00:04:57.439> to<00:04:57.470> generate<00:04:57.800> a

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
but not really enough to generate a

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.939 
but not really enough to generate a
sizable<00:04:58.970> amount<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.240> atmosphere<00:04:59.949> talking

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
sizable amount of atmosphere talking

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.230 
sizable amount of atmosphere talking
about<00:05:01.099> atmosphere<00:05:01.430> need<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.669> be<00:05:01.759> aware<00:05:02.000> of<00:05:02.060> the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
about atmosphere need to be aware of the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.929 
about atmosphere need to be aware of the
chickens<00:05:02.629> now<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:03.080> chicken<00:05:03.379> AI<00:05:03.500> is<00:05:03.759> gone<00:05:04.759> back

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:04.939 
chickens now the chicken AI is gone back

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.350 
chickens now the chicken AI is gone back
to<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.180> old<00:05:05.330> build<00:05:06.080> that<00:05:06.259> we<00:05:06.409> had<00:05:07.240> during<00:05:08.240> the

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
to the old build that we had during the

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.640 
to the old build that we had during the
kick<00:05:08.539> start<00:05:08.780> just<00:05:09.020> they're<00:05:09.229> sensitive<00:05:09.500> to

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
kick start just they're sensitive to

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.980 
kick start just they're sensitive to
light<00:05:09.889> and<00:05:10.219> they'll<00:05:10.669> go<00:05:10.699> find<00:05:11.120> warm<00:05:11.509> places<00:05:11.719> to

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
light and they'll go find warm places to

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.429 
light and they'll go find warm places to
go<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.110> reproduce<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:13.400> chickens<00:05:13.759> now<00:05:13.939> do<00:05:14.000> use

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 
go and reproduce the chickens now do use

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.209 
go and reproduce the chickens now do use
atmospheres<00:05:15.439> they<00:05:15.680> there<00:05:15.949> Bri<00:05:16.189> the

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
atmospheres they there Bri the

atmospheres they there Bri the
atmosphere<00:05:16.789> and<00:05:16.939> that<00:05:17.360> means<00:05:17.569> that<00:05:17.780> if<00:05:17.870> you

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
atmosphere and that means that if you

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.350 
atmosphere and that means that if you
are<00:05:18.229> not<00:05:18.379> careful<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:19.219> can<00:05:19.370> asphyxiate<00:05:19.849> your

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
are not careful you can asphyxiate your

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.119 
are not careful you can asphyxiate your
entire<00:05:20.599> base<00:05:20.870> by<00:05:21.139> creating<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.530> huge<00:05:21.680> swarm<00:05:22.069> of

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
entire base by creating a huge swarm of

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.379 
entire base by creating a huge swarm of
chickens<00:05:24.520> whether<00:05:25.520> we<00:05:25.699> have<00:05:25.789> slowed<00:05:26.090> down<00:05:26.240> the

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
chickens whether we have slowed down the

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.070 
chickens whether we have slowed down the
breeding<00:05:26.690> rate<00:05:26.810> someone<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:28.629> your<00:05:29.629> colonists

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
breeding rate someone and your colonists

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:38.080 
breeding rate someone and your colonists
one<00:05:30.199> out<00:05:30.349> even<00:05:30.530> for<00:05:30.770> food<00:05:30.979> too<00:05:35.800> so<00:05:36.800> just<00:05:37.099> check

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
one out even for food too so just check

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.640 
one out even for food too so just check
there<00:05:38.360> any<00:05:38.509> dangerous<00:05:39.289> to<00:05:39.469> our<00:05:39.500> base<00:05:39.860> quickly

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
there any dangerous to our base quickly

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.930 
there any dangerous to our base quickly
so<00:05:42.650> there's<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:42.979> new<00:05:43.099> proto<00:05:43.310> birds<00:05:43.610> i'll<00:05:43.789> talk

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
so there's the new proto birds i'll talk

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
so there's the new proto birds i'll talk
about<00:05:43.969> them<00:05:44.090> later<00:05:44.800> but<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.569> magus<00:05:47.569> s<00:05:47.750> just

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
about them later but the magus s just

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.110 
about them later but the magus s just
wandering<00:05:48.349> around<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:49.580> nothing<00:05:49.879> to<00:05:49.969> worry

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
wandering around so nothing to worry

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.850 
wandering around so nothing to worry
about<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.389> moment<00:05:50.690> we<00:05:51.289> can<00:05:51.439> actually<00:05:51.710> call

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
about the moment we can actually call

00:05:51.860 --> 00:06:01.240 
about the moment we can actually call
down<00:05:51.979> more<00:05:52.159> colonists<00:05:52.639> so<00:05:52.759> let's<00:05:52.939> do<00:05:53.150> that<00:06:00.250> so

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
down more colonists so let's do that so

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.619 
down more colonists so let's do that so
they're<00:06:01.400> building<00:06:01.819> a<00:06:01.879> research<00:06:02.060> room<00:06:02.389> quickly

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:02.629 
they're building a research room quickly

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.019 
they're building a research room quickly
for<00:06:02.870> us<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.520> one<00:06:04.520> of<00:06:04.639> the<00:06:04.699> other<00:06:04.729> things<00:06:04.849> i

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 
for us and one of the other things i

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:06.159 
for us and one of the other things i
wanted<00:06:05.240> to<00:06:05.330> mention<00:06:05.419> is<00:06:05.719> that<00:06:05.750> you<00:06:05.960> bass

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
wanted to mention is that you bass

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.019 
wanted to mention is that you bass
announcer<00:06:06.680> social<00:06:07.069> announce<00:06:07.340> if<00:06:07.610> there<00:06:07.849> are

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
specific problem area rooms so for

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.309 
specific problem area rooms so for
example<00:06:10.819> i<00:06:11.240> forgot<00:06:11.479> to<00:06:11.509> build<00:06:11.719> an<00:06:11.810> atmosphere

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319

example i forgot to build an atmosphere
generator<00:06:12.680> in<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:12.889> base<00:06:13.069> so<00:06:16.330> you<00:06:17.330> can<00:06:17.479> say
