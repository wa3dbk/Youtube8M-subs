water from the tap or you could walk

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.660 
water from the tap or you could walk
water<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> temperature<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.479> would<00:01:10.670> make

your tea with you just soak them in
there<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:14.729> half<00:01:14.909> hour<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.780> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
there for you know half hour so and that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.060 
there for you know half hour so and that
softens<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.799> leaves<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.390> I'll<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
softens the leaves up so what I'll do is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.270 
softens the leaves up so what I'll do is
put<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.100> sausages<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.659> skillet<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
put the sausages in the skillet to get a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.700 
put the sausages in the skillet to get a
nice<00:01:23.460> sear<00:01:23.790> on

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
nice sear on

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.060 
nice sear on
and<00:01:25.100> an<00:01:25.490> over<00:01:25.790> top<00:01:26.000> of<00:01:26.030> those<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.869> will<00:01:27.560> lay<00:01:27.740> some

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
and an over top of those I will lay some

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.800 
and an over top of those I will lay some
big<00:01:28.340> leagues<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.240> fig<00:01:32.420> leaves<00:01:32.570> will

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
big leagues and so the fig leaves will

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
big leagues and so the fig leaves will
kind<00:01:33.050> of<00:01:33.170> scheme<00:01:34.960> you'll<00:01:35.960> still<00:01:36.229> get<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.409> sear

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
kind of scheme you'll still get a sear

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.130 
kind of scheme you'll still get a sear
because<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.369> skillet<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:37.820> good<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.119> hot<00:01:38.360> but

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
because the skillet is good and hot but

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.870 
because the skillet is good and hot but
you'll<00:01:39.290> get<00:01:39.470> some<00:01:39.680> steam<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.340> then<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.580> heat

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
you'll get some steam and then the heat

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.810 
you'll get some steam and then the heat
from<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.240> skillet<00:01:42.229> is<00:01:42.650> going<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.250> really

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
from the skillet is going to really

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.090 
from the skillet is going to really
impart<00:01:44.300> that<00:01:44.360> flavor<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.140> pygmies<00:01:45.350> into

look quite quickly you may want to cook

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.240 
look quite quickly you may want to cook
a<00:02:41.810> little<00:02:41.959> bit<00:02:42.049> longer<00:02:42.260> if<00:02:42.530> you're<00:02:42.739> using<00:02:43.010> a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
a little bit longer if you're using a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.319 
a little bit longer if you're using a
bigger<00:02:43.970> faculty<00:02:44.840> or<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.170> butter<00:02:45.349> be<00:02:45.970> but<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
bigger faculty or a butter be but the

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.649 
bigger faculty or a butter be but the
trick<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.840> use<00:02:48.019> an<00:02:48.439> unsalted<00:02:49.159> liquid<00:02:50.150> to

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659

the seasoning right near the end of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.940 
the seasoning right near the end of
cooking<00:02:55.459> otherwise<00:02:56.379> these<00:02:57.379> will<00:02:57.560> get<00:02:57.680> kind<00:02:57.890> of

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
cooking otherwise these will get kind of

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.069 
cooking otherwise these will get kind of
tough<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.519> a<00:02:59.000> little<00:02:59.420> more<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.780> me<00:02:59.930> than
