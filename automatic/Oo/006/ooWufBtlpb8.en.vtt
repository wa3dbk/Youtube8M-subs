00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.730
 welcome to meeting make point 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.340
 as I will introduce you the mattress 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.250
 inflatable neoware venture of land marc 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.289
 so this is the first version 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.289
 year's awards to the mayor of 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.820
 terms art is to note however that this 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.790
 morning uses technology 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 different from the other mattresses of the 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.710
 range which I will explain 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.890
 why what they have in common is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.670
 that the dr venture is first a master 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.870
 the compact is rather light even if 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 is a little heavier than the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.050
 other mattresses of comparable size in 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.559
 the range of ware so I'm going to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.250
 show inflated one is on a mattress 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.739
 whose interest 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.559
 it's going to be to bring already more 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.030
 ordinary inflatable kamata insulation 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.079
 that is to say that inside the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.300
 mattress we have a partition a series of 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.579
 milk tale walls so compared 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.439
 to an ordinary match where we only have 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.209
 of air and well these partitions are going 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.609
 ensure better insulation 

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:12.869
 thermal 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:17.240
 then we are also on a mattress 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.340
 which is relatively stable 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.130
 but we have a difference 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.159
 to ranges to other mattresses of the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.149
 neoware range is that besides the fact 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.119
 that this one is a little bit less 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.979
 thick that only makes 5 cm we did not 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.539
 no longer the same structure inside 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.880
 that is to say on the other mattresses 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.849
 Wales neoware we really have a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.329
 triangular partition structure that 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:44.789
 will react like a real mattress of 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.560
 licques here is simply nails 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.689
 his lady horizon which ensures a 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.429
 thermal insulation and blow one is 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.740
 on a mattress that will still be a 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.539
 little less comfortable 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.540
 a little stable but galley a little 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.000
 more vague than the other matches 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.400
 bring to the mayor so here is a 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.440
 mattress that inflates to the mouth 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.120
 we can possibly inflate it with 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.650
 a small electric meter that 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.780
 found on the site 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.970
 if need be in summary it is a mattress 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.520
 that I would rather advise for a 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.380
 first investment or for a use 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.250
 punctual 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.050
 on the other hand for a more regular face 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.630
 and also if you tend 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.430
 rather to turn you when you sleep 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.040
 I advise you to orient yourself 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.560
 to other matches at ranges 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.410
 neoware especially the neo is a tracker 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.110
 which will bring a mellow and a 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.660
 closer comfort a real mattress of 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.550
 10 so I leave you on this 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.410
 see the videos we made 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.280
 succeed primates 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.440
 So here is a mattress that is 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.270
 comes in many sizes that you 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.600
 find on the site ray go to
