we<00:00:48.620> can<00:00:49.100> use<00:00:49.390> almost<00:00:50.979> infinite<00:00:51.979> number<00:00:52.370> of

we can use almost infinite number of
different<00:00:53.510> texture<00:00:53.930> is<00:00:54.350> not<00:00:54.620> limited<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.940> we

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
different texture is not limited so we

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.799 
different texture is not limited so we
made<00:00:56.629> a<00:00:57.140> new<00:00:57.500> file<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.670> give<00:00:59.330> us<00:00:59.570> the

made a new file and give us the

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.579 
made a new file and give us the

locks are the same besides tea and crank
I<00:02:39.740> made<00:02:40.550> I<00:02:40.820> try<00:02:41.240> something<00:02:41.510> different<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.350> also

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
I made I try something different I also

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.940 
I made I try something different I also
