00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
here the 909 Luna right you can see the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.690 
here the 909 Luna right you can see the
cutouts<00:00:33.930> right<00:00:34.680> there<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.130> take<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> bit<00:00:35.610> of

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
cutouts right there to take a bit of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.900 
cutouts right there to take a bit of
weight<00:00:35.850> off<00:00:36.030> off<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:37.550> also<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
weight off off of there also have the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.670 
weight off off of there also have the
apex<00:00:40.489> can<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> look<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.530> some<00:00:43.530> nice

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
apex can have a look at that some nice

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860 
apex can have a look at that some nice
grains<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> different<00:00:45.510> profile

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
grains and that's the different profile

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.770 
grains and that's the different profile
on<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> apex<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.420> start<00:00:48.660> off

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
on the apex so what I like to start off

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.600 
on the apex so what I like to start off
with<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:49.469> facts<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.280> front

unbleached grade one English willow it's
predominantly<00:01:06.930> straight<00:01:07.439> grain<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.159> about

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
predominantly straight grain so about

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.420 
predominantly straight grain so about
90%<00:01:09.299> straight<00:01:09.869> grains<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.710> maybe<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> little

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
90% straight grains with maybe a little

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.690 
90% straight grains with maybe a little
bit<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> deflection<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.549> backs<00:01:14.549> are

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
bit of deflection on the backs are

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
bit of deflection on the backs are
fitted<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> top<00:01:15.600> quality<00:01:15.799> triple<00:01:16.799> spring

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
fitted with a top quality triple spring

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.090 
fitted with a top quality triple spring
in<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> handle<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
in in the handle when you get to the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.950 
in in the handle when you get to the
nine<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.310> nine<00:01:20.670> range<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.330> also<00:01:21.540> start

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
nine and nine range what they also start

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
nine and nine range what they also start
doing<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.439> actually<00:01:22.650> giving<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> an<00:01:23.340> oval

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
doing is actually giving you an oval

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.359 
doing is actually giving you an oval
handle<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.420> opposed<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> round<00:01:25.680> handle<00:01:26.159> with

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
handle as opposed to a round handle with

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
handle as opposed to a round handle with
the<00:01:26.580> lower<00:01:26.939> Betts<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:29.329> that's<00:01:30.329> basically<00:01:30.930> so

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the lower Betts and that's basically so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.890 
the lower Betts and that's basically so
you<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.470> better<00:01:31.740> bottom<00:01:32.250> hand<00:01:32.549> comfort<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
you get better bottom hand comfort and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.230 
you get better bottom hand comfort and
control<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.680> well<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.369> also<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.790> 909

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
control as well and then also the 909

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.149 
control as well and then also the 909
bats<00:01:36.479> are<00:01:36.689> fitted<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.409> GM<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.490> Totec<00:01:40.159> so

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
bats are fitted with GM now and Totec so

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.889 
bats are fitted with GM now and Totec so
those<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.670> comes<00:01:42.119> standard<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> best<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
those that comes standard on the best so

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.120 
those that comes standard on the best so
just<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.200> run<00:01:43.350> through<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.649> couple<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:44.009> those

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
just to run through a couple of those

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.600 
just to run through a couple of those
things<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.509> means<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.280> see

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
things what that all means you can see

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.230 
things what that all means you can see
on<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.060> apex<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:49.939> predominantly<00:01:50.939> straight

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
on the apex here predominantly straight

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.179 
on the apex here predominantly straight
reins<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.890> bit<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
reins but you do have just a bit of a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.770 
reins but you do have just a bit of a
deflection<00:01:53.579> over<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.090> where<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.570> get<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
deflection over there where you get a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.870 
deflection over there where you get a
bit<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.110> squiggle<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> grains<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.759> they

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
bit of a squiggle in the grains but they

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.830 
bit of a squiggle in the grains but they
are<00:01:56.969> predominantly<00:01:57.270> straight<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:59.130> get<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
are predominantly straight you get the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.289 
are predominantly straight you get the
triple<00:02:00.840> spring<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> handle<00:02:02.090> right<00:02:03.090> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
triple spring in the handle right you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.539 
triple spring in the handle right you
can<00:02:03.420> see<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.950> offers<00:02:05.280> very

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
can see that there and it offers very

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.900 
can see that there and it offers very
good<00:02:05.670> shock<00:02:06.180> absorption<00:02:07.280> just<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.429> hang<00:02:08.789> on
