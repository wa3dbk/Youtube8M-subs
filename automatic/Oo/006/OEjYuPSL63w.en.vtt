a<00:00:56.399> potato<00:00:57.739> let's<00:00:58.739> try<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
a potato let's try it

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.910 
a potato let's try it
put<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.340> try<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> put<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.000> inside<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.890> can

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
put it try to put it inside and we can

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.830 
put it try to put it inside and we can
we<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.399> put<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> rubber<00:01:02.879> band<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> too

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
we can put a rubber band on it too

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.890 
we can put a rubber band on it too
then<00:01:04.199> we'll<00:01:04.379> stretch<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> okay<00:01:05.540> yes<00:01:06.540> okay<00:01:06.750> so

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
then we'll stretch it okay yes okay so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
then we'll stretch it okay yes okay so
say<00:01:07.890> okay<00:01:08.670> how<00:01:09.150> much<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.720> think<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:11.460> go

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
say okay how much do you think to go

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.359 
say okay how much do you think to go
down<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.390> how<00:01:13.140> long<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> think<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.310> would

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
down here how long do you think it would

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.240 
down here how long do you think it would
have<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.390> halfway<00:01:15.979> because<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
have to be but halfway because it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.649 
have to be but halfway because it
depends<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.030> stretches<00:01:18.180> because<00:01:18.540> if

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
depends on how it stretches because if

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.560 
depends on how it stretches because if
we<00:01:18.810> make<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.350> long<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.330> drop

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
we make it as long as this and we drop

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
we make it as long as this and we drop
it<00:01:21.810> it'll<00:01:22.409> stretch<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.890> go<00:01:22.950> way<00:01:23.250> below<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it it'll stretch and go way below and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
it it'll stretch and go way below and
the<00:01:24.180> egg<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.930> break<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.040> figure

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the egg will break so you have to figure

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.429 
the egg will break so you have to figure
out<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.640> long<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.150> should<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.360> oh<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
out how long it should be oh that's a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
out how long it should be oh that's a
really<00:01:28.829> good<00:01:28.950> point<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.939> stretch<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
really good point just stretch it

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.620 
really good point just stretch it
because<00:01:30.750> these<00:01:31.049> things<00:01:31.320> stretch<00:01:31.850> now<00:01:32.850> keep<00:01:33.479> on

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
because these things stretch now keep on

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.630 
because these things stretch now keep on
going<00:01:34.409> luck<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.860> walking<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
