might be the right shape here and I like

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.950 
might be the right shape here and I like
to<00:01:23.640> think<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> eyebrow<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.479> three

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
to think of the eyebrow in three

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.480 
to think of the eyebrow in three
different<00:01:25.439> sections<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
different sections so we like the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.359 
different sections so we like the
beginning<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.180> middle<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.110> end<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:29.280> I'm

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
beginning the middle and the end so I'm

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.249 
beginning the middle and the end so I'm
gonna<00:01:29.490> focus<00:01:29.759> right<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.780> beginning

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
gonna focus right now on the beginning

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.160 
gonna focus right now on the beginning
of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.680> eyebrow<00:01:32.100> which<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> then<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> inner

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
of the eyebrow which is then the inner

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.630 
of the eyebrow which is then the inner
eyebrow<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.159> we're<00:01:35.250> gonna<00:01:35.400> go<00:01:35.460> ahead<00:01:35.520> and

eyebrow and you can see we've only
sprayed<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.120> outer<00:02:21.299> corner<00:02:21.569> now<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.140> can

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
sprayed just this outer corner now I can

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.900 
sprayed just this outer corner now I can
use<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.650> different<00:02:23.099> edge<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.580> different

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
use a different edge of a different

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.670 
use a different edge of a different
stencil<00:02:24.299> if<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.540> wanted<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.440> wanted

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
stencil if I wanted to so if I wanted

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.680 
stencil if I wanted to so if I wanted
the<00:02:25.799> tail<00:02:25.980> end<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.970> front<00:02:27.239> end<00:02:27.390> of

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the tail end of one and the front end of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.320 
the tail end of one and the front end of
another<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.040> do<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:29.489> well<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.239> we're

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
another you can do that as well so we're

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.380 
another you can do that as well so we're
gonna<00:02:30.420> go<00:02:30.569> ahead<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.870> go<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.349> middle<00:02:31.709> and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
gonna go ahead and go to the middle and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.920 
gonna go ahead and go to the middle and
if<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:34.230> wanted<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.680> create<00:02:34.920> color<00:02:35.930> where

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
if you wanted to create color where

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.839 
if you wanted to create color where
there<00:02:37.079> isn't<00:02:37.260> any<00:02:37.620> I'm<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.190> gonna<00:02:38.310> align<00:02:38.640> my

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
there isn't any I'm just gonna align my

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.580 
there isn't any I'm just gonna align my
stencil<00:02:39.269> up<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.540> pretty<00:02:39.840> flush<00:02:40.140> against<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
stencil up and pretty flush against the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.120 
stencil up and pretty flush against the
skin<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> get<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.610> harder<00:02:42.060> line<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:43.680> we're

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
skin so I get that harder line and we're

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.059 
skin so I get that harder line and we're
just<00:02:44.280> gonna<00:02:44.400> go<00:02:44.640> ahead<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.709> spray<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
just gonna go ahead and spray the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
stencil up very lightly and watch the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.369 
stencil up very lightly and watch the
color<00:02:53.180> land<00:02:54.180> onto<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.599> skin<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.959> looks<00:02:55.110> pretty

it's not-it's makeup I like it has a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.879 
it's not-it's makeup I like it has a
nice<00:03:12.030> arch<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.720> yeah<00:03:13.109> it's<00:03:13.319> great<00:03:13.650> it's

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
nice arch to it yeah it's great it's

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.430 
nice arch to it yeah it's great it's
perfect<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.489> think<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.180> it's<00:03:15.900> adding<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.260> little

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
perfect I think and it's adding a little

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.170 
perfect I think and it's adding a little
bit<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.680> fullness<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.400> by<00:03:17.549> adding<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.970> touch

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
bit of fullness just by adding a touch

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.120 
bit of fullness just by adding a touch
of<00:03:18.359> color<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.410> now<00:03:19.530> we're<00:03:19.680> gonna<00:03:19.769> concentrate

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
of color so now we're gonna concentrate

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.319 
of color so now we're gonna concentrate
on<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.790> back<00:03:20.940> end<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.510> stencil<00:03:21.720> here<00:03:22.970> and

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.289 

just<00:03:27.329> do<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.660> tail<00:03:27.900> end<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.700> let<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.880> stencil

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
just do the tail end and let the stencil

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.870 
just do the tail end and let the stencil
do<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.540> work<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.819> now<00:03:34.099> if<00:03:35.099> any<00:03:35.459> gets<00:03:35.730> in

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
do the work for you now if any gets in

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.460 
do the work for you now if any gets in
there<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.150> we're<00:03:36.480> just<00:03:36.510> gonna<00:03:36.750> go<00:03:37.019> ahead<00:03:37.290> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
there and we're just gonna go ahead and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.180 
there and we're just gonna go ahead and
take<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> dry<00:03:38.099> q-tip<00:03:38.959> if<00:03:39.959> any<00:03:40.230> overspray<00:03:40.709> happen

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
take a dry q-tip if any overspray happen

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.979 
take a dry q-tip if any overspray happen
so<00:03:41.340> we'll<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:41.609> take<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> dry<00:03:42.060> q-tip<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.720> roll

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
so we'll just take a dry q-tip and roll

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.330 
so we'll just take a dry q-tip and roll
it<00:03:43.139> over<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.530> area<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:43.889> it<00:03:43.980> will<00:03:44.069> pick<00:03:44.310> it

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
it over that area and it will pick it

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.910 
it over that area and it will pick it

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
okay what do we think and then we'll

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.940 
okay what do we think and then we'll
flip<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.280> do<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.489> other<00:04:08.610> side<00:04:09.950> that's

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950
