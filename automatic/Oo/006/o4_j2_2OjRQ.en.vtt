00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.880
 rabbis hello dear viewers with 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.070
 you kaplan dot ru and forest and lawsuits 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.050
 game for the next release I stumbled 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.210
 for a wonderful game over which 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.510
 worked for several decades 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.510
 amazing graphics of physics and 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.220
 unrealistically addictive in gameplay 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.390
 Generally this masterpiece on your screens 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.390
 will appear through 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:48.550
 stone simulator even really on 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.510
 today's release I looked at the game 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.430
 los angeles street racing 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.070
 the game is racing by 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.680
 city ​​streets los angeles understandable 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.930
 from the name of the game street racing on 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.330
 imported cars on night lanes and 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.670
 central streets cars name 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.640
 ability to be damaged qualitatively 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.160
 worked out car physics behavior 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.840
 on the road it feels like in real life with this 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.920
 we impose developers and 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.990
 pr-manager 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.270
 ah yes well done now we will check it all 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.390
 going into the game I already realized that everything was done 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.200
 top level menu is simply divine 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.200
 the food 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.690
 but actually the menu looks good 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.450
 detailed and sophisticated machine and 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.790
 looking good against the background of the garage 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.729
 you can warm each part of the car in a circle 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.520
 but here are these icons of the menu itself 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.210
 just killed them as if they didn't invent it and 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.580
 drew 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.220
 but just found in google and and added 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.460
 It looks silly and seems to be on dendy 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.530
 some kind of sad in general oh well 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.259
 Pleases that there are graphics settings 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.190
 many different settings and support 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.920
 full hd 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.460
 but these parameters do not draw the game 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.160
 for enjoyment to that all kind of tolerated 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.100
 the game has a variety of career modes 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.500
 fast race time trial and of course 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.260
 the same multiplayer to watch the game take 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.329
 fast run race 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:24.459
 with gods ladies and gentlemen are loading and 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:28.010
 see I certainly did not expect to see something 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.010
 supernatural to direct wow 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.549
 but damn you're serious that this is art house 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.140
 now let you understand why gps is 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.090
 unique device allowing 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.970
 navigate the roads of major 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.299
 highway cities paving the way when you 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.120
 anything and so on but guys just not in 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.709
 this game look closer here as in 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.230
 toy car just sticker 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.319
 And on gps it shows that you will fly out 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.590
 to the sea through two hundred meters while driving on 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.349
 the lively center of los angeles panel 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.930
 cars made poor quality and looks like 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.790
 cardboard liked that you can change the form 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.849
 with a kind of camera change 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.280
 impressed and baht immediately distressed your 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.620
 driver with a transparent head which 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.049
 while driving the gearbox is eroded and 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.239
 you do not touch that feeling 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.549
 air is driven by the arm itself the lever is not 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:29.030
 moves see how the driver can 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:31.400
 shake your feet stuck to the pedals 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.889
 they really don't move at all 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.139
 what kind of invalid cast sits in the car 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.500
 everything looks like soap 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:43.780
 smeared and terribly poor poly 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.780
 riders poly riders 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.000
 keep rolling I can say 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.040
 only one damn but I'm so expert 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.209
 driving that i can't show that the game 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.209
 generally full of trash 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.930
 and 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.900
 management nikakuschaya I will try 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.510
 remove some professional driving 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.140
 and make it clear how difficult and 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.140
 to manage 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.010
 on a long turn his hand 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.070
 twitches vibrates at a speed of 3 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.460
 descent per second here you are every lady so 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.460
 could 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.920
 going into a turn does not just make me 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.320
 feels like a cow on ice 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.390
 there is no grip at all 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.060
 while driving for some reason the lower part 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.160
 erodes as if stretching like a chewing gum 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.230
 why is it not so that on the sides for 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.410
 outside the car body allegedly 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:15.050
 wind speed namely inside the body from 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.150
 steering and panels by the way about the steering wheel you 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.430
 just take a look as the character goes over 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.680
 With his hands it is something like 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:27.860
 juggles balls and does not turn the wheel 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:29.990
 management though even when taking the exam 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.030
 the driving school says it right 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.260
 hold the steering wheel and not touch it 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.870
 entangled 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.880
 although he keeps it right but how he 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.990
 flaps limbs damage machine 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.090
 the developers said that the car 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.850
 collapses in every possible place and 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.220
 the body is not damaged parts of the wheels and 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.470
 like that but they didn't say that 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.810
 lay down from the collisions on the sides of the wheel 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.570
 twist on the opposite side and 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.300
 turning is already impossible if you drive 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.070
 right your car itself will throw up to the side 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.680
 damaged place on the car 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.900
 Well, the style of the game itself worthless career 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.850
 pass boring need to offend 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.980
 a certain number of times one at a time and 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.260
 the same path only with more complex 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.570
 opponents in the general sense of playing 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.960
 career is no better to play fast race 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:21.170
 after work or school again, jokes about 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:26.120
 schoolchildren and if you are very strong 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:28.430
 man, and then I usually, in general, I 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.420
 considered the many cons of them 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:35.360
 it turned out very very much it is paper 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.550
 trees cardboard buildings substandard 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.280
 screenshots of the city in the background salon 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.520
 soiled dim colors game scheme 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.280
 everything looks so sad in this style and 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.450
 so it is not interesting if to discuss everything 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:53.060
 then the release will last for minutes 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:55.729
 let's summarize the game I give in 5 out of 10 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:59.740
 really so much because i 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.740
 played it when I was helping 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.960
 for all the time spent on this game 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.780
 there was no broken key here 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.830
 such a short and clear release gave 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:15.350
 understand that it is not necessary to play this sponsor 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.230
 showing cop the dot ru movie made 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.990
 forces emb Dear viewers send 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.130
 games for future releases all good luck 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.500
 bye Bye 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:31.860
 oh god finally how much can it 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.860
 in russia give me water and want water 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:35.719
 but 

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.010
 but
