00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.680
 de 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.649
 beautiful and water dressing procedure 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.319
 and mine but that Kronberg OMV is now like a finger exercise 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.109
 but the 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.720
 the lessening of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.650
 this exercise thanks 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.130
 a harness as the exercise success and indeed the Elbe comes in the index finger 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.800
 in the second and Dr 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
 we should 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.470
 Emana dollars 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.339
 Munich 5 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.500
 but behind the desk 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.580
 choose 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.270
 that is tomorrow in the second fret 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.270
 November 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.630
 and so who tries up to 200 percent 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.090
 because you should not have anyone 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 at the moment very private open Trittin and then again serious 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.220
 and the whole thing is done in principle so alternately 2 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.220
 Ulm 3 Bully 2 03 lol 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.410
 yes and more happens then I come as you still have to look for yes to 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 War" 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.000
 and so on 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.520
 and currently sitting reminded felt 90 BP in Bahrain 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.680
 back 3 Dr Krenz showed 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.170
 Grenzach-Wyhlen 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.170
 1 and 2 and Cologne and Trier and Cologne 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.350
 and you are in between percent so why so Kleinhans 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.459
 for tennis training need to realize that the people is going on 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.729
 something Rasmussen exaggerated 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.919
 Amon and every now and then almost as easy as a year, that's right 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.079
 that has me right 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.549
 you should be able to do both so well 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.659
 He has the measure to be cool if you go to war without it 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.659
 to end involuntarily so really 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:37.589
 and percent then you can try it out so to speak about us 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.589
 try him Â«If the club leadership 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.079
 they had from the 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.919
 and samples 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.650
 Peter Thoma notes that at least under the Peter he had to necessarily 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.649
 Percent professional in front of one hundred thousand euros 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.039
 that relatively much and always so Claas Danielsen at the wipe out and always 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.049
 and iCloud unaware of childhood 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.049
 the conclusion is shit on it 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.669
 so that the second exercise 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.749
 it is that one percent finger puts a second colorful side 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.389
 Cameron 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.389
 in the fourth volume 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.679
 I mention 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.679
 louder 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:35.709
 London or rust 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.709
 and they want to play 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.179
 for 1 4 percent 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.179
 7 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.589
 and you know that again 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:19.259
 Joop always enjoy the way Buhrow loves her son 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.229
 push with the dome over there 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.020
 and anyway and anyway, and finally, clauses became too 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.849
 Lodging or already colorful and plus
