 have you heard of wheeling bike in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.360
 mode is gaining many 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.220
 and dominates the streets of a 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.440
 neighborhood of south zone of são paulo 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.500
 see video reportage of renata

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.149
 the neighborhood of the trees of grajaú south zone 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.600
 the city of são paulo practice is a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:43.350
 pretty radical on two wheels 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.780
 [Music] 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.879
 the famous grajaú park of trees 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 came about because someone went by train and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.110
 saw the street we saw our street is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.969
 wide and near the station turned 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.670
 bridge reaching the end more than 150 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.550
 practitioners here 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.379
 [Music] 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.030
 When you 're prancing, you're 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.010
 practicing in neighborhoods are maneuvers 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.229
 performed on a wheel only with the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.170
 and with the back to front 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.700
 front we do not like 6 rl and grade 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.390
 than the crank with the rear wheel in the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.390
 floor 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.320
 I think everyone is already 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.789
 tried and even because I have 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.369
 sure you already have all that leads 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.259
 steep there is today easier to 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.750
 people know cultural with athletes who 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.850
 are references in sport training 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.229
 a lot of dedication and comes from the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.329
 videos on youtube as I said go 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.049
 much ease is is that is the effort 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.049
 briefly 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.120
 how does this feeling of you have 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.890
 taken care of the piece here and it's good, right? 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.300
 good but we see when it has to give 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.930
 a shared one too 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.040
 for the characteristic of a bicycle 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.650
 first I think it 's the picture that is 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.210
 very low yes no use replacement one 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.520
 of the greatest characteristics is that the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.640
 People use horseshoe brake in front of him. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.470
 not hang like I vibrated the disc as 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.120
 if it was a robot it is if the bank is 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.070
 leaning back we get very 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.259
 more comfortable when late already on the wheel 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.020
 one front wheels that are strong for 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.180
 damn on what these double wall 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.180
 but they are also heavy 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.200
 [Music] 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.510
 It's a card I stay but there are people who do not 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.390
 Not that I'm already used to it and my team 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.760
 only opponent of prophet boys spend 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.580
 tire after I saw that I could do other 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.590
 things I never wanted to stop and let's go 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.450
 perform where the base maneuver was 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.370
 cast bike i put left foot o 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.170
 support that my base is not five 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.640
 synchronously I use the brake 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.739
 The front pushes my body to 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.330
 front 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.580
 the beauty that is not in the support that is the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.510
 my right leg in the case is used with 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.670
 balance 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.560
 today I have a value in sport I can 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.019
 pass the sport on by other people 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.370
 through the portal he takes videos does 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.260
 with which other people can also 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.420
 practice and that happiness that I 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.200
 I have the bike is literally me 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.790
 saved 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:12.739
 bike is cool cyclists can board 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.130
 on cptm trains with their bikes 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.930
 on Saturdays after two in the afternoon and 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.240
 Sundays and holidays they can 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:28.419
 board all day 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.419
