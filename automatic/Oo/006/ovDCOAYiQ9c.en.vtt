 nice modali welcome to this new one 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.380
 tutorial 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.050
 today he tells you about the door to gun this 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.480
 mode is really easy to install and 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.730
 it's very pretty because it adds several 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.659
 minecraft things that are precisely to 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.730
 game portal gun and then let's move on 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.300
 immediately to the tutoring because spotlight already 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.159
 he did it 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.319
 spotlight and I invite you to watch it and if 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.269
 I wasn't very clear if you want ve 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:34.960
 I do it again so I do n't know ask for it 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.230
 you then go to the tutorial click 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.580
 on the link and description that will take you 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.270
 to the minecraft forum page of the 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.640
 door to can 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.480
 and this page which are the downloads of 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.100
 minecraft fulgi we go down that 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.600
 We did the most important thing 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.400
 it would be from one of the mods that is 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.320
 quite complex and we have to do 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.700
 the different steps then we go down into 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.160
 bass 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.930
 let's go up to download and click on 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.540
 this link 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.520
 hichan precisely vs 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.079
 so once you get here you have to 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.119
 go down again and click on 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.899
 download 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.569
 then here you have to click look here where 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:18.600
 I highlighted you can click on 

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:22.299
 primary now wait because it is on the fly 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.630
 wait 5 seconds for example 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.700
 click ahead and here will take you on who 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.859
 for hosts that were supposed to say is 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.429
 a kind of mediafire must have been 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.959
 this is the download of this mod 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.990
 hold down and click on download 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.639
 now eb download the mod 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.020
 now let's go to the other link e 

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:43.569
 click here 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.609
 on universal but I tried 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.499
 this last version and it doesn't work for me 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:49.869
 so I suggest you use the 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:52.329
 previous versions mainly because 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.399
 here it says what version it is 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:59.889
 6.0 point 1.339 is required upon request 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.099
 so I suggest you use that 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:04.420
 or use what I know as 6.3 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:10.030
 zero point that 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:14.910
 we can't not grow that because 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.989
 instead with a 6.4.1 grÃ cia ok now 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.340
 download these files to put on 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.430
 desktop 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.709
 we go to 100% percent 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.680
 I then find myself not even roaming we go 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.989
 in point minecraft bing and open 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.019
 minecraft marco willard winzip or six 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.019
 months 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:42.850
 now we delete half inc and we issue 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.380
 point been on one side of the desktop 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.019
 because this will serve us later 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.200
 while minecraft forum we put it here and 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.450
 open the zip file of minecraft force e 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.989
 let's move all the minecraft point files 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:02.500
 yard ok you can close minecraft forge 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.870
 and now deleted half ok once that 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.239
 you have done this step 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.209
 you can also open minecraft to see 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.920
 if you installed it rightly I ran away 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.109
 I don't advise you to do it because you see 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.390
 just time because so many easy to 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.030
 install it then we go from Rome to the dot 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.640
 minecraft and create a new folder 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.220
 call mode with the final s mod 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.109
 if you already have it you don't have to create while 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.700
 are you have create it 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.780
 then we put the file inside 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.209
 zip stitch and the wife here is not here 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.970
 you have to extract it because otherwise the bike 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.560
 it doesn't work and so you saved the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.160
 fashion is really very easy like me 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.510
 he had said and then I greet you and there 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.549

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.930
