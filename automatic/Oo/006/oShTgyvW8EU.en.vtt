00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.030 
would give it an 8 so yeah I would say
that<00:05:58.650> if<00:05:59.640> you<00:06:00.150> had<00:06:00.330> to<00:06:00.480> do<00:06:00.630> versus<00:06:01.170> the<00:06:01.500> mascara

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
that if you had to do versus the mascara

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.670 
that if you had to do versus the mascara
rocket<00:06:02.880> balling<00:06:03.210> would<00:06:03.390> probably<00:06:04.080> went<00:06:04.350> on

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
rocket balling would probably went on

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.340 
rocket balling would probably went on
like<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.910> case<00:06:06.210> and<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.690> brush<00:06:06.960> and<00:06:07.260> the

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
like the case and the brush and the

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.940 
like the case and the brush and the
style<00:06:07.820> but<00:06:08.820> I<00:06:09.120> would<00:06:09.270> say<00:06:09.480> the<00:06:09.630> curl<00:06:10.050> one<00:06:10.740> the

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
style but I would say the curl one the

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.710 
style but I would say the curl one the
other<00:06:11.070> one<00:06:11.310> would<00:06:11.550> have<00:06:11.730> to<00:06:11.790> win<00:06:12.120> on<00:06:12.480> the

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
other one would have to win on the

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.230 
other one would have to win on the
length<00:06:12.930> so<00:06:13.530> yeah<00:06:13.680> so<00:06:14.310> hope<00:06:14.460> you<00:06:14.580> guys<00:06:14.640> enjoyed
