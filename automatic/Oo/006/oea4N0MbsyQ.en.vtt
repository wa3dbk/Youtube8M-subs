00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
because I had watched a lot of YouTube

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.430 
because I had watched a lot of YouTube
videos<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:03.180> people<00:02:03.390> getting<00:02:03.600> their<00:02:04.020> symptom

videos of people getting their symptom

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.400 
videos of people getting their symptom
pissed<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.300> bad<00:02:06.600> idea<00:02:06.660> by<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.290> way

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
pissed and that is a bad idea by the way

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.850 
pissed and that is a bad idea by the way
don't<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.450> literally<00:02:09.450> everyone<00:02:09.860> started

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
don't do that literally everyone started

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.460 
don't do that literally everyone started
crying<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:12.209> few<00:02:12.420> people<00:02:12.840> nearly<00:02:13.110> passed

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
crying and a few people nearly passed

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.040 
crying and a few people nearly passed
out<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:14.250> mean<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.790> guess<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.150> pain<00:02:15.360> depends<00:02:15.900> on

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
out I mean I guess the pain depends on

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.350 
out I mean I guess the pain depends on
your<00:02:16.200> no<00:02:16.410> structure<00:02:17.040> your<00:02:17.310> piercer<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.150> your

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
your no structure your piercer and your

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.110 
your no structure your piercer and your
pain<00:02:18.600> tolerance<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.880> didn't

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
pain tolerance so just because it didn't

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.790 
pain tolerance so just because it didn't
have<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.420> me<00:02:21.600> doesn't<00:02:21.959> mean<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.680> won't

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
have for me doesn't mean that it won't

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.400
