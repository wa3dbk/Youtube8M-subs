00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.360 
you can see the reflections look a bit
 up<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.930> basically<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
 up because it's basically a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
 up because it's basically a
little<00:00:47.940> bit<00:00:48.210> offset<00:00:48.660> which<00:00:48.840> makes<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.350> look

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
little bit offset which makes it look

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.940 
little bit offset which makes it look
weird

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
weird

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.400 
weird
another<00:00:50.760> thing<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.149> looks<00:00:51.480> weird<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:52.140> these

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
another thing that looks weird are these

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.729 
another thing that looks weird are these
walls<00:00:53.070> between<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.090> city<00:00:54.449> part<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
walls between the city part it's

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.770 
walls between the city part it's
basically<00:00:56.370> an<00:00:56.760> image<00:00:57.079> on<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.800> don't<00:00:59.430> know<00:00:59.780> but

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
basically an image on I don't know but

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.250 
basically an image on I don't know but
other<00:01:01.379> than<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.710> I'd<00:01:02.699> say<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.809> really

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
other than that I'd say this is a really

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.830 
other than that I'd say this is a really
nice<00:01:04.439> looking<00:01:04.710> map<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.400> mean<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.600> see

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
nice looking map and I mean you can see

nice looking map and I mean you can see
those<00:01:07.580> apartments<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:09.470> do<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> map

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
those apartments I do think that the map

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.370 
those apartments I do think that the map
map<00:01:11.909> creator<00:01:12.600> actually<00:01:13.380> did<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.770> entirety

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
houses and places to go here actually

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.090 
houses and places to go here actually
and<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.330> course<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.930> looks<00:02:39.200> much<00:02:39.500> bigger<00:02:39.860> than

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
and of course it looks much bigger than

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.910 
and of course it looks much bigger than
it<00:02:40.160> actually<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.780> but<00:02:41.780> there<00:02:41.959> are<00:02:42.170> lots<00:02:42.680> of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
it actually is but there are lots of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.550 
it actually is but there are lots of
apartments<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.910> mean<00:02:44.150> there<00:02:44.720> are<00:02:44.930> not<00:02:45.170> so

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
apartments and I mean there are not so

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.040 
apartments and I mean there are not so
many<00:02:45.800> people<00:02:46.370> on<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.850> regular<00:02:47.540> role<00:02:47.780> play

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
many people on a regular role play

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.350 
many people on a regular role play
servers<00:02:48.530> um<00:02:48.770> I<00:02:48.920> mean<00:02:49.100> it's<00:02:49.310> completely<00:02:49.760> enough

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
servers um I mean it's completely enough

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.360 
servers um I mean it's completely enough
and<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:51.680> think<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.280> well<00:02:52.880> bank<00:02:54.190> ok

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
and I think that well bank ok

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.820 
and I think that well bank ok
this<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.270> shorten<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.780> up<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> really

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
this to shorten it up this is a really

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.490 
this to shorten it up this is a really
good<00:02:57.950> role<00:02:58.250> plane<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.820> moviemaking<00:02:59.330> map<00:03:00.260> I

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
good role plane and moviemaking map I

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.680 
good role plane and moviemaking map I
know<00:03:00.560> have<00:03:00.950> been<00:03:01.060> making<00:03:02.709> quite<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:03.770> lot<00:03:04.130> of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
know have been making quite a lot of

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.720 
know have been making quite a lot of
those<00:03:05.690> maps<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.560> that's<00:03:06.950> because<00:03:07.400> they

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
those maps and that's because they

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.060 
those maps and that's because they
differ<00:03:08.090> mostly<00:03:08.600> from<00:03:09.350> each<00:03:09.500> other<00:03:09.739> depending

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
differ mostly from each other depending

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.780 
differ mostly from each other depending
on<00:03:10.459> what<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.700> want<00:03:10.959> if<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.290> have<00:03:12.470> other<00:03:12.790> types

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
on what you want if you have other types

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.830 
on what you want if you have other types
of<00:03:14.060> maps<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.200> want<00:03:15.519> then<00:03:16.519> like<00:03:17.180> building<00:03:17.630> maps

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
of maps you want then like building maps

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.949 
of maps you want then like building maps
they<00:03:18.080> tend<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.350> be<00:03:18.470> quite<00:03:18.590> general<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.959> they

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
they tend to be quite general and they

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.590 
they tend to be quite general and they
are<00:03:21.230> hard<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.800> make<00:03:21.980> much<00:03:22.640> better<00:03:23.030> than<00:03:23.420> they

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
are hard to make much better than they

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.590 
are hard to make much better than they
already<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.670> that's<00:03:25.910> basically<00:03:26.450> the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
already is so that's basically the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.320 
already is so that's basically the
reason<00:03:28.450> well<00:03:29.450> place<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.440> map<00:03:30.709> should<00:03:31.100> be

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
reason well place of this map should be

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.259 
reason well place of this map should be
experienced<00:03:32.330> by<00:03:32.420> car<00:03:33.140> so<00:03:33.489> we<00:03:34.489> will<00:03:34.700> just<00:03:35.060> take

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
experienced by car so we will just take

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:35.920 
experienced by car so we will just take
a<00:03:35.299> little

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
a little

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.339 
a little
look<00:03:36.140> up<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.439> roadways<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.930> can<00:03:39.109> see

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
look up the roadways and you can see

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.069 
look up the roadways and you can see
that<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.859> landscape<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.780> slightly<00:03:41.780> boring

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
that the landscape is slightly boring

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.429 
that the landscape is slightly boring
but<00:03:43.629> well<00:03:44.629> I<00:03:44.900> mean<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:46.579> usually<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.170> like<00:03:48.170> this

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
but well I mean it usually is like this

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.149 
but well I mean it usually is like this
and<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:48.799> is<00:03:49.069> probably<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.730> end<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.480> map

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
and this is probably the end of the map

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.740 
and this is probably the end of the map
and<00:03:52.159> here<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:52.489> also<00:03:52.639> have<00:03:52.819> some<00:03:52.939> villas<00:03:53.510> and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
and here we also have some villas and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.220 
and here we also have some villas and
well<00:03:54.530> this<00:03:54.889> is<00:03:55.099> a<00:03:55.129> map<00:03:55.430> that's<00:03:55.730> not<00:03:55.939> very<00:03:56.239> very

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
well this is a map that's not very very

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.770 
well this is a map that's not very very
system<00:03:57.680> have<00:03:57.829> its<00:03:58.040> its<00:03:58.370> middle<00:03:58.819> middle<00:03:59.420> heavy

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
system have its its middle middle heavy

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.729 
system have its its middle middle heavy
I<00:04:00.049> should<00:04:00.799> say<00:04:01.930> here<00:04:02.930> we<00:04:03.079> have<00:04:03.200> another<00:04:03.439> way

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
I should say here we have another way

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.679 
I should say here we have another way
into<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.250> city<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.670> I<00:04:04.849> actually<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.480> this

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
into the city and I actually like this

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:06.339 
into the city and I actually like this
road<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.019> bit

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
road a bit

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.720 
road a bit
this<00:04:07.129> road<00:04:07.430> is<00:04:07.700> quite<00:04:08.060> decent<00:04:09.430> actually<00:04:10.430> for

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
this road is quite decent actually for

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.360 
this road is quite decent actually for
kind<00:04:11.599> of<00:04:11.750> regular<00:04:12.109> racing<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.889> stuff<00:04:13.040> and

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
kind of regular racing and stuff and

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.420 
kind of regular racing and stuff and
that<00:04:13.549> was<00:04:13.609> not<00:04:13.939> very<00:04:14.000> skilled<00:04:14.569> oh<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:16.250> is<00:04:16.400> a

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
that was not very skilled oh this is a

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.930 
that was not very skilled oh this is a
beautiful<00:04:16.729> little<00:04:17.150> area<00:04:17.750> with<00:04:17.930> lakes<00:04:18.289> I

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
beautiful little area with lakes I

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.659 
beautiful little area with lakes I
wonder<00:04:19.940> if<00:04:20.000> they<00:04:20.570> are<00:04:20.599> kind<00:04:21.229> of<00:04:21.440> swimmable<00:04:22.370> or

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
wonder if they are kind of swimmable or

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.409 
wonder if they are kind of swimmable or
something<00:04:23.060> like<00:04:23.210> that

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.080 

here<00:04:25.659> we<00:04:25.810> have<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.020> little<00:04:28.919> dock<00:04:29.919> thingy<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:31.060> a

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
here we have a little dock thingy and a

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.360

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
here we have a end nice map ending they

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.149 
here we have a end nice map ending they
often<00:05:06.669> use<00:05:06.969> those<00:05:07.300> endings<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:08.349> a<00:05:08.379> map<00:05:08.740> when

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
often use those endings to a map when

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.649 
often use those endings to a map when
they<00:05:09.310> just<00:05:09.610> have<00:05:09.849> a<00:05:10.289> well<00:05:11.289> like<00:05:12.099> that<00:05:12.659> well
