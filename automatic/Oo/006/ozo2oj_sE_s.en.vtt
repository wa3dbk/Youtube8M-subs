00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
for and what it isn't we just want to

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.150 
for and what it isn't we just want to
demonstrate<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.470> can't<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
demonstrate what it can and can't do and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.740 
demonstrate what it can and can't do and
either<00:00:23.699> go<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.000> make<00:00:24.119> their<00:00:24.269> own<00:00:24.300> decisions

the power diminishes greatly so that's
part<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:42.840> we're<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.290> today<00:00:43.440> we

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
part of what we're going to do today we

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.580 
part of what we're going to do today we
have<00:00:44.520> federal<00:00:44.899> number<00:00:45.899> eight<00:00:46.050> eleven<00:00:46.410> forty

five feet per second 12-gauge two and
three<00:00:49.020> quarters<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.680> this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
three quarters then we have this

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.310 
three quarters then we have this
three-inch<00:00:50.219> Nitro<00:00:50.579> Express<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:51.320> twelve

bunch of skin on it
we're<00:01:37.750> going<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:37.960> do<00:01:38.110> is<00:01:38.470> make<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:38.680> little

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
we're going to do is make a little

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.170 
we're going to do is make a little
window<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:40.510> we<00:01:40.600> can<00:01:40.720> take<00:01:40.930> multiple<00:01:41.080> shots<00:01:42.180> so

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
window so we can take multiple shots so

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.940 
window so we can take multiple shots so
the<00:01:43.900> shot<00:01:44.170> will<00:01:44.380> just<00:01:44.500> work<00:01:44.650> its<00:01:44.800> way<00:01:44.920> through

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
the shot will just work its way through

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.790 
the shot will just work its way through
this<00:01:45.280> window<00:01:45.550> had<00:01:46.540> a<00:01:46.570> long<00:01:46.780> range<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.530> won't

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
this window had a long range and won't

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.240 
this window had a long range and won't
expose<00:01:48.100> part<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.730> to<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.710> birdshot<00:01:50.920> at

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
if we get up on the skin if we have some

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.860 
if we get up on the skin if we have some
embedded<00:02:25.500> two<00:02:26.500> pellets<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:30.570> that's<00:02:31.570> all<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.810> can

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
embedded two pellets so that's all I can

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.930 
embedded two pellets so that's all I can
feel

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.060 

these<00:02:35.570> might<00:02:35.840> be<00:02:35.870> deeper<00:02:36.320> pellets<00:02:36.650> here<00:02:36.800> we'll

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
these might be deeper pellets here we'll

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.000 
these might be deeper pellets here we'll
we'll<00:02:37.520> have<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:38.200> cut<00:02:39.200> into<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> little<00:02:39.740> bit

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
