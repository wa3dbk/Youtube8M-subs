00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.380
 it was cold it was fresh on the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.330
 re-launch in preparation for the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.010
 game against FC Groningen and for you 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.990
 at least a man is a whole 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.030
 special competition for him 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.920
 tim matavz he started the competition 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.690
 the northerners but just before it 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.369
 closing the transfer market 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.930
 switch to psv 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.369
 and so there is a special one for him 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.109
 match if you think so well like him 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.510
 of'm crazy politicians do not 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.949
 about the text pointed and my old club 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.320
 but yes that is not even that much 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.570
 special to play against, for example 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.760
 very good friend of yours against tadic 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.079
 yes, of course, it is pleased and daring 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.800
 and maria 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.500
 that it is then not in the photo 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.700
 yes boat under vents sometimes a big 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.960
 really win 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.270
 hobo bag it was a big difference 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.770
 between fc groningen and psv where the land 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.840
 you too far out to as 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.430
 attacks while those at psv are quite whole 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.370
 many have to play football in the small space 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.829
 against the theater against psv everyone wants 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.180
 grab points there and that 's how it really played 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.880
 close and mark 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.490
 hood and well we're in an extended 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.549
 was not every game so you got 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.619
 much more room in motion that that 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.370
 difficult for you after 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.580
 no for me no problem but 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.130
 I think you can do better and better at it 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.110
 the future of the attacker of psv 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.460
 to the trainer who can dispose of 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.640
 an almost fit selection 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.380
 yes that's right but who's in a cover 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.890
 and that is a nice title relationship 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.830
 good 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.780
 that you like floor wisdom and turned one 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.350
 young boy psv 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.210
 another reaction so give it away 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.600
 if you are dealing with sides in a series 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.730
 is this nice that you my everyone 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.380
 on deck you are pleasant too because it is one 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.340
 decent range is with sturdy 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 opponents 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.230
 you think it starts with the one and 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 Tomorrow number chronic for example 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.660
 are now difficult in the last few weeks 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.150
 had started but do week here 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.640
 hands because they are actually stable 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.860
 answers genes and a normal normal 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.119
 good team is but psv has in it 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.690
 Past home too tricky but 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.460
 has had 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.090
 yes that's right t yes that is still fresh 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.060
 the memory and there we are 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.320
 whole west cells better my last 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.470
 place two three minutes 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.910
 Queen or yes scores from a throw-in 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.900
 yes possibilities formidable opponent 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.650
 after a not worse team well me 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.880
 think we are white and scored against 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.640
 groningen 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.010
 after price in but that should not be from the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.750
 important it is that some papers 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.640
 plant what those three points are 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.050
 important in the race for the national title 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.340
 psv gets a few sturdy 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.830
 opponents choose 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.900
 tomorrow evening fc groningen next week 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.700
 the tricky away game is in the tub 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.120
 in Rotterdam against Feyenoord on it 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.190
 program 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.190
 but money for home games 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.720
 play choice we want 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.010
 yes if you can become flowers you have to 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.410
 Home games must have gotten young in three 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.360
 points and we go for it 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.200
 no injuries and suspensions thus 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.200
 no surprise in the setup 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.300
 Normally Kevin returns again 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.890
 back and stand that so beats that 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.140
 as far as everyone is concerned 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.989
 very clear and also not so 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.660
 surprisingly tyton already on the couch 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.810
 no I do n't look at that yet 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.130
 who will give you those very long days with and 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.130
 you down tomorrow and not yet
