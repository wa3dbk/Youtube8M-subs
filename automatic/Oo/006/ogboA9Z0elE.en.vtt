00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.370
 plus 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:26.630
 in that quarter of a mile to come back with 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.980
 more and more 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.980
 daily 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.060
 in Youtube 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.580

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.920
 no no 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.610
 and I do not 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.440
 natural 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.440
 the rabbit 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:23.920
 and you know what happens I felt that what 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:34.180
 you did very well I feel you taking care of yourself 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:36.849
 I would tell you, you can do so many 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.410
 things with your voice you need to have 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:48.790
 Trust is truly spectacular 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:54.550
 it's super well all mounted and danced 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.350
 your voice all that but if you in as in your 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.380
 appearance 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.830
 you are not connected with all that we 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.820
 let's lose 100 of other things and you 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.380
 you have to catch lighter in this 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.660
 moment is more important to receive 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.200
 with his magnificent advice, really lolas 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.020
 what happened 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.210
 honestly that happened with all the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.970
 production that ate 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.750
 it is as if you had taken three steps 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.209
 behind 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.840
 choreographed insisted stockings when you 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:37.060
 we have seen will be 100 no no no pardon 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:40.239
 she says she is beautiful beautiful there was a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.849
 impeccable execution not now now 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.319
 let's have something else I also noticed it 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.019
 little nervous but that does not mean 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.970
 that we do not have a singer there that 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.069
 hour that goes out to defend a number what 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.620
 does with the quality with the decision that 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.989
 he does home honestly lola think about it 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.060
 please I already thought about it if I saw it 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.720
 better the audience looks at the best 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.720
 public does not know 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.550
 and many of the concerts of the 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.820
 big stars are doing tests 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.060
 of the profiles and dancing and singing in 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.070
 alive 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.110
 carla happiness of watching the masters 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.070
 we all agree 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.070
 You were incredible 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:29.080
 but I have not seen much better but in that 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.400
 in everything totally not totally hate 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.620
 physically he was not even seen in the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.600
 look that he thought he could not see 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.260
 so that's why I ask him what happens 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.890
 because when it is already there it is there to 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.080
 get a step back no no arcs 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.450
 or by others speak the portraitist who 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.070
 you took a step back and I did not feel that 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.520
 I gave it back but I did not feel that 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.520
 of 100 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.540

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.220
