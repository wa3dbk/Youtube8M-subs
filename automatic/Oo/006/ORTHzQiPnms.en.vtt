um<00:00:00.089> in<00:00:01.020> 1882<00:00:01.939> there<00:00:02.939> was<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.440> dentist<00:00:04.440> slash

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
um in 1882 there was a dentist slash

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.430 
um in 1882 there was a dentist slash
scientist<00:00:05.520> or<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:05.970> pretty<00:00:06.720> sure<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.109> dentist

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
scientist or I pretty sure the dentist

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.780 
scientist or I pretty sure the dentist
named<00:00:08.130> WD<00:00:08.849> Miller<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.870> what<00:00:10.620> he<00:00:10.830> did<00:00:11.219> was<00:00:11.250> he

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
named WD Miller and what he did was he

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.430 
named WD Miller and what he did was he
took<00:00:12.320> a<00:00:13.670> tooth<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:15.059> extracted<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.960> he

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
took a tooth that was extracted and he

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.710 
took a tooth that was extracted and he
put<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.859> test<00:00:17.100> tube<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.699> he<00:00:18.270> put<00:00:18.480> some

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
put it in test tube and he put some

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.950 
put it in test tube and he put some
human<00:00:19.260> saliva<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.010> some<00:00:20.699> bread<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.750> test

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
human saliva and some bread in the test

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.140 
human saliva and some bread in the test
tube<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:24.650> over<00:00:25.650> time<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.640> test<00:00:26.910> tube

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
tube and over time in this test tube

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.450 
tube and over time in this test tube
experiment<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.170> tooth<00:00:28.439> started<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> pure

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
experiment the tooth started the pure

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.889 
experiment the tooth started the pure
ating<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.230> he<00:00:31.230> said<00:00:31.579> look<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.270> found<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
ating and he said look we have found a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.190 
ating and he said look we have found a
mechanism<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.770> teeth<00:00:35.190> decay<00:00:35.809> for<00:00:36.809> teeth<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
mechanism for teeth decay for teeth a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.819 
mechanism for teeth decay for teeth a
per<00:00:37.500> tooth<00:00:37.649> decay<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.840> that's<00:00:40.140> where<00:00:40.590> our

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
per tooth decay and and that's where our

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.610 
per tooth decay and and that's where our
modern<00:00:41.309> theory<00:00:41.520> has<00:00:41.760> come<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:43.200> theory

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
modern theory has come from the theory

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.580 
modern theory has come from the theory
that<00:00:43.649> acid<00:00:44.399> or<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> bacteria<00:00:45.600> eat<00:00:45.840> sugar<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
that acid or that bacteria eat sugar and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.940 
that acid or that bacteria eat sugar and
it<00:00:47.250> causes<00:00:47.430> acid<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.390> dissolve<00:00:48.510> our<00:00:48.840> teeth<00:00:49.050> but

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it causes acid to dissolve our teeth but

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.970 
it causes acid to dissolve our teeth but
I<00:00:50.250> looked<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:50.910> his<00:00:51.059> information<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.020> he<00:00:52.680> says

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
I looked up his information and he says

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.279 
I looked up his information and he says
in<00:00:53.219> his<00:00:53.280> own<00:00:53.610> words<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.510> don't<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> court

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
in his own words I don't have the court

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.900 
in his own words I don't have the court
exacting<00:00:55.739> framing<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.399> his<00:00:56.489> own<00:00:56.579> words<00:00:56.820> he

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
exacting framing but in his own words he

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
exacting framing but in his own words he
says<00:00:57.949> yes<00:00:59.000> acid<00:01:00.000> dissolves<00:01:00.539> teeth<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
says yes acid dissolves teeth but a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.630 
says yes acid dissolves teeth but a
healthy<00:01:02.699> tooth<00:01:02.910> does<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.690> decay<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:07.640> 2010

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
healthy tooth does not decay so in 2010

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.399 
healthy tooth does not decay so in 2010
we<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> American<00:01:09.960> Dental<00:01:10.110> Association

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
we go to the American Dental Association

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.399 
we go to the American Dental Association
website<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:12.030> tell<00:01:12.299> us<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:13.049> want<00:01:13.290> us<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
website and they tell us they want us to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
website and they tell us they want us to
believe<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.040> bacteria<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:15.630> caused

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
believe that bacteria is what caused

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.520 
believe that bacteria is what caused
tooth<00:01:16.170> decay<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.740> they<00:01:17.490> left<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:19.259> very

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
tooth decay and they left out this very

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.380 
tooth decay and they left out this very
important<00:01:20.009> point<00:01:20.280> from<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> original<00:01:21.060> theory

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
important point from the original theory

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.499 
important point from the original theory
and<00:01:21.600> by<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> way<00:01:22.830> healthy<00:01:23.670> teeth<00:01:23.820> don't<00:01:24.150> decay

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and by the way healthy teeth don't decay

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.690 
and by the way healthy teeth don't decay
even<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.259> there's<00:01:25.439> acid<00:01:25.680> even<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.520> there's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
even if there's acid even if there's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.460 
even if there's acid even if there's
bacteria<00:01:26.939> even<00:01:27.840> sugar

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
bacteria even sugar

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.840 
bacteria even sugar
I'm<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.640> happen<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.799> tell<00:01:32.759> me

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
I'm not going to happen and tell me

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
I'm not going to happen and tell me
about<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.060> property<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.990> sugar<00:01:34.380> that's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
about that property of sugar that's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.230 
about that property of sugar that's
really<00:01:35.009> interesting<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.820> comes<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
really interesting when it comes to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.120 
really interesting when it comes to
bacteria<00:01:39.049> until<00:01:40.049> you've<00:01:40.170> carefully<00:01:40.770> studied

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
bacteria until you've carefully studied

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.230 
bacteria until you've carefully studied
the<00:01:41.159> book<00:01:41.840> I'll<00:01:42.840> read<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:45.090> sugar<00:01:45.780> has<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:47.240> if

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the book I'll read it the sugar has a if

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
the book I'll read it the sugar has a if
you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> lot<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> sugar<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.070> put<00:01:50.280> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you have a lot of sugar and you put it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
you have a lot of sugar and you put it
on<00:01:50.430> bacteria<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.180> dehydrates<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.140> they

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
on bacteria it dehydrates them so they

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.410 
on bacteria it dehydrates them so they
all<00:01:52.380> die<00:01:52.649> sugars<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.820> used<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
all die sugars that I used as a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.690 
all die sugars that I used as a
preservative<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.259> foods<00:01:55.829> because<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
preservative in foods because it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.670 
preservative in foods because it
prevents<00:01:57.180> bacterial<00:01:57.689> growth<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.469> how<00:01:58.619> does

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
prevents bacterial growth so how does

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.569 
prevents bacterial growth so how does
sugar<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.460> your<00:01:59.520> tea<00:02:00.119> feed<00:02:00.570> bacteria<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.680> you

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
sugar on your tea feed bacteria if you

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.130 
sugar on your tea feed bacteria if you
had<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> small<00:02:03.180> amounts<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.630> sugar<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.960> would

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
had a small amounts of sugar it would

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.410 
had a small amounts of sugar it would
but<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.649> ate<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> lot<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.100> sugar<00:02:05.240> which<00:02:06.240> we

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
but if you ate a lot of sugar which we

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.499 
but if you ate a lot of sugar which we
know<00:02:06.570> isn't<00:02:06.990> good<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.590> us<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
know isn't good for us it's not going to

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.590 
know isn't good for us it's not going to
promote<00:02:09.810> decay<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.979> surface<00:02:11.459> necessarily

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
promote decay on the surface necessarily

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.090 
promote decay on the surface necessarily
exactly<00:02:14.600> uh<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.930> love<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.830> when<00:02:15.980> you're

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
exactly uh I love that when you're

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.320 
exactly uh I love that when you're
talking<00:02:16.280> about<00:02:16.490> that<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:16.970> book<00:02:17.120> because

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
talking about that in the book because

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.790 
talking about that in the book because
