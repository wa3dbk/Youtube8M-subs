tube just painted the drive and you can
see<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> tubes<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.620> pretty<00:00:58.769> good<00:00:58.859> shape

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
see the tubes are in pretty good shape

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.229 
see the tubes are in pretty good shape
I<00:00:59.570> blunt<00:01:00.570> last<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:01.049> a<00:01:01.109> long<00:01:01.229> time<00:01:02.149> here<00:01:03.149> are

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I blunt last for a long time here are

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
I blunt last for a long time here are
the<00:01:03.329> tubes<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:04.289> another<00:01:04.530> perspective

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the tubes from another perspective

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.990 
the tubes from another perspective
you'll<00:01:05.759> see<00:01:05.939> they're<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.509> really<00:01:06.810> good<00:01:07.020> shape

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
you'll see they're in really good shape

you'll see they're in really good shape
you<00:01:09.000> got<00:01:09.149> your<00:01:09.270> front<00:01:09.509> storage<00:01:09.990> compartment

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you got your front storage compartment

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.669 
you got your front storage compartment
here<00:01:11.929> and<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.080> actually<00:01:16.259> has<00:01:16.649> a

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
here and this one actually has a

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.100 
here and this one actually has a
late-model<00:01:19.700> 2006

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
late-model 2006

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.639 
late-model 2006
Cummins<00:01:22.110> loader<00:01:23.840> which<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.409> is

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
Cummins loader which you can see is

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:32.139 
Cummins loader which you can see is
really<00:01:26.490> super<00:01:26.850> clean<00:01:29.539> it's<00:01:30.539> a<00:01:30.600> little<00:01:30.810> dusty

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
really super clean it's a little dusty

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.690 
really super clean it's a little dusty
but<00:01:33.149> like<00:01:33.690> I<00:01:33.720> said<00:01:33.929> this<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.289> late<00:01:34.799> 2006

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
but like I said this was a late 2006

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.359 
but like I said this was a late 2006
it's<00:01:35.940> got<00:01:36.090> less<00:01:36.299> than<00:01:36.450> 100<00:01:36.780> hours<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.369> it's

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it's got less than 100 hours on it it's

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's got less than 100 hours on it it's
went<00:01:38.580> to<00:01:38.670> Cummins<00:01:39.000> factory<00:01:39.420> recons<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:41.990> lot<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
went to Cummins factory recons a lot of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.419 
went to Cummins factory recons a lot of
overkill<00:01:43.289> when<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.619> comes<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> boats<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.310> got

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
overkill when it comes to boats I got

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.539 
overkill when it comes to boats I got
the<00:01:44.549> Perko<00:01:44.880> mm<00:01:45.689> raw<00:01:46.649> water<00:01:46.830> strainer<00:01:47.220> you've

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the Perko mm raw water strainer you've

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.740 
the Perko mm raw water strainer you've
got<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> freshwater<00:01:48.720> flush<00:01:49.229> system<00:01:50.750> really

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
got the freshwater flush system really

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.199 
got the freshwater flush system really
no<00:01:51.869> electronics<00:01:52.500> at<00:01:52.679> all<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.190> this<00:01:53.399> boat<00:01:53.610> very

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
no electronics at all on this boat very

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.889 
no electronics at all on this boat very
simple<00:01:54.750> they<00:01:54.989> build<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.349> for<00:01:56.780> 145,000<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
simple they build them for 145,000 and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.770 
simple they build them for 145,000 and
they're<00:01:57.989> just<00:01:58.259> bulletproof

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
they're just bulletproof

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.050 
they're just bulletproof
you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.989> put<00:02:01.200> probably<00:02:01.440> 5,000<00:02:02.250> hours<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.700> some

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you can put probably 5,000 hours on some

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.830 
you can put probably 5,000 hours on some
of<00:02:03.149> these<00:02:03.239> boats<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.720> 15,000<00:02:04.590> hours<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.950> them

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
of these boats have 15,000 hours on them

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.080 
of these boats have 15,000 hours on them
so<00:02:06.840> they're<00:02:06.989> in<00:02:07.110> pretty<00:02:07.319> good<00:02:07.440> shape<00:02:10.879> this<00:02:11.879> is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
so they're in pretty good shape this is

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.240 
so they're in pretty good shape this is
the<00:02:12.209> fuel<00:02:12.390> tank<00:02:12.690> right<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:12.989> here<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.830> 34

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
the fuel tank right up here it's 34

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.830 
the fuel tank right up here it's 34
gallons<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.760> can't<00:02:15.000> expand<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.510> probably

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
gallons you can't expand that probably

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.750 
gallons you can't expand that probably
for<00:02:15.989> about<00:02:16.110> 70<00:02:16.590> or<00:02:16.620> 80<00:02:16.830> very<00:02:17.640> simple<00:02:18.030> -<00:02:19.760> do

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
for about 70 or 80 very simple - do

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.790 
for about 70 or 80 very simple - do
gauges
