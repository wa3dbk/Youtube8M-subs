00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
in such a small team compared to a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
in such a small team compared to a
Norwegian<00:01:19.950> team<00:01:20.159> which<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.640> everything

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
Norwegian team which have everything

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.140 
Norwegian team which have everything

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
but there's a difference of course

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.219 
but there's a difference of course
there's<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.210> difference<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> new

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
there's a difference I think the new

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.069
