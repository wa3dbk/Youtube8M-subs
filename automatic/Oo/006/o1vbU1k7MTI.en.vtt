00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.560
 remember many things from your childhood 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.390
 too many guys, guys 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.850
 location but you may be seeing 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.220
 without many complications difficulties 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.380
 here on the other side of the street you will see 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.360
 there in two different places 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.480
 It's only you who point Miralles and see the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.440
 single meaning card which is to make 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.510

 was much better than it is now here the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.900
 my opinion then many things come in the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.170
 each one a very cool reference 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.520
 This channel was very fucking 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.560

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.630

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.780
