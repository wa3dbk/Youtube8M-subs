dancers I think we and I been together
can<00:02:26.959> be<00:02:27.110> harder<00:02:27.380> because<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.800> do<00:02:27.980> take<00:02:28.310> things

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
can be harder because you do take things

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.850 
can be harder because you do take things
slightly<00:02:28.820> more<00:02:29.120> personally<00:02:29.720> than<00:02:29.800> how<00:02:30.800> you

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
slightly more personally than how you

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.130 
slightly more personally than how you
would<00:02:31.160> if<00:02:31.280> somebody<00:02:31.640> else<00:02:31.820> told<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.810> because

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
would if somebody else told you because

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.420 
would if somebody else told you because
you<00:02:33.620> know<00:02:33.910> he's<00:02:34.910> supposed<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.239> be<00:02:35.390> nice<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.810> me

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
you know he's supposed to be nice to me

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.970 
you know he's supposed to be nice to me
I'm<00:02:37.430> not<00:02:37.700> telling<00:02:38.000> me<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.090> I'm<00:02:38.300> rubbish<00:02:38.980> but

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
I'm not telling me that I'm rubbish but

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.240 
I'm not telling me that I'm rubbish but
I<00:02:40.010> think<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.790> also<00:02:41.769> can<00:02:42.769> be<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.950> good<00:02:43.070> thing

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
I think it also can be a good thing

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.460 
I think it also can be a good thing
because<00:02:43.310> obviously<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.930> care<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.260> lot<00:02:45.410> about

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
because obviously we care a lot about

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.740 
because obviously we care a lot about
each<00:02:45.800> other<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.130> we<00:02:46.400> both<00:02:46.610> want<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.090> best<00:02:47.600> for

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
each other so we both want the best for

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.220 
each other so we both want the best for
each<00:02:47.810> other<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.290> feature<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:49.100> look<00:02:49.250> good

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
each other and feature to look good

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.620 
each other and feature to look good
