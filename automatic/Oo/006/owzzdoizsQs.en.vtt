00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.300 
saying not a great idea a lot of what's
going<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.500> with<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.770> environment<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:43.229> US

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
going on with the environment we US

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.660 
going on with the environment we US
people<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:46.329> are<00:01:46.720> causing<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.680> we<00:01:48.159> have<00:01:48.400> to<00:01:48.549> do

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
people you are causing it we have to do

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.890 
people you are causing it we have to do
our<00:01:48.790> part<00:01:48.939> in<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.150> environment<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:49.689> that<00:01:49.720> we

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
our part in the environment so that we

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.200 
our part in the environment so that we
can<00:01:50.049> pass<00:01:50.170> on<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.650> world<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.729> our<00:01:51.820> children

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
can pass on a world to our children

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.560 
can pass on a world to our children
right<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.560> if<00:01:54.070> we<00:01:54.759> have<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.909> part<00:01:55.180> what's<00:01:55.360> going

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
right so if we have a part what's going

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.749 
right so if we have a part what's going
on<00:01:55.689> with<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.840> environment<00:01:56.320> if<00:01:56.470> plastic<00:01:57.250> is

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
on with the environment if plastic is

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.789 
on with the environment if plastic is
apparently<00:01:58.420> emitting<00:01:59.079> something<00:01:59.530> into<00:01:59.770> our

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
apparently emitting something into our

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.620 
apparently emitting something into our
water<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.369> our<00:02:00.460> food<00:02:00.759> from<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.180> bottles<00:02:01.509> and

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
water and our food from the bottles and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.940 
water and our food from the bottles and
the<00:02:01.720> cases<00:02:02.079> and<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.290> things<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.680> we<00:02:02.770> put

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
the cases and the things that we put

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.950 
the cases and the things that we put
them<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.220> we<00:02:03.670> need<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.939> be<00:02:04.030> using<00:02:04.240> reusable

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
them in we need to be using reusable

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.969

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
someone convinced me to buy this this

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.970 
someone convinced me to buy this this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
looks like I have balsamic vinegar or

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.100 
looks like I have balsamic vinegar or
olive<00:02:32.340> oil<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.760> but<00:02:32.940> no<00:02:33.090> no<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.629> for<00:02:33.840> water

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
olive oil in it but no no it's for water

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.809 
olive oil in it but no no it's for water
doesn't<00:02:34.650> carry<00:02:34.920> enough<00:02:35.160> water<00:02:35.340> for<00:02:35.610> me<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
doesn't carry enough water for me and

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.430 
doesn't carry enough water for me and
can<00:02:35.940> check<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.269> in<00:02:36.420> two<00:02:36.540> seconds<00:02:36.959> but

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
can check this in two seconds but

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.530 
can check this in two seconds but
apparently<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.069> dark<00:02:38.340> brown<00:02:38.640> glass<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.269> good

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
apparently the dark brown glass is good

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.020 
apparently the dark brown glass is good
for<00:02:39.569> sun<00:02:40.440> protection<00:02:40.640> especially<00:02:41.640> when<00:02:41.970> you

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
for sun protection especially when you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.000 
for sun protection especially when you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
live somewhere like Los Angeles because

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.970 
live somewhere like Los Angeles because
it's<00:02:44.400> very<00:02:44.580> sunny<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.319> this<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.470> also<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.769> dark

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
it's very sunny here this is also a dark

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.080 
it's very sunny here this is also a dark
water<00:02:47.160> bottle<00:02:47.459> this<00:02:47.549> is<00:02:47.700> from<00:02:47.879> a<00:02:47.910> company

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
water bottle this is from a company

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.270 
water bottle this is from a company
called<00:02:48.269> divine<00:02:48.750> h20<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:49.349> go<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.799> refill<00:02:50.160> my

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
called divine h20 I go and refill my

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.830 
called divine h20 I go and refill my
water<00:02:50.310> there<00:02:50.700> sometimes<00:02:51.120> because<00:02:51.569> it's

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
water there sometimes because it's

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.080 
water there sometimes because it's
alkaline<00:02:52.290> water<00:02:52.470> apparently<00:02:53.310> alkaline<00:02:53.910> water

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
alkaline water apparently alkaline water

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.550 
alkaline water apparently alkaline water
and<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.390> pH<00:02:54.660> balance<00:02:55.049> of<00:02:55.110> your<00:02:55.170> body<00:02:55.260> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and the pH balance of your body is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.930 
and the pH balance of your body is
something<00:02:55.680> that's<00:02:55.920> important<00:02:56.400> that's

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
something that's important that's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.120 
something that's important that's
another<00:02:57.269> post<00:02:57.630> don't<00:02:58.230> know<00:02:58.410> any<00:02:58.560> facts<00:02:58.860> about

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
another post don't know any facts about

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.589 
another post don't know any facts about
that<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.549> do<00:02:59.700> know<00:02:59.849> that<00:03:00.000> I'll<00:03:00.120> try<00:03:00.269> anything

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
that but do know that I'll try anything

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.690 
that but do know that I'll try anything
so<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.500> another<00:03:01.709> reusable<00:03:02.280> water<00:03:02.400> bottle

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
so this is another reusable water bottle

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.920 
so this is another reusable water bottle
that<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.879> use<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.239> like<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.540> keep<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.810> one

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
that I use and I like to keep this one

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.309 
that I use and I like to keep this one
in<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.140> fridge<00:03:04.349> actually<00:03:05.840> there's<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:06.930> one

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
in the fridge actually there's this one

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.660 
in the fridge actually there's this one
this<00:03:07.500> was<00:03:07.680> given<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.920> me<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.220> gift<00:03:08.430> bag

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
this was given to me in a gift bag

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.369 
this was given to me in a gift bag
there's<00:03:09.030> nothing<00:03:09.450> better<00:03:09.599> than<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:09.989> because

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
there's nothing better than this because

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.229 
there's nothing better than this because
you<00:03:10.620> know<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.799> can<00:03:11.220> say<00:03:11.459> there's<00:03:11.730> water<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.150> it

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
you know you can say there's water in it

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.699 
you know you can say there's water in it
and<00:03:12.299> actually<00:03:12.510> put<00:03:12.810> tequila<00:03:12.930> or<00:03:13.290> vodka<00:03:13.470> in
