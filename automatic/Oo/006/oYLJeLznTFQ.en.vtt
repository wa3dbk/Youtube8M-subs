00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.290
 YouTube friends as they were I hope 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.820
 that are very good on this occasion 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.050
 let's see this very good song 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.390
 green day that they have been asking me 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.710
 So, well, you know 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.480
 several guitars and let's start 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.670
 because friends we're going to start with 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.770
 this very good green day song is 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.280
 very simple 80% of the song let's go 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.260
 to the same chords are only 4 like this 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.180
 that as we will start and as good as 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.370
 They saw the insert a capon on fret 1 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.320
 so it really takes it now 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.330
 they are going to play without the capo, because 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.860
 better many do not have them and already if the 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.110
 they want to sound with the original song 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.180
 just put it on fret 1 and 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.980
 they go everything goes then it is very 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.589
 simple let's start with the chords 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.230
 if you know wonderwall of crisis is 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.480
 really the same my minor 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.120
 but my youngest 7 we're going to leave these two 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.760
 fingers of here in 3 and 4 in the fret 3 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.680
 and on the 3rd fret of the second and the 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.330
 first string are going to stay there fixed 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.729
 all the time then we start my 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.729
 minor 7 sun greater 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.110
 greater would be like a lower your 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.070
 four since we're going to leave these two 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.060
 fingers there very simple and we're going to 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.070
 make a the larger one will be like the 724 or 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.110
 something like that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.610
 in this way ok is like the vimenor 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.920
 only these two fingers come down here 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.260
 that fret two and two of the fourth and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.980
 third is not only going about those 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.980
 four chords 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.940
 now 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.409
 t 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.369
 dt 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.369
 such 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.470
 3 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.100
 Who 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.620
 guilt 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.780
 i 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.269
 although the changes are very simple 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.650
 only these two fingers move to 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.209
 the strum will be very simple what 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.870
 what are we going to do, we're just going to 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:31.909
 make two down then again 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.310
 down up knots down and the 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:38.260
 Change of chord as tip always goes 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.260
 when you dance the upward trait 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.550
 is repeated 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.530
 then when we do the radio towards 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.420
 up we changed from agreed it's very 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.930
 simple of all these arrows for 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.930
 check them 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.280
 can 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.840
 Perez 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.250
 ok is the one and the lead guitar and it's 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.940
 very simple let's go here to 37 from the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.020
 first and after 8 and the second 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.580
 sorry 37 and fret 8 of the second and 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.990
 then in the seven hours and the first 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.250
 at five 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.250
 and we returned 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.440
 or that are very easy to that melody and 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.849
 in fact it is also the guitar solo 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.849
 only internally equal 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.180
 ok it's very simple then we go to the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.409
 only different part that is the choir 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.409
 we come from here 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.349
 singer 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.960
 let's make that little one like pass to 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.010
 chorus that is fifth string the air behind 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.010
 of two other three 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.140
 and we're going to a payment the lamb ok the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.900
 payments are very common surely we 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.980
 you know they are only here in this case 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.770
 13 3 fifth fret 5 fifth and frets 35 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.080
 40 and 35 third and we're just going to 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:22.770
 move that position ok we go in everything 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:27.660
 we climb a sun rope after we leave 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:32.880
 to network 35 of the fifth and then we're going 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:36.690
 to move to me ok that's just the 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:42.230
 same position of going through this 2 fifth 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.230
 and fret 2 fourth and area in this way 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.540
 s 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.710
 all right 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.229
 the one that changed again 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.590
 Never 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.290
 although the last round only 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.810
 after the sun let's go to a power core 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.810
 dense and storage rooms of the 5th 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.430
 then there are three laps of this and the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.510
 last only change every ok and 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.510
 then return to the same 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.930
 and 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.930
 for 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.030
 for 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.970
 ok it was very very simple and then the 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.570
 only different part is the solo of 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.200
 guitar puts it there I 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.200
 distortion 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.360
 and the only variation it makes is that it 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.360
 goes to the 5th fret of the second to me 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.210
 and the accompaniment is the chorus 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.159
 ice more forced I think 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.790
 Y 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:34.659
 ok that's exactly the same then 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:37.149
 Well, in all the parts that they need 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:38.979
 to play this song together to take 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:41.229
 in account as I already told you it takes a capo 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.809
 in fret 1 so that it sounds in tone 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:45.729
 original and yes they do have pedals 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:48.339
 distortion you can put for actions 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:51.129
 more striking and the effect that you use in 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:53.049
 intro is one that is called tremolo there 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.819
 Many pedals sell the pedals to see 

00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:57.279
 if right now you can teach them mine ok 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:58.989
 makes me this is a test and electronics 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:03.279
 which is a modulator that brings the 

00:06:58.989 --> 00:07:07.749
 so little dirty effects brings chorus this 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:09.459
 flyer facer vibrato tremolo ok but there 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:11.139
 many brands that sell only the 

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:13.479
 Tremolo pedal to get like that 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.499
 effect here is taca taca taca está 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:15.849
 pretty cool 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:18.069
 I already know if you have a guitar 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:20.049
 acoustics is the same really only 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.849
 that at least it's electro acoustic 

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:24.159
 you can not get distorted or the 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:26.019
 tremolo or whatever for really touch 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:26.889
 in the same way so it could be 

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.449
 all for this choice 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:29.799
 ok friends this for this election already
