netrunner ha netrunner in in a lot of
ways<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.340> felt<00:00:26.580> like<00:00:26.730> was<00:00:26.910> my<00:00:27.150> best<00:00:27.570> trading

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
ways I felt like was my best trading

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.679 
ways I felt like was my best trading
card<00:00:28.680> game<00:00:28.890> design<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.150> some<00:00:30.330> ways<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.630> was

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
card game design but in some ways it was

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.740 
card game design but in some ways it was
my<00:00:30.869> best<00:00:31.080> instead<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.579> maybe<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.600> best

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
my best instead it was maybe my best

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.900 
my best instead it was maybe my best
board<00:00:34.200> game<00:00:34.469> design<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> feels<00:00:35.640> more

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
board game design because it feels more

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.090 
board game design because it feels more
like<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.120> board<00:00:36.420> game<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.950> was

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
like a board game and and that was

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.150 
like a board game and and that was
probably<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> its<00:00:39.120> problems<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.860> had<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> lot

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
probably one of its problems I had a lot

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430 
probably one of its problems I had a lot
of<00:00:41.190> lessons<00:00:41.520> from<00:00:41.879> magic<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.290> trying

to make a make a richer game I like
magic<00:00:46.920> very<00:00:47.070> much<00:00:47.280> every<00:00:47.820> time<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.000> return<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
magic very much every time I return to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.590 
magic very much every time I return to
it<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.809> exciting<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.250> magic<00:00:50.730> often<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it is exciting but with magic often the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.770 
it is exciting but with magic often the

wanted a game where you played the cards
it's<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.910> only<00:00:56.940> one<00:00:57.719> thing<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.170> love<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.620> games

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it's the only one thing I love in games

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.029 
it's the only one thing I love in games
is<00:00:59.730> bluffing<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:01.320> magic<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:01.920> is

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
is bluffing and with magic there is

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.860 
is bluffing and with magic there is
bluffing<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.030> very<00:01:03.059> good<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
bluffing but you have to be very good to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
bluffing but you have to be very good to
bluff<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> wanted<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> make<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> game

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
bluff and so I wanted to make a game

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.750 
bluff and so I wanted to make a game
more<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.570> poker<00:01:06.840> where<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.640> would

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
more like poker where you you you would

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.390 
more like poker where you you you would
Bluff<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.720> early<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.439> game<00:01:10.860> career<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
Bluff very early in your game career and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.950 
Bluff very early in your game career and
so<00:01:11.820> that's<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.119> set<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:12.840> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so that's what I set out to do with that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.390 
so that's what I set out to do with that
runner<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:14.010> I've<00:01:14.100> succeeded

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
runner and and I think I've succeeded

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.440 
runner and and I think I've succeeded
with<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> oh<00:01:14.939> yes<00:01:15.770> sure<00:01:16.770> dad<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.180> fond

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
with that oh yes sure dad so I have fond

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.080 
with that oh yes sure dad so I have fond
memories<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.110> game<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.490> I'm<00:01:20.490> certainly

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
memories of the game but I'm certainly

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.940 
memories of the game but I'm certainly
disappointed<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> didn't<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.229> better<00:01:22.439> think

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
disappointed it didn't do better think

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
disappointed it didn't do better think
occasionally<00:01:23.580> about<00:01:23.790> looking<00:01:24.210> back<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
occasionally about looking back at it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.679 
occasionally about looking back at it
and<00:01:25.140> seeing<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.650> make<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> new<00:01:26.100> version

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
and seeing if I can make a new version

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.539 
and seeing if I can make a new version
or<00:01:27.689> something<00:01:28.080> were<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.770> aware<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.159> this

or something were you aware that this

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.060 
or something were you aware that this
game<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:30.119> be<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.570> prophetic<00:01:31.079> our<00:01:31.560> wheel

cyber world whatever the name yeah I

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
cyber world whatever the name yeah I
thought<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> genre<00:01:49.710> could<00:01:49.979> be

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
thought that the genre could be

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
thought that the genre could be
prophetic<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.450> certainly<00:01:51.720> can't<00:01:52.110> take

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
prophetic but I certainly can't take

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.380 
prophetic but I certainly can't take
credit<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.890> since<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.579> our<00:01:54.090> Tao

saurians universe that I was in and I

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.120 
saurians universe that I was in and I
was<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.430> big<00:01:56.670> fan<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.939> Gibson<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.020> snow<00:01:58.860> crash

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
was a big fan of Gibson and snow crash

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.760 
was a big fan of Gibson and snow crash
and<00:01:59.549> things<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.149> yeah<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> genre

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and things like that yeah it was a genre

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.080 
and things like that yeah it was a genre
which<00:02:01.920> looked<00:02:02.159> into<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> future<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.939> an

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160

with<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.739> mean<00:02:30.099> there's<00:02:30.220> probably<00:02:30.459> some<00:02:30.670> small

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
with I mean there's probably some small

changes<00:02:30.939> because<00:02:31.629> I've<00:02:31.959> changed<00:02:32.470> as<00:02:33.010> a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
changes because I've changed as a

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.619 
changes because I've changed as a
designer<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:34.120> probably<00:02:34.359> would<00:02:34.569> have

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
designer and I probably would have

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.630 
designer and I probably would have
simplified<00:02:34.959> some<00:02:35.379> things<00:02:35.620> I'd<00:02:36.310> say<00:02:36.489> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
simplified some things I'd say the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.800 
simplified some things I'd say the
biggest<00:02:36.670> change<00:02:37.439> would<00:02:38.439> be<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.760> might<00:02:40.389> not

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
biggest change would be that I might not

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.500 
biggest change would be that I might not
make<00:02:41.109> it<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.439> trading<00:02:41.980> card<00:02:42.159> game<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.819> think<00:02:43.420> it

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
make it a trading card game I think it

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.160 
make it a trading card game I think it
was<00:02:43.659> a<00:02:44.430> back<00:02:45.430> when<00:02:45.939> it<00:02:46.060> was<00:02:46.090> designed<00:02:46.569> we<00:02:46.989> were

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
was a back when it was designed we were

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.020 
was a back when it was designed we were
exploring<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:48.040> space<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.549> trading<00:02:48.849> card

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
exploring the space of trading card

exploring the space of trading card
games<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.480> didn't<00:02:49.720> really<00:02:49.900> beginning<00:02:50.560> didn't

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310

really<00:02:51.519> know<00:02:51.700> what<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.269> boundaries<00:02:52.599> of<00:02:52.720> that

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
really know what the boundaries of that

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.990 
really know what the boundaries of that
space<00:02:53.200> were<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.950> seems<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.370> shame<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.639> have

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
space were and it seems a shame to have

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.119 
space were and it seems a shame to have
a<00:02:55.060> game<00:02:55.359> I<00:02:55.750> think<00:02:56.109> I<00:02:56.439> think<00:02:56.620> creating<00:02:56.980> card

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
a game I think I think creating card

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.789 
a game I think I think creating card
games<00:02:57.340> can<00:02:57.879> be<00:02:57.909> very<00:02:58.269> rich<00:02:58.569> but<00:02:59.349> it's<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.560> shame

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
games can be very rich but it's a shame

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.949 
games can be very rich but it's a shame
to<00:02:59.950> have<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.099> game<00:03:00.400> which<00:03:01.060> doesn't<00:03:01.450> need<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.780> be

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
to have a game which doesn't need to be

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.559 
to have a game which doesn't need to be
one<00:03:02.169> because<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.189> just<00:03:03.400> makes<00:03:03.609> it<00:03:03.819> so<00:03:03.879> heavy<00:03:04.239> so

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
one because it just makes it so heavy so

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.720 
one because it just makes it so heavy so
hard<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.139> develop<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:06.069> hard<00:03:06.280> for<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.489> players

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
hard to develop so hard for the players

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.149 
hard to develop so hard for the players
and<00:03:06.849> so<00:03:07.239> forth<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:07.989> would<00:03:08.379> redesign<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.010> that

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
and so forth so I would redesign so that

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.039 
and so forth so I would redesign so that
it<00:03:09.250> wasn't<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.609> trading<00:03:09.939> card<00:03:10.090> game<00:03:10.389> but<00:03:11.019> a

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
it wasn't a trading card game but a

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.800 
it wasn't a trading card game but a
standalone<00:03:11.739> game<00:03:12.069> with<00:03:12.250> expansions<00:03:12.819> maybe

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
standalone game with expansions maybe

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.300 
standalone game with expansions maybe
maybe<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.409> art<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.650> would<00:03:14.769> change<00:03:14.950> i<00:03:15.129> don't

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
maybe the art I would change i don't

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.220 
maybe the art I would change i don't
know<00:03:15.400> i<00:03:15.609> like<00:03:15.819> the<00:03:15.970> art<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.389> love<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.959> flavor

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
know i like the art I love the flavor

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.280

text<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:17.919> the<00:03:18.280> universe<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:19.989> would<00:03:20.169> think

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
text and the universe but I would think

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.780 
text and the universe but I would think
about<00:03:20.409> trying<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:21.010> figure<00:03:21.250> out<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.400> way<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.609> make

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
about trying to figure out a way to make

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.110 
about trying to figure out a way to make
it<00:03:21.819> more<00:03:22.470> broadly<00:03:23.470> accessible<00:03:24.040> even<00:03:24.879> though<00:03:25.090> I

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
it more broadly accessible even though I

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.509 
it more broadly accessible even though I
like<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:26.169> part<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.829> lot<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.250> still

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
like that part of it a lot it still

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.050 
like that part of it a lot it still
feels<00:03:27.790> too<00:03:28.720> niche<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:30.099> too<00:03:30.489> much<00:03:30.669> for

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.599 
for instance the best sealed deck game
that<00:04:03.400> could<00:04:03.639> be<00:04:03.790> but<00:04:04.479> a<00:04:04.750> game<00:04:05.109> which<00:04:05.379> is<00:04:05.409> is<00:04:05.829> if

that could be but a game which is is if

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.710 
that could be but a game which is is if

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
it's if it's not going to be an

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.509 
it's if it's not going to be an
excellent<00:04:07.979> customizable<00:04:08.979> game<00:04:09.129> one<00:04:09.340> where

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
excellent customizable game one where

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.369 
excellent customizable game one where
you<00:04:09.609> actually<00:04:09.790> construct<00:04:10.389> the<00:04:10.509> decks<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.199> it

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
you actually construct the decks and it

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.629 
you actually construct the decks and it
doesn't<00:04:11.650> need<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.799> be<00:04:11.919> a<00:04:11.979> trading<00:04:12.280> card<00:04:12.370> game

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
doesn't need to be a trading card game

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.240 
doesn't need to be a trading card game
and<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.269> so<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:13.959> appreciate<00:04:14.439> the<00:04:14.650> thought<00:04:14.799> but

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
and so so I appreciate the thought but

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.199 
and so so I appreciate the thought but
and<00:04:16.180> then<00:04:16.359> when<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.810> came<00:04:16.959> out<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.139> actually<00:04:17.380> a

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
and then when it came out I actually a

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.029 
and then when it came out I actually a
lot<00:04:19.209> of<00:04:19.359> people<00:04:19.479> spoke<00:04:20.320> very<00:04:20.500> highly<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.949> it

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
lot of people spoke very highly of it

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.980 
lot of people spoke very highly of it
and<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.220> believe<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.729> but<00:04:22.330> over<00:04:22.570> time<00:04:22.750> I've

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
and I believe that but over time I've

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.230 
and I believe that but over time I've
come<00:04:23.409> to<00:04:23.529> decide<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:24.039> I<00:04:24.490> mean<00:04:25.029> there<00:04:25.120> were<00:04:25.210> a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
come to decide that I mean there were a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.900 
come to decide that I mean there were a
lot<00:04:25.389> of<00:04:25.419> reasons<00:04:25.900> why<00:04:26.080> perhaps

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
lot of reasons why perhaps

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.760 
lot of reasons why perhaps
didn't<00:04:27.480> do<00:04:27.570> as<00:04:27.690> well<00:04:27.720> as<00:04:27.900> we<00:04:28.050> had<00:04:28.230> hoped<00:04:28.260> and

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
didn't do as well as we had hoped and

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.880 
didn't do as well as we had hoped and
and<00:04:29.280> most<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.700> those<00:04:29.790> i<00:04:29.850> think<00:04:30.180> were<00:04:30.330> because

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
and most of those i think were because

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.160 
and most of those i think were because
wizards<00:04:31.890> was<00:04:32.130> concentrating<00:04:32.910> on<00:04:33.060> magic<00:04:33.780> and

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
wizards was concentrating on magic and

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.500 
wizards was concentrating on magic and
also<00:04:35.100> once<00:04:35.370> people<00:04:35.700> start<00:04:35.910> playing<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.180> trading

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
also once people start playing a trading

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.730 
also once people start playing a trading
card<00:04:36.630> game<00:04:36.840> they<00:04:36.960> only<00:04:37.110> have<00:04:37.260> time<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.560> play

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
card game they only have time to play

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.830 
card game they only have time to play
one<00:04:37.950> but<00:04:38.520> over<00:04:38.730> time<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:38.910> decided<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.450> some<00:04:39.720> of

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
one but over time I decided that some of

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.780 
one but over time I decided that some of
it<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.050> also<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.470> default<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.460> design

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
it is also the default of the design

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.820 
it is also the default of the design
perhaps<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.570> perhaps<00:04:43.140> if<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.410> had<00:04:43.590> been<00:04:43.620> a

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
perhaps the perhaps if it had been a

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.160 
perhaps the perhaps if it had been a
standalone<00:04:44.610> product<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.810> would<00:04:45.930> have<00:04:46.020> been<00:04:46.110> a

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
standalone product it would have been a

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.590 
standalone product it would have been a
little<00:04:46.290> better<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.770> was<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.700> planning<00:04:48.120> playing

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
little better I was to planning playing

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.430 
little better I was to planning playing
this<00:04:49.110> winner<00:04:49.370> no<00:04:50.370> no<00:04:50.790> but<00:04:50.930> but<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.140> would<00:04:52.410> like

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
this winner no no but but I would like

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.350 
this winner no no but but I would like
to<00:04:52.620> play<00:04:52.920> more<00:04:53.160> that's<00:04:53.580> that's<00:04:54.030> mostly

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
to play more that's that's mostly

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.880 
to play more that's that's mostly
because<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.720> like<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:55.020> play<00:04:55.110> new<00:04:55.320> games<00:04:55.590> and

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:34.020 
but I think that's a great idea too I
think<00:07:31.330> and<00:07:32.169> I<00:07:32.319> think<00:07:32.349> I<00:07:32.650> should<00:07:33.159> it<00:07:33.280> I<00:07:33.460> should

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.030
