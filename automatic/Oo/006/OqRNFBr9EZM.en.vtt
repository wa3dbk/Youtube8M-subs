pretty awesome so if you want to try

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.990 
pretty awesome so if you want to try
this<00:01:39.570> car<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.799> make<00:01:41.400> sure<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this car out just make sure you have the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.969 
this car out just make sure you have the
m5<00:01:42.360> chosen<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.740> go

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
m5 chosen and then you go in you just go

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
m5 chosen and then you go in you just go
and<00:01:47.310> search<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.820> tune<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.060> write<00:01:48.390> ray

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and search for a tune you write ray

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.840 
and search for a tune you write ray
drift<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> guy<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:50.549> pop<00:01:50.820> up

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
drift I will be the guy that will pop up

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.870 
drift I will be the guy that will pop up
most<00:01:51.240> likely<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:52.470> there's<00:01:52.680> someone<00:01:52.950> else<00:01:53.070> yeah

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
most likely if there's someone else yeah

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.280 
most likely if there's someone else yeah
you<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:54.270> me<00:01:54.420> right<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:54.840> messing<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:55.229> my

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you see me right there I'm messing up my

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.980 
you see me right there I'm messing up my
spelling<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.040> okay<00:01:56.310> ray<00:01:56.700> drift<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
spelling that's okay ray drift and you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.929 
spelling that's okay ray drift and you
can<00:01:58.200> try<00:01:58.409> out<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> little<00:01:59.490> um<00:01:59.610> fight

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
can try out this be a little um fight

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.940 
can try out this be a little um fight
for<00:02:00.119> yourself<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.540> honestly<00:02:00.899> even<00:02:01.170> stalk

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
for yourself but honestly even stalk

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.640 
for yourself but honestly even stalk
this<00:02:02.219> car<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.820> sideways<00:02:03.299> I'm<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:03.600> sure

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
this car can get sideways I'm not sure

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.800 
this car can get sideways I'm not sure
for<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> long<00:02:05.070> amount<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.400> time<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> does<00:02:06.570> do

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
for a long amount of time but it does do

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.420 
for a long amount of time but it does do
a<00:02:06.840> pretty<00:02:07.080> good<00:02:07.170> job<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.830> see<00:02:08.009> me<00:02:08.130> taking

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
a pretty good job here you see me taking

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.160 
a pretty good job here you see me taking
this<00:02:08.520> turn<00:02:08.759> look<00:02:09.240> how<00:02:09.360> smooth<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.840> this

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
this turn look how smooth this is this

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.190 
this turn look how smooth this is this
is<00:02:10.350> because<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.520> has<00:02:11.580> four<00:02:12.330> doors<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:13.020> has<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
is because it has four doors it has a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.110 
is because it has four doors it has a
much<00:02:13.440> longer<00:02:13.710> wheelbase<00:02:14.220> than<00:02:14.670> most<00:02:14.820> cars

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
much longer wheelbase than most cars

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.270 
much longer wheelbase than most cars
that<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.450> drift<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.800> think<00:02:17.040> it's

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
that you drift and so you think it's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280 
that you drift and so you think it's
hard<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> manage<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:18.420> doesn't<00:02:18.780> drift<00:02:19.080> like

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
hard to manage it doesn't drift like

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.410 
hard to manage it doesn't drift like
those<00:02:19.500> cars<00:02:19.800> because<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.370> has<00:02:20.610> such<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> longer

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
those cars because it has such a longer

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.000 
those cars because it has such a longer
wheelbase<00:02:21.690> where<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.260> feels<00:02:22.500> like<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.830> has<00:02:22.980> a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
wheelbase where it feels like it has a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.230 
wheelbase where it feels like it has a
longer<00:02:23.370> wheelbase<00:02:23.580> because<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:24.150> a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
longer wheelbase because it's a

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.840 
longer wheelbase because it's a
four-door<00:02:24.600> yeah<00:02:25.440> yeah<00:02:25.950> you'd<00:02:26.310> think<00:02:26.340> that'd

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
four-door yeah yeah you'd think that'd

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.490 
four-door yeah yeah you'd think that'd
be<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> lot<00:02:27.330> harder<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.780> drift<00:02:28.050> but<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.320> really

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
be a lot harder to drift but it really

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.650 
be a lot harder to drift but it really
feels<00:02:28.800> natural<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.640> got<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.630> bit

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
feels natural and it got just a bit

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.170 
feels natural and it got just a bit
better<00:02:30.960> than<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.590> most<00:02:31.710> cars<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:32.940> still

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
better than in most cars but it's still

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.210 
better than in most cars but it's still
just<00:02:33.240> really<00:02:33.990> well<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.620> how<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.950> drifts

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
just really well on I like how it drifts

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.070 
just really well on I like how it drifts
it<00:02:35.340> really<00:02:35.550> does<00:02:35.790> give<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> nice<00:02:36.780> feeling

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
it really does give you a nice feeling

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.720 
it really does give you a nice feeling
when<00:02:37.260> you're<00:02:37.440> going<00:02:37.590> sideways<00:02:37.950> with<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.459> car

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
when you're going sideways with this car

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.520 
when you're going sideways with this car
and<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.390> first<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.810> all<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.050> sounds<00:02:40.350> amazing

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.140 
and it first of all that sounds amazing
when<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:40.980> changing<00:02:41.340> gears<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.700> guys<00:02:41.850> hear

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.350 
when it's changing gears you guys hear
that<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:42.870> one<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.500> those

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
that it is just one of those

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.770

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
f-type but

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.230 
f-type but
it<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.190> really<00:02:51.700> really<00:02:52.240> incredible<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:54.000> if<00:02:55.000> you
