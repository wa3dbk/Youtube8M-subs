00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
use a Sun Oven when the Sun Oven arrives

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580 
use a Sun Oven when the Sun Oven arrives
will<00:00:08.730> come<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.120> box<00:00:09.300> with<00:00:09.690> packing<00:00:10.080> material

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
will come in a box with packing material

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.259 
will come in a box with packing material
and<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.860> course<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.280> first<00:00:11.460> step<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.940> to

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and of course the first step is to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.000 
and of course the first step is to
remove<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.740> box<00:00:18.680> when<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.770> remove

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
remove it from the box when you remove

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.099 
remove it from the box when you remove
it<00:00:20.100> from<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.369> box<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.270> want<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.539> open<00:00:21.990> it

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
it from the box you just want to open it

of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> inside<00:00:31.309> they<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.579> discarded

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.600 

before<00:00:37.200> putting<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> Sun<00:00:37.860> Oven<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> Sun

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
before putting the Sun Oven in the Sun

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.020 
before putting the Sun Oven in the Sun
it's<00:00:39.090> very<00:00:39.420> important<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.710> oven<00:00:40.950> comes<00:00:41.309> with

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it's very important the oven comes with

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.600 
it's very important the oven comes with
a<00:00:42.059> protective<00:00:42.809> film<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.770> reflectors<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
a protective film on the reflectors and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.240 
a protective film on the reflectors and
the<00:00:45.270> first<00:00:45.539> step<00:00:45.899> before<00:00:46.320> putting<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the first step before putting it in the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
the first step before putting it in the
Sun<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.270> make<00:00:48.420> sure<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> completely

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
Sun is to make sure that you completely

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.420 
Sun is to make sure that you completely
peel<00:00:49.980> away<00:00:50.270> this<00:00:51.270> protective<00:00:51.989> film<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.620> you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
peel away this protective film if you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.630 
peel away this protective film if you
loosen<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> edges<00:00:54.809> first<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:56.250> peel<00:00:56.610> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
loosen the edges first and then peel it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.569 
loosen the edges first and then peel it
it<00:00:57.059> comes<00:00:57.539> off<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:58.079> faster<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.859> then<00:00:59.399> be

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it comes off a lot faster and then be

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.700 
it comes off a lot faster and then be
very<00:00:59.789> careful<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.539> around<00:01:00.780> each<00:01:01.260> rivet

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
very careful as you go around each rivet

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.039 
very careful as you go around each rivet
to<00:01:02.190> make<00:01:02.340> sure<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> film<00:01:03.719> off

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
to make sure you get all of the film off

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.130 
to make sure you get all of the film off
as<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.240> peel<00:01:06.540> away<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
as you can see as you peel away the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770 
as you can see as you peel away the
reflective<00:01:07.830> material<00:01:08.369> what's<00:01:09.000> underneath<00:01:09.330> is

a very shiny reflector and the reflector

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.770 
a very shiny reflector and the reflector
reflects<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> light<00:01:14.220> into<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> oven<00:01:15.090> box<00:01:15.360> in
