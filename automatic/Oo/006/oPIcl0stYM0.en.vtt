00:00:02.462 --> 00:00:03.523
 This is our homeland 

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:06.970
 Over the years, it does not work 

00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:18.793
 The return time has come 

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:25.357
 Let's turn it into action 

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:35.551
 Let's ... go to NEW ARMENIA. Together POSSIBLE 

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:17.773
 Raffi, good armor, Raffi, good duduk, Raffi, good cognac, Raffi, good pure water, Raffi, clean air. 

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:37.915
 Today we are all the owners and servants of Armenia. Today Armenia lives with us, and we are the ones that come to our senses to make sure that our tricolor is standing and standing forever in this building. 

00:01:48.274 --> 00:02:01.580
 The citizen is the king, and the government bodies, the state, ensure the citizen's freedom on the basis of national interest 

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:18.550
 Together we are looking forward to Armenia, which will have a chosen president who will appreciate and criticize, and who will be first of all a citizen. 

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:38.060
 Our struggle is long-lasting, our "triumph" is a victory ... and all of us belong to a country that has been EATHED AND EATH TO BE RECONCILIATED, HAYAS-HAN, Yas-Haas-Ha ... 

00:03:07.252 --> 00:03:26.550
 I'll give you all a little more "torture", I do not know how much. I ask you not to worry, to give each other strength, do not bother, because this is our way. The road is one and will lead the people to power and the victory of the Armenian nation. Thank you ... 

00:03:46.903 --> 00:04:00.720
 Every citizen, an Armenian, will be part of that great road that begins today, from here and will take each village and city, square and yard 

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:40.880
 The slaves of ours, the Turks among us, the Russians, the Americans, the foreigners, we must take and become Armenians, in our own land, in our own land 

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:48.390
 They have a word, they have a label, they have a debate, let them not be afraid, let them go. 

00:04:49.362 --> 00:04:50.430
 WE ARE COMING... 

00:05:00.814 --> 00:05:06.080
 HAS-YAS-TAN ... 

00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:22.840
 This time no one, no neighbor, no rival, no president, no government will no longer play the will, voice and right of the Armenian people because we are together, to victory 

00:05:23.813 --> 00:05:37.800
 And before we get to the bank of the river, we must invite and return the Armenian people to this coast of the river, the Republic of Armenia 

00:06:27.222 --> 00:06:31.490
 Raffi Jan, I am proud of you, the Armenian people love and believe in you 

00:06:32.027 --> 00:06:40.860
 Let's make Ani's bride, Kars, Dinner, Walk in the bouquets in Erzurum, dance on the slopes of our Musa Dagh, dine toasts in Karabakh
