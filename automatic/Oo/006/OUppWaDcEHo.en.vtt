00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
prepared to pay a big bunch of money

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.180 
prepared to pay a big bunch of money
let's<00:03:44.740> compare<00:03:45.130> them<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.280> them<00:03:46.150> his<00:03:46.480> nemesis

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
let's compare them to them his nemesis

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.000 
let's compare them to them his nemesis
or<00:03:48.190> go<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.730> Toho<00:03:52.060> kaiju<00:03:52.330> orga<00:03:52.810> as<00:03:53.800> you

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
or go this is the Toho kaiju orga as you

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.979 
or go this is the Toho kaiju orga as you
can<00:03:54.160> tell<00:03:54.340> they<00:03:54.490> do<00:03:54.700> go<00:03:55.000> well<00:03:55.510> together

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.080 

so<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.590> can<00:03:59.799> probably<00:04:00.040> recreate<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:00.700> movie

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090
