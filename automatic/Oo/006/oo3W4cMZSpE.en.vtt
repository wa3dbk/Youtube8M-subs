00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the biggest things that has gotten on my

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.050 
the biggest things that has gotten on my
nerves<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> next-gen<00:01:38.310> console<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
load times on some of these games I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.190 
load times on some of these games I
think<00:01:41.220> Ryse<00:01:41.640> son<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:42.000> Rome<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.509> probably<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
think Ryse son of Rome is probably the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560 
think Ryse son of Rome is probably the
worst<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.680> I've<00:01:43.979> seen<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.250> far<00:01:44.520> I've<00:01:45.180> never

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
worst one I've seen so far I've never

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.410 
worst one I've seen so far I've never
timed<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.500> takes<00:01:46.770> forever<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.759> so

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
timed it but it takes forever and so

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.960 
timed it but it takes forever and so
some<00:01:48.720> people<00:01:48.750> were<00:01:49.079> saying<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:50.490> after<00:01:50.729> they

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
some people were saying that after they

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.550

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
people tested other games like Forza

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.399 
people tested other games like Forza
Dead<00:02:02.460> Rising<00:02:02.670> 3<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.659> they<00:02:03.869> were<00:02:03.930> still

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
Dead Rising 3 and they were still

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.169 
Dead Rising 3 and they were still
getting<00:02:04.710> 15<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.640> 20<00:02:06.030> second<00:02:06.570> load<00:02:07.200> time<00:02:07.560> drops

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
getting 15 to 20 second load time drops

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.540 
getting 15 to 20 second load time drops
just<00:02:09.179> by<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> external<00:02:11.009> hard<00:02:11.280> drive

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
just by going to the external hard drive

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.760 
just by going to the external hard drive
because<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> uses<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.420> 3.0<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
because it uses a 3.0 you

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.430 
because it uses a 3.0 you
USB<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.550> get<00:02:14.880> faster<00:02:15.510> hard<00:02:15.810> drives<00:02:16.170> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
USB you can get faster hard drives and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.140 
USB you can get faster hard drives and
the<00:02:17.310> USB<00:02:17.820> transfer<00:02:18.090> rate<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.110> actually<00:02:19.680> higher

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
the USB transfer rate is actually higher

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.080 
the USB transfer rate is actually higher
than<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.330> SATA<00:02:21.660> 2<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:23.190> currently<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
than the SATA 2 that is currently on the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.180 
than the SATA 2 that is currently on the
hard<00:02:24.450> drive<00:02:24.720> installed<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.040> Xbox<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:27.120> so

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
hard drive installed in the Xbox one so

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.650 
hard drive installed in the Xbox one so
pretty<00:02:29.190> good<00:02:29.400> news<00:02:29.610> all<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:29.970> way<00:02:30.240> around<00:02:30.540> you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
pretty good news all the way around you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.540 
pretty good news all the way around you
can<00:02:30.720> get<00:02:30.930> more<00:02:31.110> storage<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:31.980> also<00:02:32.190> have

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
can get more storage you can also have

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.450 
can get more storage you can also have
two<00:02:32.850> external<00:02:33.330> storage<00:02:33.870> hard<00:02:34.770> drives<00:02:35.100> hooked

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
two external storage hard drives hooked

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.240 
two external storage hard drives hooked
up<00:02:35.640> at<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.820> same<00:02:36.180> time<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.170> guess<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.860> could

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
up at the same time so I guess you could

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.040 
up at the same time so I guess you could
have<00:02:38.400> three<00:02:38.760> because<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.240> still<00:02:39.540> get<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.780> use

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
have three because you still get to use

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.530 
have three because you still get to use
the<00:02:40.320> one<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.620> came<00:02:41.070> with<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.490> Xbox<00:02:41.970> that's

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the one that came with the Xbox that's

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.330 
the one that came with the Xbox that's
still<00:02:42.840> installed<00:02:43.410> there<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.130> I

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
still installed there so you can have I

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.550 
still installed there so you can have I
guess<00:02:44.550> three<00:02:44.880> hard<00:02:45.150> drives<00:02:45.330> hooked<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.320> to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
guess three hard drives hooked up to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.180 
guess three hard drives hooked up to
your<00:02:46.590> Xbox<00:02:47.460> one<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.870> far<00:02:49.380> as<00:02:49.530> which<00:02:49.860> hard

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
your Xbox one so as far as which hard

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.800 
your Xbox one so as far as which hard
drive<00:02:50.460> would<00:02:50.640> be<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.910> best<00:02:51.120> one<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.660> if

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
drive would be the best one to get if

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.140 
drive would be the best one to get if
you're<00:02:51.960> going<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.290> be<00:02:52.380> shopping<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.400> one<00:02:53.760> I

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you're going to be shopping for one I

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.960 
you're going to be shopping for one I
would<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:54.960> wait<00:02:55.260> till<00:02:55.590> more<00:02:55.920> tests<00:02:56.280> are<00:02:56.640> run

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
would just wait till more tests are run

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.760 
would just wait till more tests are run
by<00:02:57.000> several<00:02:57.810> different<00:02:58.140> people<00:02:58.260> using

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
by several different people using

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.950 
by several different people using
several<00:02:59.070> different<00:02:59.190> types<00:02:59.790> of<00:03:00.300> hard<00:03:00.660> drives

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
several different types of hard drives

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.810 
several different types of hard drives
and<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.620> know<00:03:01.770> if<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.160> news<00:03:02.370> comes<00:03:02.580> out

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.950 
will start making and we can find out
which<00:03:10.800> one<00:03:11.040> would<00:03:11.700> be<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.880> best<00:03:12.240> for<00:03:12.810> your

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
which one would be the best for your
