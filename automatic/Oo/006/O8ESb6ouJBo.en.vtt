of any knots or tangles now I have bangs

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.970 
of any knots or tangles now I have bangs
so<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.829> gonna<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.340> try<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:36.480> way<00:00:36.980> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
so I'm gonna have to try in one way to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.580 
so I'm gonna have to try in one way to
hide<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.399> too<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:38.940> those<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> don't

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
hide them too but for those of you don't

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.780 
hide them too but for those of you don't
just<00:00:40.590> disregard<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.670> it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
just disregard that because it's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.310 
just disregard that because it's
probably<00:00:41.940> flat<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> little<00:00:42.989> bit<00:00:43.110> easier

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
probably flat it's a little bit easier

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.880 
probably flat it's a little bit easier
for<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.829> anyway<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:45.440> what<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:48.890> just

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
for you anyway so what I do is I just

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.200 
for you anyway so what I do is I just
spray<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.640> underside<00:00:51.440> including<00:00:52.440> my<00:00:52.530> bangs

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
spray the underside including my bangs

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.389 
spray the underside including my bangs
with<00:00:54.210> hair<00:00:54.420> spray<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:56.059> continue<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
with hair spray and just continue to

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.520 
with hair spray and just continue to
brush<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.670> through<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.629> helps<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
brush it through so this helps it to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:14.399 
brush it through so this helps it to
create<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.219> bit<00:01:02.399> more<00:01:03.379> height

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.340 

so<00:01:14.979> once<00:01:15.280> you've<00:01:16.079> doused<00:01:17.079> it<00:01:17.409> in<00:01:17.500> hairspray<00:01:18.130> I

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
so once you've doused it in hairspray I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.090 
so once you've doused it in hairspray I
use<00:01:20.350> my<00:01:20.530> right<00:01:20.740> hand<00:01:20.799> I<00:01:21.399> just<00:01:22.360> pinch<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:23.100> about

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
use my right hand I just pinch it about

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.910 
use my right hand I just pinch it about
here<00:01:24.369> just<00:01:24.970> lightly<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.899> then<00:01:26.680> I<00:01:26.740> take<00:01:26.890> my

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
here just lightly and then I take my

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.149 
here just lightly and then I take my
other<00:01:27.070> hand<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.789> I<00:01:28.060> just<00:01:28.350> use<00:01:29.350> this<00:01:29.560> bit<00:01:29.860> to

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
other hand and I just use this bit to

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.499 
other hand and I just use this bit to
help<00:01:30.369> create<00:01:30.610> that<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:32.500> role<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:36.179> two<00:01:37.179> key

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
help create that that role so two key

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.889 
help create that that role so two key
things<00:01:37.539> are<00:01:38.079> pinch<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.770> roll<00:01:39.250> so<00:01:39.759> pinch<00:01:40.630> here

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
things are pinch and roll so pinch here

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:48.210 
things are pinch and roll so pinch here
and<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.119> roll<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.349> helps<00:01:47.649> it<00:01:47.770> to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
and then I roll so that helps it to

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.870 
and then I roll so that helps it to
create<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.860> then<00:01:51.069> just<00:01:51.340> take<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.549> bobby<00:01:51.759> pin

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
create it and then just take a bobby pin

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.710 
create it and then just take a bobby pin
and<00:01:52.090> just<00:01:52.799> pin<00:01:53.799> that<00:01:54.039> flat<00:01:54.610> section<00:01:55.149> there<00:01:55.330> so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
and just pin that flat section there so

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.190 
and just pin that flat section there so
that<00:01:55.869> helps<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.229> hold<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:59.280> spray<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:02.049> with

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
that helps it hold it and spray so with

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.100 
that helps it hold it and spray so with
this<00:02:02.319> whiskey<00:02:02.679> bit<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.399> we've<00:02:03.549> just<00:02:03.759> used

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.020
