hi<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.410> wanted<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:02.010> simple<00:00:02.610> high<00:00:02.879> voltage

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hi so I wanted a simple high voltage

de<00:00:06.210> Graaff<00:00:06.240> machine<00:00:06.420> but<00:00:07.049> unfortunately<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
de Graaff machine but unfortunately the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.890 
de Graaff machine but unfortunately the
humidity<00:00:08.280> here<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:08.550> Manila<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.300> high<00:00:09.570> that

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
humidity here in Manila is so high that

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.200 
humidity here in Manila is so high that
I<00:00:10.050> couldn't<00:00:10.380> get<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.650> work<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.969> have

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
I couldn't get it to work and I have

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.360 
I couldn't get it to work and I have
another<00:00:12.420> video<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.170> which<00:00:13.799> shows<00:00:14.040> the

static<00:00:17.460> electricity<00:00:17.810> so<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> decided<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.439> go

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
static electricity so I decided to go

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.040 
static electricity so I decided to go
one<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> these<00:00:20.130> mosquitoes<00:00:20.880> zapper<00:00:21.330> racket

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
got a small battery inside you plug it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.880 
got a small battery inside you plug it
into<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> mains<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> charges<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.080> it's

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890

into the mains and it charges it it's
got<00:00:32.040> an<00:00:32.099> on/off<00:00:32.399> switch<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> button

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
got an on/off switch and in a button

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.660 
got an on/off switch and in a button
that<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.500> hold<00:00:34.680> down<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> button<00:00:35.010> it's

that when you hold down the button it's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.959 
that when you hold down the button it's
armed<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.110> test<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.820> like

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
armed so if I test this you see like

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.319 
armed so if I test this you see like
that<00:00:39.079> now<00:00:40.250> just<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> open<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.059> let<00:00:42.239> me

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that now just to open it up you let me

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.490 
that now just to open it up you let me
just<00:00:42.510> make<00:00:42.660> sure<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:43.460> there<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:45.170> we<00:00:46.170> open

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
just make sure it's there you go we open

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.450 
just make sure it's there you go we open
this<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.770> now<00:00:48.649> inside<00:00:49.649> you'll<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
this up now inside you'll see the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.080 
this up now inside you'll see the
battery<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.890> won't<00:00:53.309> remove<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.730> circuit

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
battery and I won't remove this circuit

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.660 
battery and I won't remove this circuit
board<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.539> yet<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.710> you'll<00:00:55.829> see<00:00:56.039> hopefully

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
board just yet but you'll see hopefully

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.849 
board just yet but you'll see hopefully
you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.629> some<00:00:57.809> large<00:00:58.020> capacitors<00:00:58.680> in

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
you can see some large capacitors in

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.520 
you can see some large capacitors in
there<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.239> course<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> transformer<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
there and of course the transformer and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
there and of course the transformer and
the<00:01:01.739> transformer<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> key<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:02.940> that's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the transformer is the key here that's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.149 
the transformer is the key here that's
what's<00:01:03.390> stepping<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:03.989> our<00:01:04.260> small<00:01:04.710> voltage

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
what's stepping up our small voltage

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.520 
what's stepping up our small voltage
here<00:01:05.369> which<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.790> probably<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.360> don't<00:01:07.350> know

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
here which is probably I don't know

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.550 
here which is probably I don't know
maybe<00:01:07.590> three<00:01:08.040> volts<00:01:08.640> something<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.560> or

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
maybe three volts something like that or

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.219 
maybe three volts something like that or
six<00:01:10.860> volts<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.549> stepping<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:12.060> too<00:01:12.420> at

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
six volts and it's stepping out too at

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.600 
six volts and it's stepping out too at
the<00:01:13.409> moment<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.799> don't<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> would

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the moment I don't know but I would

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
the moment I don't know but I would
estimate<00:01:15.000> around<00:01:15.830> maybe<00:01:18.229> valves<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.350> volts

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
estimate around maybe valves and volts

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.649 
estimate around maybe valves and volts
three<00:01:20.400> thousand<00:01:20.790> volts<00:01:20.820> something<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.479> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
three thousand volts something like that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.140 
three thousand volts something like that
not<00:01:22.200> extremely<00:01:22.619> high<00:01:22.920> high<00:01:23.250> enough<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.729> zap<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
not extremely high high enough to zap a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.230 
not extremely high high enough to zap a
mosquito<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.170> won't<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.470> high<00:01:26.210> now<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
mosquito but it won't be that high now a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.640 
mosquito but it won't be that high now a
lot<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.509> people<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.470> project

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
lot of people for this kind of project

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.770 
lot of people for this kind of project
would<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.369> take<00:01:29.520> apart<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.090> disposable

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
would actually take apart a disposable

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
would actually take apart a disposable
camera<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.470> use<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> flash<00:01:32.130> circuit<00:01:32.759> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
camera and use the flash circuit that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.109 
camera and use the flash circuit that
works<00:01:33.630> fine<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.100> cheap<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.700> so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
works fine but this is so cheap and so

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.679 
works fine but this is so cheap and so
easy<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.810> modify<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.700> use<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.420> just

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
easy to modify and to use that it's just

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.179 
easy to modify and to use that it's just
not<00:01:39.869> worth<00:01:40.079> bothering<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> camera

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
not worth bothering with the camera

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.760 
not worth bothering with the camera
circuits<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.049> might<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.740> might

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
circuits now what I might do is I might

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.370 
circuits now what I might do is I might
actually<00:01:44.040> keep<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.579> handle<00:01:45.119> part<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.170> chop

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
actually keep this handle part and chop

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.880 
actually keep this handle part and chop
it<00:01:46.530> off<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:46.950> because<00:01:48.259> there's<00:01:49.259> no<00:01:49.439> benefit

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it off here because there's no benefit

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.410 
it off here because there's no benefit
to<00:01:49.950> me<00:01:50.159> taking<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.670> out<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:50.909> making<00:01:51.210> my<00:01:51.390> own

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
to me taking this out and making my own

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.600 
to me taking this out and making my own
case<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.829> already<00:01:53.130> quite<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.399> good

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
case for it it's already quite a good

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
case for it it's already quite a good
case<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> make<00:01:54.930> sure<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.229> no<00:01:55.409> one

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
case it's going to make sure that no one

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.200 
case it's going to make sure that no one
accidentally<00:01:56.040> gets<00:01:56.310> zapped<00:01:56.640> by<00:01:56.969> touching

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
accidentally gets zapped by touching

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.530 
accidentally gets zapped by touching
transform<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.200> anything<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> I'm

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
transform or anything like that so I'm

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.940 
transform or anything like that so I'm
going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> pause<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> video<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.530> I'll<00:02:01.680> come

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
going to pause the video and I'll come

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.240 
going to pause the video and I'll come
back<00:02:02.100> when<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.399> made<00:02:02.579> some<00:02:02.729> progress

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
back when it made some progress

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.080 
back when it made some progress
hi<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.110> just<00:02:05.320> finished<00:02:05.590> my<00:02:05.710> build

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
hi so I just finished my build

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.890 
hi so I just finished my build
unfortunately<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.120> had<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.270> remove<00:02:07.660> the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
unfortunately I had to remove the

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.350 
unfortunately I had to remove the
battery<00:02:08.380> because<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:09.009> AC<00:02:09.280> charging<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.179> key

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
battery because the AC charging so key

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.110 
battery because the AC charging so key
inside<00:02:10.690> here<00:02:10.990> actually<00:02:11.410> blew<00:02:11.680> up<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:12.130> think<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
inside here actually blew up I think the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.020 
inside here actually blew up I think the
reason<00:02:13.390> for<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.570> is<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.990> had<00:02:14.200> it

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
reason for that is that I had it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.520 
reason for that is that I had it
customized<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.450> they<00:02:16.600> would<00:02:16.870> always<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.410> on

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
customized it so they would always be on

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.770 
customized it so they would always be on
and<00:02:17.800> at<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.310> time<00:02:18.580> we<00:02:18.760> sparked<00:02:19.270> while<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.660> was

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
and at the time we sparked while it was

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.320 
and at the time we sparked while it was
charging<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.740> think<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.490> didn't<00:02:21.670> like<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.030> so

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
charging I think it didn't like that so

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.090 
charging I think it didn't like that so
I've<00:02:22.450> now<00:02:22.600> got<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.900> hooked<00:02:23.050> up<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.410> 5<00:02:23.800> volt

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
I've now got it hooked up to a 5 volt

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.610 
I've now got it hooked up to a 5 volt
power<00:02:24.340> source<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.810> I'll<00:02:25.959> turn<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.320> on<00:02:26.410> and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
power source and I'll turn it on and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.020 
power source and I'll turn it on and
you'll<00:02:26.709> see<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> light<00:02:27.160> comes<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.790> we'll

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
you'll see the light comes on and we'll

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.970 
you'll see the light comes on and we'll
test<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.390> out<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:28.810> on<00:02:28.990> this<00:02:29.170> piece<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.560> metal

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
test it out just on this piece of metal

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.090 
test it out just on this piece of metal
you<00:02:33.570> can<00:02:34.570> see<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.780> makes<00:02:34.959> pretty<00:02:35.230> big<00:02:35.560> sparks

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
you can see it makes pretty big sparks

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.660 
you can see it makes pretty big sparks
pretty<00:02:36.400> loud<00:02:37.620> one<00:02:38.620> thing<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.890> did<00:02:39.100> test<00:02:39.400> is

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
pretty loud one thing I did test is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.070 
pretty loud one thing I did test is
using<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.300> as<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:41.110> EMP<00:02:41.980> device<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.450> made<00:02:44.050> a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
using this as a EMP device so I made a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.260 
using this as a EMP device so I made a
coil<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.560> wire<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:45.100> placed<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.910> over<00:02:46.000> this

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
coil of wire I placed it over this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.640 
coil of wire I placed it over this
connected<00:02:47.020> it<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.170> each<00:02:47.620> terminal<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.400> then

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
connected it to each terminal and then

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.520 
connected it to each terminal and then
basically<00:02:50.650> short<00:02:51.310> Soviet<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.380> put<00:02:53.380> the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
basically short Soviet so it put the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.470 
basically short Soviet so it put the
pulse<00:02:53.890> through<00:02:54.160> here<00:02:54.400> made<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> magnetic<00:02:55.180> field

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
pulse through here made a magnetic field

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.470 
pulse through here made a magnetic field
and<00:02:56.290> actually<00:02:56.470> fry<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.070> my<00:02:57.400> thermometer<00:02:57.940> here

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
and actually fry it my thermometer here

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.810 
and actually fry it my thermometer here
even<00:02:59.380> if<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.560> remove<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.100> battery<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.550> put<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
even if I remove the battery and put the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.390 
even if I remove the battery and put the
battery<00:03:00.940> back<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.450> it<00:03:01.570> doesn't<00:03:01.840> work<00:03:01.959> anymore

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
battery back in it doesn't work anymore

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.080 
battery back in it doesn't work anymore
unfortunately<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.430> didn't<00:03:03.610> catch<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.970> on

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
unfortunately I didn't catch that on

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.630 
unfortunately I didn't catch that on
camera<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:05.050> I<00:03:05.440> figured<00:03:05.890> we<00:03:06.010> can<00:03:06.130> try<00:03:06.340> with<00:03:06.400> this

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
camera so I figured we can try with this

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.720 
camera so I figured we can try with this
calculator<00:03:07.510> instead<00:03:08.049> so<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.040> let<00:03:09.370> me<00:03:09.489> connect

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
calculator instead so I let me connect

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.540 
calculator instead so I let me connect
this<00:03:09.910> up<00:03:11.040> just<00:03:12.040> make<00:03:12.280> sure<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:12.610> dead

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.010 

so<00:03:18.550> I've<00:03:18.640> got<00:03:18.790> one<00:03:18.970> time<00:03:19.240> we're<00:03:19.450> going<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.720> one

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
so I've got one time we're going to one

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.100 
so I've got one time we're going to one
part<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.590> coil<00:03:21.210> which<00:03:22.210> is<00:03:22.240> permanently

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
part of the coil which is permanently

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.690 
part of the coil which is permanently
connected<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.740> then<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.070> other<00:03:24.190> one<00:03:24.430> I'll

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
connected and then the other one I'll

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.270 
connected and then the other one I'll
just<00:03:25.000> touch<00:03:25.210> against<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.530> let's<00:03:26.830> get<00:03:27.100> our

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
just touch against it so let's get our

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.610 
just touch against it so let's get our
calculator<00:03:27.460> and<00:03:28.390> I'll<00:03:28.870> just<00:03:29.050> put<00:03:29.260> in<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.440> bunch

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
calculator and I'll just put in a bunch

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.610 
calculator and I'll just put in a bunch
of<00:03:29.770> nines<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:30.910> can<00:03:31.060> see<00:03:31.210> that<00:03:31.390> there<00:03:31.630> place

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
of nines so you can see that there place

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.950 
of nines so you can see that there place
the<00:03:32.830> coil<00:03:33.130> over<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.730> top<00:03:33.940> turn<00:03:34.900> on<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.170> device

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.590 

to<00:03:40.960> make<00:03:41.110> sure<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.820> okay<00:03:42.820> so<00:03:43.330> we<00:03:43.450> actually

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
to make sure this okay so we actually

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.540 
to make sure this okay so we actually
just<00:03:43.990> reset<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.590> zero<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.370> just

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
just reset it to zero so it just

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.420 
just reset it to zero so it just
restarted<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.270> calculator<00:03:46.890> but<00:03:47.890> everything

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
restarted the calculator but everything

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.220 
restarted the calculator but everything
else<00:03:48.580> still<00:03:48.850> works<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:49.660> let's<00:03:49.810> try<00:03:50.020> that<00:03:50.170> again

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
else still works so let's try that again

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.470 
else still works so let's try that again
for<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:50.980> thermometer<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.670> really<00:03:51.940> has<00:03:52.120> killed

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
for the thermometer it really has killed

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.400 
for the thermometer it really has killed
it<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.900> know<00:03:53.020> it<00:03:53.260> will<00:03:53.530> not<00:03:53.650> turn<00:03:53.950> on<00:03:55.410> remove

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
it you know it will not turn on remove

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.750 
it you know it will not turn on remove
the<00:03:56.560> battery<00:03:57.040> put<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:58.270> battery<00:03:58.630> back<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:59.760> it's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
the battery put the battery back in it's

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.240 
the battery put the battery back in it's
a<00:04:00.820> brand<00:04:01.060> new<00:04:01.120> battery<00:04:01.360> by<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.780> way<00:04:01.960> just<00:04:02.890> will

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
a brand new battery by the way just will

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.280 
a brand new battery by the way just will
not<00:04:03.400> turn<00:04:03.610> on<00:04:03.760> any<00:04:03.940> more<00:04:04.150> sensitive<00:04:04.810> receive

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
not turn on any more sensitive receive

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.600 
not turn on any more sensitive receive
this<00:04:05.440> EMP<00:04:05.950> pulse<00:04:06.750> or<00:04:07.750> EMP<00:04:08.110> so<00:04:09.010> we've<00:04:09.310> got<00:04:09.460> the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
this EMP pulse or EMP so we've got the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.490 
this EMP pulse or EMP so we've got the
numbers<00:04:10.210> on<00:04:10.330> there<00:04:10.510> now<00:04:10.690> let's<00:04:11.110> try<00:04:11.320> that

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
numbers on there now let's try that

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:20.060 
numbers on there now let's try that
again

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.580 

okay<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.450> time<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:21.930> put<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.110> bunch<00:04:22.410> of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
okay that time it's put a bunch of

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.170 
okay that time it's put a bunch of
different<00:04:23.040> numbers<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.520> there<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:23.970> it's

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
different numbers on there and it's

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.300 
different numbers on there and it's
displayed<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.930> E<00:04:25.170> for<00:04:25.560> error<00:04:25.800> let's<00:04:26.100> see<00:04:26.250> if

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
displayed and E for error let's see if

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.850 
displayed and E for error let's see if
we<00:04:26.430> can<00:04:26.580> reset<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.180> yeah<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.500> although<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.830> is

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
we can reset that yeah so although it is

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.650 
we can reset that yeah so although it is
messing<00:04:29.310> with<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.550> calculator<00:04:30.030> it's<00:04:30.420> not

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
messing with the calculator it's not

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.350 
messing with the calculator it's not
killing<00:04:30.990> it<00:04:31.080> completely<00:04:31.740> so<00:04:32.370> let's<00:04:32.580> just<00:04:33.240> put

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
killing it completely so let's just put

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.600 
killing it completely so let's just put
in<00:04:33.480> five<00:04:33.690> five<00:04:33.900> five<00:04:34.110> five<00:04:34.290> five<00:04:34.460> bunch<00:04:35.460> of

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
in five five five five five bunch of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.660 
in five five five five five bunch of
fives<00:04:35.850> try<00:04:36.420> one<00:04:36.600> last<00:04:36.810> time<00:04:37.280> make<00:04:38.280> sure<00:04:38.490> this

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
fives try one last time make sure this

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.920 
fives try one last time make sure this
is<00:04:38.880> safe<00:04:40.310> okay<00:04:41.310> put<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.880> coil<00:04:42.120> over<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.720> cap

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
is safe okay put the coil over the cap

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.320 
is safe okay put the coil over the cap
later<00:04:43.340> put<00:04:44.340> on<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.550> back<00:04:44.700> of<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:44.910> calculator

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
later put on the back of the calculator

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.690 
later put on the back of the calculator
this<00:04:45.540> time<00:04:45.600> see<00:04:46.020> if<00:04:46.050> it<00:04:46.170> makes<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.440> difference

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
this time see if it makes a difference

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:53.150 
this time see if it makes a difference
turn<00:04:47.700> on<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.910> device<00:04:51.200> okay<00:04:52.230> make<00:04:52.830> sure<00:04:53.010> it's

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
turn on the device okay make sure it's

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.360 
turn on the device okay make sure it's
safe<00:04:54.110> let's<00:04:55.110> check<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.530> calculator<00:04:56.010> that

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
safe let's check the calculator that

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.970 
safe let's check the calculator that
time<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:56.940> did<00:04:57.060> nothing<00:04:57.420> at<00:04:57.540> all<00:04:57.770> let's<00:04:58.770> strike

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
time it did nothing at all let's strike

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:06.260 
time it did nothing at all let's strike
back<00:04:59.160> on<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.400> front<00:04:59.580> again<00:05:04.190> okay<00:05:05.190> turn<00:05:06.060> it<00:05:06.090> off

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
back on the front again okay turn it off

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.790 
back on the front again okay turn it off
for<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:06.480> second<00:05:06.870> make<00:05:07.050> sure<00:05:07.080> it's<00:05:07.290> safe

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
for a second make sure it's safe

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.480 
for a second make sure it's safe
I<00:05:08.090> had<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.210> sitting<00:05:09.390> on<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:10.100> metal<00:05:11.100> shield

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
I had it sitting on the metal shield

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.660 
I had it sitting on the metal shield
here<00:05:11.760> so<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.240> was<00:05:12.420> obviously<00:05:13.410> shocking<00:05:13.950> right

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
here so it was obviously shocking right

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:23.180 
here so it was obviously shocking right
let's<00:05:15.030> try<00:05:15.270> again<00:05:18.950> okay<00:05:19.980> I<00:05:20.190> should<00:05:20.790> say<00:05:22.190> so

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
let's try again okay I should say so

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.580 
let's try again okay I should say so
it's<00:05:23.370> just<00:05:23.580> reset<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.060> zero<00:05:24.420> so<00:05:24.990> it's<00:05:25.170> a<00:05:25.320> fun

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
it's just reset it to zero so it's a fun

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.890 
it's just reset it to zero so it's a fun
little<00:05:25.710> thing<00:05:26.150> there's<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.240> bunch<00:05:27.450> of<00:05:27.570> stuff<00:05:27.780> I

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
little thing there's a bunch of stuff I

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.480 
little thing there's a bunch of stuff I
want<00:05:28.020> to<00:05:28.140> try<00:05:28.290> with<00:05:28.560> this<00:05:28.680> it's<00:05:28.920> very<00:05:29.010> fun<00:05:29.460> to

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
want to try with this it's very fun to

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.070 
want to try with this it's very fun to
work<00:05:29.820> with<00:05:29.880> these<00:05:30.120> high<00:05:30.300> voltages<00:05:30.870> and

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
work with these high voltages and

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.460 
work with these high voltages and
because<00:05:31.980> it's<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.280> mosquito<00:05:32.580> swatter

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
because it's a mosquito swatter

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.290 
because it's a mosquito swatter
it<00:05:34.800> doesn't<00:05:35.100> really<00:05:35.220> carry<00:05:35.490> much<00:05:35.700> current<00:05:36.150> so

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
it doesn't really carry much current so

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.030 
it doesn't really carry much current so
even<00:05:36.510> if<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:36.660> did<00:05:36.810> accidentally<00:05:37.350> catch

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
even if you did accidentally catch

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.190 
even if you did accidentally catch
yourself<00:05:38.490> it's<00:05:39.150> just<00:05:39.390> going<00:05:39.510> to<00:05:39.570> hurt<00:05:39.840> it's

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
yourself it's just going to hurt it's

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.350 
yourself it's just going to hurt it's
nice<00:05:40.470> you<00:05:40.740> can<00:05:40.800> really<00:05:41.400> do<00:05:41.520> any<00:05:41.730> damage

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
nice you can really do any damage

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.930 
nice you can really do any damage
now<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.170> capacitors<00:05:43.710> inside<00:05:44.130> here<00:05:44.400> are<00:05:44.580> rated

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
now the capacitors inside here are rated

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.330 
now the capacitors inside here are rated
at<00:05:45.030> 400<00:05:45.660> volts<00:05:45.690> so<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.770> lets<00:05:46.950> us<00:05:47.100> know<00:05:47.190> that

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
at 400 volts so that lets us know that

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.930 
at 400 volts so that lets us know that
this<00:05:47.730> isn't<00:05:47.910> going<00:05:48.180> over<00:05:48.660> 400<00:05:49.200> volts<00:05:49.940> which

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
this isn't going over 400 volts which

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.820 
this isn't going over 400 volts which
means<00:05:51.150> it's<00:05:51.330> not<00:05:51.480> really<00:05:51.540> that<00:05:51.870> dangerous<00:05:52.680> it

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
means it's not really that dangerous it

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.380 
means it's not really that dangerous it
would<00:05:52.950> hurt<00:05:53.160> if<00:05:53.370> you<00:05:53.550> you<00:05:53.790> know<00:05:53.910> it<00:05:54.030> would

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
would hurt if you you know it would

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.880 
would hurt if you you know it would
shock<00:05:54.630> you<00:05:54.660> but<00:05:55.050> it<00:05:55.140> wouldn't<00:05:55.380> actually<00:05:55.530> cause

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
shock you but it wouldn't actually cause

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.850 
shock you but it wouldn't actually cause
any<00:05:56.130> damage<00:05:56.900> but<00:05:57.900> for<00:05:58.110> my<00:05:58.230> flight<00:05:58.440> voltage

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
any damage but for my flight voltage

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.160 
any damage but for my flight voltage
experiments<00:05:59.490> like<00:05:59.610> EMP<00:06:00.240> and<00:06:00.270> other<00:06:00.720> things<00:06:00.990> I

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
experiments like EMP and other things I

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:10.250 
experiments like EMP and other things I
want<00:06:01.380> to<00:06:01.440> try<00:06:01.650> it's<00:06:01.920> really<00:06:02.310> perfect<00:06:09.260> so

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
want to try it's really perfect so

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.990 
want to try it's really perfect so
