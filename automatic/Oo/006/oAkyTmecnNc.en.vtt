very sensitive about when you're writing

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.580 
very sensitive about when you're writing
for<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> voice<00:02:05.480> what<00:02:06.480> you<00:02:06.690> can't<00:02:06.990> teach<00:02:07.290> is

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
for the voice what you can't teach is

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.889 
for the voice what you can't teach is
inspiration<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.550> ideas<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.450> that's<00:02:09.630> often

inspiration and ideas and that's often

inspiration and ideas and that's often
how<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.170> works<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:11.130> days<00:02:11.880> go<00:02:11.910> past<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
how it works you as days go past you

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.420 
how it works you as days go past you

have all these little tiny ideas and you

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.040 
have all these little tiny ideas and you
store<00:02:14.670> them<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.269> spouts<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.630> paper<00:02:15.840> or

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
store them up on the spouts of paper or

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.930 
store them up on the spouts of paper or
just<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.410> your<00:02:16.440> mind<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.459> then<00:02:17.580> when<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.790> comes

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
just in your mind and then when it comes

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.180 
just in your mind and then when it comes
to<00:02:18.150> writing<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.570> piece<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.050> think<00:02:19.290> well<00:02:19.890> what's

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
to writing a piece you think well what's

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
to writing a piece you think well what's
what's<00:02:20.580> sort<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.690> bits<00:02:21.930> box

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
what's sort of in the in the bits box

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.900 
what's sort of in the in the bits box
and<00:02:22.620> then<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.070> fish<00:02:23.250> something<00:02:23.580> out<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.850> you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and then you fish something out and you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.370 
and then you fish something out and you
think<00:02:24.150> actually<00:02:24.269> yeah<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
think actually yeah this this is the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.080 
think actually yeah this this is the
place<00:02:25.590> for<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.010> little<00:02:26.160> bit<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.940> to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
place for this a little bit I like to

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.640 
place for this a little bit I like to
think<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.530> my<00:02:28.530> music<00:02:29.239> perhaps<00:02:30.239> almost<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.590> a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
think of my music perhaps almost on a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.580 
think of my music perhaps almost on a
time<00:02:32.430> graph<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.360> sort<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.780> start<00:02:34.050> with<00:02:34.110> almost<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
time graph I sort of start with almost a

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.729 
time graph I sort of start with almost a
map<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.400> whole<00:02:35.580> piece<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.330> music<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:37.019> really

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
map of the whole piece of music I really

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.610 
map of the whole piece of music I really
find<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.310> helps<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.850> have<00:02:39.330> an<00:02:39.959> idea<00:02:40.410> of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
find that it helps to have an idea of

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.800 
find that it helps to have an idea of
what<00:02:41.010> I'm<00:02:41.190> trying<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.519> do<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.090> larger<00:02:42.600> scale

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
what I'm trying to do on a larger scale

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.990 
what I'm trying to do on a larger scale
there's<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.320> joy<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.190> would<00:02:44.370> use<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.610> word

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
there's a joy and I would use that word

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.199 
there's a joy and I would use that word
very<00:02:45.080> advisedly<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.440> working<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.400> paper<00:02:47.910> you

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
very advisedly in working on paper you

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.330 
very advisedly in working on paper you

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
were spread it out across the floor you

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.340 
were spread it out across the floor you
can<00:02:50.519> invent<00:02:50.850> different<00:02:51.120> ways<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.690> sketching

maybe one day become truly original is

maybe one day become truly original is

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
everything but I don't think I'm at that

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.820 
everything but I don't think I'm at that
point<00:03:22.280> yet<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.910> mean<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.750> made<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.020> career<00:03:24.410> writing

them The Vicar of Dibley and mr. bean
I<00:03:31.489> used<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.360> Cathedral<00:03:33.200> Choir<00:03:33.349> this<00:03:33.620> one<00:03:33.800> here

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
I used a Cathedral Choir this one here

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.360 
I used a Cathedral Choir this one here
at<00:03:34.069> Christ<00:03:34.250> Church<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.239> think<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:36.370> it's

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
at Christ Church so I think that it's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.430 
at Christ Church so I think that it's
it's<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.970> skill<00:03:38.360> like<00:03:38.599> anything<00:03:39.019> else<00:03:39.170> you

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
it's a skill like anything else you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.900 
it's a skill like anything else you
might<00:03:39.769> come<00:03:40.010> here<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.370> learn<00:03:40.489> how<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.640> be<00:03:40.819> an

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
might come here and learn how to be an

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.610 
might come here and learn how to be an
engineer<00:03:41.300> but<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.900> think<00:03:42.080> if<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.230> came<00:03:42.440> here

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
engineer but I think if you came here

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.490 
engineer but I think if you came here
and<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:42.890> learnt<00:03:43.280> about<00:03:43.519> choral<00:03:43.880> music<00:03:44.500> it

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
and you learnt about choral music it

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.259 
and you learnt about choral music it
would<00:03:45.650> be<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.799> skill<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.160> was<00:03:46.370> actually<00:03:46.760> more

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
would be a skill that was actually more

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.300 
would be a skill that was actually more
applicable<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.350> modern<00:03:48.620> life<00:03:48.799> than<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.160> might

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
applicable to modern life than you might

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.970 
applicable to modern life than you might
think<00:03:49.480> or<00:03:50.480> one<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.290> most<00:03:51.680> wonderful

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980
