00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
alright I'm just adding the the wheels

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.569 
alright I'm just adding the the wheels
to<00:00:32.099> establish<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> wheelbase<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:37.309> I'm<00:00:38.309> just

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
to establish the wheelbase here I'm just

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.610 
to establish the wheelbase here I'm just
gonna<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.480> front<00:00:42.530> start<00:00:43.530> to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
gonna go in with the front start to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740 
gonna go in with the front start to
indicate<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> profile<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.329> vehicle

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
indicate what the profile this vehicle

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
indicate what the profile this vehicle
is<00:00:45.840> gonna<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.110> looking<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:49.940> we're<00:00:50.940> really

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
is gonna be looking like we're really

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
important that as you start to sketch to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.420 
important that as you start to sketch to
kind<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.210> extend<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.260> arms<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.190> had

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
kind of extend your arms out like I had

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.200 
kind of extend your arms out like I had
mentioned<00:00:56.610> some<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.360> previous<00:00:57.870> videos

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
mentioned some of the previous videos

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.610 
mentioned some of the previous videos
that's<00:01:00.210> what's<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> give<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.230> your

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
that's what's going to give you your

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.039 
that's what's going to give you your
dynamic<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> flow<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.870> might

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
dynamic look and the flow that you might

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.590 
dynamic look and the flow that you might
be<00:01:04.170> looking<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:05.030> let's<00:01:06.030> take<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.420> practice

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
be looking for let's take some practice

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
be looking for let's take some practice
it's<00:01:07.110> not<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.650> gonna<00:01:07.740> come<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.520> easy

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it's not like it's gonna come that easy

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.560 
it's not like it's gonna come that easy
and<00:01:09.860> without<00:01:10.860> any<00:01:11.010> effort<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:12.060> takes<00:01:12.330> some

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and without any effort it takes some

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.820 
and without any effort it takes some
time<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:14.360> get<00:01:15.360> your<00:01:15.659> arms<00:01:16.170> used<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
time for you to get your arms used to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.859 
time for you to get your arms used to
this<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.280> emotion<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.180> definitely<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
this kind of emotion it's definitely a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.560 
this kind of emotion it's definitely a
different<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> drawing<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:21.270> don't<00:01:21.450> want

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
different way of drawing you don't want

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.010 
different way of drawing you don't want
to<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.170> labor<00:01:22.500> over<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:24.020> drawing

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to do is kind of labor over the drawing

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.270 
to do is kind of labor over the drawing
itself<00:01:26.600> our<00:01:27.600> labor<00:01:27.930> over<00:01:28.439> every<00:01:28.740> single<00:01:29.070> line

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
itself our labor over every single line

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.270 
itself our labor over every single line
that<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.670> start<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.960> draw<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> be

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
that you start to to draw you want to be

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.819 
that you start to to draw you want to be
able<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.670> make<00:01:32.820> sure<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.390> go<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:34.590> stroke

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
able to make sure that you go one stroke

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.789 
able to make sure that you go one stroke
at<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> time<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> mess<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.560> don't<00:01:37.560> worry

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
at a time and if you mess up don't worry

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.700 
at a time and if you mess up don't worry

now<00:01:45.710> already<00:01:45.979> as<00:01:46.399> I<00:01:46.579> start<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.969> draw<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:47.479> I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
now already as I start to draw this I

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.730 
now already as I start to draw this I
did<00:01:49.250> look<00:01:49.399> at<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:49.610> Ferrari<00:01:49.969> but<00:01:50.360> I'm<00:01:51.320> telling

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740

did look at a Ferrari but I'm telling
you<00:01:51.770> right<00:01:51.860> now<00:01:52.250> I've<00:01:52.490> made<00:01:52.700> one<00:01:53.060> mistake<00:01:53.240> I

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
you right now I've made one mistake I

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.850 
you right now I've made one mistake I
don't<00:01:53.719> know<00:01:53.869> whether<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.229> could<00:01:54.469> have<00:01:54.590> come

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
don't know whether you could have come

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.880 
don't know whether you could have come
you<00:01:54.890> caught<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.850> but<00:01:56.119> in<00:01:56.479> particular<00:01:57.140> what's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
you caught it but in particular what's

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.660 
you caught it but in particular what's
going<00:01:58.610> wrong<00:01:58.820> with<00:01:58.880> this<00:02:00.250> particular<00:02:01.250> vehicle

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
going wrong with this particular vehicle

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.330 
going wrong with this particular vehicle
is<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.689> distance<00:02:04.149> between<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.960> glass<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
is the distance between the glass the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.759 
is the distance between the glass the
front<00:02:07.610> windshield<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:09.380> front<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.649> the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
front windshield and the front of the

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.710 
front windshield and the front of the
car<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.369> should<00:02:10.670> be<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.819> little<00:02:11.060> bit<00:02:11.299> longer

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
car that should be a little bit longer

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.860 
car that should be a little bit longer
so<00:02:12.129> what<00:02:13.129> I've<00:02:13.250> done<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.489> think<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.970> brought<00:02:14.540> that

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
so what I've done I think I brought that

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.800 
so what I've done I think I brought that
windshield<00:02:15.560> out<00:02:16.280> too<00:02:16.819> far<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.480> should<00:02:17.720> have

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
windshield out too far and I should have

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.449 
windshield out too far and I should have
probably<00:02:18.080> taken<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.590> back<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> little<00:02:19.190> bit

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
probably taken that back a little bit

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.210 
probably taken that back a little bit
more<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.030> then<00:02:20.870> also<00:02:21.049> made<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.680> wheels<00:02:22.040> a

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
more and then also made the wheels a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.940 
more and then also made the wheels a
little<00:02:22.430> bit<00:02:22.549> larger<00:02:23.049> but<00:02:24.049> as<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.380> said<00:02:24.440> when<00:02:24.920> you

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
little bit larger but as I said when you

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.220 
little bit larger but as I said when you
start<00:02:25.250> doing<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.519> exercises<00:02:26.000> don't<00:02:26.810> go<00:02:27.049> back

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
start doing the exercises don't go back

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.069 
start doing the exercises don't go back
and<00:02:27.500> try<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.709> erase<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.459> correct<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.840> just

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
and try to erase and correct it and just

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:30.819 
and try to erase and correct it and just
move<00:02:30.319> on

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
move on

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.530 
move on
I<00:02:30.860> mean<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.459> if<00:02:31.849> you're<00:02:32.060> really<00:02:32.360> interested

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
I mean you if you're really interested

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.259 
I mean you if you're really interested
in<00:02:32.870> getting<00:02:32.989> good<00:02:33.290> at<00:02:33.470> drawing<00:02:34.010> then<00:02:34.430> you're

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
in getting good at drawing then you're

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.940 
in getting good at drawing then you're
gonna<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.630> doing<00:02:35.959> quite<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.380> few<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.829> these

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
gonna be doing quite a few of these

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.390 
gonna be doing quite a few of these
sketches<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.840> know<00:02:39.099> whatever<00:02:40.099> it<00:02:40.310> is

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
sketches that you know whatever it is

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.610 
sketches that you know whatever it is
that<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.760> do<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.390> one<00:02:41.599> particular<00:02:41.959> day<00:02:42.349> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
that you do that one particular day and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.620 
that you do that one particular day and
theoretically<00:02:43.579> the<00:02:43.849> next<00:02:44.120> couple<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.480> days

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
theoretically the next couple of days

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.039 
theoretically the next couple of days
should<00:02:45.019> negate<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.970> previous<00:02:47.389> day<00:02:47.540> sketches

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
should negate the previous day sketches

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.830 
should negate the previous day sketches
and<00:02:48.670> just<00:02:49.670> little<00:02:49.970> by<00:02:50.060> little<00:02:50.329> you'll<00:02:50.569> just

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
and just little by little you'll just

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.319 
and just little by little you'll just
see<00:02:51.470> an<00:02:51.590> improvement<00:02:51.950> you'll<00:02:52.280> get<00:02:52.489> better<00:02:52.639> and

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
see an improvement you'll get better and

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.270 
see an improvement you'll get better and
it<00:02:53.870> just<00:02:54.139> means<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.799> got<00:02:54.829> to<00:02:54.950> be<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.100> little

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
it just means you got to be a little

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.170 
it just means you got to be a little
patient<00:02:55.459> that's<00:02:56.209> all<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.819> here<00:02:59.030> I'm<00:02:59.150> just

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
patient that's all and here I'm just

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.320 
patient that's all and here I'm just
gonna<00:02:59.420> indicate<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:01.100> spokes

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.030 

once<00:03:07.330> again<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.200> brush<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.650> I'm<00:03:08.770> using

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
once again the the brush that I'm using

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.990 
once again the the brush that I'm using
here<00:03:09.660> on<00:03:10.660> painter<00:03:11.260> 12<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.340> an<00:03:12.610> acrylic

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
here on painter 12 is is an acrylic

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.050 
here on painter 12 is is an acrylic
brush<00:03:13.390> for<00:03:14.379> some<00:03:14.620> reason<00:03:15.069> it's<00:03:15.280> caught<00:03:15.879> my

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
brush for some reason it's caught my

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.930 
brush for some reason it's caught my
fancy<00:03:16.330> with<00:03:16.980> being<00:03:17.980> able<00:03:18.129> to<00:03:18.310> get<00:03:18.550> some<00:03:18.760> nice

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
fancy with being able to get some nice

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.390 
fancy with being able to get some nice
thick<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.900> thin<00:03:19.930> lines<00:03:20.379> but<00:03:20.739> when<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:21.010> do<00:03:21.129> zoom

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
thick to thin lines but when you do zoom

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.009 
thick to thin lines but when you do zoom
up<00:03:21.610> on<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.940> hundred<00:03:22.300> percent<00:03:22.599> it<00:03:22.690> doesn't<00:03:22.930> look

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
up on it hundred percent it doesn't look

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.710 
up on it hundred percent it doesn't look
that<00:03:23.050> good<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.680> think<00:03:24.220> from<00:03:24.580> from<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.209> angle

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
that good I think from from this angle

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.229 
that good I think from from this angle
or<00:03:25.840> just<00:03:26.140> from<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:26.590> distance<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:27.640> itself<00:03:27.970> and

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
or just from this distance in itself and

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.750 
or just from this distance in itself and
it<00:03:28.390> seems<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.900> me<00:03:29.050> it<00:03:29.230> looks<00:03:29.470> pretty<00:03:29.890> nice<00:03:30.099> I

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.710 

have<00:03:36.760> been<00:03:36.940> experimenting<00:03:37.480> with<00:03:37.690> some<00:03:38.080> other

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
have been experimenting with some other

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.240 
have been experimenting with some other
mediums<00:03:40.720> on<00:03:41.049> painter<00:03:41.530> which<00:03:41.890> have<00:03:42.069> been

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
mediums on painter which have been

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:51.420 
mediums on painter which have been
honestly<00:03:43.120> pretty<00:03:43.540> impressive<00:03:44.019> I<00:03:50.340> mean<00:03:51.340> you

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430

honestly pretty impressive I mean you
got<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.880> side<00:03:52.269> view<00:03:52.480> mirror<00:03:52.720> just<00:03:52.959> about<00:03:53.799> done

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
got the side view mirror just about done

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.009 
got the side view mirror just about done
I'm<00:03:55.750> gonna<00:03:56.170> add<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:57.209> reflections<00:03:58.209> that's

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
I'm gonna add the reflections that's

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.559 
I'm gonna add the reflections that's
gonna<00:03:59.170> go<00:03:59.440> on<00:03:59.470> that<00:04:00.630> side<00:04:01.630> of<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:04.209> window<00:04:04.540> and

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
gonna go on that side of the window and

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:13.630 
gonna go on that side of the window and
we're<00:04:05.170> just<00:04:05.319> about<00:04:05.530> done

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.979 

what<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:14.760> seeing<00:04:15.090> me<00:04:15.239> there<00:04:15.450> at<00:04:15.659> the<00:04:15.719> bottom

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
what you seeing me there at the bottom

what you seeing me there at the bottom
of<00:04:16.320> each<00:04:16.769> wheels<00:04:17.160> I'm<00:04:18.530> when<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.620> start

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
of each wheels I'm when you start

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.620 
of each wheels I'm when you start
looking<00:04:20.190> at<00:04:20.280> side<00:04:20.579> views<00:04:20.910> there<00:04:21.209> still<00:04:21.449> it's

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
looking at side views there still it's

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.900 
looking at side views there still it's
not<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.810> complete<00:04:22.470> side<00:04:22.949> view<00:04:23.220> there's<00:04:23.550> there's

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
not a complete side view there's there's

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.600 
not a complete side view there's there's
a<00:04:23.970> little<00:04:24.360> bit<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:25.410> fisheye<00:04:26.070> view<00:04:26.130> that

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
a little bit of a fisheye view that

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.640 
a little bit of a fisheye view that
allows<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.150> see<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.740> tire<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:31.320> other

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
allows you to see the tire on the other

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.439 
allows you to see the tire on the other
side<00:04:32.340> of<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:33.389> vehicle<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:35.910> hope<00:04:36.270> you
