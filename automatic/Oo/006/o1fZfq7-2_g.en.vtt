00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.919
 hello how about youtube friends and -1 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 video this time I bring a tutorial of 

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:10.410
 minecraft and how could they see in the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.540
 title of the video that we are going to take advantage of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.720
 this for those who did is 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.470
 asking about the new update 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:22.380
 which is the 1.3 point 1 that brings this 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.700
 new option of dry morality the one that is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.490
 the destruction of 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.039
 play this through the cndh 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.039
 I'm not going to close this whatever 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.880
 that is Friday 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.480
 and well let's remove 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.980
 well then well to be seen in the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.820
 activation 1.3 point 1 and if we go to 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.060
 multiplayer we are going to leave this that 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.180
 is looking to search for flights of 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.640
 What are you going to get out and obviously 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.280
 right now I do not have anyone connected in 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.640
 my network that is not going to leave nobody sees your 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.550
 it works is like let's say like the xbox 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.860
 in playing by means of interconnection 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.770
 we have to be linked to the same modem 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.150
 or to the same ip to be able to this one 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.940
 find the worlds of our friends 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.310
 ok obviously if we have a partner 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.530
 Some friend who is not from our state 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.090
 we will not be able to do it unless 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.130
 let's use a server this a machine 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.320
 which then index all to a single ip 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.579
 ok or a single server does not use it here 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.329
 start this world to explain more 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.329
 or less a bit 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.800
 and good 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.900
 this if we go to here we destruction 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.000
 maybe open talk here we can 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.979
 configure what type of map we want 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.229
 to the traditional guayas survival of 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.180
 creative and then use tricks if 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.270
 we want to activate the commands then 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.490
 we have to start the benefit start 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.560
 because it's badly translated but it says 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.290
 start in the world of the we do not push 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.479
 in the spend ip in my case as it is already 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.520
 configured is going to give me this ip that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.150
 start and regularly with five points 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.150
 65 is going to be an ip machine if not this one 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.670
 if you start with a 92 by regular always 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.430
 is going to be a normal one and they will not be able to 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.609
 to access 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.960
 more or less I show you this what if 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.950
 we 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.590
 but 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.129
 painlessly artist and we put here and that 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.750
 here is not going to give for example 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.850
 our ip 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.770
 of my adapter and how come they are 192 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.300
 2,668 so and here he gives us he says 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.000
 eternity machi that gives us 565 52 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.620
 46 that also more that is here and good 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.320
 you are going to give another one we indicate 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.320
 configure this that we are going to do not 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.330
 let's go here to open this 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.300
 good window in the start menu can 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.020
 put to execute 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.130
 or well more a little faster 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.850
 he pressed on the windows key on his 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.860
 keyboard and the r key 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.200
 at the same time and will open them to this 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.430
 let's put the following command that 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.380
 it is at that point cpl just as they are 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.820
 seeing on screen and also how they are doing 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.520
 to be able to find in this is the video 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.920
 what to simply paste it here 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.140
 We accept and will open the 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.660
 next window once we're in 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.400
 this window will be our 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.050
 connections in my case like I'm in a 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.750
 desktop pc more to the connection area 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.000
 local and in the march you if you are in 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.920
 some laptop he's going to come out I imagine 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.980
 that some this one 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.819
 in some uefa network of flight like this 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.489
 we selected the maybe machine and gloves 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.930
 to download this is feared forgiveness or 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.180
 link to download on the fly and goes 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.459
 to be in the description to the video and 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.450
 well once we have we go 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:09.050
 to go here properties 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.120
 here we will go to select is 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.140
 here is internet protocol version 4 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.450
 and then we and on properties here and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.639
 we ignore everything we just chop where 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.490
 says advanced options 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.590
 and here attention to you here says 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.680
 metric interface 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.190
 they will leave in 12 and 5 thousand 7 min something 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:35.650
 so you do not palome this option like this 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.530
 let him put 1 and press on accept 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.419
 here accept close and here we can do 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.500
 our window once this is done 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.500
 that we open our march 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.460
 our program of march and we are 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.870
 all in a network simply with that 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.870
 open we will give and the ip of the 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.110
 machi or we can pass it to the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.240
 person simply even if I give you here 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.770
 multiplayer and automatically here you 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.140
 It's going to look like the world without needing 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.180
 add the ip nor sea and well then 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.330
 then already once this always does not 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.639
 be able to share your world 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.710
 then this is all for the time being 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.090
