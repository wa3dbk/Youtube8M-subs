i thought i had the render settings down
but<00:00:56.460> i<00:00:56.489> was<00:00:56.760> getting<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
but i was getting a lot of you see that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
but i was getting a lot of you see that
bounced<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.260> back<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> his<00:00:58.620> head<00:00:58.850> but<00:00:59.850> i

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
bounced to the back of his head but i

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.660 
bounced to the back of his head but i
was<00:01:00.030> getting<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> lot<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.500> frame<00:01:01.500> skipping<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
was getting a lot of frame skipping you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.789 
was getting a lot of frame skipping you
know<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.750> couldn't<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.439> figure<00:01:04.650> out

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
know and I couldn't really figure out

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.480 
know and I couldn't really figure out
why<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.960> thought<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> settings<00:01:08.159> were<00:01:08.250> fine

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
why so I thought the settings were fine

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.550 
why so I thought the settings were fine
so<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.299> did<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> few<00:01:09.659> things<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.350> still

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
so I just did a few things and it still

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.250 
so I just did a few things and it still
wasn't<00:01:10.680> fine<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> did<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> Medal<00:01:13.229> of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
wasn't fine and then I did a Medal of

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.840 
wasn't fine and then I did a Medal of
Honor<00:01:13.470> commentary<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> other<00:01:14.430> day<00:01:14.580> and

all I changed all the settings that just
changed<00:01:58.079> them<00:01:58.170> down<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> 720<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.060> hoping

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
changed them down to 720 so I'm hoping

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.970 
changed them down to 720 so I'm hoping
that<00:02:01.620> fixes<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.840> frame<00:02:03.840> skipping<00:02:04.500> problem

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
that fixes the frame skipping problem

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.790 
that fixes the frame skipping problem
that<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:05.430> was<00:02:05.640> having<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.560> let<00:02:07.560> me<00:02:07.650> know<00:02:07.770> how

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
that I was having so let me know how

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.460 
that I was having so let me know how
this<00:02:08.220> video<00:02:08.550> looks<00:02:08.850> if<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.330> looks<00:02:09.510> smooth<00:02:10.050> for

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
this video looks if it looks smooth for

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.210 
this video looks if it looks smooth for
the<00:02:10.530> most<00:02:10.740> part<00:02:10.890> uh<00:02:12.530> I'm<00:02:13.530> hoping<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.010> does<00:02:14.190> I

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the most part uh I'm hoping it does I

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.300 
the most part uh I'm hoping it does I
mean<00:02:14.550> if<00:02:14.670> there's<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.940> skip<00:02:15.210> here<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.600> there

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
mean if there's a skip here and there

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.590 
mean if there's a skip here and there
you<00:02:17.310> know<00:02:17.400> that's<00:02:17.610> no<00:02:17.760> big<00:02:18.000> deal<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.360> long<00:02:18.420> as

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
you know that's no big deal as long as

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.030 
you know that's no big deal as long as
it's<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.350> other<00:02:19.530> ones<00:02:19.800> where<00:02:20.010> I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
it's not like the other ones where I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.520 
it's not like the other ones where I
mean<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.310> other<00:02:20.460> ones<00:02:20.640> were<00:02:20.820> like<00:02:21.170> really<00:02:22.170> bad

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
mean the other ones were like really bad

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.260 
mean the other ones were like really bad
I'm<00:02:22.890> talking<00:02:23.190> about<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.490> know<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:24.030> really

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
I'm talking about you know like really

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.820 
I'm talking about you know like really
bad<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:25.520> if<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:27.330> one<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.570> pretty<00:02:27.990> decent<00:02:28.260> then

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
bad so if this one is pretty decent then

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.290 
bad so if this one is pretty decent then
I'll<00:02:28.950> just<00:02:28.980> stick<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.430> these<00:02:29.610> settings<00:02:29.970> and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
I'll just stick with these settings and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.330 
I'll just stick with these settings and
just<00:02:30.480> leave<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> at<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
just leave it at that and this is the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.070 
just leave it at that and this is the
best<00:02:32.490> i'll<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.820> able<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.150> for<00:02:33.330> now<00:02:33.420> until<00:02:34.050> I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
aim but eventually i'll get a SSD and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.160 
aim but eventually i'll get a SSD and
hopefully<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.280> fixes<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.700> but<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.750> anybody

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
what's causing this problem for my rig

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.720 
what's causing this problem for my rig
is<00:03:42.570> pretty<00:03:42.780> good<00:03:42.989> it's<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.280> recording

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
is pretty good it's just the recording

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.280 
is pretty good it's just the recording
part<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.420> gets<00:03:45.600> jacked<00:03:45.870> up<00:03:46.019> somebody

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
part of it that gets jacked up somebody

more<00:04:14.010> medal<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.370> honor<00:04:14.580> gameplay

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
more medal of honor gameplay

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.810 
more medal of honor gameplay
uh<00:04:15.770> only<00:04:16.770> reason<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.100> didn't<00:04:17.340> play<00:04:17.489> medal<00:04:17.700> of

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
uh only reason I didn't play medal of

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.479 
uh only reason I didn't play medal of
honor<00:04:18.000> now<00:04:18.239> was<00:04:18.510> because<00:04:18.540> like<00:04:19.020> I<00:04:19.140> said<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:20.220> was

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
honor now was because like I said it was

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.730 
honor now was because like I said it was
locking<00:04:21.330> up<00:04:21.570> on<00:04:21.780> me<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.080> figured<00:04:22.410> this<00:04:22.530> game

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
locking up on me and I figured this game

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.310 
locking up on me and I figured this game
is<00:04:22.950> less<00:04:23.130> intensive<00:04:23.760> on<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.750> computer<00:04:25.170> than

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
is less intensive on the computer than

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.650 
is less intensive on the computer than
Medal<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.680> Honor<00:04:25.860> probably<00:04:26.160> would<00:04:26.460> be<00:04:26.640> but<00:04:27.600> uh

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
Medal of Honor probably would be but uh

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.720 
Medal of Honor probably would be but uh
