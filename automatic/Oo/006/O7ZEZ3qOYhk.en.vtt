00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.649

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.069
 I do not roll up anymore and start with the analysis 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.060
 this time analyze the game paghman world 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.850
 page manuel was released the 20th anniversary of the creation of paghman 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.790
 is a 3d based on the roaming of free platforms for the playstation 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.100
 released on September 30, 1999 was released for the gringo and advance on the 17th 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.690
 November 2004 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.040
 history 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.850
 It all starts a day when palms come to your house to celebrate your 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 twentieth birthday but when he gets home he discovers that his family has been 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.199
 kidnapped by a robot impersonator of paghman take 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.220
 created by orson who is bent on stealing the identity of paghman paghman 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.009
 part towards coast and land where you must explore the various worlds to 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.939
 to free their kidnapped relatives, each of whom 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.979
 find in one of the different worlds the story is not bad 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.520
 although it is improvable but it justifies that we have to play the game although not 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.990
 it will be the story that will not engage in playing 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.990
 Here I leave the introduction 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.310
 or not 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 min 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.970
 the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.810
 the actress 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.229
 James 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.229
 I have 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.589
 now 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.499
 graphics 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:05.810
 the graphics are fine for their time are well detailed and the game 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:10.230
 it looks pretty good when playing it although what I liked most graphically are 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:14.459
 the colorful characters and scenarios that help you feel even more 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.459
 as if you were in the game 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:24.599
 the sound is one of the things that I like most about this game the soundtrack 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.949
 It is catchy and is very successful has several songs that adapt very well 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:32.619
 to the type of scenario in which you find yourself and is one of the most 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:33.679
 striking 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:38.059
 besides the sound effects are not left behind the sounds are very good 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:43.199
 and they remember the game of the recreational ones for example when palm 9 playability 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:49.269
 the game contains three modes the adventure mode the labyrinth mode and the mode 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.709
 classic in adventure mode paghman must travel the various worlds 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.559
 to rescue his family 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:04:00.069
 It is quite long and in my opinion varied although it can be made repetitive 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.879
 in labyrinth mode you have to chase blinky pinky joplin jimi 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.889
 crime go names xd 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.799
 in a variety of three-dimensional labyrinths is like the game of 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.799
 recreational but with three-dimensional graphics 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.559
 and in classic mode you can play the original pacman that of the recreational ones 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.559
 that will bring us many memories 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.199
 10 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.360
 it is important to highlight all the things that we can do against evil among them 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.200
 they run jump bounce 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.930
 to do somersaults to go off shooting diving running swim and even 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.690
 shoot among others truly this is a game that I really liked in your 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.690
 day and it is highly recommended 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.699
 Final note 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.689
 eight with five 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.330
 an 8 with five because the game is good but could be improvable with respect to its 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
 history and be a little more varied 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.629
 up to here the analysis 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.279
 do not forget that if you want you can ask me to analyze some other game of 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.430
 psx 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.430
 do not forget to rate and if possible subscribe 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:25.449
