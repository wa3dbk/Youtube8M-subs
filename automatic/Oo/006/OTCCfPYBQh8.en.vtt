00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello everyone and in this video I will tell 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.910
 you how to weave beads on the machine for 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.680
 I will need no machine for you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.080
 will need the usual leaving Khilok Odessa 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.849
 and the fact that this book, as it were, and I do not read it 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.370
 I did not come in handy but you can also 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.949
 take any to them that read just 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.260
 the book does not suffer mom 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.869
 ambitions and rice set up can itself take 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.210
 sewing threads i take both because 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.970
 that the iris is my basis for athens 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.949
 threads for beads you can do so 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.990
 same or vice versa or take something one 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.300
 that is, here as someone like everything for 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.130
 basis can be taken than from linnett but they 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.800
 will be very transparent therefore 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.870
 don't they don't like scotch scissors and you 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.469
 all as usual and beads which you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.440
 will come in handy 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.510
 Franz is a needle of a scene and a little one so as not to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.730
 could the power of the beads are hard to see but then 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.350
 you will also need to trace it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.870
 direct weaving scheme according to which we 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.629
 We will spin I spin under such a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.250
 scheme but since it is a little small 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.370
 I'll add some more rows first 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.590
 background and so here 13 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.840
 horizontal rows means us 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.880
 need 14 threads through which we 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.380
 will be based glue them with 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.060
 sides of the cover to make them easy 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.040
 finish because if you stick 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.369
 inside there is nothing to tear off 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.479
 dangle with the book and that is not really 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.320
 then suffer and what we do we 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.439
 we wind 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.490
 so that it turns out 14 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.490
 threads 1 by 2 and so on until 14 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.289
 and we secure the tip with duct tape should not 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.039
 be average not very others not very 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.630
 weak and begin to weave 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.340
 I have already broken several rows in order 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 to make it easier for you to show 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.530
 I want to draw your attention that I 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.060
 replaced black with green bread 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.250
 it seemed so the bauble will turn out 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.140
 Here are the first rows of the new ones on them 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.380
 pay attention because all 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.829
 done exactly the same way so we look our 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.890
 scheme 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.770
 on the left we have five whites as it were 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.709
 squares that is, we choose 5 white 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.000
 beads 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.299
 We look further at the following scheme 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.500
 three black but my case it will be 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:22.700
 green beads 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.819
 further we look at the scheme there again 5 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.900
 white beads 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.170
 we used to recruit 5 whites again 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.720
 beads in this way that is 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.660
 we got 5 white beads 3 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.930
 green and again 5 white camera a little 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.510
 candles for it is nothing we do 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.760
 we pass it all under the threads 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.940
 that is the way to turek us 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.569
 stayed here and the beads were distributed 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.569
 between threads 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.660
 that is, like this and that 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.090
 we correct it so that everything is normal 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.319
 that is, each bead was surrounded 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.480
 right and left 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.560
 thread here and so finally something else 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.950
 distributed 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.120
 that is, each of the two sides is surrounded 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.720
 wrong ones 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.510
 but only 1 she as if I have not 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.260
 just to the right what we do next we 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:28.709
 take our needle again and we must again 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.769
 pass it pisya in this hole 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.250
 only on top that is above these 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.250
 threads 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.510
 so here we are tightening 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.710
 somehow we fix the blue type 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.430
 here so we have continued so 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.410
 same ballsy that is, we look at the scheme to 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.270
 only the same row we recruit again 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.970
 conducts included below and then above 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.220
 if you run out of thread then you 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.820
 tie the knot as close as possible to 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.250
 beads 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.500
 then milich thread thread 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.050
 tying a bundle and shoulder detox again 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.640
 as in the beginning, I hope everything is clear 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.320
 explained and you liked this 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.110
 video tutorial if so put 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.110
 thumb up all bye and see you soon
