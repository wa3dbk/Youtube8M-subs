00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.910
 build in elevator to the moon 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.430
 it looks like something out of a fiction movie 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.810
 but a group of Japanese scientists 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.000
 they are convinced that they can 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.430
 build a space elevator so 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.760
 fast and relatively cheap from 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.310
 Earth to the moon 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.590
 but the technological evolution of our 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.150
 epoch allows that elevator 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.150
 can really be developed 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.090
 because the space elevator would have 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.090
 tens of thousands of kilometers long 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.070
 there are some initiatives but the group 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.380
 live pork in japan promises that it will have a 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.270
 elevator to the moon built for the 27 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.100
 of October of the year 2000 31 today 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.699
 group has raised more than 15 thousand dollars 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.710
 little more than 200 thousand Mexican pesos for 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.040
 take your project out 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.570
 the structure would be made of coal 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.090
 some cable scientists in charge 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.430
 of taking the elevator could take the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.340
 load into space easily 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.180
 these cars would be of modest size 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.159
 allowing energy costs 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.189
 do not be so exaggerated 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.380
 The purpose of the project is to create 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.780
 a 2- kilometer-high robot for 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.180
 carry some load and build a 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.700
 platform that joins the earth 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.700
 although the project sounds a bit 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.360
 eccentric it is not impossible for the group 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.180
 I will achieve it before 2007 the group 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.040
 I already had some advances built in 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.409
 actually this project is not something new 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.960
 it was only resumed 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.509
 happened to the moon to attach a 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.490
 space capsule like a rocket when 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.829
 the bridge is close enough 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.630
 of the moon would come off the capsule 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.539
 and it would stick to the surface of the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.640
 natural satellite this will allow you to have 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.810
 transport between the lunar surface and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.150
 the capsule 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.980
 although some decades are still missing 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.739
 so there is a permanent connection 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.690
 between the earth and the moon said invention 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.020
 it could work as a point of 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.720
 control ie a rocket could be 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.030
 sent to the orbital station so that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.440
 people or objects can be 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.750
 taken to the satellite 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.390
 report is waiting for the results of 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.069
 your feasibility studies these 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.800
 studies are what allowed the 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.849
 group decide whether the project is viable or 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.780
 do not 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.110
 regardless of the results of 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.730
 The studies of sport will also depend 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.860
 of the amount of money I make 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.020
 raise for your project 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.550
 and that of asteroids that can impact 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.550
 with the space elevator
