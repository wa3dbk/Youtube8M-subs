warm<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.860> up<00:02:26.040> prior<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.430> serving<00:02:26.909> it<00:02:27.000> which

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
warm it up prior to serving it which

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.670 
warm it up prior to serving it which
deprives<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.170> it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
deprives it of it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.179 
deprives it of it
of<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.340> nutrients<00:02:30.150> male<00:02:30.599> milk<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.140> stored<00:02:31.739> for

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
of the nutrients male milk is stored for

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.309 
of the nutrients male milk is stored for
a<00:02:32.219> shorter<00:02:32.549> time<00:02:32.579> doesn't<00:02:33.480> have<00:02:33.689> to<00:02:33.870> be<00:02:33.989> warmed

a shorter time doesn't have to be warmed
at<00:02:34.590> all<00:02:36.049> this<00:02:37.049> is<00:02:37.379> due<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.890> covalent<00:02:38.189> bonds

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
at all this is due to the covalent bonds

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.690 
at all this is due to the covalent bonds
where<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.719> atoms<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.349> opposite<00:02:40.950> spin<00:02:41.250> are

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
where the atoms of opposite spin are

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.949 
where the atoms of opposite spin are
released<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:43.370> gradually<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:45.269> result<00:02:45.659> of<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
bond energy is a growing temperature of

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
the molecule which ensures the constant

let's<00:02:52.290> check<00:02:52.469> this<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:52.920> little<00:02:53.280> test<00:02:53.519> that

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
let's check this with a little test that

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.110 
let's check this with a little test that
you<00:02:53.879> can<00:02:54.090> try<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.719> your<00:02:55.200> own<00:02:55.560> at<00:02:55.829> home<00:02:55.889> all<00:02:56.849> you

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
for approximately 15 minutes now let's

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.629 
for approximately 15 minutes now let's
drop<00:03:11.700> or<00:03:12.030> put<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.079> thermometer<00:03:13.620> inside<00:03:14.340> the
