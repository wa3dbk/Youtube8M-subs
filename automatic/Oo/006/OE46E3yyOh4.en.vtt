 hello people it's gecko and we get 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.600
 find today for a new 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.370
 tutorial so in this tutorial I will 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.860
 show you how to get 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.720
 the punches improved so everything 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.330
 first small precision I 'm not going 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.790
 to go into detail with regard to 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.040
 regards assembly and improvement 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.600
 sticks so for you I'll put you 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.510
 links in the description that you 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.880
 will lead to complete tutorials for this 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.100
 now we will start immediately with the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.040
 first step of this acquired tutorial and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.080
 fill the four chests to ham in the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.950
 first that is near the generator 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.500
 number 5 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.260
 there is where there is forgiveness where there is there 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.420
 all energy the second which is in 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.050
 against against the bottom of the dune 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:09.470
 I'll get to the third one 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:11.600
 finds near the church and the fourth 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.570
 which is right next to the tower 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.920
 mastodon or generator number 4 on 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.170
 could not fill you need everything 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.690
 just kill zombies nearby 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.720
 from these evil until they close 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.000
 and flees into the ground of herself a 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.350
 times these four badly filled you have 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.810
 simply direct you to a 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.880
 plate of elders and you can 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.369
 recover from there your super 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.130
 punch so there we have not seen can 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.840
 say thank you to the studio words so that's it 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.050
 the super punch that appears on 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.610
 this form once a super blow of 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.890
 fist in hand you simply 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.450
 assembly is improved at all four 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.000
 elementary sticks 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.210
 so I will put you the links of tutorials 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.390
 in the description 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.880
 [Music] 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.020
 once your staff seemed improved 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.420
 you're going to have to go to 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.869
 some places so the fire stick 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.940
 in the room was the apple pack the stick 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.099
 front in the robot naming at a 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.430
 robots test that passes in the middle of 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.170
 the map the ice stick in the robot 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.470
 naming freya it's the robot that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.720
 goes to the level of the church and the stick 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.690
 of lightning in the robot this moment thor 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.489
 who goes to the pass level passes a 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.709
 once gray pass place and forgiveness 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.599
 batting tower in the robots and well 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.459
 your four sticks will reappear in 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.360
 the full pac room so calls from 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.360
 from there you can retrieve them 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.579
 once these steps are completed 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.980
 you are going to need the mortars 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.170
 like me I call them or monkeys 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.260
 napalm like many of you them 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.299
 name so it's the same I would put you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.109
 a tutorial of a discussion to find out 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.850
 how will the assets and you will also 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.000
 need the drone of maxis 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.000
 [Music] 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.940
 once these objects in your possession 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.690
 you have headed near 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.390
 number 5 generators 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.940
 the one where there is coughing energy you 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.430
 go throw a mortar or a monkey 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.709
 of apple on this concrete plate that is 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.330
 find outside the map 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.720
 at the same time there will have to be a 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.850
 player in a robot to press a 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.250
 red button that will be in Paris between 2 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.160
 so this red button there is in all 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.860
 the robots so pressing on the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.700
 button will divide the missiles of the 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.680
 robots on this concrete pack and so to 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.390
 from there we need the dropt 2 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.700
 maxis so the drone of maxis that you 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.940
 are just let go and go him 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.510
 even head into the well which 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.450
 will have the effect of letting go 8 or 9 20 bis 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.160
 panzer so be ready to welcome them 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.200
 that's why I told you to 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.200
 get your sticks right before 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.520
 if it is necessary to chain them 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.130
 you need all the workers you will have 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.320
 destroys all the soldiers to say 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.940
 they said in chorus 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.900
 you are going to need blood, they say 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.780
 so 70 you 're going to use it to see 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.790
 an airplane illuminated in the sky at 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.890
 colors will not always see because 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.750
 of the model because of the studio mode but 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.270
 guys there so seven planes eliminated 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.520
 you're going to have to destroy and you're going 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.260
 having to find an invisible zombie this 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.690
 zombie that's spinning all the time around 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.960
 of the dune once that's fine 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.240
 visible killed there is the drone of maxis which 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.430
 will appear where you killed him so 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.770
 you get it back and now you 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.420
 have seen running in the slpa punch case 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.640
 where you're going to have to kill zombies 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.020
 white excess zombie on the clever you 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.270
 killed those zombies with the help of your 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.310
 super punch thing not to 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.600
 forget it must all players is 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.890
 a stick in the hands it is not necessary 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.990
 take one but you must have 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.310
 a stick in your hand so you go 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.110
 kill zombies until you have this 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.490
 little plaque that appears once 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.680
 this plaque appeared to you the 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.770
 recover and from there you have 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.910
 your super punch improve 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.800
 your super punch which is 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.930
 improved compared to the stick you 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.790
 have in hand so I had the 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.160
 stick to sell supercoupe points in front 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.040
 so to know that he is boycotting pretty much 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.220
 until the sleeve 40 I'm not mistaken 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.930
 39 40 and so here are the people me 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.419
