00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.650
 Keulrop this task missionaries course three shots today about how high the code catches 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.090
 I 'll try to explain. 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.599
 I'm talking about catching high chords in general, so I can not see f . 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:23.130
 Let's go to the Getmy Shop. 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:26.460
 The index finger is very important. 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.920
 It's sticking to the edge plate . 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:36.269
 Geurigoseo that you have become an important part here, here, for example, how to eat jeorida jeoljeolyi 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.590
 Give me the middle part, so there's no sound. 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.739
 Giving is the most important thing. 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.460
 So the thumb and index finger 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.910
 For example, to the fact these days doejyo give this stretch yijeongdoro 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.090
 I'm putting up a state that's that way. 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 By 90 degrees doejyo be presented when a close fit 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:00.360
 And give more force downwards and one word to the end 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.500
 The rest of the kids are up to something now that feeling every time slightly 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.489
 It's important. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.479
 If you say most of the fi code to catch 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.260
 Guys 2 3 4 Finger's power really ends up releasing too much 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.600
 But the finger that you have to give more power here 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.280
 For the first time, 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 Giving more yoge rest of the kids when the sound is much better to put feelings 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.270
 good 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:32.310
 That's because that 's because if the child is down, 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.300
 They get relatively stronger because they come up, but they get a good effect. 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.560
 You can. 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.399
 And when I look at my wrists I see a lot of bends now almost on my back 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.180
 About 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:47.610
 Can I show so much give off about the wrist also hurting very much 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.729
 At first, the negative wrist or shoulder is very powerful, 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.810
 The center of the force has been moved to the end. 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.110
 You can feel the pillar little by little if you keep practicing. 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.340
 It is. 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.610
 If your shoulder or wrist hurts, you really like your strength. 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.940
 There is little that the force necessary to remove the head is not well 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.149
 Doeguyo you need to keep practicing and Articles notice 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.140
 When you catch a f 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.190
 uh 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.360
 It's much quicker if you go ahead with the people's achievements and cover the rest of the kids 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.430
 You can catch 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:25.320
 When you first touch this, it will be relatively 1 2 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.950
 Of course you can go this way if you get wet, but you can spread it faster 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:35.370
 I know. 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:39.110
 Well, why the early pro f you go to the same shape in that way take f 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.110
 So it is a breadfare 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:51.260
 This practice can be a bit more comfortable when practicing high chords and other high chords. 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.260
 Can I be funny bead it is also true plan b c 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.600
 I can do it together with the need for an app flexi 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:07.520
 Today I learned about how to catch a high code coming 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:12.370

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.370
