00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.439
 Hello and first I welcome to 100 14 dead 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.520
 I'll show you that StrÃ¶hl is about to become z 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.729
 Members are not really 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:20.990
 the doctors said 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.929
 they can expand well signal 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.929
 that is, a nomadic signal is only brought to 15 luck 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.739
 after that you only need to title 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.909
 after Oxford steps and then reinstate councilor 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.360
 the second thing is to Peter 15 minutes facilities 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.720
 when the signal comes from behind 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.000
 every tenth Hayward 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.130
 when the signal comes from the front 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.130
 how that does not even know 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.360
 of course it works too 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.430
 then the third thing is the train tipped to run 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 now you can too 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 Naughty Dog 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.369
 When using Republic Land you have to pay attention 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.160
 the Dr 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
 what a child signal comes from directly behind 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.290
 because it is so scored then the whole thing goes 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.610
 You have to pay attention 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.080
 the best dress from a way to the title 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080
 through the whole club before him 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.429
 a lightning and dust in addition to the booked 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.429
 he still gets a signal from that 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.309
 You can also use that 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.309
 when bands like a small column find 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.939
 Idstein the TZ has a contract and we come 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.939
 comes the outgoing signal 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.589
 our tactics should stay the same 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.209
 exactly the same as here 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.529
 with tricks and Petermann you can also need 2 switches next to each other 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.419
 if for example 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.279
 these two failures 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.879
 to have a divorced effect 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:04.999
 for example 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.999
 this fails 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.549
 these will be for sale 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.549
 this fails 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.619
 this will be available 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.619
 we have a problem now 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.729
 a switch simply from both facts 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.409
 mg and our solutions 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.599
 because in BÃ¼chenbronn 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.599
 then just fine 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.439
 and now we have two planners a loving one 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.919
 or just under 5 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.189
 do two different things 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.839
 that was it 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:51.079
 there is first
