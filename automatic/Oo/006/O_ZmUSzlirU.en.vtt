00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.230
 queue in this tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:10.410
 how 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.580
 how to tame sharks 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.200
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.360
 get shark eggs like the one 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.840
 I have at hand right now 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.810
 this 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.090
 even though 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.740
 and they get killing the sharks 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.560
 usually they usually stumble 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.250
 the shark teeth and pretty 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.820
 rarely european shark eggs 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 shark eggs are quite difficult 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.270
 you have to kill many sharks to 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.960
 what 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.910
 to get one so I can kill 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.410
 one to see if he does not do it just to 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.410
 teach originated I already have 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.070
 It would be very lucky but you have to try 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.590
 I kill 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.590
 it's not appropriate what I wanted 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.250
 I do not think so 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.250
 and that rabbit 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.159
 and well we have to put it under the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.940
 water for the ions 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.460
 we throw this 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.920
 when it hatched I will go back to resume the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.920
 video so you can see what has come out 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.920
 As you can see, the eggs have already hatched 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.840
 they have left some tiny sharks 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.420
 the sharks are already domesticated 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.820
 so we're going to disappear from 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.409
 where the endings so 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.689
 this is the tutorial is all 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.690
 the sharks will no longer escape 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.800
 here any doubt 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.170
 in the comments you tell me 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.290
