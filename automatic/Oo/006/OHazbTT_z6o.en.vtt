00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.880
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.369
 shown how you windows ten quite legal 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.470
 can download from microsoft now 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.779
 microsoft is sliding because of the huge 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.760
 andrangs not to all update 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.279
 authorized computer the appropriate 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.100
 updates at the same time out but 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.320
 stop in several waves in a row 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.190
 and while the windows home users of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.860
 windows 7 and windows 8 have an update 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.170
 or to upgrade to windows 10 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.479
 are almost required to be windows 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.290
 Professional users rather untouched 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.030
 remained 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.600
 Nevertheless, users can of course 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.549
 also now windows 10 download 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.610
 Of course, that also has the advantage 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:54.780
 that at the end of a real 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.059
 installation medium and not directly 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.549
 into the cold water or into the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.140
 update must speak microsoft goes along 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.879
 time and provides you with a program 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.580
 available with yours 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.990
 desired version of windows 10 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.119
 can download 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.049
 link, of course, have in the description 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.299
 I already here too 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.220
 downloaded it leads to this 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.619
 we need only one 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.360
 scroll down a bit and then 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.500
 Here we have the possibility of the tool 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.570
 download 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.960
 depending on which operating system you have 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.909
 currently have 32bit or 64bit is 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.950
 the whole also offered accordingly 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.020
 but that has nothing to do with what they do 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.670
 be downloaded at the end including 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.330
 if you have a windows for example now 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 You can have 32 bits on your computer 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.569
 download a windows 10 64 bit right now 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.459
 or even easier just like that 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.740
 I have the 32 bit right now 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.810
 here also downloaded media 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.909
 creation tool but if you like the whole 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.630
 Just start it all is whole 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.610
 easy 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.610
 we get directly as the first option the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.649
 possibility either the calculator now 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.110
 just leave or just enter 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.939
 installation medium for another pc 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.100
 Of course, you can also create it 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.899
 use this pc so i will now 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.680
 which also make language then select 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.170
 German our windows 10 I take here 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.360
 pro because at the end of the calculator 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.880
 it will be updated and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.180
 here as architecture we can just 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.549
 both times 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.040
 I want that in my case 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.260
 as an iso-file because I can 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.290
 just open dvd among others burn 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.430
 or even on a usb stick 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.040
 we all already in other videos 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.170
 shown if for you only the usb stick 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 Variant in question then comes simply the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.319
 upper option 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.780
 that is also said directly because I 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.109
 Now both variants would like to have so 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.120
 32 bit and 64 bit that I have a stick 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.060
 need at least six gigabytes 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 has space 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.720
 So after I hit my pick 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.610
 Just click here to continue 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.650
 then it must be stated where the whole 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.620
 should be stored de 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.129
 maiziÃ¨re directly the desktop like that and now 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.540
 of course I have to wait for the moment 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.799
 how long the whole process in the end 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.080
 lasts of course 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.970
 depending on internet connection and how 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.220
 many other users apart from me 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.819
 currently just download windows 10 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.799
 want 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.049
 Microsoft was over the news too 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.579
 Although reading has extra capacity 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.860
 Shopped to other providers but 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.870
 currently the whole thing is still pretty fresh 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.940
 and therefore it will be reinforced 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.220
 Asked in so far that so the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.940
 second factor depending on how long that 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.940
 whole lasts 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.630
 then is the iso file for us 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.000
 disposal we can either now 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.310
 directly over the program still on one 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.959
 dvd burn or of course later 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.850
 just double click on the iso file 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.100
 or of course burn on a usb stick 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.590
 I have the iso file now on a cd 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.720
 burned and placed in the drive and 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.910
 of course, on the computer the corresponding 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.360
 boot order changed so that he 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.150
 first here now in my case of that 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.930
 cd drive slash dvd drive 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.820
 so start reading only the whole or was 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.290
 but here the choice because I yes 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.440
 just downloaded both versions 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.650
 but if I have windows 10 64 bit now 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.120
 want to install or windows 10 32 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.120
 bit okay
