00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
spritz a little water on it to make it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.860 
spritz a little water on it to make it
damp<00:00:40.340> again<00:00:40.640> before<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:41.000> blow<00:00:41.270> dry<00:00:41.510> it<00:00:41.540> and

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
damp again before you blow dry it and

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.900 
damp again before you blow dry it and
another<00:00:42.500> key<00:00:42.950> thing<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.670> want<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.850> remember

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
another key thing you want to remember

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.470 
another key thing you want to remember
is<00:00:44.540> to<00:00:44.840> do<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:45.290> on<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:46.040> tangled<00:00:46.550> hair<00:00:46.790> so

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
is to do this on the tangled hair so

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.780 
is to do this on the tangled hair so
even<00:00:48.170> before<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.590> blow<00:00:48.920> dry<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:49.520> want<00:00:49.700> to

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
even before you blow dry it you want to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.280 
even before you blow dry it you want to
comb<00:00:50.000> through<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.330> and<00:00:50.570> make<00:00:50.750> sure<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:50.960> there

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
comb through it and make sure that there

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.259 
comb through it and make sure that there
are<00:00:51.379> no<00:00:51.559> tangles<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.850> way<00:00:53.059> you'll

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
are no tangles and that way you'll

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:03.170 
are no tangles and that way you'll
minimize<00:00:53.449> breakage<00:00:53.960> on<00:00:54.379> your

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.880
