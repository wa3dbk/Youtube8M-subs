00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.309 

hi<00:00:01.890> there<00:00:02.159> people<00:00:02.610> I've<00:00:03.179> decided<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:04.020> want<00:00:04.259> to

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
hi there people I've decided I want to

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.130 
hi there people I've decided I want to
learn<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> lot<00:00:04.799> more<00:00:04.859> about<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.520> way<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:06.140> BLDC

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
learn a lot more about the way that BLDC

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.490 
learn a lot more about the way that BLDC
motors<00:00:07.589> are<00:00:07.919> driven<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.730> controlled<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.599> so

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
motors are driven and controlled and so

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.150 
motors are driven and controlled and so
what<00:00:10.980> I've<00:00:11.130> done<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.630> taken<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.290> mechanism

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
what I've done is taken the mechanism

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.330 
what I've done is taken the mechanism
out<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:15.260> cd-rom<00:00:16.260> drive<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:19.130> built<00:00:20.130> this

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
out of a cd-rom drive and built this

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.400 
out of a cd-rom drive and built this
circuit<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:22.400> on<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.580> breadboard<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.410> that

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
circuit here on this breadboard and that

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.769 
circuit here on this breadboard and that
circuit<00:00:25.920> basically<00:00:26.189> amplifies<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.359> signals

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
circuit basically amplifies the signals

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.400 
circuit basically amplifies the signals
from<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.320> Hall<00:00:29.189> effect<00:00:29.480> sensors<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
from the Hall effect sensors on the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.690 
from the Hall effect sensors on the
motor<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.130> gives<00:00:32.940> its<00:00:33.120> position<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
motor and that gives its position and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.760 
motor and that gives its position and
just<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.880> laugh<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.360> directly<00:00:37.290> connected

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
just for a laugh of directly connected

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.139 
just for a laugh of directly connected
the<00:00:38.300> outputs<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.809> Hall<00:00:40.200> sensors<00:00:41.149> directly

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the outputs of the Hall sensors directly

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
the outputs of the Hall sensors directly
to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.809> inputs<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.550> lt98<00:00:46.160> bridge<00:00:47.160> driver

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to the inputs of this lt98 bridge driver

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610 
to the inputs of this lt98 bridge driver
I<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.960> always<00:00:49.200> been<00:00:49.410> connected

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
I see and that's always been connected

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.869 
I see and that's always been connected
to<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.340> motor<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:52.340> one<00:00:53.340> thing<00:00:53.520> you'll<00:00:53.670> notice

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
to the motor and one thing you'll notice

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.470 
to the motor and one thing you'll notice
is<00:00:55.820> as<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.329> turn<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.780> motor<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
is as I turn the motor you can see the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.450 
is as I turn the motor you can see the
outputs<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.750> Hall<00:01:01.050> sensors<00:01:01.620> change<00:01:04.460> okay

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
outputs of the Hall sensors change okay

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.810 
outputs of the Hall sensors change okay
and<00:01:06.060> while<00:01:06.479> my<00:01:06.720> final<00:01:07.080> intention<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.979> got

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and while my final intention is an got

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.510 
and while my final intention is an got
to<00:01:08.970> learn<00:01:09.119> tic<00:01:09.600> C<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:12.200> write<00:01:13.200> some<00:01:13.500> code<00:01:13.979> which

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to learn tic C and write some code which

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.950 
to learn tic C and write some code which
will<00:01:14.729> generate<00:01:15.360> three-phase<00:01:16.130> PWM<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.960> control

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
will generate three-phase PWM to control

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.730 
will generate three-phase PWM to control
the<00:01:19.140> motor<00:01:19.320> smoothly<00:01:20.220> hopefully<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.420> anyway

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
the motor smoothly hopefully but anyway

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.980 
the motor smoothly hopefully but anyway
let's<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:22.979> turn<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.650> power<00:01:25.650> supply<00:01:26.130> up

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
let's just turn the in power supply up

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.770 
let's just turn the in power supply up
and<00:01:27.990> show<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.470> happens

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and show you what happens

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.760 
and show you what happens
so<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:34.210> at<00:01:34.420> four<00:01:34.720> volts

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.580 

six<00:01:38.490> books<00:01:40.580> eight<00:01:41.580> books

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.260 

ten<00:01:45.220> volt<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:47.200> 12<00:01:47.649> volt<00:01:47.890> now<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.549> current

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
ten volt that's 12 volt now the current

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.219 
ten volt that's 12 volt now the current
is<00:01:49.450> in<00:01:49.979> two<00:01:50.979> amps<00:01:51.460> which<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.659> very<00:01:52.930> high<00:01:53.200> for

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
is in two amps which is very high for

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.120 
is in two amps which is very high for
what<00:01:53.619> it's<00:01:53.770> actually<00:01:53.950> doing<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.590> can<00:01:56.799> see<00:01:56.979> the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
what it's actually doing you can see the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.690 
what it's actually doing you can see the
output<00:01:57.549> of<00:01:58.409> two<00:01:59.409> of<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.680> holes<00:01:59.890> effect

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
output of two of the holes effect

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.830 
output of two of the holes effect
sensors<00:02:01.149> on<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.390> oscilloscope<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.880> what

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
sensors on the oscilloscope right what

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
sensors on the oscilloscope right what
I'm<00:02:04.899> going<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.110> do<00:02:05.259> now<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.830> take<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.640> load<00:02:06.820> off

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
I'm going to do now is take the load off

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.710 
I'm going to do now is take the load off
the<00:02:08.860> motor<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:15.150> turn<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.330> power<00:02:16.540> supply

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
the motor just turn the power supply

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:27.190 
the motor just turn the power supply
again<00:02:21.390> six<00:02:22.390> looks<00:02:23.819> painful

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.780 

again<00:02:28.099> 12<00:02:28.790> volts<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.739> it's<00:02:30.739> drawing<00:02:31.040> two<00:02:31.370> amps

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
again 12 volts and it's drawing two amps

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.140 
again 12 volts and it's drawing two amps
which<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.870> way<00:02:33.050> too<00:02:33.110> high<00:02:33.640> if<00:02:34.640> you're<00:02:34.910> going<00:02:35.030> to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
which is way too high if you're going to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.449 
which is way too high if you're going to
drive<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:37.280> motor<00:02:37.459> digitally<00:02:38.150> like<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:39.459> for

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
drive the motor digitally like this for

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.339 
drive the motor digitally like this for
part<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.849> cycle<00:02:41.300> you'd<00:02:41.690> actually<00:02:41.840> need<00:02:42.200> to

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
part of the cycle you'd actually need to

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.199 
part of the cycle you'd actually need to
leave<00:02:42.819> one<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.150> phases<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.500> driven

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
leave one of the phases on driven

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.400 
leave one of the phases on driven
because<00:02:47.209> at<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.599> moment<00:02:47.630> it's<00:02:48.110> sort<00:02:48.319> of

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
because at the moment it's sort of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.360 
because at the moment it's sort of
fighting<00:02:48.890> itself<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.860> anyway<00:02:52.099> then<00:02:52.250> it

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
fighting itself so but anyway then it

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.530 
fighting itself so but anyway then it
worked<00:02:52.610> better<00:02:52.819> than<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.180> thought<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.420> would

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
worked better than I thought it would

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.530 
worked better than I thought it would
anyway<00:02:56.540> thank<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.110> for<00:02:57.260> watching
