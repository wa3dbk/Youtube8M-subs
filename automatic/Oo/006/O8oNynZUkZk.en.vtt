00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello you welcome school wanna 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.740
 know and i'm she is a master teacher 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.060
 biology 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 Now we will analyze the task 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.590
 swimming pool from the demo version 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.349
 ege biology for 2013 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.529
 So our question is set compliance 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.210
 between the characteristic of organisms and 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.939
 functional group of cats which he 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.789
 I will remind that functional 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.630
 There are three types of groups: these are producers. 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.789
 and consumers and decomposers ask us 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.329
 only about two of them about producers and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.170
 decomposers cool center from the word prodius 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.300
 these are the organisms that produce or 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.390
 produce organic matter from 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.920
 inorganic on earth by producers 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 are autotrophs 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.219
 that is, plants rent center is edius 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.440
 something to reduce this group of organisms 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.870
 which decompose the remains 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.570
 usually a number of cents is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.409
 bacteria let us see our options 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.549
 answers is the first link in the chain 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.570
 nutrition is the first generally plant 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.799
 is the first link in the food chain b 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.939
 synthesize organic matter from 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.670
 inorganic 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.630
 again here we are talking about producers or 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.560
 autodromes 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.409
 in use the energy of sunlight 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.759
 Pyatirechye plant right set 1 g 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.229
 eat ready organic 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.390
 substances it goes well with the summer center 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.920
 also end cops 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.670
 eat ready organic 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.470
 substances figure 2d return 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.130
 minerals system Vaika 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.950
 here it is about bacteria that is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.430
 arita cents 2 and decompose organic 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.220
 substances of two generals and the same too 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.850
 engaged in bacteria that is decomposers 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.950
 number 2 with you was a school want to know and I 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.040
 she is a mastrenko subscribe to our 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.330
 youtube channel and that know rubik 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.950
 come to us for courses in Moscow and 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.950
 get ready for the exam with us
