00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.550
 at 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.279
 hello everyone that says I hope 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.920
 that you are well we find ourselves for 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.860
 a little video on a heavy new 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.840
 caf which is on the cosmodrome at 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.480
 steppe level so from the first 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.610
 area of â€‹â€‹this pole so when you launch 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.430
 the exploration mode you go 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.470
 up to this little building and he's going 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.590
 to kill the vandals that are going 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.930
 go out with absolutely no delay of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.820
 repop so how's it going to happen 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.339
 concretely you have December in this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.379
 underground at this place precisely and 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.870
 you will only have to kill 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.479
 different vandals and scraps that go 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.339
 Repop indefinitely at this place so 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.110
 you go down just down to the level 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.600
 from the stairs you wait for your 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.059
 radar is reactive and you will see the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.070
 vandals go out like magic 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.450
 right in front of you so I have you 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.220
 makes a small cut and we get 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 found fifteen minutes later to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.110
 show you what has already been harvested 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.299
 with a player present on the amazon 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.900
 obviously already knows the same 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.150
 technical 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.359
 so you can notice that after 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.659
 15 minutes only we already have a 4 that 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.460
 is already pretty well stocked with a g 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.289
 legendary that's the good news 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.109
 so that sounds like a lute 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.179
 pretty efficient cellar even if honestly 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.399
 I think the theory of coffee lute 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.200
 would in my opinion only a 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.890
 history of headshots so no matter 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.539
 the place 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.090
 this place if it stays very 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.429
 interesting because despite all their pop 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.140
 epic enemies fast treatment 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.210
 as you can see it is going 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.280
 really a look attested that I you 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.380
 recommends the same title as that of 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.090
 come from all for this little video of 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.159
 squeeze that it will be useful to me and do not forget 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.229
 not to take pleasure in the game or 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.270
 those who are low level who discovers the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.159
 game I strongly recommend you do not 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.020
 not do that kind of farming well of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.759
 enjoy your experience thoroughly and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.710
 to play the game in a natural way 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.289
 I think you will appreciate again 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.850
 more beautiful and wonderful appearance 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.980
 of this adventure 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.540
 I do very very big kisses and I 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.000
 tell you very quickly for others 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.240
 tips about destiny ciao
