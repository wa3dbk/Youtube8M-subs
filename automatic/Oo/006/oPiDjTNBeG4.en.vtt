working<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:06.789> everything<00:01:07.180> for<00:01:07.330> cannabic<00:01:07.750> so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
working on everything for cannabic so

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.430 
working on everything for cannabic so
it's<00:01:07.960> almost<00:01:08.140> like<00:01:08.289> a<00:01:08.380> brand<00:01:08.649> new<00:01:08.740> laid

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
came with a new melon ice thing isn't

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.620 
came with a new melon ice thing isn't
skepta<00:01:16.020> modification<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> bolt<00:01:18.060> down<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
skepta modification to the bolt down the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.760 
skepta modification to the bolt down the
compound<00:01:19.620> bolt<00:01:20.300> voltage<00:01:21.300> system<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.620> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
compound bolt voltage system so this is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
compound bolt voltage system so this is
the<00:01:22.920> stock<00:01:23.330> stock<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.570> pretty<00:01:25.470> flimsy<00:01:27.140> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the stock stock one pretty flimsy the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.410 
the stock stock one pretty flimsy the
the<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.010> that's<00:01:29.220> been<00:01:29.430> actually<00:01:29.970> added<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the one that's been actually added to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.550 
the one that's been actually added to
this<00:01:30.720> lead<00:01:31.550> so<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.170> actually

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
this lead so this is it it's actually

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.190 
this lead so this is it it's actually
had<00:01:34.680> four<00:01:34.950> bolts<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.450> there's<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.140> one

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
had four bolts so there's one here one

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.930 
had four bolts so there's one here one
here<00:01:37.500> there's<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.920> underneath<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.580> counter

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
here there's one underneath the counter

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.340 
here there's one underneath the counter
pound<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:40.440> then<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.160> so<00:01:42.140> boy<00:01:43.140> it's

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
pound and then one here so boy it's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.859 
pound and then one here so boy it's
really<00:01:43.470> rigid<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> decent<00:01:45.510> tool

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
really rigid it's got a decent tool

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.469 
really rigid it's got a decent tool
pulse<00:01:46.200> down<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> tool<00:01:48.090> post<00:01:48.270> if

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
pulse down it this is the tool post if

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.320 
pulse down it this is the tool post if
it<00:01:48.570> came<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.780> from<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.560> factory<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.729> that

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
it came with from the factory and that

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.850 
it came with from the factory and that
actually<00:01:51.660> works<00:01:51.869> pretty<00:01:51.960> well<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.710> can

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
actually works pretty well so you can

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.410 
actually works pretty well so you can
see<00:01:53.040> I've<00:01:53.160> got<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.490> chunk<00:01:53.760> of<00:01:53.880> carbide<00:01:54.270> in

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
see I've got this chunk of carbide in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.640 
see I've got this chunk of carbide in
here<00:01:54.540> we're<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> face<00:01:55.050> this<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> we're

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
here we're going to face this and we're

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.469 
here we're going to face this and we're
going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.800> turn<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.690> alright<00:01:57.690> it's<00:01:58.259> got<00:01:58.410> a<00:01:58.440> new

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
going to turn it alright it's got a new

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.100 
going to turn it alright it's got a new
tail<00:02:00.479> stock<00:02:00.750> chuck<00:02:01.080> drill<00:02:01.680> chuck<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:03.110> it's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
tail stock chuck drill chuck and it's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.230 
tail stock chuck drill chuck and it's
got<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> quick<00:02:04.470> change<00:02:04.680> gearbox<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.759> all<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
got a quick change gearbox and all the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.600 
got a quick change gearbox and all the
threads<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.720> it'll<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.170> from<00:02:07.890> 8<00:02:08.100> threads<00:02:08.340> per

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
threads so it'll go from 8 threads per

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.170 
threads so it'll go from 8 threads per
inch<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.970> 56<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.860> point<00:02:11.490> five<00:02:11.760> point<00:02:12.000> seven

seven five to two and a half and three
and<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.560> believe<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:21.620> pitch<00:02:22.620> for

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
and I believe that that's the pitch for

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.229 
and I believe that that's the pitch for
the<00:02:23.100> metric<00:02:23.940> threads<00:02:24.420> okay<00:02:25.400> all<00:02:26.400> right<00:02:26.519> so

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
the metric threads okay all right so

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.090 
the metric threads okay all right so
let's<00:02:27.510> let's<00:02:27.989> fire<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.380> bad<00:02:28.590> boy<00:02:28.709> up

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
let's let's fire this bad boy up

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:41.350 
let's let's fire this bad boy up
see<00:02:29.400> how<00:02:29.580> cats

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.710 

nice<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.080> smooth<00:02:42.320> work<00:02:42.860> great

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
nice and smooth work great

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.490 
nice and smooth work great
will<00:02:45.110> show<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:46.100> next<00:02:46.310> one<00:02:46.430> will<00:02:46.640> be<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
will show the the next one will be the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.440 
will show the the next one will be the
turn

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
turn

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.420 
turn
and<00:02:50.870> will<00:02:51.020> actually<00:02:51.170> engage<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.950> food<00:02:52.190> for

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
and will actually engage the food for

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:03.630 
and will actually engage the food for
that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.270 

it's<00:03:03.940> about<00:03:04.390> zero

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
it's about zero

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.140 
it's about zero
go<00:03:06.459> ahead<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.790> pick<00:03:06.910> this<00:03:07.120> up

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
go ahead and pick this up

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.619 
go ahead and pick this up
it's<00:03:09.480> about<00:03:09.750> all<00:03:10.440> better<00:03:10.769> part<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:12.090> turn

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.670 

the<00:03:18.170> caliper<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:19.159> now<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:21.170> show<00:03:21.379> how

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
the caliper here now and to show how

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.410 
the caliper here now and to show how
much<00:03:21.829> we've<00:03:22.609> taken<00:03:22.849> on<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.699 

in<00:03:28.660> jail<00:03:28.990> it

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.720 

she's<00:03:33.159> taken<00:03:33.430> off<00:03:33.580> about<00:03:34.470> 70,000<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:36.549> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
she's taken off about 70,000 on the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.360 
she's taken off about 70,000 on the
diameter<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:37.330> about<00:03:37.980> 35,000<00:03:38.980> side<00:03:39.190> on<00:03:39.280> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
diameter so about 35,000 side on the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.250 
diameter so about 35,000 side on the
radius<00:03:39.790> in<00:03:40.480> one<00:03:41.379> cut<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:43.299> is<00:03:43.510> this<00:03:44.080> is

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
radius in one cut and this is this is

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.490 
radius in one cut and this is this is
not<00:03:44.379> a<00:03:44.670> inserted<00:03:45.720> carbide<00:03:46.720> it's<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.019> cemented

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
not a inserted carbide it's a cemented

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.750 
not a inserted carbide it's a cemented
carbide<00:03:48.329> it's<00:03:49.329> just<00:03:49.709> really<00:03:50.709> really<00:03:51.250> working

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
carbide it's just really really working

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.360 
carbide it's just really really working
well<00:03:51.940> in<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.900> surface<00:03:53.709> finish<00:03:54.010> on<00:03:54.159> this

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
well in that the surface finish on this

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.020 
well in that the surface finish on this
is<00:03:54.579> very<00:03:55.030> nice<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:56.140> works<00:03:56.980> really<00:03:57.459> well<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
is very nice and works really well I

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.330 
is very nice and works really well I
turned<00:03:59.019> this<00:03:59.170> one<00:03:59.379> down<00:03:59.560> this<00:03:59.769> morning<00:04:00.010> and

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
turned this one down this morning and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.300 
turned this one down this morning and
again<00:04:00.519> that<00:04:00.760> just<00:04:00.790> looks<00:04:01.299> great<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:03.040> that's<00:04:03.129> a

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
again that just looks great so that's a

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.190 
again that just looks great so that's a
little<00:04:03.459> even<00:04:03.849> operation<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.109> a<00:04:05.260> jet<00:04:06.299> BD<00:04:07.299> 920

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
little even operation it is a jet BD 920

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.010 
little even operation it is a jet BD 920
and<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.829> door

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
and and the door

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.810 
and and the door
got<00:04:15.020> an<00:04:15.170> extra<00:04:15.470> shelf<00:04:15.740> down<00:04:15.980> below<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.340> factory

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
got an extra shelf down below a factory

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.180 
got an extra shelf down below a factory
stand<00:04:17.350> effective<00:04:18.350> base<00:04:18.560> cabinet<00:04:19.070> I'm

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
stand effective base cabinet I'm

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.210 
stand effective base cabinet I'm
guessing<00:04:19.579> that's<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.910> at<00:04:20.600> least<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:21.019> $300<00:04:21.680> option

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
guessing that's a at least a $300 option

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.980 
guessing that's a at least a $300 option
on<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:25.120> basically<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.390> seems<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.810> work

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
on this so basically it seems to work

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.620 
on this so basically it seems to work
great<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.650> lot<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.730> capability<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.450> is<00:04:29.600> a

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
great a lot of capability it is a

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.820 
great a lot of capability it is a
reversing<00:04:31.330> reversing<00:04:32.330> motor<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.020> that's<00:04:33.590> a

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
reversing reversing motor and that's a

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.680 
reversing reversing motor and that's a

all the ways are hardened I don't
