00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
it all the way through and then this is

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.289 
it all the way through and then this is
basically<00:03:34.870> all<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.650> do<00:03:35.829> a<00:03:36.280> twist<00:03:37.000> from<00:03:37.180> the

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
basically all I do a twist from the

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.900 
basically all I do a twist from the
bottom<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.769> make<00:03:39.010> sure<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.579> it<00:03:39.730> actually

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
bottom and to make sure that it actually

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.110 
bottom and to make sure that it actually
twists<00:03:40.780> up<00:03:40.930> top<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.620> use<00:03:41.650> my<00:03:42.370> other<00:03:42.639> fingers

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
twists up top I use my other fingers

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.170
