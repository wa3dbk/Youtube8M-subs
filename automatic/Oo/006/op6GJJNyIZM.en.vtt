 but I do not feel happy 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.980
 there is nothing 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.540
 ask the marathoner with the absurd distances for any being 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.360
 human in fact he is the only one in the world type of tattoo 3 of the most

 Write a Review 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.210
 to almost 40 degrees negative 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.750
 the forecast is to run with almost 4 pounds in the river of January there is not a winter 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.590
 rigorous and more have to find creative solutions 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.020
 such as three 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.350
 in naryn fridge 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.730
 to -17 degrees three times a week it needs to pass through this period indicates 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.869
 whereas marking 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.079
 March 391 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.290
 inside the refrigerator after arriving at the time of the test he does not suffer 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.689
 low temperature 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:16.919
 it's just that outfit 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.430
 You can stay here for more than a few seconds. 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.689
 begin to suffer alone 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.259
 with this rigorous cold 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.740
 in this challenge 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.580
 there is no room for failures if you ride a little too much if alcohol 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.800
 continues to rise even if you tie or lose - and simplistic matters in looks 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.050
 hypothermia when body temperature is below normal 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:38.899
 It can kill 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.529
 so much suffering 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:41.299
 to win 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.859
 a medal and sometimes a trophy to my really democrat how much 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:46.629
 to the tire 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.919
 forlÃ¡n is March will run thinking three years 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.729
 He needs to train half tied up. 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:56.939
 there is no doubt what is different but this Brazilian 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:57.859
 deserves applause
