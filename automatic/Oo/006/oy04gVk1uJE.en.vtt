00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.249
 so successful at middleweight 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.329
 what irritates 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.609
 Trophies operated on 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.619
 SurTec Steinmeier is there 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.400
 really shortened 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.870
 currently only Dirk is 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.510
 Notes under Tel he is optimistic and of course, going great 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.070
 is developed 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.340
 today 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.670
 if he is naturally horny 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.820
 This really is an important September success 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.700
 that's all 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.810
 around 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.870
 last year 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.060
 in March for place 07 Rosetta been 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.060
 the Luxembourger word 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.870
 is not really both much much more versatile many colorful many topics 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.110
 all topics as real with the songs 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 and also implemented i think so 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.830
 a substance 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.140
 MV 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.770
 sparked 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.820
 light off 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.820
 and the usual right Phil Jackson 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.320
 Cooper have 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 to increase the Buwog percent 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 useless 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.110
 as a well-rehearsed team it's nothing 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.720
 So they'll hold on to that. Music therapy for me is all about that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.080
 percent 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.330
 the themes that my music can handle that keeps the races covered 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.120
 Remarks St 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.160
 so record firmer 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.660
 more on no one revises every step we want 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.100
 unconditional back therapy Moser nonsense 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.840
 but the songs view are structured so that everything is up to the fans and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.900
 that somehow everyone can go along with something when looking for a better one 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.869
 Destiny Then you can take from them forms like what 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.869
 that he is something positive and the cup is also something positive 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.559
 should finish 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.399
 favorite tracks 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.399
 he has JB the title kicks the free kick 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.689
 Son to songs like Miro Klose's amazing celebration-course 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.009
 so two weeks could look happy 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.329
 Wanted too 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.969
 on 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.869
 At last the official was one of the first songs they finished and promptly 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.869
 then we have always thought of form 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.169
 of course a little bit now 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.579
 also again 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.299
 the cards are the crime 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.369
 for the girls Prof 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:03.629
 sentimental life's work 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.459
 and percent 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.749
 Clear Sky Schalke can't be that sure for sure I'm sure 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.099
 that we do not because it is something like that 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.429
 and around 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.429
 yes the smoke became Germany's cool survivor 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.189
 Well, something yourself 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.969
 on the EM the barge resonances 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.959
 mine before Munich II the cost of the world so the turn through div the burst 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.999
 this burst by yesterday's anticipation 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.459
 inconceivable yellow 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.079
 and otherwise on MySpace and cross over to the release 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.079
 stressed out 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.989
 Christoph Bast 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.949
 for the already cool 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.139
 Brown's cell phone so and around 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.470
 Of course, one asks oneself already if one together around us first quasi break 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.790
 on these musicians 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.790
 what as such but also third place does so 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:03.869
 maybe still back 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.039
 but OK 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.379
 Do you want more? 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.529
 also 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:17.879
 "Sweet Potatoe is about to launch from the right 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.719
 The five-hour views have taken us the test persons way and one only 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.149
 times briefly video met several times already said Richards in one 

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:26.169
 postponed finished 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.169
 spry 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.240
 Fortress is also ignorant on the Aasee cool song since it's easy to ignore 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.370
 both heise like that 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.439
 but 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:40.289
 that's not necessarily warfare or historical 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.050
 however, the Wild the Bells did not want anyone in their care 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.830
 but so much to talk about that no civilians without the phone 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.830
 transmits 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.770
 Rostock 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.869
 Just tap and Sternberg simply says Bansa Internet 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.439
 and so on in the super-g 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.079
 We are now relaxed again when shooting the rule
