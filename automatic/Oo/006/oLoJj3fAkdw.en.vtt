00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:11.179
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:16.529
 review to sigma 17 to 50 mm f2 8 ex 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:20.580
 dg hsm lens I have this lens 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:25.050
 me as a successor to the kit objectively 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.949
 bought which at a nikon 3200 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.560
 it was the same with it 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.130
 focal length range as far as the kit 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.160
 objectively shows here but clearly 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.219
 better characteristics while being at 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.770
 objectively must clearly notice that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.489
 this lens is not for full size 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.420
 cameras is intended but for bsc 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.190
 cameras and exactly for such a camera 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.449
 I use it all, I have it too 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.210
 objectively in the first one and a half 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.430
 Months use possible very much 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.780
 convinced and I'm really satisfied 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.290
 with the picture results the pals 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.119
 the objective in cooperation with 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.509
 the camera he aims at earlier 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.960
 Report to the objective has been frequent 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.130
 criticized that the sun visor not 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.600
 properly hooked or just very lax holds 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:34.009
 I can not say that anymore now 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.350
 you have to be a little strong here 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.659
 Apply to the sun visor 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.610
 remove and open 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.400
 So here seems to be over time 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.970
 on 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.340
 after having corrected the objective 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.900
 otherwise it is really stable built 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:57.720
 notices that above all things about it 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:02:01.410
 when it is focused something 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.580
 heavier is compared to 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.560
 my kit objective what I before 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.729
 used respectively 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.670
 Actually it is not that 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:18.459
 Focus what is so difficult 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.650
 but that is not true even now 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.660
 overly stiff so I say 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.080
 that would bother me to focus that 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.510
 even the easy ones and play when I am 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.630
 that would like to do this manually 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.820
 unfortunately I always the switch too 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.640
 manually set as soon as I turn on automatic 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.230
 I can not do that manually 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.810
 After focusing it is a bit 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.760
 pity that would of course be a great 1 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.560
 managed that could still have objective 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.880
 At the same time I notice this and me 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.209
 believe that you can see it well if I 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.760
 now the focus year-round turn that 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.750
 The range of the ring is really 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.100
 very very small that is with one 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.410
 small movement of focus your ring 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.560
 the focus already remembers 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.959
 very big and it is very much in the end 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.290
 rough steps or one must 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.440
 He be very careful to be appropriate 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.780
 focus 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.680
 otherwise I noticed that hope 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.680
 you can stop now 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.319
 the lens clatters a bit that 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.650
 luck not to the lens cover 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.400
 So it does not easily make noise 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.200
 astonish 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.450
 At least I think that's normal 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.489
 not only is it my objective 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:39.819
 otherwise it works 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.639
 autofocus when taking pictures in the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.260
 automatic automatic mode she had 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.389
 precise and very fast 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.790
 I can not do any problems for myself 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:55.239
 determine 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:57.189
 also the os of the objective so the 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.700
 Movement stabilizer works 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:04.329
 here are also great times 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.199
 freehand shots in darkness man 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.030
 not in darkness but at 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:10.359
 worse light conditions 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.730
 possible without blurring the picture 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.620
 and i have problems in the end too 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.650
 recognize what I actually photographed 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.240
 have the autofocus itself is pleasant 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.490
 quietly so I can actually 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.539
 Do not complain about the volume 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.990
 concerns I have other objective where 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:36.659
 that is always very clear 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:41.139
 listen to the image quality is to say that 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:43.690
 in principle the pictures become blurred 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.340
 especially in low focal lengths 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.970
 17 millimeters but you realize that already 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.669
 the sharpness to the edge so slightly a little bit 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.490
 and then you lose in this 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.919
 focal length range and actually 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.050
 sees chromatic aberrations and also 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.710
 the picture is slightly distorted how far 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.050
 but then the focal length range in 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.300
 Direction 50 millimeters moves the more 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.130
 less is this picture error 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.780
 but overall, they are 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.719
 do not bother me saying so now 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.539
 would be 17 meters point with 17 mm 17 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.590
 Millimeter photo are with the lens 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.740
 not possible at all 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.520
 No, that's not it but you can do that 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.530
 ever notice 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.490
 Just look at the picture more closely 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:34.710
 look at and compare with each other 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:37.120
 through the relatively wide aperture 2.8 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.449
 can really be synonymous very much 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.520
 to turn pleasant pictures in the dark 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.349
 or photograph and is 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.009
 is also good times a video with 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:52.539
 that with the objective turn without that 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:56.500
 you get problems with the light 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:06:00.280
 Personally, I also like the objective 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:05.520
 very good in gegenlicht motives and also 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:09.190
 the okay of the lens is very close to me 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:13.990
 but it is also a little bit 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:18.629
 taste thing in total is the signal 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:22.020
 17 50mm really a very good allround 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:25.120
 Objective what a fair price 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.349
 is sold and what I really like 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.849
 can recommend 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:32.830
 who somehow cares about the little one 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.630
 Disadvantages of the lens can be distracting 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.930
 like to look for another one 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.940
 for me it is beginner and photographer 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.669
 start a clear increase to 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:48.729
 kit lens and therefore makes me this 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:52.120
 objectively at the time a lot of fun so that 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.700
 it was with my review to sigma 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.530
 lens 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.480
 he has liked the reviews 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:01.320
 like to go up there 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.850
 otherwise, who would like to be able to press 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.730
 questions or suggestions in the 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:08.400
 comments and describe and 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.700
 otherwise have a nice day 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.700
 soon
