Michelle what what what he's doing is

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.430 
Michelle what what what he's doing is
illegal<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.170> he's<00:00:44.160> committing<00:00:44.579> loan<00:00:45.090> fraud

value<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> house<00:00:50.610> which<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.210> harder<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.480> do

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
value of the house which is harder to do

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
value of the house which is harder to do
these<00:00:51.809> days<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:53.280> there's<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> lot

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
these days because there there's a lot

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.270 
these days because there there's a lot
more<00:00:53.760> scrutiny<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.780> appraisals<00:00:55.500> appraisers

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
more scrutiny for appraisals appraisers

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
more scrutiny for appraisals appraisers
but<00:00:57.090> still<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.539> possible<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.199> especially

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
but still it's possible and especially

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
but still it's possible and especially
when<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.309> markets<00:00:59.640> change<00:00:59.910> though<00:01:00.899> those

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
when the markets change though those

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.689 
when the markets change though those
types<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> things<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.800> happen<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.550> they're

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
types of things can happen but they're

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
types of things can happen but they're
also<00:01:02.820> getting<00:01:03.120> new<00:01:03.449> loans<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> property

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
also getting new loans on the property

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.050 
also getting new loans on the property
so<00:01:04.799> they're<00:01:04.920> getting<00:01:05.159> loans<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.909> they're

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
so they're getting loans then they're

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.670 
so they're getting loans then they're
pulling<00:01:06.390> money<00:01:06.540> back<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.350> creating

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
pulling money back out there creating

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
pulling money back out there creating
shadows<00:01:07.890> seconds<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.360> they're<00:01:09.510> doing<00:01:09.540> is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
shadows seconds so what they're doing is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
shadows seconds so what they're doing is
defrauding<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.619> lender<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.100> yeah<00:01:11.430> obviously

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
defrauding the lender and yeah obviously

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
defrauding the lender and yeah obviously
you<00:01:12.060> don't<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:13.290> we're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you don't want to do that what we're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.260 
you don't want to do that what we're
doing<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.710> perfectly<00:01:14.189> legal<00:01:14.430> though<00:01:14.760> let<00:01:15.180> me

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
doing is perfectly legal though let me

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.510 
doing is perfectly legal though let me
give<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.509> an<00:01:15.600> example<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.740> zero<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:17.280> deal

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
give you an example of a zero down deal

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.640 
give you an example of a zero down deal
so<00:01:17.759> you'll<00:01:17.880> understand<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.930> structure<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
so you'll understand the structure and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
so you'll understand the structure and
how<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.009> works<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.610> maybe<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.210> little<00:01:21.330> bit<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
how it works and maybe a little bit of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.840 
how it works and maybe a little bit of
the<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.049> some<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> ins<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.250> outs<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.670> this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the of some of the ins and outs of this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.570 
the of some of the ins and outs of this
process<00:01:24.450> let's<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.409> subject<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
process let's take subject to and I and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.730 
process let's take subject to and I and
I<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> hierarchy<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.720> structures<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
I have a hierarchy of structures that I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.690 
I have a hierarchy of structures that I
use<00:01:28.979> from<00:01:29.729> best<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.450> worse<00:01:30.810> depending<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
use from best to worse depending on the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.999 
use from best to worse depending on the
type<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.210> deal<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> seller

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
type of deal that it is what the seller

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.140 
type of deal that it is what the seller
needs<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.610> they're<00:01:35.729> trying<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> accomplish

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
needs what they're trying to accomplish

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
needs what they're trying to accomplish
and<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and what you're going to do with the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.210 
and what you're going to do with the
property<00:01:38.610> after<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
property after you get it but then that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.359 
property after you get it but then that
hierarchy<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.119> subject<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> top<00:01:43.560> then

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
hierarchy is subject to as the top then

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.639 
hierarchy is subject to as the top then
multi<00:01:44.909> mortgage<00:01:45.299> then<00:01:45.630> land<00:01:46.020> contract<00:01:46.500> or

we<00:03:03.480> all<00:03:03.600> know<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.810> about<00:03:04.350> eighty-five

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
we all know that about eighty-five

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.559 
we all know that about eighty-five
percent<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.640> for<00:03:05.880> sale<00:03:06.030> by<00:03:06.150> owners<00:03:06.390> don't

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
percent of for sale by owners don't

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.810 
percent of for sale by owners don't
succeed<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> likelihood<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.489> they're<00:03:08.700> not

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
succeed so the likelihood is they're not

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.069 
succeed so the likelihood is they're not
going<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> sell<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.180> for<00:03:09.299> sub<00:03:09.600> by<00:03:09.720> owner<00:03:09.870> and

going to sell it for sub by owner and
save<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.410> commission<00:03:10.829> either<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:12.030> they<00:03:12.510> don't

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
save the commission either so they don't

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.560 
save the commission either so they don't
have<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> lot<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.230> choices<00:03:14.150> so<00:03:15.150> if<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.360> go<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
have a lot of choices so if you go to

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.699 
have a lot of choices so if you go to
them<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:15.870> say<00:03:16.079> I'd<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.530> buy<00:03:16.650> this
