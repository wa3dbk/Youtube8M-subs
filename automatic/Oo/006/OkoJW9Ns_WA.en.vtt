know<00:05:38.640> that<00:05:38.790> by<00:05:38.940> now<00:05:38.970> so<00:05:39.440> do<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.500> think<00:05:40.740> they

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
know that by now so do I think they

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.860 
know that by now so do I think they
should<00:05:41.040> keep<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.310> CCP<00:05:41.790> in<00:05:42.060> modern<00:05:42.600> warfare<00:05:42.720> 3

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870

not<00:05:49.470> quite<00:05:49.680> sure<00:05:49.710> in<00:05:50.160> between<00:05:50.490> there<00:05:50.730> 6-3<00:05:51.330> 6-3

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.990 
not quite sure in between there 6-3 6-3
is<00:05:51.870> still<00:05:52.050> growing<00:05:52.200> do<00:05:53.160> I<00:05:53.220> think<00:05:53.460> hacking<00:05:53.850> is

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
is still growing do I think hacking is

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.200 
is still growing do I think hacking is
reasonable<00:05:54.540> /<00:05:54.810> acceptable<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:55.890> what<00:05:56.730> do<00:05:56.970> you

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
reasonable / acceptable and what do you

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.730 
reasonable / acceptable and what do you
have<00:05:57.450> with<00:05:57.960> /<00:05:58.560> against<00:05:59.130> it<00:05:59.480> first<00:06:00.480> off<00:06:00.690> I<00:06:00.990> don't

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
have with / against it first off I don't

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.690 
have with / against it first off I don't
think<00:06:02.250> hacking<00:06:02.640> is<00:06:02.760> acceptable<00:06:04.400> however<00:06:05.400> let

zombies or whatever then

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.719 
zombies or whatever then
I'm<00:06:41.110> completely<00:06:41.530> fine<00:06:41.740> with<00:06:41.770> that<00:06:41.919> what<00:06:42.550> is<00:06:42.639> my

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
I'm completely fine with that what is my

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.129 
I'm completely fine with that what is my
favorite<00:06:43.030> call<00:06:43.180> of<00:06:43.270> duty<00:06:43.479> game<00:06:43.690> they<00:06:43.990> would

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:44.139 
favorite call of duty game they would

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.320 
favorite call of duty game they would
probably<00:06:44.349> have<00:06:44.560> to<00:06:44.590> be<00:06:44.710> world<00:06:45.069> at<00:06:45.190> war<00:06:45.370> I<00:06:45.639> think

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
probably have to be world at war I think

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.899 
probably have to be world at war I think
if<00:06:46.419> they<00:06:46.539> remastered<00:06:47.169> that<00:06:47.349> 6v6<00:06:47.830> no<00:06:48.669> lag

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:48.909 
if they remastered that 6v6 no lag

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.820 
if they remastered that 6v6 no lag
shooting<00:06:49.360> all<00:06:49.569> the<00:06:49.629> stuff<00:06:50.229> included<00:06:50.680> that

shooting all the stuff included that

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.409 
shooting all the stuff included that
would<00:06:50.949> be<00:06:51.039> the<00:06:51.340> most<00:06:51.520> fun<00:06:51.729> game<00:06:51.970> to<00:06:52.000> play<00:06:52.210> for

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
I'm looking forward to that that'll be

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.770 
I'm looking forward to that that'll be
towards<00:07:18.340> when<00:07:18.550> modern<00:07:18.819> warfare<00:07:19.000> 3<00:07:19.150> comes<00:07:19.569> out

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
towards when modern warfare 3 comes out

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.439 
towards when modern warfare 3 comes out
and<00:07:20.099> the<00:07:21.099> last<00:07:21.280> question<00:07:21.430> here<00:07:21.879> what<00:07:22.060> isn't

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449 
and the last question here what isn't

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:23.969 
and the last question here what isn't
the<00:07:22.539> biggest<00:07:22.719> difference<00:07:23.169> between<00:07:23.229> cod<00:07:23.740> and

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:23.979 
the biggest difference between cod and

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.550 
the biggest difference between cod and
conduit<00:07:24.400> what<00:07:25.389> I<00:07:25.419> noticed<00:07:25.840> about<00:07:25.930> the<00:07:26.169> conduit

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 
conduit what I noticed about the conduit

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.350 
conduit what I noticed about the conduit
is<00:07:26.740> that<00:07:26.889> it<00:07:26.979> has<00:07:27.099> such<00:07:27.340> a<00:07:27.370> smooth<00:07:27.789> operating

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
is that it has such a smooth operating

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.529 
is that it has such a smooth operating
system<00:07:29.139> or<00:07:29.319> engine<00:07:30.069> or<00:07:30.190> whatever<00:07:30.460> it<00:07:31.090> runs<00:07:31.360> so

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
system or engine or whatever it runs so

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:33.480 
system or engine or whatever it runs so
smoothly<00:07:31.930> I've<00:07:32.229> never<00:07:32.530> seen<00:07:32.800> it<00:07:32.949> lag<00:07:33.159> I've

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
smoothly I've never seen it lag I've

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.480 
smoothly I've never seen it lag I've
never<00:07:33.729> seen<00:07:34.090> you<00:07:34.810> know<00:07:35.319> I<00:07:35.710> don't<00:07:36.099> know<00:07:36.190> just

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:36.490 
never seen you know I don't know just

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.820 
never seen you know I don't know just
you<00:07:37.060> know<00:07:37.180> no<00:07:37.629> lag<00:07:37.840> shooting<00:07:38.289> or<00:07:38.409> anything

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:38.830 
you know no lag shooting or anything

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.159 
you know no lag shooting or anything
host<00:07:39.550> migration<00:07:39.849> I<00:07:40.419> think<00:07:40.750> it<00:07:40.840> just<00:07:40.870> runs

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
host migration I think it just runs

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.839 
host migration I think it just runs
really<00:07:41.349> smooth<00:07:41.740> the<00:07:41.949> only<00:07:42.190> problem<00:07:42.610> with<00:07:42.759> the

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:42.849 
really smooth the only problem with the

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.809 
really smooth the only problem with the
conduit<00:07:43.210> is<00:07:43.449> that<00:07:43.659> it<00:07:43.810> has<00:07:43.990> a<00:07:44.430> no-party<00:07:45.430> system

00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:45.819 
conduit is that it has a no-party system

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:48.029 
conduit is that it has a no-party system
which<00:07:45.940> kind<00:07:46.240> of<00:07:46.300> sucks<00:07:46.539> but<00:07:46.779> anyway<00:07:47.680> guys<00:07:47.800> hope
