00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.170
 Hello dear subscribers 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.080
 viewers today made a cellar visa 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.050
 discovered three cans of the old new 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.119
 the drink is essentially mine 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.070
 concentrated sweet compote and so y 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.660
 I have in stock 2 cans of grape 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.230
 drink and 1 can 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.510
 cherry and plum open banks and pour 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.290
 drinks in the delivery room of course already 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.320
 without berries 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.700
 while I pour out the comfort I will pour 20 grams 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.270
 saw river dry yeast 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.270
 warm water 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.540
 yeast activated i add them 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.960
 put under the water slide and put in 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.960
 warm place 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.320
 braga from compote played for days 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.500
 six seven 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.100
 she still stood for eight days 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.690
 sediment settled now rented composition 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.690
 as put on distillation 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.280
 quality control braga on the color she 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.280
 good about the cycle las scent incomprehensible 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.900
 tastes a little bitter and co2 but which 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.990
 diluted three or four times 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.729
 put on the first distillation as always 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.920
 make the first distillation 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.920
 without collecting all the fractions in one bowl 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.369
 I buried a comfortable moonshine I start the selection 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.700
 not knowing exactly cut down here compote contained 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.210
 sugar so take away at random how much 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.210
 will turn out 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.100
 after the first haul I got 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.570
 one and a half comfortable homebrew look 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.570
 what is his castle 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.540
 his fortress 43 44 degrees diluted 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.459
 with water about a liter and a half 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.459
 and put on 2 stage 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.630
 buried moonshine and start assembling one 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.290
 I will collect fractions over low heat 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.290
 bit by bit 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.700
 burga finish me my faction 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.700
 sucker 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.490
 selected fin fraction and so and 100 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:13.090
 milliliters and the smell is so nice 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.340
 not smelly but so small 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.100
 middle fraction and immediately controlling 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.620
 video alcoholometer for fortress to select 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.320
 roughly plans at degrees 40 45 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.990
 Well here's how to fly culture show 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.840
 a little over 40 finish board average 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:33.730
 the main faction and that of 7 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.280
 liters of compote turned 800 us liters 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.040

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.040
 heads and tails look at his fortress 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.670

 liter of water to start over low heat 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.600
 take away the milliliters 50 head fractions 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.210
 stock head tastes so sadko cotton 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.030

 finishing washing sukhoparnik and start 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.840
 aromatization 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:52.050
 ran a flavored home brew smell 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.050
 in the kitchen we drive them just gorgeous class 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.639
 starting tasting moonshine from compote 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:20.590
 which I then flavored 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:23.130
 juniper poured so light 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.740

 again there is a row and then its reversal 40 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:02.919
 degrees and he still stood with me for three days 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.860
 about the taste is the taste of juniper 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:09.070
 drops just barely slightly 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.050
 there is more aroma and smell 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.889
 this drink i.e. juniper is better 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.820
 stands out in the smell of russia there and stayed 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:17.820
 it is that light sweetness 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:32.930
