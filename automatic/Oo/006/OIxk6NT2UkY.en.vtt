00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
this game could go into overtime but I

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.210 
this game could go into overtime but I
do<00:02:36.480> believe<00:02:36.810> Oregon<00:02:37.380> State<00:02:37.410> can<00:02:37.860> win<00:02:38.040> by<00:02:38.190> a

touchdown<00:02:38.550> maybe<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.540> field<00:02:39.810> goal<00:02:40.020> for<00:02:40.320> their

pretty decent quarterback and a couple
of<00:03:20.730> pretty<00:03:20.970> good<00:03:21.060> defensive<00:03:21.600> players<00:03:21.810> they

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
of pretty good defensive players they

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.650 
of pretty good defensive players they
still<00:03:22.709> had<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> mediocre<00:03:23.580> rushing<00:03:24.150> game<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.540> I

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
still had a mediocre rushing game and I

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.540 
still had a mediocre rushing game and I
think<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.140> end<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.890> Russian<00:03:26.280> game<00:03:26.400> is

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
think in the end the Russian game is

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.520 
think in the end the Russian game is
gonna<00:03:26.700> be<00:03:26.790> what<00:03:27.060> kills<00:03:27.330> them<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.780> what<00:03:28.380> will

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
gonna be what kills them and what will

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.920 
gonna be what kills them and what will
end<00:03:28.709> end<00:03:29.040> up<00:03:29.220> as<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> 60<00:03:30.000> record<00:03:30.209> for<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.630> oregon

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930

see<00:03:59.910> something<00:04:00.180> pretty<00:04:00.959> similar<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.739> year

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
see something pretty similar this year

see something pretty similar this year
and<00:04:02.280> what<00:04:02.640> i<00:04:02.670> think<00:04:02.940> will<00:04:03.060> be<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.239> 70<00:04:03.900> record<00:04:04.170> for

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.770 
and what i think will be a 70 record for
the<00:04:04.560> biebers<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.100> probably<00:04:06.030> just<00:04:06.300> a<00:04:06.450> blowout

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the biebers and probably just a blowout

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
they lost Andrew Luck well not the case

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.310 
they lost Andrew Luck well not the case
Kevin<00:04:25.860> Hogan<00:04:26.039> stepped<00:04:26.520> up<00:04:26.700> and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
Kevin Hogan stepped up and

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.160 
Kevin Hogan stepped up and
place<00:04:27.470> Andrew<00:04:28.010> Luck<00:04:28.220> spot<00:04:28.610> pretty<00:04:29.300> nicely<00:04:29.630> and

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
place Andrew Luck spot pretty nicely and

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.920 
place Andrew Luck spot pretty nicely and
as<00:04:30.560> well<00:04:30.740> with<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.130> great<00:04:31.430> defense<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.270> a

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
as well with the great defense and a

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.080 
as well with the great defense and a
decent<00:04:33.590> rushing<00:04:34.070> attack<00:04:34.370> well<00:04:34.670> last<00:04:34.880> year

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
decent rushing attack well last year

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.060 
decent rushing attack well last year
great<00:04:35.420> Russian<00:04:35.720> act<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:36.050> year<00:04:36.110> probably<00:04:36.800> a

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
great Russian act this year probably a

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.850 
great Russian act this year probably a
decent<00:04:37.490> rushing<00:04:37.760> attack<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.510> think<00:04:39.350> Stanford

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
decent rushing attack I think Stanford

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.590 
decent rushing attack I think Stanford
defense<00:04:40.370> is<00:04:40.580> going<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.850> stop<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.300> Oregon

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600
