 I'll choose who it was from the corn 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.900
 I click abroad 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.320

 the cuts 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.560
 so we have here the hard metal percussion screams and so on 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.950
 let's take as an example the wine burned piano 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.450

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.330
 Emo piano comes here. 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
 then what you were doing does not imply adding 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.910
 done that I click inmet 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.799
 will open a new window to set up crime for the housewife from the 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:03.880
 music 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 the colloquium good when I speak the minor king of the minor and so goes 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.940
 This is what they blow from the beginning of the song after 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.789
 change the chem 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.849
 then that's when I choose that he chose to speak 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.929
 bigger 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.699
 and click next 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.699
 after being the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.219
 the exercise that is 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.249
 a case each the beginning this configuration of the 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:37.079
 the end of the cup if you need to change the deco reveals the song bradesco owns 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.469
 tools for this work 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.680
 so what I chose the course with the step I want to start this score this 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.519
 may also be retired removed 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.919
 after 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.299
 so I click and finish 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.909
 make this journey 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.459
 then the idea of â€‹â€‹that window where they appreciate the title if it had 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.169
 agitated composer rises title and would also appear in his due 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.169
 places 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.269
 so it is to lose what would put the project with the schools 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.590
 and also taking advantage we will learn how then the other two 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.969
 choice of a leader 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.389
 very quick as well as the house and this will be a video-lesson part but only for 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.389
 Let's work and do the exercises here. 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.769
 the colloquium reposition was in the song what I want 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.949
 then I click the astra 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.859
 this venture 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.419
 which gives the new note lot 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.329
 so what I'm going to choose a semi brief 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.559
 explains 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.189
 this ene symbol 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.149
 what was to be broken 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:44.919
 so up here in those ten in ten musical figures I chose the rhythm 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.680
 and here down with the stench chose that damage that what I wanted 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.899
 of cole companies I'll write brief sashimi 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.189
 on site 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.019
 Wescley and write or semi-open is a good on the swing kaka from outside 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.519
 to make it easier for the work of working with the bodies to bring a good tone 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.919
 that just hold the key 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.619
 I was going to change the little ball of the mouse 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:11.589
 decreases 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:12.859
 and increased by 15 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.859
 a man so little with four more games not 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.569
 so so I can work with them 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.449
 is that I chose technological neutral 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:26.340
 I'll 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.960
 the place to go around with a nice man 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.789
 formed the courtesy 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.949
 I will put it into play 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.949
 we reformed the court 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:39.810
 right with the car 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.169
 with elections so let's do the exercises this giving light 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.050
 and more ahead we will have new guards 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.249
 ah 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.779
 ae 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.069
 W 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.069
 coast 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:09.419
 spider
