00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello and welcome to another video about 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.160
 life in canada in this video I'm going to 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.910
 explain how a lease works 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.340
 apartment in montreal canada 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.890
 When you get to Canada, the main thing is 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.119
 that you choose a place to live 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.070
 generally we immigrants start 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.590
 for an apartment for rent while 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.090
 we are growing economically to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.529
 find an apartment for rent 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.880
 montreal keep in mind the following 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.680
 points 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.470
 if you are a father and you come with your children 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.920
 so they study try to live 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.720
 near the schools because in montreal 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.360
 the school commission assigns the school 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.489
 closer to your home so enter more 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.890
 near school this will be much 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.020
 better also that there are markets or 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.760
 nearby shops it is always very useful to have 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.610
 a store nearby to buy what 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.039
 you need also try that your 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.930
 apartment is near the subway or 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.610
 a bus station since the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.010
 mobility is very important and in 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.379
 winter walk a lot to take a bus 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.539
 it's not very fun most of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.899
 contracts in the apartments work 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:12.390
 per year so you should stay 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.520
 there at least not during your first year 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.070
 of stay of canada later you will be able 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.979
 consider moving to another place or follow 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.730
 there the contract in Canada is called the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.000
 toothpick 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.160
 and here all things are specified 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.710
 what you can do and what is not allowed 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.720
 also do not do sometimes the same 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.030
 Owners have the right to enter 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.220
 your property without your consent in 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.040
 case of urgency regarding the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.740
 pets in rentals is pretty 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.870
 difficult not to say almost impossible to 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.870
 get a protect owner you 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.410
 allow them to have the vast majority 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.850
 problems having a dog or cat and 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.090
 some but very few allow animals 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.800
 small ones like hamsters or fish only 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.960
 so if you come with your pet 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.510
 make sure you have a place where the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.550
 accept as regards prices varies 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.380
 depending on the location among more 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.620
 close to centers or places 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.600
 tourism is more expensive if it is 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.520
 relatively close to a station 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.710
 metro also gets to rise a little 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.110
 so it will depend on your needs 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.850
 personal the price system goes by 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.340
 a number of rooms that has the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.310
 apartment let's say what 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.620
 the bathroom counts as half a room like this 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.510
 that we are talking about a two and a half and 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.239
 three and a half one four and a half five and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.340
 medium and I do not know if there are six and a half never 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.650
 heard about it but if you come with a 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.370
 family and children the most advisable is 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.930
 that you are in a four and a half or five and 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.720
 medium for them to have their 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.030
 room and its space if you come with your 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.180
 couple or if it's only a two and a half 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.269
 a three and a half you're going as far as the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.780
 price and four and a half are more or 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.900
 less between $ 800 and $ 1,500 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.970
 Canadians like I said earlier is going to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.860
 depend mostly on the location 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.220
 from the same place 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.840
 keep in mind that these 800 thousand 500 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.390
 dollars are monthly 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.510
 you always have to read the contract well and 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.879
 keep in mind that sometimes there are expenses 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.340
 such as telephone or internet heating 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.830
 that are not included as you can 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.870
 they are also included so they should 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.000
 to perform very well everything be careful 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.760
 that the owner does not cheat them 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.349
 be new in the country for this last 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.299
 I will leave a link in the description of 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.370
 video so they can see more in depth 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.160
 the rights and duties of the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.959
 tenants and lessors this is a 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.930
 page available only in English and 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.140
 French pitifully and finally like 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.760
 a curious fact of canada in general the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.750
 more expensive cities to live in 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.000
 canada are toronto and vancouver 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.620

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.400

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.460
 greeting 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.469
 today I want to talk about a topic about 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.480
 which are coming to me enough 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.609
 questions on the facebook page and it's 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.090
 about how discrimination is lived 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.090
 in canada
