00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.920 
coat on he didn't really have the blood
I<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.369> I'll<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:48.000> honest<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.509> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
I like it I'll be honest with you just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.389 
I like it I'll be honest with you just
because<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> couple<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> reasons<00:01:49.920> I'll<00:01:50.250> tell

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
because a couple of reasons I'll tell

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.870 
because a couple of reasons I'll tell
you<00:01:50.460> why

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you why

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.179 
you why
just<00:01:51.689> because<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.290> said<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.680> does<00:01:52.829> give<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
just because like I said it does give it

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.580 
just because like I said it does give it
more<00:01:53.340> detail<00:01:53.520> number<00:01:54.299> one<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.229> number<00:01:55.470> two

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
more detail number one and number two

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.429 
more detail number one and number two
the<00:01:56.520> coat<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:58.009> removable<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.509> if<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.350> to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the coat is removable so if you want to

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
the coat is removable so if you want to
have<00:02:01.619> him<00:02:02.340> without<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> coat<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
have him without the coat and have the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450 
have him without the coat and have the
opening<00:02:03.960> scene<00:02:04.290> where<00:02:04.710> he's<00:02:04.890> has<00:02:05.100> all<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
opening scene where he's has all the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.479 
opening scene where he's has all the
blood<00:02:05.700> that's<00:02:06.020> probably<00:02:07.020> why<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:08.129> put<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
blood that's probably why they put the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.130 
blood that's probably why they put the
blood<00:02:08.700> there<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:10.800> know<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.550> said<00:02:12.140> you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
blood there you know like I said you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.970 
blood there you know like I said you
don't<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
don't have to have the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.380 
don't have to have the
so<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.250> guess<00:02:14.430> they<00:02:14.580> give<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.000> other<00:02:15.150> choice

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
so I guess they give it the other choice

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.420 
so I guess they give it the other choice
to<00:02:15.659> have<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.989> with<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.440> without<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
to have it with or without so it's the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.160 
to have it with or without so it's the
best<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.790> both<00:02:17.940> worlds<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.420> guess<00:02:18.599> me

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
best of both worlds I guess me

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.930 
best of both worlds I guess me
I<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> codon<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.459> like<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> blood

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
I like the codon and I like the blood

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.580 
I like the codon and I like the blood
look<00:02:21.150> that's<00:02:22.049> my<00:02:22.260> opinion<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.040> that's<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
look that's my opinion so that's it a

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.539 
look that's my opinion so that's it a
couple<00:02:25.590> other<00:02:25.769> things<00:02:25.860> here<00:02:26.129> I'll<00:02:26.310> show<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
couple other things here I'll show you

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.149 
couple other things here I'll show you
what<00:02:26.909> I<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.420> don't<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:29.010> got<00:02:29.129> a

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
what I like and I don't like it's got a

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.680 
what I like and I don't like it's got a
decent<00:02:29.400> looking<00:02:29.760> night<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.150> all<00:02:30.269> blood<00:02:30.540> on

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
decent looking night with all blood on

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.170 
decent looking night with all blood on
it<00:02:30.840> as<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.110> can<00:02:31.230> see<00:02:31.290> here<00:02:31.940> but<00:02:32.940> he<00:02:33.030> has

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
it as you can see here but he has

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.449

absolutely no blood on his hands which

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.960 
absolutely no blood on his hands which
is<00:02:35.489> not<00:02:35.940> good<00:02:36.709> because<00:02:37.709> he<00:02:37.980> has<00:02:38.129> all<00:02:38.400> blood<00:02:38.760> on

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
is not good because he has all blood on

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.830 
is not good because he has all blood on
the<00:02:39.060> inside<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.480> his<00:02:39.720> suit<00:02:39.989> as<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.769> can<00:02:40.920> see

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
feet do move a little in his arms over

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.140 
feet do move a little in his arms over
here<00:03:16.170> his<00:03:16.379> wrists<00:03:16.760> completely<00:03:17.760> spin<00:03:18.030> around

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
here his wrists completely spin around

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.110
