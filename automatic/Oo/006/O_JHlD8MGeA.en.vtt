turns on when we put it in reverse
in<00:03:48.100> this<00:03:48.220> case<00:03:48.460> we<00:03:48.580> found<00:03:48.760> out<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.390> one<00:03:49.720> gets

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
in this case we found out that one gets

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.750 
in this case we found out that one gets
hot<00:03:50.140> when<00:03:50.650> it's<00:03:50.800> reverse<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.490> engines

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
hot when it's reverse and the engines

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.910 
hot when it's reverse and the engines
running<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:53.110> now<00:03:53.230> we'll<00:03:53.380> go<00:03:53.470> ahead<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.770> look

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
running and now we'll go ahead and look

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.580 
running and now we'll go ahead and look
for<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.370> key<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.760> ignition<00:03:54.880> power<00:03:55.510> source<00:03:55.870> the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
for a key to ignition power source the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.220 
for a key to ignition power source the
fuse<00:03:56.890> panel<00:03:57.040> says<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.700> there's<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.230> ignition

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
fuse panel says that there's a ignition

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.180 
fuse panel says that there's a ignition
miscellaneous<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:01.360> we'll<00:04:01.480> test<00:04:01.720> that<00:04:01.930> and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
miscellaneous so we'll test that and

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.140 
miscellaneous so we'll test that and
looks<00:04:03.190> like<00:04:03.220> we<00:04:03.400> have<00:04:03.490> power<00:04:03.670> when<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.940> key<00:04:04.120> is

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
looks like we have power when the key is

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.990 
looks like we have power when the key is
it's<00:04:04.420> an<00:04:04.540> on<00:04:04.690> position<00:04:08.610> now<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.670> make<00:04:09.850> our

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
it's an on position now to make our

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.430 
it's an on position now to make our
connections<00:04:10.450> we're<00:04:10.930> actually<00:04:11.050> gonna<00:04:11.260> use<00:04:11.410> a

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
connections we're actually gonna use a

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.680 
connections we're actually gonna use a
fuse<00:04:11.770> tap<00:04:12.040> we're<00:04:12.820> gonna<00:04:12.940> pull<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.180> rijal<00:04:13.390> fuse

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.680 
now it looks like we have a picture on
the<00:06:23.320> first<00:06:23.530> test<00:06:23.860> look<00:06:24.370> like<00:06:24.550> the<00:06:25.210> picture<00:06:25.540> was
