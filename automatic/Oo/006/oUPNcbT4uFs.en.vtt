 disadvantaged youths donated me 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.630
 I think that's just the way it is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.280

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.399
 to take part 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.730
 is also 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.010
 feeling of belonging here very much

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.660
 Also, there are around 70 soccer stars from 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.969
 once the honor will give 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:12.409
 it is a bit more complicated 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:16.640
 to select his own favorites and 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.060
