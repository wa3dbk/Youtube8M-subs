00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
in my career more so I figured I would

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.900 
in my career more so I figured I would
stick<00:02:37.990> with<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.350> rather<00:02:38.680> than<00:02:38.980> go<00:02:39.220> with<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
stick with that rather than go with the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.180 
stick with that rather than go with the
power<00:02:40.120> forward<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.690> year<00:02:40.750> but<00:02:41.530> look<00:02:41.890> for<00:02:42.070> him

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190

stuff<00:04:46.510> like<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:46.960> so<00:04:47.770> there<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.250> is<00:04:48.389> don't

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
stuff like that so there it is don't

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.940 
stuff like that so there it is don't
really<00:04:49.599> have<00:04:49.780> any<00:04:49.930> parks<00:04:50.229> dumb<00:04:50.440> packages

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
really have any parks dumb packages

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.710 
really have any parks dumb packages
equip<00:04:51.310> that's<00:04:51.789> not<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.000> big<00:04:52.210> deal

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
equip that's not a big deal

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.659 
equip that's not a big deal
so<00:04:52.960> here<00:04:53.169> it<00:04:53.229> is<00:04:53.349> the<00:04:53.740> release<00:04:54.010> timing<00:04:54.490> is

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
so here it is the release timing is

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.159 
so here it is the release timing is
normal<00:04:55.150> I'm<00:04:55.330> thinking<00:04:55.599> about<00:04:55.660> switching<00:04:55.840> that

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
normal I'm thinking about switching that

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.400 
normal I'm thinking about switching that
to<00:04:56.380> quick<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:57.220> release<00:04:57.700> is<00:04:57.970> 82<00:04:58.810> so<00:04:59.200> if<00:04:59.289> you're

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
to quick the release is 82 so if you're

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.020 
to quick the release is 82 so if you're
looking<00:04:59.530> for<00:04:59.770> Tracy<00:05:00.039> McGrady's<00:05:00.580> jump<00:05:00.849> shot
