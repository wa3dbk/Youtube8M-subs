00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
website it kind of looks like a cachet

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.949 
website it kind of looks like a cachet
you<00:02:07.290> basically<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.770> wipe<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.159> clean<00:02:08.780> what<00:02:09.780> is

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
you basically just wipe it clean what is

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.610 
you basically just wipe it clean what is
cachet<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.769> says<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:13.140> way<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.470> works

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
cachet it says here the way that works

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.539 
cachet it says here the way that works
to<00:02:13.860> decrease<00:02:14.250> lag<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.030> resets<00:02:16.489> any<00:02:17.930> default

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
to decrease lag is it resets any default

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.140 
to decrease lag is it resets any default
