00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello and even less as in this video is 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.110
 see if making a slingshot is very 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.110
 simple like this 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.110
 to do it the only thing we're going to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.500
 need is a piece of the bottle the 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.040
 part of the head a balloon ribbon 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.230
 adhesive and some scissors very well let's 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.180
 start what we're going to need the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.919
 only bottle is this part of here 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.919
 okay so let's cut here 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.600
 we have already cut the part of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.370
 is from the bottle and now we are going to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.050
 finish counting it well so that it is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.050
 in the best possible way 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.870
 very well done this is very easy 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:08.490
 let's put the balloon in the part of the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:11.240
 entry as centered as possible 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.930
 this way 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.890
 the projectile that goes in here will come out 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.630
 more focused in principle with this would be 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.340
 enough but we 're going to let's 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.689
 put the one hundred insulator so that 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.580
 really the balloon endure much more 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.970
 It's worth it this way we do not know 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.970
 escape 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.399
 We cut through here and finish 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:05.829
 hook what we see well that since 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.489
 we are resistant and now only 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:12.899
 it would be necessary to put a stone on this side 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.899
 and throw 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.550
 Well , we have already seen how we have 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.400
 finished now let's try to launch 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.840
 this the truth that comes out with a lot of force 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.270
 you only have to have it though 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.590
 be in the head you see that he is here 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.590
 ok but only doing so 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.950
 it ends with a lot of work 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.840
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.850
 video and that you try it you have seen that 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.040
 It is very fast and easy and above all 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.090
 news to shoot no one many 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.090
 Thank you and see you soon
