also saw this and it went over how much
she<00:05:01.340> owed<00:05:01.460> me<00:05:01.490> so<00:05:01.730> I<00:05:01.790> just<00:05:01.820> bought<00:05:02.120> this<00:05:02.240> by

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
myself and it's sort of like this

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.780 
myself and it's sort of like this
knitted<00:05:05.720> material<00:05:06.440> but<00:05:06.710> it's<00:05:06.950> very<00:05:07.190> fit<00:05:07.640> as

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790
