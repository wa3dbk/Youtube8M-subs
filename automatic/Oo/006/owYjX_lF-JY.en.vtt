so<00:00:53.670> basically<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> had<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.450> was<00:00:54.660> sand

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
so basically what I had to do was sand

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.840 
so basically what I had to do was sand
up<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.740> little<00:00:55.920> bit<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.280> create<00:00:56.700> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
up a little bit there and create the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
up a little bit there and create the
scene<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:58.020> around<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.540> that<00:01:00.540> worked<00:01:00.750> out

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
scene going around so that worked out

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
scene going around so that worked out
pretty<00:01:00.930> good<00:01:01.200> now<00:01:01.829> he<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.220> a<00:01:02.250> very<00:01:02.579> big<00:01:02.940> kid<00:01:03.180> I

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
pretty good now he is a very big kid I

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.779 
pretty good now he is a very big kid I
mean<00:01:03.540> this<00:01:03.660> sucker<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.350> almost<00:01:04.789> 21

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
mean this sucker is like almost 21

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.550 
mean this sucker is like almost 21
inches<00:01:06.119> tall<00:01:06.359> from<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> top<00:01:06.990> bottom<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.469> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
inches tall from the top bottom of the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.830 
inches tall from the top bottom of the
base<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> top<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> head<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.569> sees

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
base to the top of the head so it sees

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.499 
base to the top of the head so it sees
pretty<00:01:10.229> big<00:01:10.380> he's<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.310> small<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.179> all<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
pretty big he's not small at all and

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.209 
pretty big he's not small at all and
it's<00:01:12.630> all<00:01:12.810> solid<00:01:13.049> resin<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:13.679> is<00:01:13.799> good<00:01:13.979> I

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
it's all solid resin which is good I

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's all solid resin which is good I
think<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.999> base<00:01:15.149> is<00:01:15.359> just<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.569> little<00:01:15.780> bit<00:01:15.899> of

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
think the base is just a little bit of

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
think the base is just a little bit of
hollow<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.950> big<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.280> deal<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.149> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
hollow not that big of a deal but it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.620 
hollow not that big of a deal but it
works<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:20.039> I<00:01:20.100> had<00:01:20.219> to<00:01:20.249> do<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.789> I<00:01:21.299> had

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
works out so what I had to do was I had

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.809 
works out so what I had to do was I had
to<00:01:21.869> figure<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.229> how<00:01:22.469> to<00:01:22.530> put<00:01:23.069> him<00:01:23.219> together

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
to figure out how to put him together

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:26.510 
to figure out how to put him together
with<00:01:24.420> painting<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.259> getting<00:01:25.829> the<00:01:26.039> cape<00:01:26.280> on

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
with painting and getting the cape on

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.300 
with painting and getting the cape on
because<00:01:27.030> if<00:01:27.569> you<00:01:28.350> put<00:01:28.710> everything<00:01:28.920> together

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
because if you put everything together

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.789 
because if you put everything together
then<00:01:29.789> he<00:01:29.880> try<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.149> paint<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:31.229> difficult

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
then he try to paint it's very difficult

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.209 
then he try to paint it's very difficult
to<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.579> here<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> basically<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
to get up in here so basically what I

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.629 
to get up in here so basically what I
did<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.789> did<00:01:35.819> the<00:01:36.060> bottom<00:01:36.270> half<00:01:36.689> first<00:01:37.639> and

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:38.639 
did was I did the bottom half first and

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:40.730 
did was I did the bottom half first and
then<00:01:39.539> after<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.899> got<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> bottom<00:01:40.560> half

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
then after I got the bottom half

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.599 
then after I got the bottom half
together

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
together

and Max it all back together that was

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.039 
and Max it all back together that was
the<00:02:05.759> only<00:02:05.880> way<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.119> could<00:02:06.270> come<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the only way I could come up with the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.620 
the only way I could come up with the
idea<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.220> once<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.759> got<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> idea<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.420> how<00:02:09.540> to

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
idea so once I got the idea of how to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.210 
idea so once I got the idea of how to
put<00:02:09.930> them<00:02:10.020> together<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.500> went<00:02:10.800> ahead<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.130> did

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
put them together I went ahead and did

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.940 
put them together I went ahead and did
it<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.550> required<00:02:12.240> some<00:02:12.510> thinking<00:02:13.050> what<00:02:13.830> was

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it it required some thinking what was

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.750 
it it required some thinking what was
the<00:02:14.100> best<00:02:14.280> off

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the best off

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.500 
the best off
how<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.209> do<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.810> make<00:02:16.470> life<00:02:16.709> easier<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.580> so

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
how to do it and make life easier and so

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.750 
how to do it and make life easier and so
basically<00:02:19.019> yeah<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.319> had<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.680> paint<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.129> while

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
basically yeah you had to paint it while

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.880 
basically yeah you had to paint it while
putting<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.450> together<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:22.049> was<00:02:22.200> only<00:02:22.379> option

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
putting it together it was only option

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.550 
putting it together it was only option
so<00:02:23.400> once<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.700> was<00:02:23.970> all<00:02:24.120> done<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.870> he<00:02:25.260> was<00:02:25.379> all

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
so once that was all done and he was all

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.149 
so once that was all done and he was all
set

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
set

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.250 
set

that<00:02:44.370> key<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.750> other<00:02:45.870> way<00:02:46.109> so<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.340> made<00:02:47.730> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
that key in the other way so I made a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940 
that key in the other way so I made a
pin<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.750> there<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.109> made<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.409> for<00:02:49.530> there<00:02:49.680> so

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
pin for there and I made it for there so

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.160 
pin for there and I made it for there so
he<00:02:50.069> fits<00:02:50.370> him<00:02:50.579> pretty<00:02:50.760> good<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.959> instead

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
he fits him pretty good now so instead

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.910 
he fits him pretty good now so instead
of<00:02:52.349> sawing<00:02:52.980> off<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.639> key<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.200> left<00:02:55.680> that

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
of sawing off this key here I left that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.879 
of sawing off this key here I left that
there<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.489> gave<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> nice<00:02:57.139> metal<00:02:58.139> peg<00:02:58.470> going

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.259 
there and I gave a nice metal peg going
in<00:02:59.010> there<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.400> worked<00:02:59.639> out<00:02:59.790> good<00:03:00.030> so

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
in there and that worked out good so

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.849 
in there and that worked out good so
he's<00:03:00.389> nice<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.599> solid<00:03:01.049> because<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> reason

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
he's nice and solid because the reason

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.099 
he's nice and solid because the reason
why<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:01.980> did<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.209> left<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.659> regular

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
why I did that if you left the regular

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.170 
why I did that if you left the regular
keys<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:04.650> they<00:03:04.709> try<00:03:04.889> to<00:03:04.920> put<00:03:05.159> them<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.370> who'd

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
keys and they try to put them in who'd

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.569 
keys and they try to put them in who'd
be<00:03:06.359> so<00:03:06.569> backwards<00:03:07.170> heavy<00:03:07.409> with<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.769> Cape<00:03:07.980> he

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
be so backwards heavy with the Cape he

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.580 
be so backwards heavy with the Cape he
would<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.849> fall<00:03:09.060> out<00:03:09.120> but<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.019> that<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.319> got

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
would just fall out but now that I got

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.550 
would just fall out but now that I got
that<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:10.920> there<00:03:11.040> works<00:03:11.280> out<00:03:11.430> pretty<00:03:11.549> good<00:03:11.700> so

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
that in there works out pretty good so

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.720 
that in there works out pretty good so

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
doing a lot of this uh of this like

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.650 
doing a lot of this uh of this like
pearlized<00:04:49.630> ink<00:04:50.110> type<00:04:50.800> stuff<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:52.120> did<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> lot

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
pearlized ink type stuff and I did a lot

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.510 
pearlized ink type stuff and I did a lot
of<00:04:52.690> washes<00:04:53.350> and<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.590> got<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:53.770> lot<00:04:53.980> of<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.310> in

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
of washes and I got a lot of that in

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.350 
of washes and I got a lot of that in
there<00:04:54.730> so<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:55.930> actually<00:04:56.200> feels<00:04:56.470> like<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.970> is<00:04:58.150> as

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
there so it actually feels like it is as

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.879 
there so it actually feels like it is as
Fortress<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.810> Solitude<00:04:59.020> but<00:04:59.620> in<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.710> certain

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
Fortress of Solitude but in a certain

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.250 
Fortress of Solitude but in a certain
way<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.220> get<00:05:00.580> like<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.850> sheen<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.540> shine<00:05:01.840> of

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
way to get like a sheen and shine of

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.140 
way to get like a sheen and shine of
blues<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:02.979> white<00:05:03.160> so<00:05:03.610> it's<00:05:04.180> kind<00:05:04.479> of<00:05:05.040> very

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
blues and white so it's kind of very

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.969 
blues and white so it's kind of very
shiny<00:05:07.150> which<00:05:07.419> is<00:05:07.540> kind<00:05:07.750> of<00:05:07.780> cool<00:05:07.990> so<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:08.860> think
