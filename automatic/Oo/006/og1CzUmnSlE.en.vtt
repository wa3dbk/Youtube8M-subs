00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.200 

now<00:00:01.560> there<00:00:01.709> are<00:00:01.860> very<00:00:02.129> few<00:00:02.399> things<00:00:02.669> that<00:00:03.120> will

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
now there are very few things that will

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.030 
now there are very few things that will
get<00:00:03.300> me<00:00:03.449> out<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.629> bed<00:00:03.780> in<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.319> morning<00:00:04.620> before

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
get me out of bed in the morning before

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.249 
get me out of bed in the morning before
8<00:00:05.190> o'clock<00:00:05.220> but<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.180> transit<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.779> Venus<00:00:07.109> is

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
8 o'clock but the transit of Venus is

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.900 
8 o'clock but the transit of Venus is
one<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.649> them<00:00:07.799> because<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.700> last

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
one of them because this is the last

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.100 
one of them because this is the last
time<00:00:09.120> it's<00:00:09.269> going<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.450> happen<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:09.840> lifetime

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
time it's going to happen in my lifetime

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.049 
time it's going to happen in my lifetime
so<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.860> don't<00:00:11.190> have<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.429> worry<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:11.790> this

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
so I don't have to worry about this

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.629 
so I don't have to worry about this
becoming<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.509> regular<00:00:12.660> thing<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.980> my<00:00:14.400> way<00:00:14.580> to

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
becoming a regular thing on my way to

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.470 
becoming a regular thing on my way to
see<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.330> transit<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.960> Venus<00:00:17.240> okay<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
see the transit of Venus okay so the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.939 
see the transit of Venus okay so the
transit<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.990> probably<00:00:19.260> starting<00:00:19.680> right<00:00:19.920> now

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
transit is probably starting right now

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.460 
transit is probably starting right now
this<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.640> probably<00:00:20.789> contact<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.810> 816

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
this is probably contact one it's 816

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:50.110 
this is probably contact one it's 816
a.m.<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:23.130> Sydney

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120 

can<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> see<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.540> absolutely<00:00:52.380> not

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
can you see it absolutely not

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.310 
can you see it absolutely not
she<00:00:53.700> can't<00:00:53.970> see<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.630> it's<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.440> black<00:00:55.800> dot

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
she can't see it it's like a black dot

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
she can't see it it's like a black dot
it's<00:00:58.320> Venus<00:00:59.540> beautiful<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.629> Sun<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.050> out

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it's Venus beautiful the Sun is now out

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.200 
it's Venus beautiful the Sun is now out
and<00:01:01.470> with<00:01:02.190> these<00:01:02.309> silly<00:01:02.489> glasses<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> can

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and with these silly glasses you can

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.760 
and with these silly glasses you can
actually<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.870> Venus<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.890> Sun<00:01:06.440> nowadays<00:01:07.440> I

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
actually see Venus on the Sun nowadays I

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.990 
actually see Venus on the Sun nowadays I
imagine<00:01:08.100> most<00:01:08.190> people<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.700> excited

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
imagine most people don't get excited

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
imagine most people don't get excited
about<00:01:09.300> Venus<00:01:09.750> passing<00:01:10.259> in<00:01:10.350> front<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> Sun

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
about Venus passing in front of the Sun

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.070 
about Venus passing in front of the Sun
I<00:01:11.040> mean<00:01:11.280> what's<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> big<00:01:11.850> deal<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
I mean what's the big deal but in the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.650 
I mean what's the big deal but in the
old<00:01:13.259> days<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.820> important<00:01:15.390> event

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
old days it was a really important event

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.600 
old days it was a really important event
because<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.530> allowed<00:01:16.800> us<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.100> determine<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
because it allowed us to determine the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.450 
because it allowed us to determine the
scale<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.180> our<00:01:18.330> solar<00:01:18.600> system<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.800> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
scale of our solar system and then the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.310 
scale of our solar system and then the
scale<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> universe<00:01:21.030> astronomers<00:01:21.660> at<00:01:22.289> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
scale of the universe astronomers at the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.139 
scale of the universe astronomers at the
time<00:01:22.560> knew<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.039> relative<00:01:23.460> distances<00:01:23.940> between

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
time knew the relative distances between

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.389 
time knew the relative distances between
the<00:01:24.420> planets<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.740> Kepler's<00:01:26.160> laws

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
the planets because of Kepler's laws

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.389 
the planets because of Kepler's laws
that<00:01:26.910> could<00:01:27.090> calculate<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.750> ratios<00:01:28.440> of<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
that could calculate the ratios of the

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.400 
that could calculate the ratios of the
different<00:01:29.759> radii<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.780> orbits<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.350> planets

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
different radii of the orbits of planets

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.590 
different radii of the orbits of planets
but<00:01:32.000> unfortunately<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.119> didn't<00:01:33.300> have<00:01:33.420> any

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
but unfortunately they didn't have any

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600 
but unfortunately they didn't have any
absolute<00:01:34.259> measure<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.009> they<00:01:35.130> couldn't<00:01:35.430> really

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
absolute measure so they couldn't really

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
absolute measure so they couldn't really
say<00:01:35.940> how<00:01:36.180> far<00:01:36.509> anything<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:37.140> from<00:01:37.380> anything

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
say how far anything was from anything

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.980 
say how far anything was from anything
else<00:01:37.759> Edmund<00:01:38.759> Halley<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.600> guy<00:01:39.720> who<00:01:39.780> the

comments<00:01:40.380> named<00:01:40.619> after<00:01:40.830> was<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.000> who

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
comments named after was the one who

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.480 
comments named after was the one who
suggested<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.780> by<00:01:43.110> timing<00:01:43.979> how<00:01:44.190> long<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
suggested that by timing how long it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.969 
suggested that by timing how long it
takes<00:01:44.850> Venus<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.750> pass<00:01:45.990> across<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.440> face<00:01:46.800> of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
takes Venus to pass across the face of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.620 
takes Venus to pass across the face of
the<00:01:47.070> Sun<00:01:47.250> from<00:01:47.789> different<00:01:48.179> points<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.539> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the Sun from different points on the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
the Sun from different points on the
earth<00:01:48.780> would<00:01:49.380> allow<00:01:49.649> us<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:50.039> measure<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
earth would allow us to measure the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.430 
earth would allow us to measure the
distance<00:01:51.240> between<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.630> Earth<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.259> Sun

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
distance between the Earth and the Sun

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.380 
distance between the Earth and the Sun
that's<00:01:53.160> using<00:01:53.429> something<00:01:53.580> called<00:01:53.700> parallax

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that's using something called parallax

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.570 
that's using something called parallax
now<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.140> illustrate<00:01:55.380> parallax<00:01:56.130> I've<00:01:56.310> actually

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
now to illustrate parallax I've actually

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.430 
now to illustrate parallax I've actually
kind<00:01:56.849> of<00:01:56.970> set<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.390> solar<00:01:57.660> system<00:01:57.929> in<00:01:58.229> my

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
kind of set up a solar system in my

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.800 
kind of set up a solar system in my
kitchen<00:01:58.709> and<00:01:59.039> living<00:01:59.459> room<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.599> see

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
kitchen and living room so you can see

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.919 
kitchen and living room so you can see
the<00:02:00.959> Sun<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.440> behind<00:02:01.619> me<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.940> is<00:02:03.179> Venus

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
the Sun there behind me this is Venus

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.620 
the Sun there behind me this is Venus

up<00:02:17.519> dude<00:02:17.730> hey<00:02:18.239> man<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.480> went<00:02:18.599> up<00:02:18.720> in<00:02:18.840> Space<00:02:19.050> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
up dude hey man I went up in Space and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.839 
up dude hey man I went up in Space and
Rocket<00:02:19.260> Center<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.769> got<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> time<00:02:20.280> she<00:02:20.670> said

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
Rocket Center we got the time she said

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.100 
Rocket Center we got the time she said
we<00:02:20.940> could<00:02:21.060> calculate<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.510> distance<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.019> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
we could calculate the distance to the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.720 
we could calculate the distance to the
Sun<00:02:22.260> right<00:02:22.500> oh<00:02:22.650> yeah<00:02:23.220> because<00:02:23.430> we're<00:02:23.670> on

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
Sun right oh yeah because we're on

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.100 
Sun right oh yeah because we're on
opposite<00:02:24.090> sides<00:02:24.269> of<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.420> globe<00:02:24.480> we're<00:02:24.930> gonna

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
opposite sides of the globe we're gonna

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.020 
opposite sides of the globe we're gonna
compare<00:02:25.500> times<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.099> calculate<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> distance

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
compare times and calculate the distance

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.770 
compare times and calculate the distance
the<00:02:27.180> Sun<00:02:27.360> my<00:02:28.260> time<00:02:28.560> was<00:02:28.830> 6<00:02:29.640> hours<00:02:29.849> 28<00:02:30.660> minutes

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
just go put it that calculator website

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.479 
just go put it that calculator website
you<00:02:48.150> gave<00:02:48.299> me<00:02:48.420> yeah<00:02:48.630> yeah<00:02:48.870> let's<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.489> okay

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
you gave me yeah yeah let's do that okay

calculate<00:02:54.959> but<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> plan<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.170> I'm<00:02:58.380> going

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
calculate but so the plan is I'm going

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.520 
calculate but so the plan is I'm going
to<00:02:58.650> shoot<00:02:58.980> from<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.239> earth<00:03:00.480> from<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.110> top<00:03:01.349> of

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
to shoot from the earth from the top of

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.680 
to shoot from the earth from the top of
the<00:03:01.620> earth<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.130> see<00:03:02.970> what<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.360> looks<00:03:03.540> like

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
the earth and see what it looks like

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.509 
the earth and see what it looks like
when<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.900> make<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.140> transit<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.860> Venus<00:03:05.220> across

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
when I make a transit of Venus across

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.009 
when I make a transit of Venus across
the<00:03:05.700> face<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.060> Sun<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:06.810> I'm<00:03:06.900> going

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
the face of the Sun and then I'm going

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.990 
the face of the Sun and then I'm going
to<00:03:07.079> change<00:03:07.380> my<00:03:07.590> perspective<00:03:07.650> slightly<00:03:08.519> so<00:03:08.940> I'm

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
to change my perspective slightly so I'm

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.789 
to change my perspective slightly so I'm
going<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.209> go<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.690> lower<00:03:10.079> part<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> earth

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
going to go to a lower part of the earth

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.380 
going to go to a lower part of the earth
and<00:03:11.069> I'm<00:03:11.130> going<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.280> shoot<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.609> same<00:03:11.819> thing

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
and I'm going to shoot the same thing

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.360 
and I'm going to shoot the same thing
and<00:03:12.690> then<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.170> want<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.380> overlay<00:03:13.920> those<00:03:14.130> two

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
and then I want to overlay those two

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.270 
and then I want to overlay those two
images<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.120> see<00:03:15.450> how<00:03:16.079> Venus<00:03:16.560> looks<00:03:16.769> as<00:03:16.980> it's

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
images to see how Venus looks as it's

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.890 
images to see how Venus looks as it's
tracking<00:03:17.790> across<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.269> Sun<00:03:18.450> from<00:03:18.600> those<00:03:18.750> two

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
tracking across the Sun from those two

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.729 
tracking across the Sun from those two
different<00:03:19.170> locations

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
different locations

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.220 
different locations
it<00:03:19.950> should<00:03:20.310> trace<00:03:20.609> out<00:03:20.819> two<00:03:21.150> separate<00:03:21.780> chords

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
it should trace out two separate chords

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.379 
it should trace out two separate chords
across<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.709> face<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.069> Sun<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:24.209> is

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
across the face of the Sun and that is

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.300 
across the face of the Sun and that is
what<00:03:24.540> allows<00:03:24.660> us<00:03:25.109> to<00:03:25.260> estimate<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:26.280> distance

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
what allows us to estimate the distance

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.910 
what allows us to estimate the distance
to<00:03:27.030> Venus<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.720> distance<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.620> Sun<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
to Venus and the distance to the Sun and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.050 
to Venus and the distance to the Sun and
everything<00:03:29.069> else<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.549> solar<00:03:29.670> system

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
everything else in the solar system

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.729 
everything else in the solar system
because<00:03:30.120> once<00:03:30.750> we<00:03:30.870> have<00:03:30.989> one<00:03:31.230> absolute

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
because once we have one absolute

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.949 
because once we have one absolute
distance<00:03:32.160> we<00:03:32.579> can<00:03:32.700> get<00:03:32.819> all<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.450> distances

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
distance we can get all of the distances

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.699 
distance we can get all of the distances
so<00:03:34.639> 243<00:03:35.639> years<00:03:35.850> ago<00:03:36.180> Captain<00:03:36.870> Cook<00:03:37.139> was<00:03:37.440> down

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
so 243 years ago Captain Cook was down

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.400 
so 243 years ago Captain Cook was down
here<00:03:38.160> sent<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.060> Tahiti<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.780> observe<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
here sent to Tahiti to observe the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.690 
here sent to Tahiti to observe the
transit<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:41.040> Venus

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
transit of Venus

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.210 
transit of Venus
after<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.390> he<00:03:43.540> opened<00:03:43.750> his<00:03:44.050> sealed<00:03:44.560> papers

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
after that he opened his sealed papers

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.220 
after that he opened his sealed papers
with<00:03:46.030> his<00:03:46.180> secret<00:03:46.660> mission

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
with his secret mission

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.009 
with his secret mission
he<00:03:47.830> was<00:03:47.980> meant<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.280> find<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.450> Great<00:03:49.660> Southern

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
he was meant to find the Great Southern

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.220 
he was meant to find the Great Southern
land<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.769> claim<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.160> for<00:03:51.190> Britain<00:03:52.090> which<00:03:53.050> is

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
land and claim it for Britain which is

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.530 
land and claim it for Britain which is
what<00:03:53.379> he<00:03:53.440> did<00:03:53.620> he<00:03:53.860> mapped<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.730> explore<00:03:55.360> the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
what he did he mapped and explore the

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.330 
what he did he mapped and explore the
coasts<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:56.050> New<00:03:56.200> Zealand<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.830> Australia

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
coasts of New Zealand and Australia

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.940 
coasts of New Zealand and Australia
before<00:03:57.940> returning<00:03:58.480> home<00:03:58.599> this<00:03:58.930> was<00:03:59.140> his<00:03:59.620> first

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
before returning home this was his first

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.000 
before returning home this was his first
voyage<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.940> South<00:04:01.120> Pacific<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:02.010> pretty
