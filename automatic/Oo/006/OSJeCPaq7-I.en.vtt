welcome to this tutorial brought to you
by<00:00:08.120> River<00:00:08.630> City<00:00:08.870> Graphix<00:00:08.930> today<00:00:09.620> when<00:00:09.860> you've

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
by River City Graphix today when you've

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.530 
by River City Graphix today when you've
shown<00:00:10.160> you<00:00:10.280> how<00:00:10.400> to<00:00:10.430> use<00:00:10.520> the<00:00:10.820> motion<00:00:11.270> sketch

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
shown you how to use the motion sketch

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.660 
shown you how to use the motion sketch
and<00:00:11.750> auto<00:00:12.139> orient<00:00:12.650> features<00:00:12.950> in<00:00:13.160> After

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
and auto orient features in After

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.670 
and auto orient features in After
Effects<00:00:13.970> so<00:00:14.630> to<00:00:14.690> get<00:00:14.930> serving<00:00:15.260> and<00:00:15.349> go<00:00:15.410> down<00:00:15.530> to

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
Effects so to get serving and go down to

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.010 
Effects so to get serving and go down to
After<00:00:16.010> Effects<00:00:16.279> and<00:00:16.730> we're<00:00:17.630> going<00:00:17.810> to<00:00:17.900> be

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
After Effects and we're going to be

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.470 
After Effects and we're going to be
going<00:00:18.170> to<00:00:18.650> our<00:00:19.040> composition<00:00:19.970> window<00:00:20.119> and

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
going to our composition window and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.140 
going to our composition window and
clicking<00:00:20.840> on<00:00:20.960> layer<00:00:21.230> new<00:00:21.860> solid<00:00:22.099> and<00:00:22.939> we're

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
clicking on layer new solid and we're

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.999 
clicking on layer new solid and we're
just<00:00:23.270> going<00:00:23.419> to<00:00:23.480> make<00:00:23.660> a<00:00:23.720> new<00:00:23.989> solid<00:00:24.230> any<00:00:24.650> color

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
just going to make a new solid any color

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.819 
just going to make a new solid any color
comp<00:00:25.579> size<00:00:25.790> click<00:00:26.630> OK<00:00:26.989> and<00:00:27.290> basically<00:00:27.680> we're

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
comp size click OK and basically we're

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.409 
comp size click OK and basically we're
basically<00:00:28.640> we're<00:00:28.790> going<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:28.939> be<00:00:29.060> using<00:00:29.329> this

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
basically we're going to be using this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.819 
basically we're going to be using this
as<00:00:29.599> a<00:00:29.750> shape<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:30.200> I'm<00:00:30.290> just<00:00:30.380> gonna<00:00:30.500> make<00:00:30.710> it

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
as a shape so I'm just gonna make it

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.400 
as a shape so I'm just gonna make it
into<00:00:30.950> a<00:00:31.099> kind<00:00:31.640> of<00:00:31.730> vertical<00:00:32.599> rectangle<00:00:33.350> and

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
into a kind of vertical rectangle and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.280 
into a kind of vertical rectangle and
just<00:00:33.470> put<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:33.800> down<00:00:33.920> into<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.310> bottom<00:00:34.579> corner

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
just put it down into the bottom corner

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.080 
just put it down into the bottom corner
so<00:00:36.290> what<00:00:36.500> motion<00:00:36.860> sketch<00:00:37.100> which<00:00:37.700> is<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.910> first

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
so what motion sketch which is the first

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
so what motion sketch which is the first
thing<00:00:38.180> we'll<00:00:38.330> be<00:00:38.450> talking<00:00:38.630> about<00:00:38.840> what<00:00:39.080> that

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
thing we'll be talking about what that

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.020 
thing we'll be talking about what that
does<00:00:39.410> is<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.830> basically<00:00:39.920> allows<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:40.700> to<00:00:40.760> take

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
does is it basically allows you to take

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.330 
does is it basically allows you to take
and<00:00:41.300> draw<00:00:41.840> a<00:00:42.050> path<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:42.620> After<00:00:42.920> Effects<00:00:43.160> and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
and draw a path in After Effects and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.240 
and draw a path in After Effects and
animate<00:00:43.910> your<00:00:44.030> shape<00:00:44.330> along<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.470> in

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
animate your shape along it so in

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.980 
animate your shape along it so in
traditional<00:00:46.490> animation<00:00:47.390> with<00:00:47.630> in<00:00:47.720> After

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
traditional animation with in After

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.150 
traditional animation with in After
Effects<00:00:48.170> you<00:00:48.320> would<00:00:48.410> actually<00:00:48.530> have<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:48.860> set

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
Effects you would actually have to set

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.610 
Effects you would actually have to set
keyframes<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:49.940> rotation<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.750> position<00:00:50.990> and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
keyframes and rotation and position and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.740 
keyframes and rotation and position and
things<00:00:51.800> like<00:00:51.950> that<00:00:52.160> automatically<00:00:53.120> like

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
things like that automatically like

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.540 
things like that automatically like
you'd<00:00:54.260> basically<00:00:54.680> set<00:00:54.920> those<00:00:55.100> where<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:55.310> want

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
you'd basically set those where you want

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.640 
you'd basically set those where you want
it<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:55.760> move<00:00:55.970> but<00:00:56.780> this<00:00:56.900> will<00:00:57.079> automatically

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
it to move but this will automatically

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.200 
it to move but this will automatically
generate<00:00:57.800> this<00:00:58.220> for<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:58.610> as<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:58.970> kind<00:00:59.090> of

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
generate this for you as you kind of

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.850 
generate this for you as you kind of
move<00:00:59.360> your<00:00:59.480> mouse<00:00:59.660> around<00:00:59.870> in<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.620> path<00:01:00.829> that

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
move your mouse around in the path that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.760 
move your mouse around in the path that
you<00:01:01.100> want<00:01:01.220> it<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.430> follow<00:01:01.780> so<00:01:02.780> in<00:01:03.350> order<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.620> get

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
you want it to follow so in order to get

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.350 
you want it to follow so in order to get
to<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:04.129> motion<00:01:04.489> sketch<00:01:04.699> window<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.030> go<00:01:05.180> up<00:01:05.239> to

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
to the motion sketch window you go up to

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.910 
to the motion sketch window you go up to
window<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.659> then<00:01:05.900> down<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.140> motion<00:01:06.710> sketch

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
window and then down to motion sketch

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.130 
window and then down to motion sketch
and<00:01:07.250> I<00:01:07.340> already<00:01:07.520> have<00:01:07.640> mine<00:01:07.850> open<00:01:08.030> down<00:01:08.869> here

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
and I already have mine open down here

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.929 
and I already have mine open down here
so<00:01:09.500> this<00:01:09.619> is<00:01:09.740> what<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.069> panel<00:01:10.460> will<00:01:10.609> look<00:01:10.759> like

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
so this is what the panel will look like

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.330 
so this is what the panel will look like
you<00:01:11.119> have<00:01:11.149> capture<00:01:11.630> speed<00:01:12.159> smoothing<00:01:13.159> you

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
you have capture speed smoothing you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.370 
you have capture speed smoothing you
have<00:01:13.490> show<00:01:13.759> and<00:01:14.149> you<00:01:14.329> have<00:01:14.479> start<00:01:14.960> duration

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
have show and you have start duration

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.319 
have show and you have start duration
and<00:01:15.619> start<00:01:16.039> capture<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:16.909> I'm<00:01:16.969> just<00:01:17.090> going<00:01:17.270> to

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
and start capture so I'm just going to

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:18.520 
and start capture so I'm just going to
set<00:01:17.479> this<00:01:17.569> back<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.929> 1<00:01:18.170> because<00:01:18.350> that's

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
set this back to 1 because that's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.870 
set this back to 1 because that's
probably<00:01:18.770> how<00:01:19.009> it'll<00:01:19.159> look<00:01:19.219> for<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.609> on<00:01:19.789> the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
probably how it'll look for you on the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.179 
probably how it'll look for you on the
smoothing<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:21.409> I'm<00:01:21.619> just<00:01:21.710> going<00:01:21.829> to<00:01:21.920> show<00:01:22.159> you

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
smoothing and I'm just going to show you

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.219 
smoothing and I'm just going to show you
straight<00:01:23.179> out<00:01:23.270> how<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:23.659> work<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.079> we're<00:01:24.170> just

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
straight out how this work so we're just

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.260 
straight out how this work so we're just
going<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.530> click<00:01:24.679> to<00:01:24.799> start<00:01:25.009> capture<00:01:25.399> and<00:01:25.759> then

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
going to click to start capture and then

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.370 
going to click to start capture and then
we're<00:01:26.569> just<00:01:26.749> going<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.079> make<00:01:27.229> sure<00:01:27.259> our

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
we're just going to make sure our

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.959 
we're just going to make sure our
cursors<00:01:27.889> at<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.100> beginning<00:01:28.429> there<00:01:28.579> and<00:01:28.819> then

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
cursors at the beginning there and then

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.870 
cursors at the beginning there and then
just<00:01:29.179> take<00:01:29.359> and<00:01:29.770> drag<00:01:30.770> along<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.100> path<00:01:31.369> wherever

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
just take and drag along a path wherever

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.449 
just take and drag along a path wherever
you<00:01:31.999> want<00:01:32.179> your<00:01:32.450> object<00:01:32.929> to<00:01:33.049> go<00:01:33.219> as<00:01:34.219> you<00:01:34.340> can

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
you want your object to go as you can

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.129 
you want your object to go as you can
see<00:01:34.609> it's<00:01:34.729> made<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.909> bunch<00:01:35.329> of<00:01:35.420> keyframes<00:01:35.899> if<00:01:36.049> we

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.139 
see it's made a bunch of keyframes if we

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:37.719 
see it's made a bunch of keyframes if we
take<00:01:36.319> and<00:01:36.499> toggle<00:01:36.829> down<00:01:36.920> our<00:01:37.130> little<00:01:37.340> arrow<00:01:37.520> on

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
take and toggle down our little arrow on

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.090 
take and toggle down our little arrow on
our<00:01:37.759> blue<00:01:38.090> salad<00:01:38.450> there<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.979> toggle<00:01:39.979> down

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
our blue salad there and toggle down

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.739 
our blue salad there and toggle down
transform<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.789> can<00:01:40.939> see<00:01:41.119> all<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.479> different

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
transform you can see all the different

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.599 
transform you can see all the different
points<00:01:41.899> that<00:01:42.229> are<00:01:42.289> made<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.310> if<00:01:43.459> we<00:01:43.579> take

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
points that are made and so if we take

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.940 
points that are made and so if we take
and<00:01:44.060> move<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.359> along<00:01:44.539> we<00:01:45.439> click<00:01:45.649> on<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.889> you

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
and move this along we click on it you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.499 
and move this along we click on it you
can<00:01:46.069> see<00:01:46.219> it's<00:01:46.459> following<00:01:46.819> all<00:01:46.939> those<00:01:47.060> points

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
can see it's following all those points

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.809 
can see it's following all those points
and<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:48.170> moves<00:01:48.319> in<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.679> same<00:01:48.979> path<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.520> we

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
and it moves in that same path that we

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.969 
and it moves in that same path that we
just<00:01:49.969> moved<00:01:50.179> our<00:01:50.329> mouse<00:01:50.539> so<00:01:51.170> this<00:01:51.319> can<00:01:51.439> be<00:01:51.469> very

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
just moved our mouse so this can be very

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.550 
just moved our mouse so this can be very
good<00:01:52.249> for<00:01:52.579> doing<00:01:52.759> quick<00:01:53.090> animation<00:01:53.359> or<00:01:54.170> if<00:01:54.469> you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
good for doing quick animation or if you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.779 
good for doing quick animation or if you
want<00:01:54.709> to<00:01:54.770> take<00:01:54.889> the<00:01:54.979> time<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.189> refine<00:01:55.609> these

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
want to take the time to refine these

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:56.980 
want to take the time to refine these
keyframes<00:01:56.209> you<00:01:56.359> can<00:01:56.479> take<00:01:56.630> any<00:01:56.779> of<00:01:56.869> these

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
keyframes you can take any of these

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.419 
keyframes you can take any of these
keyframes<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.590> pretty<00:01:57.740> much<00:01:57.859> just<00:01:57.920> move<00:01:58.249> them

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
keyframes and pretty much just move them

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.849 
keyframes and pretty much just move them
around<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.689> can<00:01:59.899> actually<00:02:00.259> refine<00:02:00.619> them

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
around and you can actually refine them

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.300 
around and you can actually refine them
how<00:02:01.039> you<00:02:01.100> would<00:02:01.310> like<00:02:02.499> so<00:02:03.499> if<00:02:03.859> you<00:02:04.039> want<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:04.279> a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
how you would like so if you want it a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.050 
how you would like so if you want it a
little<00:02:04.729> bit<00:02:04.880> more<00:02:05.090> fine-tuned<00:02:06.849> animation<00:02:07.849> on

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
little bit more fine-tuned animation on

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.730 
little bit more fine-tuned animation on
there<00:02:08.300> what<00:02:08.599> you<00:02:08.690> can<00:02:08.840> do<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.259> I'm<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:09.500> going

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
there what you can do is I'm just going

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.650 
there what you can do is I'm just going
to<00:02:09.860> take<00:02:10.099> and<00:02:10.959> delete<00:02:11.959> these<00:02:12.080> keyframes<00:02:12.560> out

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
to take and delete these keyframes out

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.910 
to take and delete these keyframes out
and<00:02:13.930> we<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.260> start<00:02:14.620> over<00:02:14.740> here<00:02:16.590> put<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.620> down

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
and we can start over here put that down

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.290 
and we can start over here put that down
layer<00:02:18.160> move<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> beginning<00:02:18.880> now

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
layer move this to the beginning now

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.450 
layer move this to the beginning now
what<00:02:20.140> these<00:02:20.320> other<00:02:20.560> settings<00:02:21.040> do<00:02:21.190> are

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
what these other settings do are

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.760 
what these other settings do are
basically<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:22.570> capture<00:02:23.050> speed<00:02:23.290> at<00:02:23.410> 100%

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
basically you have capture speed at 100%

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.040 
basically you have capture speed at 100%
so<00:02:24.340> we're<00:02:24.520> capturing<00:02:24.760> at<00:02:25.300> real-time

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
so we're capturing at real-time

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.780 
so we're capturing at real-time
basically<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:27.070> if<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.310> have<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.460> really

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
basically so if you have a really

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.120 
basically so if you have a really
precise<00:02:28.240> say<00:02:29.230> you're<00:02:29.380> doing<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:29.740> some<00:02:29.920> kind

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
precise say you're doing like some kind

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.580 
precise say you're doing like some kind
of<00:02:30.190> spiral<00:02:30.700> effect<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.360> your<00:02:31.450> shape<00:02:31.690> you're

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
of spiral effect to your shape you're

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.170 
of spiral effect to your shape you're
probably<00:02:32.830> gonna<00:02:33.070> want<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.640> take<00:02:33.790> your<00:02:33.970> time

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
probably gonna want to take your time

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.550 
probably gonna want to take your time
when<00:02:34.360> you're<00:02:34.480> moving<00:02:34.600> your<00:02:34.870> mouse<00:02:35.020> around<00:02:35.380> so

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
when you're moving your mouse around so

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.110 
when you're moving your mouse around so
you're<00:02:35.680> gonna<00:02:35.800> want<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.160> move<00:02:36.310> slower<00:02:36.820> so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
you're gonna want to move slower so

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.430 
you're gonna want to move slower so
you're<00:02:37.240> not<00:02:37.360> capturing<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.870> real<00:02:38.050> time<00:02:38.290> you'd

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
you're not capturing it real time you'd

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.890 
you're not capturing it real time you'd
put<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:38.800> something<00:02:39.070> like<00:02:39.240> half<00:02:40.240> time<00:02:40.600> or<00:02:40.870> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
put it on something like half time or a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.160 
put it on something like half time or a
fourth<00:02:41.350> of<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> time<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:41.830> you'd<00:02:41.950> up<00:02:42.160> this

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
fourth of the time so you'd up this

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.110 
fourth of the time so you'd up this
number<00:02:44.170> depending<00:02:44.620> on<00:02:44.770> how<00:02:45.040> slow<00:02:45.520> you're

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
number depending on how slow you're

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.000 
number depending on how slow you're
actually<00:02:46.420> moving<00:02:46.600> your<00:02:46.780> mouse<00:02:46.960> or<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.860> can

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
actually moving your mouse or you can

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.040 
actually moving your mouse or you can
just<00:02:48.160> adjust<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.090> keyframes<00:02:49.480> later<00:02:49.720> but<00:02:49.900> this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
just adjust the keyframes later but this

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.570 
just adjust the keyframes later but this
kind<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> gives<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> chance<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.310> do<00:02:51.460> that

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
kind of gives you the chance to do that

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.200 
kind of gives you the chance to do that
right<00:02:51.790> away

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
right away

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.420 
right away
now<00:02:52.780> within<00:02:52.960> smoothing<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.220> definitely

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
now within smoothing this is definitely

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.890 
now within smoothing this is definitely
something<00:02:54.790> I'd<00:02:54.880> recommend<00:02:55.300> using<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.660> saw

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
something I'd recommend using you saw

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.790 
something I'd recommend using you saw
how<00:02:56.080> there<00:02:56.230> were<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.320> ton<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.590> different

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
how there were a ton of different

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.950 
how there were a ton of different
keyframes<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:58.210> you<00:02:58.330> want<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.570> cut<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
keyframes if you want to cut the

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.610 
keyframes if you want to cut the
keyframes<00:02:59.440> down<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.860> having<00:03:00.220> like<00:03:01.620> more

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
keyframes down to having like more

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.070 
keyframes down to having like more
distinct<00:03:03.430> keyframes<00:03:04.390> or<00:03:04.540> other<00:03:04.660> than<00:03:04.780> just<00:03:04.960> a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
distinct keyframes or other than just a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.230 
distinct keyframes or other than just a
bunch<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.530> them<00:03:05.680> basically<00:03:06.310> having<00:03:06.880> at<00:03:07.000> one

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
bunch of them basically having at one

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.460 
bunch of them basically having at one
smoothing<00:03:07.660> it'll<00:03:07.780> give<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.230> most

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
smoothing it'll give you the most

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.730 
smoothing it'll give you the most
accurate<00:03:09.210> representation<00:03:10.210> of<00:03:10.560> how<00:03:11.560> your

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
accurate representation of how your

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.830 
accurate representation of how your
mouse<00:03:11.920> moved<00:03:12.250> but<00:03:12.820> if<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.270> take<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.630> put<00:03:13.750> it

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
mouse moved but if you take and put it

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.120 
mouse moved but if you take and put it
up<00:03:13.930> at<00:03:14.050> something<00:03:14.230> like<00:03:14.410> ten<00:03:14.680> which<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:15.010> would

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
up at something like ten which I would

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.120 
up at something like ten which I would
recommend<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:15.970> do<00:03:16.120> start<00:03:16.390> capture

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
recommend and then you do start capture

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.950 
recommend and then you do start capture
it<00:03:18.130> will<00:03:18.310> take<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:18.910> it'll<00:03:19.390> kind<00:03:19.570> of<00:03:19.720> make<00:03:19.840> some

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
it will take and it'll kind of make some

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.310 
it will take and it'll kind of make some
key<00:03:20.350> keyframes<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.750> can<00:03:22.870> see<00:03:23.020> that<00:03:23.200> now

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
key keyframes and you can see that now

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.550 
key keyframes and you can see that now
we<00:03:23.380> have<00:03:23.530> instead<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:24.900> 30<00:03:25.900> keyframes<00:03:26.410> or

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
we have instead of like 30 keyframes or

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.230 
we have instead of like 30 keyframes or
something<00:03:26.830> we<00:03:26.890> have<00:03:27.040> like<00:03:27.250> well<00:03:27.790> there<00:03:28.150> was

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
something we have like well there was

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.090 
something we have like well there was
probably<00:03:28.510> more<00:03:28.570> than<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.960> we<00:03:29.650> have<00:03:29.680> some

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
probably more than that we have some

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.220 
probably more than that we have some
distinct<00:03:30.640> just<00:03:31.210> a<00:03:31.300> few<00:03:31.570> keyframes<00:03:31.960> and<00:03:32.140> so

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
distinct just a few keyframes and so

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.960 
distinct just a few keyframes and so
it's<00:03:32.350> much<00:03:32.530> easier<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:33.040> tweak<00:03:33.280> your<00:03:33.310> animation

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
it's much easier to tweak your animation

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.690 
it's much easier to tweak your animation
later<00:03:34.150> on<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.680> that's<00:03:35.860> basically<00:03:36.160> how<00:03:36.280> motion

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
later on so that's basically how motion

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.400 
later on so that's basically how motion
sketch<00:03:36.880> works<00:03:37.120> its<00:03:37.300> really<00:03:37.360> good<00:03:37.690> for<00:03:37.720> mocking

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
sketch works its really good for mocking

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.010 
sketch works its really good for mocking
up<00:03:38.560> animation<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.390> actually<00:03:40.720> use<00:03:40.870> it

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
up animation and you can actually use it

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.110 
up animation and you can actually use it
for<00:03:41.200> some<00:03:41.380> pretty<00:03:41.560> nice<00:03:42.520> stuff<00:03:42.730> as<00:03:42.880> well<00:03:43.090> so

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
for some pretty nice stuff as well so

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.660 
for some pretty nice stuff as well so
just<00:03:43.600> for<00:03:43.900> animating<00:03:44.350> position<00:03:44.860> around<00:03:44.950> so

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
just for animating position around so

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.460 
just for animating position around so
now<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:45.910> we<00:03:46.030> have<00:03:46.210> our<00:03:46.240> path<00:03:46.720> going<00:03:47.290> right

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
now that we have our path going right

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.990 
now that we have our path going right
now<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.800> kind<00:03:47.950> of<00:03:48.040> looks<00:03:48.250> like<00:03:48.460> we've<00:03:48.730> made<00:03:48.760> a

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
now it kind of looks like we've made a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.030 
now it kind of looks like we've made a
windy<00:03:49.600> road<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.470> second<00:03:50.740> thing<00:03:50.830> I'm<00:03:50.950> gonna

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
windy road so the second thing I'm gonna

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.770 
windy road so the second thing I'm gonna
be<00:03:51.160> showing<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.490> how<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:51.610> do<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:52.000> auto<00:03:52.270> orient

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
be showing you how to do is auto orient

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.540 
be showing you how to do is auto orient
your<00:03:52.900> shape<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.410> what<00:03:53.770> I<00:03:53.800> mean<00:03:53.980> by<00:03:54.130> this<00:03:54.190> is

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
your shape and what I mean by this is

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.670 
your shape and what I mean by this is
say<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.060> we<00:03:55.240> imagine<00:03:55.810> our<00:03:55.960> blue<00:03:56.200> shape<00:03:56.440> as<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
say that we imagine our blue shape as a

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.160 
say that we imagine our blue shape as a
car<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.490> we<00:03:57.880> want<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.240> be<00:03:58.390> going<00:03:58.840> along

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
car and we want it to be going along

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.040 
car and we want it to be going along
this<00:03:59.320> windy<00:03:59.680> road<00:04:00.300> from<00:04:01.300> like<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> top<00:04:01.780> down

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
this windy road from like a top down

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.080 
this windy road from like a top down
like<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.350> bird's-eye<00:04:02.740> view<00:04:02.770> perspective<00:04:03.310> now

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
like a bird's-eye view perspective now

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.760 
like a bird's-eye view perspective now
when<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.540> gets<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.810> this<00:04:04.900> curve<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.500> would<00:04:05.590> be

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
when it gets to this curve it would be

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.400 
when it gets to this curve it would be
probably<00:04:06.450> rotated<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.600> be<00:04:07.750> going<00:04:07.900> around<00:04:08.110> and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
probably rotated and be going around and

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.380 
probably rotated and be going around and
rotate<00:04:08.890> as<00:04:09.100> its<00:04:09.340> following<00:04:09.670> around<00:04:09.940> here<00:04:10.210> now

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
rotate as its following around here now

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.800 
rotate as its following around here now
to<00:04:11.200> do<00:04:11.320> this<00:04:11.470> without<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.910> After<00:04:13.540> Effects

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
to do this without the After Effects

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.670 
to do this without the After Effects
feature<00:04:14.050> I'm<00:04:14.140> going<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.290> show<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.470> you'd

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
feature I'm going to show you you'd

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.470 
feature I'm going to show you you'd
basically<00:04:14.830> have<00:04:15.100> to<00:04:15.340> be<00:04:15.790> rotating<00:04:16.390> it

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
basically have to be rotating it

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.060 
basically have to be rotating it
periodically<00:04:17.140> along<00:04:17.470> here<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.799> setting

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
periodically along here and setting

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.890 
periodically along here and setting
keyframes<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.150> would<00:04:19.270> take<00:04:19.420> a<00:04:19.450> while<00:04:19.690> so

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
keyframes and it would take a while so

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.080 
keyframes and it would take a while so
what<00:04:20.890> I'm<00:04:21.010> going<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.190> show<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.400> here<00:04:21.729> is<00:04:21.880> if

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
what I'm going to show you here is if

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.550 
what I'm going to show you here is if
you<00:04:22.240> just<00:04:22.570> I'm<00:04:22.840> just<00:04:22.900> going<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.140> close<00:04:23.320> that

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
you just I'm just going to close that

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.920 
you just I'm just going to close that
for<00:04:24.030> simplicity<00:04:25.030> is<00:04:25.300> if<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.510> click<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:25.780> your

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
for simplicity is if you click on your

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.860 
for simplicity is if you click on your
layer<00:04:26.140> then<00:04:26.650> go

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
layer then go

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.350 
layer then go
to<00:04:26.960> layer<00:04:27.199> now<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.830> transform<00:04:28.669> then<00:04:29.150> go<00:04:29.240> down

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
to layer now to transform then go down

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.200 
to layer now to transform then go down
to<00:04:29.419> Auto<00:04:29.810> Orient<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.530> then<00:04:31.190> click<00:04:31.729> orient

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
to Auto Orient and then click orient

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.550 
to Auto Orient and then click orient
along<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.449> path<00:04:32.750> which<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.199> what<00:04:33.320> we<00:04:33.440> have

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
along a path which is what we have

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.110 
along a path which is what we have
already<00:04:33.770> created<00:04:34.070> with<00:04:34.370> our<00:04:34.550> motion<00:04:34.880> sketch

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
already created with our motion sketch

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.570 
already created with our motion sketch
just<00:04:35.479> click<00:04:35.720> OK<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.350> basically<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.280> will<00:04:37.340> take

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
just click OK and basically it will take

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.350 
just click OK and basically it will take
and<00:04:37.850> move<00:04:38.600> your<00:04:38.870> shape<00:04:39.699> along<00:04:40.699> the<00:04:40.910> path<00:04:41.120> and

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
and move your shape along the path and

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.090 
and move your shape along the path and
it'll<00:04:41.510> oriented<00:04:42.050> depending<00:04:42.470> on<00:04:42.590> how<00:04:42.860> your

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
it'll oriented depending on how your

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.219 
it'll oriented depending on how your
your<00:04:43.490> path<00:04:43.760> moves<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.630> now<00:04:44.750> if<00:04:44.840> we<00:04:44.870> want<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.110> to

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
your path moves so now if we want it to

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.080 
your path moves so now if we want it to
look<00:04:45.290> like<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.530> car<00:04:45.830> we'll<00:04:46.100> just<00:04:46.280> kind<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.550> fix

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
look like a car we'll just kind of fix

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.390 
look like a car we'll just kind of fix
it<00:04:47.300> on<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.449> very<00:04:47.690> beginning<00:04:47.870> position<00:04:48.400> so

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
it on the very beginning position so

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.920 
it on the very beginning position so
that<00:04:49.520> it's<00:04:49.639> kind<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.820> pointing<00:04:50.180> towards<00:04:50.449> where

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
that it's kind of pointing towards where

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.100 
that it's kind of pointing towards where
it's<00:04:51.110> going<00:04:51.229> to<00:04:51.290> be<00:04:51.380> driving<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:53.690> now<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.900> can

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
it's going to be driving and now you can

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.170 
it's going to be driving and now you can
see<00:04:54.260> that<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.560> auto<00:04:54.830> Orient's<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.820> that<00:04:56.000> path

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
see that it auto Orient's to that path

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.060 
see that it auto Orient's to that path
so<00:04:56.720> this<00:04:56.840> can<00:04:56.960> be<00:04:56.990> really<00:04:57.320> helpful<00:04:57.500> um<00:04:57.889> I<00:04:58.040> just

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
so this can be really helpful um I just

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.200 
so this can be really helpful um I just
thought<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.370> should<00:04:58.460> bring<00:04:58.729> that<00:04:58.760> up<00:04:58.880> because

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
thought I should bring that up because

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.670 
thought I should bring that up because
we<00:04:59.330> already<00:04:59.449> had<00:04:59.690> a<00:04:59.720> curving<00:05:00.199> path<00:05:00.229> that<00:05:00.590> we

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
we already had a curving path that we

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.650 
we already had a curving path that we
made<00:05:00.830> with<00:05:01.010> our<00:05:01.039> motion<00:05:01.460> sketch<00:05:01.729> so<00:05:02.539> it's

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
made with our motion sketch so it's

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.939 
made with our motion sketch so it's
definitely<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.020> nice<00:05:03.139> tip<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.680> don't<00:05:03.830> have

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
definitely a nice tip so you don't have

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.730 
definitely a nice tip so you don't have
to<00:05:04.600> manually<00:05:05.600> add<00:05:05.630> in<00:05:05.960> those<00:05:06.110> rotation

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
to manually add in those rotation

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.830 
to manually add in those rotation
keyframes<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:08.270> hope<00:05:08.419> you<00:05:08.510> guys<00:05:08.630> learned

keyframes so hope you guys learned

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.659 
keyframes so hope you guys learned
