00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.100
 hello you center personal 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.320
 prospects and we present to your 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.730
 attention the second part of our course 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.730
 dedicated to relay protection and 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.360
 automatics 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.550
 on the site you have already seen 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.989
 approximate content of the second part 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.489
 course and now we'll talk about her 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.909
 the second part of the course consists of 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.949
 the following points the first is the basis 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.309
 working with protection terminals and here we are 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.650
 analyze the basic concepts that 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.840
 generally apply to 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.750
 terminal microprocessors for kings 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.909
 protection and further consider the phased 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.409
 instructions for setting up terminals and 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.020
 chrysler and 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:22.240
 a b b in the basics of working with 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:26.570
 protection terminals, we will examine the question and 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.440
 here are the questions that you see more precisely on 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.240
 What screens does the terminal consist of? 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.530
 what does each of 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 component parts plus everything 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.570
 there is a difference in the work of these 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.250
 parts based on various 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.720
 terminals that is, let's say 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.790
 measuring part of one terminal 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.270
 may differ not part of me 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.740
 another terminal but basically the difference 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.760
 go to logic and the next question is just 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.620
 illuminates the work of flexible and rigid logic 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.340
 how do they differ advantages and 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.520
 disadvantages will also be considered in 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.299
 the next question 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.299
 further well 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:23.040
 as for the methodology of the instructions for 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.400
 setting up terminals before caviar here we are 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.200
 will deal with you four basic questions 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.269
 software installation 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.599
 tion equipment parameter 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.200
 terminals and method of testing security with 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.049
 using an outside source 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.549
 the next question is about instructions for 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.430
 adjusting dark bresser 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:48.629
 there we understand similar under 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.310
 questions and last question second 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.310
 parts of our course will be 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.680
 Instructions for commissioning a series of terminals 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.840
 b b 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.900
 More precisely firms a in b series 600 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.950
 that is, it is there revered and happy 670 and 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.010
 in this matter we will deal with you also 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.650
 installation of communications software 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.440
 terminals the only difference from 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.180
 previous questions that is instructions 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.780
 on adjusting bresler and caviar here 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.480
 there is such a thing as 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.489
 configuring the terminal but about this 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.470
 we will tell you in more detail when 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.659
 consideration 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.349
 Instructions for setting up the corporate series b 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.540
 well and also ultimately we have to 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.930
 consider the method of checking various 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.010
 terminal using a third-party source 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.979
 Thank you very much for your attention 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.280
 meet you at the next video 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.280
