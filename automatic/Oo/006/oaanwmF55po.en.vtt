look at the ramps in this ballgame and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.059 
look at the ramps in this ballgame and
what<00:01:46.969> they<00:01:47.090> do<00:01:47.149> well<00:01:47.509> again<00:01:48.380> Jeff<00:01:48.619> Fisher<00:01:48.889> team

what they do well again Jeff Fisher team

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.499 
what they do well again Jeff Fisher team
is<00:01:49.219> going<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.399> be<00:01:49.549> well<00:01:49.729> balanced<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:50.359> right

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
is going to be well balanced but right

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.719

now<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:50.749> passing<00:01:51.380> game<00:01:51.529> looks<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:52.579> the

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
now the passing game looks like the

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.580 
now the passing game looks like the
running<00:01:52.999> game<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.389> very<00:01:53.600> basic<00:01:54.139> is<00:01:54.289> very

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
running game is very basic is very

running game is very basic is very
vanilla<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.490> have<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.969> do<00:01:56.149> different<00:01:56.719> things

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
vanilla you have to do different things

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.629 
vanilla you have to do different things
to<00:01:56.990> get<00:01:57.200> Sam<00:01:57.469> Bradford<00:01:57.920> in<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.099> situation

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639 
to get Sam Bradford in the situation

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:59.949 
to get Sam Bradford in the situation
where<00:01:58.789> he<00:01:58.909> can<00:01:59.029> be<00:01:59.149> successful<00:01:59.659> you're

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
where he can be successful you're

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.050 
where he can be successful you're
passing<00:02:00.380> game<00:02:00.560> should<00:02:00.829> not<00:02:01.069> look<00:02:01.670> like<00:02:01.880> you're

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
passing game should not look like you're

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.279 
passing game should not look like you're
running<00:02:02.179> game<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.719> have<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.959> do<00:02:03.049> something

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
running game so you have to do something

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.199 
running game so you have to do something
to<00:02:03.560> stress<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.979> field<00:02:04.189> vertically<00:02:04.579> to<00:02:04.819> help

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
to stress the field vertically to help

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:06.969 
to stress the field vertically to help
out<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.450> young<00:02:05.630> QB<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.200> running<00:02:06.829> out<00:02:06.950> of

out the young QB and running out of

out the young QB and running out of
spray<00:02:07.279> up<00:02:07.340> on<00:02:07.459> beaches<00:02:07.609> I<00:02:07.819> think<00:02:08.030> will<00:02:08.179> help

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
spray up on beaches I think will help

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.490 
spray up on beaches I think will help
the<00:02:08.479> reason<00:02:08.690> why<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.810> say<00:02:08.990> spread<00:02:09.289> formations

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
the reason why I say spread formations

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.740 
the reason why I say spread formations
because<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.369> want<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.610> widen<00:02:10.819> out<00:02:11.120> there<00:02:11.330> 3-4

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
because you want to widen out there 3-4

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.070 
because you want to widen out there 3-4
defense<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:12.770> tough<00:02:13.099> work<00:02:13.340> quarterback<00:02:13.819> to

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
defense it's tough work quarterback to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.059 
defense it's tough work quarterback to
find<00:02:15.080> where<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.410> pressure<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:15.709> coming<00:02:15.860> from

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
find where the pressure is coming from

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.890 
find where the pressure is coming from
out<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.459> 34<00:02:16.910> because<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.510> don't<00:02:17.630> know<00:02:17.780> where

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
out of a 34 because you don't know where

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.180 
out of a 34 because you don't know where
their<00:02:17.990> fourth<00:02:18.230> or<00:02:18.410> fifth<00:02:18.560> guy<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.740> coming<00:02:19.069> from

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
their fourth or fifth guy is coming from

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.280 
their fourth or fifth guy is coming from
so<00:02:19.370> if<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:19.550> widen<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:20.060> out<00:02:20.180> by<00:02:20.659> flexing<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
so if you widen it out by flexing the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.679 
so if you widen it out by flexing the
formation<00:02:21.829> you<00:02:22.189> can<00:02:22.370> essentially<00:02:23.000> see<00:02:23.390> where

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
formation you can essentially see where

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:24.850 
formation you can essentially see where
the<00:02:23.810> pressure<00:02:24.019> is<00:02:24.170> coming<00:02:24.379> from<00:02:24.590> it

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
the pressure is coming from it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.770 
the pressure is coming from it
you<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:25.040> get<00:02:25.190> better<00:02:25.340> protection<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.150> running

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
you can get better protection so running

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.270 
you can get better protection so running
out<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.080> spread<00:02:27.350> formation<00:02:27.530> may<00:02:28.010> help

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
out of the spread formation may help

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.220 
out of the spread formation may help

position to stop the run and the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.110 
position to stop the run and the
x-factor<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.770> little<00:03:25.010> things<00:03:25.190> catch<00:03:25.940> the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
x-factor the little things catch the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.150 
x-factor the little things catch the
football<00:03:26.330> no<00:03:26.930> false<00:03:27.260> starts<00:03:27.590> no<00:03:27.709> penalty<00:03:28.070> is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
football no false starts no penalty is

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.830 
football no false starts no penalty is
nothing<00:03:28.489> like<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:29.209> have<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.450> tie<00:03:29.600> up

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
nothing like that you have to tie up

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.030 
nothing like that you have to tie up
your<00:03:29.870> loose<00:03:30.140> ends<00:03:30.380> in<00:03:30.560> order<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.830> be<00:03:30.950> effective

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
your loose ends in order to be effective

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.770 
your loose ends in order to be effective
now<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:31.850> look<00:03:31.970> at<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.150> position<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.600> break

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
now you look at the position to break

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.900 
now you look at the position to break
down<00:03:32.959> I<00:03:33.200> think<00:03:33.620> both<00:03:33.799> teams<00:03:33.830> have<00:03:34.250> good<00:03:34.549> young

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
down I think both teams have good young

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.030 
down I think both teams have good young
quarterbacks<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.570> i<00:03:35.750> call<00:03:36.049> this<00:03:36.200> matchup<00:03:36.620> equal

Steven<00:03:39.920> Jackson<00:03:40.100> Whitney<00:03:40.519> brings<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.850> the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
Steven Jackson Whitney brings to the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.640 
Steven Jackson Whitney brings to the
table<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.299> love<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.600> depth<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:41.989> Redskins<00:03:42.440> I

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
table I love the depth of the Redskins I

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.140 
table I love the depth of the Redskins I
think<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.040> risk<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.310> had<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.700> advantage<00:03:44.030> at

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
think the risk is had the advantage at

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.640 
think the risk is had the advantage at
the<00:03:44.269> receiver<00:03:44.600> position<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:45.260> tight<00:03:45.470> end

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
the receiver position the tight end

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.110 
the receiver position the tight end
position<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.130> definitely<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.730> offensive

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
position and definitely the offensive

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.720 
position and definitely the offensive
line<00:03:47.269> now<00:03:47.810> defensively<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.920> front<00:03:49.220> seven<00:03:49.549> in

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
line now defensively the front seven in

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.550 
line now defensively the front seven in
my<00:03:49.910> opinion<00:03:50.209> is<00:03:50.390> solid<00:03:50.780> on<00:03:50.900> both<00:03:51.140> sides<00:03:51.410> of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
my opinion is solid on both sides of

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.660 
my opinion is solid on both sides of
football<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:51.920> Rams<00:03:52.070> do<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.250> lot<00:03:52.400> of<00:03:52.430> good

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
football the Rams do a lot of good

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.949 
football the Rams do a lot of good
things<00:03:52.820> with<00:03:53.060> their<00:03:53.209> front<00:03:53.420> seven<00:03:53.570> and<00:03:53.780> so

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
things with their front seven and so

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.750 
things with their front seven and so
does<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.620> Washington<00:03:55.040> Redskins<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.489> think<00:03:55.670> the

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
does the Washington Redskins I think the

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.820 
does the Washington Redskins I think the
Rams<00:03:56.000> have<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.720> advantage<00:03:57.140> skill-wise<00:03:57.650> in

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
Rams have the advantage skill-wise in

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.740 
Rams have the advantage skill-wise in
the<00:03:58.459> secondary<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.269> give<00:03:59.480> them<00:03:59.600> an

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
the secondary so I give them an

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.910 
the secondary so I give them an
advantage<00:04:00.049> and<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.350> think<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.620> risk<00:04:00.799> is

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
advantage and I think the risk is

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.740 
advantage and I think the risk is
definitely<00:04:01.670> have<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.940> edge<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.390> special

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
definitely have the edge and special

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.210 
definitely have the edge and special
teams<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.110> when<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:03.350> look<00:04:03.470> at<00:04:03.620> this<00:04:03.739> ball<00:04:04.010> game

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
teams so when you look at this ball game

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.580 
teams so when you look at this ball game
you<00:04:04.700> look<00:04:05.269> at<00:04:05.420> where<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.810> risk<00:04:05.989> is<00:04:06.170> can<00:04:06.410> have

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
you look at where the risk is can have

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.020 
you look at where the risk is can have
an<00:04:06.739> advantage<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.220> think<00:04:07.549> they<00:04:07.610> can<00:04:07.760> have<00:04:07.940> an

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
an advantage I think they can have an

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.940 
an advantage I think they can have an
advantage<00:04:08.299> throwing<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.019> football<00:04:09.170> down<00:04:09.620> the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
advantage throwing the football down the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.650 
advantage throwing the football down the
field<00:04:10.100> and<00:04:10.400> loosen<00:04:10.700> up<00:04:10.820> their<00:04:11.000> boxes<00:04:11.510> what

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
field and loosen up their boxes what

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.060 
field and loosen up their boxes what
they're<00:04:11.780> going<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:11.959> try<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.140> do<00:04:12.320> is<00:04:12.620> come<00:04:12.920> in

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
they're going to try to do is come in

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.789 
they're going to try to do is come in
and<00:04:13.250> try<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.430> stop<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.940> run<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:14.540> rg3<00:04:15.290> can<00:04:15.500> show

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
and try to stop the run but rg3 can show

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:16.719 
and try to stop the run but rg3 can show
that<00:04:15.830> he<00:04:16.160> can<00:04:16.310> throw<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.489> football

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
that he can throw the football

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.490 
that he can throw the football
consistently<00:04:17.720> when<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:17.959> running<00:04:18.169> game<00:04:18.290> is

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
consistently when the running game is

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.080 
consistently when the running game is
gone<00:04:18.799> I<00:04:19.040> think<00:04:19.400> that's<00:04:19.549> going<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.729> help<00:04:19.880> the

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
gone I think that's going to help the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.370 
gone I think that's going to help the
Redskins<00:04:20.450> out<00:04:20.540> which<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.750> why<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:20.989> think<00:04:21.169> the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
Redskins out which is why I think the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.230 
Redskins out which is why I think the
Redskins<00:04:21.709> win<00:04:21.890> this<00:04:22.040> ballgame<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.669> do<00:04:22.910> not

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
Redskins win this ballgame I do not

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.090 
Redskins win this ballgame I do not
trust<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.750> offensive<00:04:24.169> line<00:04:24.290> of<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.890> st.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
trust the offensive line of the st.
