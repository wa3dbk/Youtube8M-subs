display<00:00:23.250> which<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.420> incredible<00:00:24.840> this

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
display which really incredible this

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
display which really incredible this
laptop<00:00:25.140> though<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.859> battery<00:00:26.369> life<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.730> own

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
laptop though is the battery life I own

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.089 
laptop though is the battery life I own
it<00:00:27.029> specifically<00:00:27.750> because<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.710> battery

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
it specifically because of the battery

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.160 
it specifically because of the battery
life<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.670> not<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> netbook<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.810> does<00:00:30.990> get

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
life it's not a netbook but it does get

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.770 
life it's not a netbook but it does get
like<00:00:31.349> 12<00:00:31.679> hours<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.340> battery<00:00:32.669> stated<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
like 12 hours of battery stated on the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420 
like 12 hours of battery stated on the
box<00:00:34.110> i<00:00:34.290> actually<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.680> closer<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.130> 9<00:00:35.399> or

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
box i actually get closer to about 9 or

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.360 
box i actually get closer to about 9 or
10<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:36.059> still<00:00:36.300> incredible<00:00:36.840> beats<00:00:37.370> 99%

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
10 but it's still incredible beats 99%

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.709 
10 but it's still incredible beats 99%
of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> laptops<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> market<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.480> it's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
of the laptops on the market and it's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.500 
of the laptops on the market and it's
affordable<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.440> powerful<00:00:41.040> enough<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.250> do

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
affordable it's powerful enough to do

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
affordable it's powerful enough to do
Photoshop<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.719> ironically<00:00:43.559> enough<00:00:43.620> some

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
Photoshop and ironically enough some

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.770 
Photoshop and ironically enough some
people<00:00:44.460> think<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.059> these<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.539> kind<00:00:45.750> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
people think that these are like kind of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.479 
people think that these are like kind of
like<00:00:45.840> over<00:00:46.170> glorified<00:00:46.379> netbooks<00:00:46.980> they're<00:00:47.190> not

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
like over glorified netbooks they're not

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.490 
like over glorified netbooks they're not
these<00:00:48.149> ultra<00:00:48.539> low<00:00:48.660> voltage<00:00:48.690> process<00:00:49.410> are

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
these ultra low voltage process are

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
these ultra low voltage process are
actually<00:00:49.920> basically<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> cut-down<00:00:51.180> version<00:00:51.360> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
actually basically a cut-down version of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.450 
actually basically a cut-down version of
a<00:00:52.020> full-sized<00:00:52.530> core<00:00:52.890> two<00:00:53.039> duos<00:00:53.340> you're

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
a full-sized core two duos you're

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.580 
a full-sized core two duos you're
actually<00:00:53.550> getting<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> pretty<00:00:54.059> powerful

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
actually getting a pretty powerful

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.959 
actually getting a pretty powerful
competent<00:00:55.590> dual-core<00:00:56.010> processor<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
competent dual-core processor it's just

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.760 
competent dual-core processor it's just
clocked<00:00:57.329> lower<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.079> things<00:00:58.260> go<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.620> bit

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
clocked lower so things go a little bit

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580 
clocked lower so things go a little bit
slower<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:00.510> cores<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.469> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
slower but you do have two cores and you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.750 
slower but you do have two cores and you
do<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> nice<00:01:01.920> chip<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> pretty

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
do have a nice chip it is pretty

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.039 
do have a nice chip it is pretty
powerful<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.390> course<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.719> ultra<00:01:03.930> low

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
powerful and of course it's ultra low

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.210 
powerful and of course it's ultra low
voltage<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.439> saves<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> lot<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.979> energy

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
voltage so it saves you a lot of energy

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.590 
voltage so it saves you a lot of energy
now<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.790> clocked<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.420> point

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
now this one is clocked at one point

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.929 
now this one is clocked at one point
three<00:01:06.720> gigahertz<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> SU<00:01:07.830> 7300<00:01:08.549> very

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
three gigahertz it's the SU 7300 very

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
three gigahertz it's the SU 7300 very
nice<00:01:09.119> intel<00:01:09.420> processor<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.320> reason<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
nice intel processor the reason that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
nice intel processor the reason that
this<00:01:10.830> thing<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.100> still<00:01:11.310> pretty<00:01:11.610> fast<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
this thing is still pretty fast and you

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.030 
this thing is still pretty fast and you
know<00:01:12.689> definitely<00:01:12.990> works<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.530> enough<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.770> do

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
know definitely works well enough to do

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.230 
know definitely works well enough to do
Photoshop<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.790> more<00:01:14.909> advanced

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
Photoshop and some more advanced

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.700 
Photoshop and some more advanced
software<00:01:15.479> programs<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.619> does

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
software programs it's because it does

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
software programs it's because it does
have<00:01:16.830> four<00:01:17.040> gigabytes<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.520> ddr3<00:01:17.909> memory<00:01:18.210> it's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
have four gigabytes of ddr3 memory it's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.640 
have four gigabytes of ddr3 memory it's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
got a 500 gigabyte hard drive it does

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.310 
got a 500 gigabyte hard drive it does
have<00:01:22.770> hybrid<00:01:23.130> graphics<00:01:23.729> which<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.240> mean<00:01:24.810> one

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
have hybrid graphics which is I mean one

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.270 
have hybrid graphics which is I mean one
of<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> things<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.799> don't<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:26.130> very

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
of the things that you don't see very

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.920 
of the things that you don't see very
often<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.670> very<00:01:27.000> very<00:01:27.240> cool<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.659> even

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
often it's very very cool it's not even

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
often it's very very cool it's not even
