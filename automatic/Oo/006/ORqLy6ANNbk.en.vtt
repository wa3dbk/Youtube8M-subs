00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.230
Hello, this is XboxAhoy and this is the thirty-second
episode of my Black Ops weapon guide.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.160
Another one shot down.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.640
In this episode we're covering the Strela-3.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.080
It's a single-shot weapon, unlocked at level
30.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:28.400
The 9K34 Strela-3, also known by its NATO
reporting name SA-14 Gremlin - is a Man-portable

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.009
Air Defense System that originates from the
Soviet Union.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.010
The Russian name, 'Strela', translates as
'arrow'.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.530
The Strela-3 was first introduced in 1974,
superceding the earlier Strela-2M.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.399
The development of anti-air launchers mirrors
the development of countermeasures to defeat

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.410
such homing missiles, and the Strela-3's design
intent was no different.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.870
With improved thermal tracking hardware, the
missile was designed to be more resistant

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.980
to countermeasures such as flares and infrared
jammers used by aircraft of the era.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.260
The Strela-3 was ultimately replaced in 1983
by the 9K38 Igla - or 'Needle' - a separate

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.080
design to the Strela series that offered an
'Identification friend-or-foe' system, increased

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.270
effective range, and improved lethality on
target.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.100
The Strela-3 was exported to over 30 countries,
and has seen successful operational use in

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.990
combat situations.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.400
It launches a 75 millimetre diameter missile,
bearing a 1.17 kilogram warhead with infra-red

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.450
homing seeker head.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.840
By default, you'll be equipped with two such
missiles upon spawn - or three total should

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.549
you have Scavenger Pro equipped.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.280
As a lock-on launcher, you cannot employ the
Strela in an anti-personnel role.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.110
When used against air support, however - it
is very effective.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.829
A successful missile strike will destroy any
aerial target.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.670
Enemy helicopters do have countermeasures,
however - your first missile launched will

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.450
be diverted by flares, which will lead the
heat-seeking missile the Strela fires off

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.409
course, resulting in a miss.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.380
Fire again, however - and the helicopter will
be vulnerable to a single missile.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.910
Handling is universally slow with this weapon
- the Strela is sluggish to bring to bear,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.460
and will hamper your movement speed to boot
- to 80% of maximum speed.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.390
Aim time is similarly slow, at half a second
- and reloads will take 3 seconds to complete.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.629
There are no attachments available for the
Strela, so your choice here is simple.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.130
Your perks, however, will have some effect
on your performance.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.370
The first perk slot is arguably the most important
- and there are two potential choices here,

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.510
to maximise the Strela's capability.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.739
The first is Ghost Pro - this will prevent
you from being targeted by enemy air support,

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.250
which can be vital when you're exposed during
the lock-on procedure.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.500
Ghost will buy you vital seconds under fire
from a chopper gunner, allowing for much easier

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.290
despatch of such killstreaks.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.860
Scavenger Pro is also another worthwhile choice,
as you'll gain an extra missile in reserve,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.580
for 3 total.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.230
This gives you the ability to take down up
to 3 enemy killstreaks in one life - useful

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.670
when the enemy has an affinity for the Spy
Plane.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.190
Also useful in your second slot is Sleight
of Hand - This makes successive shots faster

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.550
thanks to the speedier reload, and reduces
the time it takes to aim with the weapon.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.840
Paired with Ghost Pro, there's no better combination
for eliminating the top tier aerial killstreaks.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.159
The Strela-3 is the single best launcher in
Black Ops for tackling enemy air support.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.640
Similar to the M72 LAW, it boasts a guided
projectile that can despatch enemy air support

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.290
in just a single hit.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.792
Unlike the LAW, however - you have two missiles
by default, and as such can tackle a helicopter

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:53.909
solo where the LAW's single missile cannot.

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.360
However, the Strela doesn't offer much in
the way of versatility - lacking the M72's

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.010
ability to free fire, you cannot use it directly
against your enemy.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.370
However, within its role - it cannot be beaten,
and when overwhelming enemy air support threatens

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.220
your chance of victory, the Strela will answer
the call.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.910
It is a single-purpose weapon, but one that
boasts unique focus.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.760
When launched at a vulnerable aerial target,
this self-guided arrow... will always hit

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.150
the bullseye.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.620
Thanks for watching, this has been XboxAhoy.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.430
Join me next time, when I'll be covering the
AK-47.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.160
Until then, farewell.
