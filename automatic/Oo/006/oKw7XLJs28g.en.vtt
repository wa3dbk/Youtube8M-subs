well and you really feel the performance
in<00:06:15.640> them<00:06:15.790> is<00:06:16.240> because<00:06:16.510> of<00:06:16.690> the<00:06:16.930> custom<00:06:17.380> silicon

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
in them is because of the custom silicon

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.430 
in them is because of the custom silicon
that<00:06:18.640> we<00:06:18.910> designed<00:06:19.270> for<00:06:19.570> this<00:06:19.720> product<00:06:20.230> that
