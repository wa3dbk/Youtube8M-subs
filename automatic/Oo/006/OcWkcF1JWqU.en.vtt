with sleight of hand and extreme

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.420 
with sleight of hand and extreme
conditioning<00:00:25.439> which<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> two<00:00:26.130> perks

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
conditioning which are the two perks

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.429 
conditioning which are the two perks
which<00:00:27.050> speed<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.320> throughout<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> game

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
which speed you up throughout the game

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.260 
which speed you up throughout the game
one<00:00:31.439> plus<00:00:31.650> one<00:00:31.800> equals<00:00:31.949> speedy<00:00:32.579> midget<00:00:33.000> right

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
one plus one equals speedy midget right

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.290 
one plus one equals speedy midget right
so<00:00:34.050> i<00:00:34.500> don't<00:00:35.160> really<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.399> count<00:00:35.730> down<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.239> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
so i don't really like count down as a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.200 
so i don't really like count down as a
map<00:00:37.670> it's<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.480> open<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:41.000> there's<00:00:42.000> just

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
map it's just to open and there's just

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.479 
map it's just to open and there's just
little<00:00:42.480> things<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.050> hide<00:00:43.200> behind<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.040> most<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
little things to hide behind and most of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.520 
little things to hide behind and most of
them<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.420> penetrated<00:00:45.660> by<00:00:48.170> bullets<00:00:49.170> from

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
them can be penetrated by bullets from

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.310 
them can be penetrated by bullets from
assault<00:00:50.160> rifles<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.000> light<00:00:51.809> machine<00:00:52.110> guns

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
assault rifles and light machine guns

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.180 
assault rifles and light machine guns
etc<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.260> guys<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.890> doing<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
etc so right here these guys are doing a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.729 
etc so right here these guys are doing a
pretty<00:00:56.430> bad<00:00:56.579> job<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:57.289> looking<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> radar

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
pretty bad job at looking at the radar

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.229 
pretty bad job at looking at the radar
and<00:00:59.070> they<00:00:59.160> don't<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.670> me<00:00:59.820> very<00:00:59.850> well

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and they don't really see me very well

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.150 
and they don't really see me very well
so<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:00.870> kind<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.109> running<00:01:01.260> around<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:01.980> pick

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
so I'm kind of running around I can pick

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.939 
so I'm kind of running around I can pick
them<00:01:02.280> off<00:01:02.870> good<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:04.019> about<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.379> Scorpion

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
them off good thing about the Scorpion

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.410 
them off good thing about the Scorpion
is<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.330> very<00:01:06.510> powerful<00:01:07.670> SMG<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.240> does

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
is it's a very very powerful SMG it does

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.840 
is it's a very very powerful SMG it does
a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.780> damage<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:11.130> got<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.760> good

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
a lot of damage it's got very good

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.429 
a lot of damage it's got very good
accuracy<00:01:12.600> I'm<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.369> high<00:01:14.549> fire<00:01:14.909> rate<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
accuracy I'm in a high fire rate but the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.109 
accuracy I'm in a high fire rate but the
crutch<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.490> small<00:01:18.350> clip<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
crutch for it is the small clip so you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.179 
crutch for it is the small clip so you
technically<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.140> reload<00:01:22.650> after<00:01:22.950> every

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
technically have to reload after every

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190 
technically have to reload after every
one<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:24.000> kills<00:01:24.330> depending<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.020> how<00:01:25.140> many

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
one or two kills depending on how many

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.720 
one or two kills depending on how many
bullets<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.740> takes<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
bullets it takes for you to

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.690 
bullets it takes for you to
kill<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> person<00:01:27.780> you're<00:01:28.260> shooting<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.800> but

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
kill the person you're shooting at but

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.070 
kill the person you're shooting at but
that's<00:01:30.030> kind<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.360> where<00:01:30.510> sleight<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> hand

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
that's kind of where sleight of hand

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.290 
that's kind of where sleight of hand
comes<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.440> handy<00:01:31.620> in<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.430> bullet<00:01:32.760> reload<00:01:33.090> is

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
comes in handy in the bullet reload is

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.520 
comes in handy in the bullet reload is
fast<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> Scorpion<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:37.140> only<00:01:37.350> thing

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
fast for the Scorpion the only thing

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.070 
fast for the Scorpion the only thing
about<00:01:37.710> reloading<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.580> when<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.780> can't

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
about reloading it is when you you can't

about reloading it is when you you can't
do<00:01:40.410> a<00:01:40.440> short<00:01:41.370> and<00:01:41.520> reload<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.420> can't<00:01:42.720> cheat

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990

the case you have to actually finish

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.940

your<00:01:59.820> reload<00:02:00.150> that<00:02:00.990> time<00:02:01.260> I<00:02:01.290> thought<00:02:01.650> I<00:02:01.710> had

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
your reload that time I thought I had

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.670 
your reload that time I thought I had
the<00:02:02.250> sniper<00:02:02.580> in<00:02:03.000> my<00:02:03.150> sight<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.720> he<00:02:04.110> shot<00:02:04.470> me

just<00:04:28.870> throwing<00:04:29.319> my<00:04:29.470> random<00:04:29.860> native<00:04:30.190> frost<00:04:30.460> and

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
just throwing my random native frost and

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.830 
just throwing my random native frost and
that<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:33.250> pays<00:04:33.460> off<00:04:33.669> sometimes<00:04:33.970> but<00:04:34.449> then<00:04:34.750> you

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
that it pays off sometimes but then you

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.119 
that it pays off sometimes but then you
don't<00:04:35.020> really<00:04:35.110> have<00:04:35.319> a<00:04:35.349> grenade<00:04:35.710> when<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:35.979> get

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
don't really have a grenade when you get

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.080 
don't really have a grenade when you get
into<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.340> tight<00:04:36.610> spot<00:04:37.000> or<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:39.460> really<00:04:39.729> need<00:04:39.940> it

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
into a tight spot or you really need it

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.279 
into a tight spot or you really need it
so<00:04:40.479> I<00:04:40.720> try<00:04:41.680> not<00:04:42.009> to<00:04:42.069> throw<00:04:42.639> a<00:04:42.669> miracle<00:04:43.240> mood<00:04:43.389> but

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
so I try not to throw a miracle mood but

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.830 
so I try not to throw a miracle mood but

this<00:05:16.030> map<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:16.330> this<00:05:16.719> kind<00:05:17.199> of<00:05:17.259> bullshit

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
this map is this kind of bullshit

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.610 
this map is this kind of bullshit
because<00:05:18.069> all<00:05:19.000> infinity<00:05:19.780> war<00:05:19.960> really<00:05:20.169> did<00:05:20.409> was

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
because all infinity war really did was

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.480 
because all infinity war really did was
put<00:05:20.889> to<00:05:21.419> to<00:05:22.419> camping<00:05:22.870> spots<00:05:23.199> on<00:05:24.009> each<00:05:24.159> side<00:05:24.460> of

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
put to to camping spots on each side of

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.820 
put to to camping spots on each side of
the<00:05:24.669> map<00:05:24.909> and<00:05:25.240> then<00:05:25.960> put<00:05:26.349> a<00:05:26.380> bunch<00:05:26.590> of<00:05:26.710> little

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
the map and then put a bunch of little

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.950 
the map and then put a bunch of little
objects<00:05:27.340> in<00:05:27.490> between<00:05:27.789> them<00:05:27.969> but<00:05:28.719> if<00:05:28.840> those

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
objects in between them but if those

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.689 
objects in between them but if those
objects<00:05:29.469> weren't<00:05:29.710> there<00:05:29.889> I<00:05:29.919> know<00:05:30.099> everybody
