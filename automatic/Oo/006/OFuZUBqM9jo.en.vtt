about<00:01:14.100> an<00:01:14.189> hour<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.729> eventually<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> got<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
about an hour and eventually I got it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
about an hour and eventually I got it
and<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.520> was<00:01:17.520> aiming<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.759> 18,000<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.320> felt

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
and I was aiming for 18,000 but I felt

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.760 
and I was aiming for 18,000 but I felt
just<00:01:20.280> shy<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.560> as<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> bit

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
just shy of that so as a bit

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.649 
just shy of that so as a bit
disappointed<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.400> still<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.880> got<00:01:24.000> me<00:01:24.119> you

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
disappointed but still it got me you

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.780 
disappointed but still it got me you
know<00:01:24.780> 40-somethings<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> world<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.520> i

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
know 40-somethings in the world which i

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.359 
know 40-somethings in the world which i
guess<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.390> ok<00:01:27.710> obviously<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> fool<00:01:29.100> game

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
guess is ok obviously the fool game

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.010 
guess is ok obviously the fool game
hasn't<00:01:29.670> released<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.509> understand<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
hasn't released and I understand that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.420 
hasn't released and I understand that
not<00:01:31.140> everyone<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.159> game<00:01:32.280> at<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
not everyone will have the game at the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.130 
not everyone will have the game at the
moment<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> yeah<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.840> friends

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
moment and so yeah not all my friends

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.960 
moment and so yeah not all my friends
will<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> game<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.979> guess<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:38.880> may

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
will have the game so I guess there may

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.710 
will have the game so I guess there may
be<00:01:39.000> someone<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.360> there<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.570> he<00:01:39.630> was
