00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.719
 There is such a controversial issue with 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.699
 what age can you study 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.130
 bodybuilding 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:21.550
 you understand from absolutely anyone here 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:26.250
 such a significant misconception that 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:30.070
 bodybuilding affects growth here look 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.469
 many years and bodybuilding did not affect him 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.600
 this is one of the few sports 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.570
 who do not put age and sex 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.480
 restrictions that is to consider such 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.790
 questions yes here are smaller athletes 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.370
 more often you seek higher 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.100
 results but this is not a fact and you 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.530
 look at the growth clearly small 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.180
 it is easier for an athlete to lift a barbell 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.200
 he needs to lift the barbell on much 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.300
 lower height 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.550
 a tall man here we are 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.269
 look at the height of the lift bar is understandable 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.840
 or he needs to drag the meter or small 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:10.719
 two or three times as low as an athlete 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.200
 easier because height 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:18.069
 lifting much smaller decks and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.209
 restrictions here are often female girls 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:25.479
 dumbbells are often afraid 

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:28.600
 here exercises with dumbbells is the best 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.259
 generally the best way to keep in shape 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.959
 your muscles your body but we are in this 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.229
 case is considered from what age 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:40.450
 bodybuilding 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.880
 well bodybuilding it does not matter iron sport 12 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.549
 years now a man has recently started to engage 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.740
 in such a sport in training we start 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.630
 go in here exercise ate him 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.289
 he just liked him better 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.010
 goes here is the slope and ate 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:06.740
 here he is doing them many times in three 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:13.330
 then here are exercises like craving 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.330
 chin like that 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.280
 also 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.000
 The exercise includes such exercises as 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.220
 weight bench 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.760
 Well these arguments have long maintained that the effect of 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.160
 iron sport on a person's height well 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.430
 father i'm not wrong fifty second year 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:46.320
 in Leningrad I do not remember the name of the professor 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:54.270
 was held here so held a 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:56.610
 the tests took a group of athletes that's rude 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.850
 saying weightlifters that is training 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.410
 the deadlift squats went away 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.320
 which is an exercise of 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.140
 archie recognized opinion here they plant growth 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.240
 do not give rise and took control group 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:16.010
 swimmers of the same age 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.860
 well and for two years were carried out 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.440
 all kinds of x-ray 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.470
 tomographic medical all 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.590
 research verification but any 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.090
 deviations 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:34.290
 no two groups were identified 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.130
 weightlifting swimmers developed in general 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.250
 equally that is to say breathing heart 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.910
 by height 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.989
 it didn't depend on a particular choice 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.280
 sports but only from any 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:54.110
 individual features well here we are 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.110
 now try the weight bench 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.160
 to visualize 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.319
 he owes a little but nevertheless he does not 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.120
 I started doing it so long ago 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.150
 took gyaru 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.750
 in general, he will be 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.600
 hope he does not give up the results will 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.669
 i think no i'm sure he will get 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.900
 normal development and iron sport 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.900
 no effect on growth 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:46.009
 jim ate you look at the growth and 

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:48.379
 not at all affected his growth I think 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.179
 such a common misconception 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.179
 not even worth considering
