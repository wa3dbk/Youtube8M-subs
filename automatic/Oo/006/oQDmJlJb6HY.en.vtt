00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you guys what I think so first off the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.850 
you guys what I think so first off the
game<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.670> using<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.119> id<00:01:30.329> Tech<00:01:30.900> 5<00:01:31.259> engine

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
game will be using the id Tech 5 engine

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890 
game will be using the id Tech 5 engine
so<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.579> an<00:01:32.759> engine<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.119> Bethesda<00:01:33.630> has<00:01:33.750> been

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
so this is an engine I Bethesda has been

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.670 
so this is an engine I Bethesda has been
using<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.860> used<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.369> doomed<00:01:35.759> for

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
using is going to be used on doomed for

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.620 
using is going to be used on doomed for
Wolfenstein<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.070> noon<00:01:38.250> Wolfenstein<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.509> new

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
Wolfenstein the noon Wolfenstein the new

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.109 
Wolfenstein the noon Wolfenstein the new
order<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:41.040> evil<00:01:41.310> within<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.939> being

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
order and the evil within so it's being

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.020 
order and the evil within so it's being
used<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.170> Thesz<00:01:43.409> does<00:01:43.740> sort<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.820> new

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
used on all of a Thesz does sort of new

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.969 
used on all of a Thesz does sort of new
games<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:45.930> makes<00:01:46.110> sense<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.740> used

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
games so what makes sense if it was used

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.249 
games so what makes sense if it was used
on<00:01:47.100> dishonored<00:01:47.640> not<00:01:48.540> necessarily<00:01:49.140> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
on dishonored not necessarily that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.440 
on dishonored not necessarily that
dishonor<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.860> being<00:01:50.100> made<00:01:50.280> by<00:01:50.460> Bethesda<00:01:51.030> but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
dishonor is being made by Bethesda but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.929 
dishonor is being made by Bethesda but
Bethesda<00:01:51.990> definitely<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.530> being<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> part

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
Bethesda definitely is being is a part

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.240 
Bethesda definitely is being is a part
of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> development<00:01:54.630> process<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.100> would

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
of the development process so it would

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.039 
of the development process so it would
definitely<00:01:56.460> make<00:01:56.670> sense<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.719> were<00:01:57.780> using

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
definitely make sense if they were using

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.230 
definitely make sense if they were using
their<00:01:58.320> engine<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.759> being<00:01:59.909> said<00:02:00.030> I

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
their engine so with that being said I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.600 
their engine so with that being said I
would<00:02:00.540> speculate<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:02.009> new<00:02:02.130> dishonored

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
would speculate that the new dishonored

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.969 
would speculate that the new dishonored
will<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.090> better<00:02:03.780> graphics<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> old<00:02:04.770> one

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
will have better graphics on the old one

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.069 
will have better graphics on the old one
I<00:02:05.189> think<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.700> will<00:02:05.759> look<00:02:06.000> at<00:02:06.180> least<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.659> good<00:02:06.840> as

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
I think it will look at least as good as

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.260 
I think it will look at least as good as
the<00:02:07.409> clips<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.009> Wolfenstein<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> evil

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
the clips on Wolfenstein and the evil

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.710 
the clips on Wolfenstein and the evil
within<00:02:09.390> we've<00:02:09.720> seen<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.349> better

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
within we've seen if not better

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.980 
within we've seen if not better
so<00:02:11.680> next<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.610> factsheets<00:02:13.480> ended<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> game

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
so next the factsheets ended the game

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.170 
so next the factsheets ended the game
would<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> new<00:02:14.500> location<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:16.030> I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
would have a new location and like I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.140 
would have a new location and like I
said<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.780> going<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.020> be<00:02:17.110> tevia<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.670> also

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
said that is going to be tevia and also

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.090 
said that is going to be tevia and also
a<00:02:19.180> new<00:02:19.390> main<00:02:19.570> character<00:02:20.140> no<00:02:20.470> more<00:02:20.620> information

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
a new main character no more information

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.070 
a new main character no more information
about<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.340> we're<00:02:22.330> going<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:22.600> new<00:02:22.870> and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080

get access to the doom 4 beta so that

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.480 
get access to the doom 4 beta so that
was<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> lot<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.140> information<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.980> drop<00:02:45.190> really

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
was a lot of information to drop really

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.940 
was a lot of information to drop really
quick<00:02:45.670> but<00:02:45.820> let<00:02:45.970> me<00:02:46.000> go<00:02:46.180> back<00:02:46.209> over<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:46.990> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
quick but let me go back over it so the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.800 
quick but let me go back over it so the
engine<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.520> pretty<00:02:48.730> much<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:49.209> pretty<00:02:49.420> much<00:02:49.510> went

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
engine is pretty much I pretty much went

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.720 
engine is pretty much I pretty much went
over<00:02:50.080> all<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.560> let's<00:02:51.190> talk<00:02:51.340> about<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.610> new

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
over all that let's talk about the new

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.630 
over all that let's talk about the new
location<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.540> like<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:52.959> said<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.400> going<00:02:54.580> to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
location so like I said that is going to

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.760 
location so like I said that is going to
be<00:02:54.730> TV<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.240> if<00:02:55.510> all<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:55.990> is<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.350> be<00:02:56.470> believed

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
be TV I if all this is to be believed

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.680 
be TV I if all this is to be believed
and<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.010> think<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:58.030> fact<00:02:58.240> that<00:02:58.360> the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
and I think it is the fact that the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.900 
and I think it is the fact that the
leaked<00:02:59.230> poster<00:02:59.860> we<00:02:59.980> got<00:03:00.160> matches<00:03:00.610> up<00:03:00.760> with

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
leaked poster we got matches up with

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.790 
leaked poster we got matches up with
this<00:03:01.030> leaked<00:03:01.300> fact<00:03:01.600> sheet<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.050> makes<00:03:02.470> sense<00:03:02.650> to

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
this leaked fact sheet it makes sense to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.350 
this leaked fact sheet it makes sense to
me<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.190> definitely<00:03:03.459> think<00:03:03.850> both<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.120> these

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
me and I definitely think both of these

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.020 
me and I definitely think both of these
are<00:03:04.540> legit<00:03:04.930> sources<00:03:05.440> um<00:03:05.730> we're<00:03:06.730> also<00:03:06.850> gonna

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
are legit sources um we're also gonna

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.390 
are legit sources um we're also gonna
have<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.240> new<00:03:07.360> main<00:03:07.540> character<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.040> Corvo

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
have a new main character so the Corvo

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.920 
have a new main character so the Corvo
is<00:03:09.520> not<00:03:09.700> going<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.880> return<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.240> think<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.810> was

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
is not going to return I think that was

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.050 
is not going to return I think that was
a<00:03:10.959> really<00:03:11.140> good<00:03:11.470> choice<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:12.040> think<00:03:12.880> we<00:03:12.940> pretty

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
a really good choice I think we pretty

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.550 
a really good choice I think we pretty
much<00:03:13.180> got<00:03:13.480> all<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.720> coro<00:03:13.959> story<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.500> don't

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
much got all the coro story I don't

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.890 
much got all the coro story I don't
think<00:03:14.800> we<00:03:14.890> need<00:03:15.010> anything<00:03:15.280> else<00:03:15.519> from<00:03:15.640> him<00:03:15.900> new

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
think we need anything else from him new

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.810 
think we need anything else from him new
and<00:03:17.080> updated<00:03:17.200> powers<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.130> we're<00:03:18.519> going<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.700> see

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
and updated powers so we're going to see

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.160 
and updated powers so we're going to see
some<00:03:18.940> new<00:03:19.090> powers<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.750> they're<00:03:19.870> also<00:03:19.989> going

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
some new powers and they're also going

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.650 
some new powers and they're also going
to<00:03:20.230> update<00:03:20.590> some<00:03:20.769> powers<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.910> think<00:03:22.300> kind<00:03:22.540> of

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
to update some powers so think kind of

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.840 
to update some powers so think kind of
like<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.140> 2d<00:03:23.620> LCS<00:03:24.010> we<00:03:24.160> got<00:03:24.340> for<00:03:24.550> this<00:03:24.670> honor

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
like the 2d LCS we got for this honor

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.640 
like the 2d LCS we got for this honor
the<00:03:25.120> two-story<00:03:25.630> DLCs<00:03:26.170> where<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.410> play<00:03:26.590> this

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
the two-story DLCs where you play this

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.120 
the two-story DLCs where you play this
dog<00:03:27.090> we<00:03:28.090> got<00:03:28.330> some<00:03:28.690> new<00:03:28.870> powers<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:29.739> also<00:03:29.920> they

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
dog we got some new powers but also they

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.770 
dog we got some new powers but also they
updated<00:03:30.489> some<00:03:30.700> powers<00:03:31.030> like<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.209> blink<00:03:31.600> I

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
updated some powers like the blink I

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.720 
updated some powers like the blink I
think<00:03:31.959> we're<00:03:32.080> going<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.260> get<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.769> lot<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.370> stuff

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
think we're going to get a lot of stuff

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.190 
think we're going to get a lot of stuff

like that and I think it will remind us
a<00:03:35.350> lot<00:03:35.610> like<00:03:36.610> how<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.880> change<00:03:37.360> was<00:03:37.540> made<00:03:37.600> from

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
plays out maybe the outsider does

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.890 
plays out maybe the outsider does
something<00:04:12.220> wrong<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.640> him<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:13.000> don't<00:04:13.840> know

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
something wrong to him I don't know

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.240 
something wrong to him I don't know
we'll<00:04:14.049> just<00:04:14.080> have<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.470> wait<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.709> see<00:04:14.920> but

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
we'll just have to wait and see but

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.740 
we'll just have to wait and see but
definitely<00:04:15.970> an<00:04:16.060> interesting<00:04:16.330> feature

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
definitely an interesting feature

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.690 
definitely an interesting feature
especially<00:04:17.200> something<00:04:17.890> really<00:04:18.459> interesting

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
especially something really interesting

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.880 
especially something really interesting
to<00:04:19.030> put<00:04:19.209> on<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.510> fact<00:04:19.750> sheet<00:04:20.020> which<00:04:20.530> makes<00:04:20.739> me

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
to put on the fact sheet which makes me

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.110 
to put on the fact sheet which makes me
think<00:04:20.919> that<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.310> whole<00:04:21.520> story<00:04:21.849> is<00:04:21.970> about

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
think that the whole story is about

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.670 
think that the whole story is about
trying<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.690> take<00:04:22.900> out<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.200> outside

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
trying to take out the outside

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.370 
trying to take out the outside
uh<00:04:23.949> we<00:04:24.850> did<00:04:25.060> you<00:04:25.539> get<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.810> see<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.139> there<00:04:26.289> will

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
uh we did you get to see that there will

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.680 
uh we did you get to see that there will
be<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.530> versus<00:04:27.009> multiplayer<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.330> probably

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
be a versus multiplayer so probably

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.900 
be a versus multiplayer so probably
something<00:04:29.050> like<00:04:29.080> if<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.770> think<00:04:30.039> the<00:04:30.699> done

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
something like if you think the done

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.240 
something like if you think the done
well<00:04:31.150> trials<00:04:31.539> dlc<00:04:32.080> if<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:32.650> guys<00:04:32.800> think<00:04:32.830> about

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
well trials dlc if you guys think about

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.340 
well trials dlc if you guys think about
the<00:04:33.639> back<00:04:33.940> street<00:04:34.539> brawl<00:04:34.840> or<00:04:34.870> something<00:04:35.259> like

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
the back street brawl or something like

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.779 
the back street brawl or something like
that<00:04:35.410> where<00:04:36.039> it's<00:04:36.220> kind<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.400> an<00:04:36.490> enclosed

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
that where it's kind of an enclosed

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.400 
that where it's kind of an enclosed
arena<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.479> think<00:04:37.750> it'll<00:04:37.870> definitely<00:04:38.139> be

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
arena I think it'll definitely be

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.499 
arena I think it'll definitely be
something<00:04:38.800> like<00:04:39.039> that<00:04:39.310> how<00:04:39.789> they<00:04:40.060> incorporate

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
something like that how they incorporate

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.870 
something like that how they incorporate
stealth<00:04:41.289> into<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.770> I'm<00:04:42.039> interested<00:04:42.729> to<00:04:42.759> see

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
stealth into that I'm interested to see

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.450 
stealth into that I'm interested to see
but<00:04:43.810> definitely<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.199> nice<00:04:44.410> feature<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:45.070> really

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
but definitely a nice feature I really

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.920 
but definitely a nice feature I really
hope<00:04:45.580> they<00:04:45.759> focus<00:04:46.210> on<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.419> story<00:04:46.720> though

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
hope they focus on the story though

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.749 
hope they focus on the story though
because<00:04:47.110> obviously<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.650> story<00:04:47.919> is<00:04:48.220> the

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
because obviously the story is the

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.820 
because obviously the story is the
biggest<00:04:49.120> part<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.509> Dishonored<00:04:50.020> so<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.710> I

pretty much all of the platforms that
are<00:04:58.750> being<00:04:58.990> used<00:04:59.229> and<00:04:59.500> also<00:05:00.130> will<00:05:00.520> have<00:05:00.729> a<00:05:00.759> 2016

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
are being used and also will have a 2016

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.420 
are being used and also will have a 2016
release<00:05:01.870> date<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:02.349> it's<00:05:02.560> kind<00:05:03.039> of<00:05:03.070> weird<00:05:03.340> that

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
release date so it's kind of weird that

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.939 
release date so it's kind of weird that
they<00:05:03.639> would<00:05:03.759> announce<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.210> at<00:05:04.360> e3<00:05:04.599> of<00:05:05.020> 2014<00:05:05.770> i

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
they would announce that at e3 of 2014 i

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.439 
they would announce that at e3 of 2014 i
would<00:05:06.099> expect<00:05:06.250> them<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.669> wait<00:05:06.789> probably<00:05:07.000> till

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
would expect them to wait probably till

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.620 
would expect them to wait probably till
2015<00:05:08.220> but<00:05:09.220> maybe<00:05:09.669> and<00:05:10.150> this<00:05:10.300> is<00:05:10.479> just

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
2015 but maybe and this is just

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.540 
2015 but maybe and this is just
completely<00:05:10.949> speculation<00:05:11.949> on<00:05:12.009> my<00:05:12.130> part<00:05:12.160> i'm

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
completely speculation on my part i'm

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.430 
completely speculation on my part i'm
thinking<00:05:13.060> maybe<00:05:13.180> it<00:05:13.449> might<00:05:13.570> be<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.750> larger<00:05:14.199> game

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
thinking maybe it might be a larger game

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.260 
thinking maybe it might be a larger game
people<00:05:15.340> who<00:05:15.400> are<00:05:15.520> making<00:05:15.669> larger<00:05:16.090> game

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
people who are making larger game

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.999 
people who are making larger game
sometimes<00:05:16.720> like<00:05:17.020> to<00:05:17.169> get<00:05:17.349> the<00:05:17.440> name<00:05:17.620> out<00:05:17.770> there

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
sometimes like to get the name out there

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.040 
sometimes like to get the name out there
and<00:05:18.160> floating<00:05:18.520> around<00:05:18.580> so<00:05:19.479> i<00:05:19.539> think<00:05:19.630> it<00:05:19.840> might

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
and floating around so i think it might

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.080 
and floating around so i think it might
be<00:05:20.080> a<00:05:20.259> larger<00:05:20.770> game<00:05:20.979> then<00:05:21.250> the<00:05:21.490> first<00:05:21.729> decide

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
be a larger game then the first decide

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.909 
be a larger game then the first decide
but<00:05:22.840> we're<00:05:22.990> really<00:05:23.199> going<00:05:23.380> to<00:05:23.440> have<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.620> see

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
but we're really going to have to see

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.400
