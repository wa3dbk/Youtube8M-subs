00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 we started painting the first segment very 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.680
 black color is obtained but the paint 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.160
 absolutely not stink and very fast 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.000
 dries it comfortably enough means gay 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.429
 what paint 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.070
 worth buying we were buying paint in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.470
 lerua merlen is not cheap enough 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.380
 there are 9 liters of paint cost us 5000 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.029
 rubles but here what is the essence here 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.740
 quite an expensive base for paint 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.929
 that is, it is white of some such 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.829
 translucent color there they have 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.739
 tinting service that is, you have chosen 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.059
 it is the color in this case black and they 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.730
 there literally 5 minutes 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.129
 special in the car shake and all this 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.899
 and got coal on black paint you 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.450
 accordingly you can choose any 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.149
 another color is gray there is light gray dark 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.510
 gray and so on but we still color 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:00.809
 Like of course there will be a black studio 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.170
 box but we'll see and therefore 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.360
 my friends write in the comments worth 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.280
 whether to paint black color e or maybe 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.659
 It is worth then repaint in perspective 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
 in some no more neutral gray 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.560
 so that not so dismally write we 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.560
 waiting for your advice 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.450
 and so here is the paint itself here it is for her 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.140
 Will the paint roll out as usual here 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.170
 no repair school needed 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.320
 and since we have enough 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.740
 re here we just added 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.670
 fluid would always tell when a 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.179
 crush it fast enough so 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:54.640
 way we start the whole thing 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:54.640
 rolling over all pink 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:10.039
 nothing complicated principle for so today 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.840
 we finished painting painted over everything 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.810
 crayons corner and that's what we did 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.640
 that's all 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.060
 aquazone ie this is the word of the border 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.040
 and all that farther we have aquazone but she 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.829
 as a matter of fact from the film crew 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.019
 turned out to be a black square for now 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.840
 Of course the studio is not ready yet far 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.950
 there 's a lot more to do here 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.269
 modifying this one just don't be 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.769
 there will be clean space and only 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.660
 pantographs light everything can be mine 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.540
 dear readers someone has experience 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.430

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.060
 by some 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.100
 moments that were initially not well 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.670
 you know some kind of pitfalls and so 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.780
 further for example now 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.470
 I have no idea how to mount 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.620
 the system 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.450

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.180

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.660
 which are now at the stage of establishment, we have 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.690
 can not know about you as you have 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.510
