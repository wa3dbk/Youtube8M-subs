because I'm treating them with copper

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.510 
because I'm treating them with copper
fungicide<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:32.159> copper<00:01:33.119> fungicide<00:01:33.439> spray<00:01:34.520> not

fungicide a copper fungicide spray not
the<00:01:35.729> dust<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.170> mix<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
then every two weeks spray the tomato

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.219 
then every two weeks spray the tomato
plants<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.590> these<00:01:50.430> plants
