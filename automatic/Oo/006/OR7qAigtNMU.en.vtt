I'll<00:00:43.850> show<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:44.300> how<00:00:44.949> briefly<00:00:45.949> to<00:00:46.670> do<00:00:46.820> that

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
I'll show you how briefly to do that

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.700 
I'll show you how briefly to do that
here<00:00:48.019> so<00:00:48.769> what<00:00:49.550> we<00:00:49.640> need<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:49.879> do<00:00:50.000> is<00:00:50.530> plug<00:00:51.530> each

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
here so what we need to do is plug each

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.939

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.340 
the hard drive out I've left the battery
in<00:01:02.440> next<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.649> bias<00:01:03.890> battery<00:01:04.990> is<00:01:05.990> going<00:01:06.259> to

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
in next to the bias battery is going to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.020 
in next to the bias battery is going to
be<00:01:06.410> hard<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:06.710> see<00:01:06.950> because<00:01:07.009> this<00:01:07.430> camera's<00:01:07.910> not

model

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.250 

now<00:01:30.660> I've<00:01:31.140> made<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.820> jumper<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.930> bits<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
now I've made the jumper out of bits of

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.620 
now I've made the jumper out of bits of
wire<00:01:35.120> to<00:01:36.120> paperclip<00:01:37.490> okay<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.450> need

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
wire to paperclip okay and what we need

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.900 
wire to paperclip okay and what we need
to<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.870> is<00:01:40.700> tip<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> laptop<00:01:42.120> on<00:01:42.300> its<00:01:42.480> side<00:01:43.910> open

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
to do is tip the laptop on its side open

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:54.320 
to do is tip the laptop on its side open
halfway<00:01:48.290> like<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:52.820> flip<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.910> over<00:01:54.060> because

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
halfway like some flip it over because

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.670 
halfway like some flip it over because
it<00:01:54.450> makes<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> easier<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.230> switches<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.620> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
it makes it easier the switches at the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.760 
it makes it easier the switches at the
top<00:01:57.710> holding<00:01:59.600> this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> tricky<00:02:01.200> part<00:02:01.230> you've

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
top holding this is a tricky part you've

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.020 
top holding this is a tricky part you've
got<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.920> whole<00:02:02.190> arc<00:02:02.780> these<00:02:03.780> two<00:02:04.520> top<00:02:05.520> ones<00:02:08.030> hold

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
got a whole arc these two top ones hold

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.630 
got a whole arc these two top ones hold
it<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.270> place<00:02:11.330> turn<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> laptop<00:02:12.630> on<00:02:12.930> the
