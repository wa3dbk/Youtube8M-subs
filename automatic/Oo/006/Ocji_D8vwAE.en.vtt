00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 if I think that new we have advanced 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.140
 very much and that for 7 years that 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.780
 we have been doing culture campaigns 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.300
 citizen has already been reflected in 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.490
 this has been a very big support both 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.920
 of the mayor's office as the authority for 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 example in the perception of culture 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.949
 citizen was very important 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.170
 I understand that there were only two 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 homicides against 15 the previous year the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.849
 accident rate fell 65% with the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.099
 culture campaign of the liquor theme 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.170
 foam we have not been able to eradicate the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.950
 went down a little they are respecting more so 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.579
 least do not throw environment you are already seeing 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.500
 the carnival as something less fun 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.420
 less drinks and those campaigns have to give 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.340
 result is more culture is more 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.739
 tradition all the campaigns are giving 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.200
 results I think that in that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 aspect not because the carnival is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.090
 precisely the territory where 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.000
 they bring together all social classes 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.640
 if the hoist call the fact of having to 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.620
 charge a ticket office on track 40 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.710
 example in the headlights in a need 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.540
 extreme cases that is to say the contribution of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.030
 district at this time is only the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.220
 use of public space that represents 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.620
 a 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.080
 you are very big on the subject of finance 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.130
 for us we do not have our 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.230
 requirement the pri there is no contribution 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.690
 official if you ask me which one 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.010
 would be your ideal carnival my carnival 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.280
 ideal would be a carnival in which what 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.200
 will parade practically trailers and they 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.880
 I confess that the trailer we removed it from 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.350
 the guacherna at the expense of a result 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.810
 negative in the economic part but for 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.840
 example in the battle of flowers 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.630
 yes, while we are 60% 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.979
 in commercial hands in the hands of 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.020
 consell sponsors to which 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.910
 We appreciate very much because there are some 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.590
 who have more than marketing management 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.510
 culturally as I respect but there are others 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.729
 no, and we have regulations in the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.190
 moment we pass the three brothers 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.380
 but the majority of a silver that 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.090
 comes from the public sector and the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.770
 ticket sales would think that 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.780
 we could make all the changes that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.280
 we want to be with carnival like I eat 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.740
 Folk groups define first 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.770
 but if I have a commitment that 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.990
 meet the lord who paid for a trailer 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.000
 that dances in the flower boot and that 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.740
 style is they represent us almost 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.470
 900 million pesos 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.540
 as I do to sustain the channel as 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.640
 I do to pay more than 300 million in 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.350
 bathrooms that you have to have a will 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.450
 very big policy you have to give it a 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.700
 I overturn the budget we are working 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.620
 with doctor elsa noguera long ago 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.360
 hand in fact for the mayor and 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.190
 the doctor list is the president of the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.170
 our board are working hand in hand 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.360
 but it is to make an appropriation of 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.010
 district budget exclusively 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.020
 for the Carnival of Barranquilla I will 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.700
 I give an example the grass carnival is 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.710
 a small carnival is done with four 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.150
 one billion pesos of those four thousand 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.370
 millions almost three thousand five hundred us 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.170
 contributes the district because we are 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.060
 aware that it is a public holiday 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.880
 that is being handled by an entity that 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.500
 is public and private and precisely this 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.930
 this private audience he is what gives him 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.640
 the speed to a decision making in 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.380
 carnival for a popular action that 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.720
 he chose many, many years but he did more 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.040
 damage is going to be the carnival in which no 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.530
 we are allowed to use the foundation 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.000
 Carnival but now anyone by 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.100
 We can not establish a single agreement 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.590
 of the Ministry of Culture or with the 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.790
 mayor then these monies also 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.620
 coming of resources for 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.180
 doers have to have a process 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.130
 very big and not supporting them with the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.480
 speed that we doing that I 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.590
 I think the first the first challenge that 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.360
 operates the carnival foundation of 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.220
 barranquilla that's one thing that 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.410
 we two years ago really we 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.870
 is quite paralyzed and for the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.660
 doers is not good the second challenge is 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.640
 work in the public sector the part 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.500
 of political will to be able to give 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.660
 good resource for the holidays so 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.690
 have to resort to marketing 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.060
 private sponsors or at least 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.250
 and the sponsorships become a 20 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.110
 or 30 percent because I think it's 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.020
 viable and it is very easy to work 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.050
 there is another challenge that was the potholes 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.810
 I was here is a retouch 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.660
 that has not been able or is sometimes that 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.250
 improvement in the new bucket guacherna 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.870
 usually when the group the public 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.730
 have a music workshop in front for 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.070
 because the sound of them does not let go their 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.750
 music in 100 the first booty the second 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.780
 reason is if is the television guayos 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.060
 photographer for all for because all 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.760
 they're going to be the big motives show 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.500
 that could be solved by putting strawberry 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.390
 and therefore telecaribe at the end of 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.790
 deficit as are the juries that 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.920
 we try to do that other big challenge 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.990
 of the potholes there is another very big challenge 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.320
 that the the rest to work known in 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.240
 the carnival 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.520
 to dignify him I told him that 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.300
 social program that we have every year 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.890
 and encouraging them to turn them around a lot 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.620
 more part of the party has already been done 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.570
 a lot we went from 380 million to a thousand 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.330
 million the stimulus folder in the 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.890
 span of these six years and the other challenge 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.900
 is to work the infrastructure of the 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.430
 city work we have 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.830
 really start working from now 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.300
 so that they have a decent site so 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.980
 unless you can do the contests 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.930
 where you can make a festival of 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.420
 orchestras where the entire city can 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.560
 put 20,000 spectators there is no 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.720
 site where there may be 20,000 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.300
 spectators seated then in session of the 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.240
 metropolitan stadium that are not going 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.970
 to lend because it's for bigger events 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.460
 of soccer specifically was losing 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.160
 the player let's say so we will 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.190
 we raised the theme of the pongos but 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.170
 hit bottom at the 2014 carnival in the 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.670
 5,000 people attended 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.500
 we started the alarms we started 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.660
 do a study that I wanted people 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.210
 I wanted to talk about this the festival and 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.980
 we found something very important and it is the 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.780
 Large country competition and events 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.720
 large in canyon legs 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.760
 on Monday then as the festival 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.400
 vallenato also had to resort to 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.230
 bring an international carving artist 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.430
 international to do a show and 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.590
 present the rest of the thing and 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.970
 logically this artist we could 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.919
 bring this year with a very sponsorship 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.470
 big we do not have the resources 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.090
 nor are we going to pay an artist where all 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.240
 the other musicians are going to achieve the 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.240
 festival
