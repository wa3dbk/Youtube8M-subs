 hello guys today we are with you 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.320
 continue familiarity with the environment 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.279
 performer robot 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:18.160
 and study the team while opening on 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.850
 desktop folder with l2 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.660
 we find 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.630
 farig with the name of the robot with the image 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.240
 such an icon or application like it 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.700
 we can learn by double clicking the left 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.630
 the mouse buttons agree with everyone 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.780
 conditions 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.370
 provided it means if we have 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 pops up some extra windows 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.090
 if we do not have an additional window 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.470
 pops up and immediately loading 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 applications this is also acceptable after 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.140
 how are we loaded 1 maze we are with you 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.780
 must load the main part and three 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 labyrinth or is our task for you 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.580
 this we press the button 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.580
 the maze 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.579
 on the desktop as we already know 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.060
 desktop you can go with you 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:16.380
 key pressing a few times we 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.130
 select again folder adj 2 here from 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.920
 all daddies 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.619
 using the scroll bar 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 Left mouse button open approx 2 in 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.619
 folder limit 2 is located the other three 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.110
 folders or territories means we need 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.409
 maz directory 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.210
 MAZ double click of the left mouse button 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.100
 We also find this on the task 43 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.920
 so in this task just we can 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.310
 use cycle 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.310
 until 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.750
 let's say my machine is right here 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.420
 that is, our robot gazes when 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.130
 help arrow we see up 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.710
 or here we can see from the rear 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.530
 signal light and we need 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.520
 check the next cell and not yet 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 wall he will have us do the next 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.800
 step that is forward 1 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.460
 as soon as he reaches the wall that is 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.050
 conditions 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:20.590
 until a wall ahead 1 will be 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.960
 reached he must turn right 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.670
 that is, as soon as the wall appears he 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.580
 from turn to the right, they 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.860
 going forward or in this case when 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.030
 turn he will have to turn 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.270
 inside this cell further to reach 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.930
 up to the base here it is marked with a letter 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.190
 n he must check the conditions that is 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.170
 if the left wall we will of course be 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.390
 move forward note if 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.720
 He is already on the base and also check 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.850
 conditions if the left wall is then again 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.040
 take a step right in this cell and it turns out 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.750
 here means we need we need 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.410
 will write one unit program 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.380
 back one here with my program 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.500
 ready so I'll just show you 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.739
 will have to write it yourself 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.590
 don't write anything in the notebook yet 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.870
 let's you and I see, and so long as 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.870
 ahead is free here are our conditions 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.629
 he will step forward forward 1 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.970
 the whole team is recorded as you 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.349
 you know, we have the whole program here 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.019
 such braces 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.730
 and the team ends with a certain 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.569
 familiar 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.860
 this is our comma in this case 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.099
 mean so far ahead he will 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.230
 perform period one ahead are free in 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.540
 period one ahead is free ahead 1 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.280
 again if free ahead also 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.959
 run before one check 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.739
 next key ahead free yes 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.190
 for a long time and does not step to check this key 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.830
 walk me 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.650
 so check ahead freely 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.710
 but it turns out that he can't step 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.520
 give means the conditions are not met 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.760
 then he proceeds to the next step 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.910
 step it will be a turn to the right it was 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.530
 unfold here in this cage 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.530
 let us just see now 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.890
 so he turned around and begin to check 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.770
 The following conditions are left on the left 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.960
 us to the left of the robot the wall the robot goes 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.290
 here, respectively, look here and this 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.100
 wall it is located to his left side 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.780
 he will fulfill the conditions ahead 1 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.110
 but how can you agree or say he 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.510
 we have 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.940
 walks into this cell now he is fast 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.730
 just drove but when he reached here 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:56.020
 this cell, he took a step back rear 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:59.230
 move back one here 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.300
 just try to look to restore 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.460
 our program, we can 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.750
 way to stop the labyrinth robot 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.750
 indicates the initial position 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.690
 the base stays in place let's see 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.600
 once again here we have in these procedures and 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.389
 perform one step at a time 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:25.129
 let's see the first condition so far 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:27.440
 ahead free please go ahead 1 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:30.260
 checked 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.170
 as well to the left the wall again before 1 and 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.050
 immediately look back 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.950
 let's see this step here back he 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.660
 took a step back all the program is complete 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.450
 here we stand on this cell 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.470
 return maze starting position 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.470
 watch the program entirely 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.360
 so although there is no open we will not 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.889
 watch the program entirely 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.539
 please the robot did not come to the base 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.639
 why because my cursor is where 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:03.229
 end of the program means we must 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:06.330
 put it at the beginning we put it first 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.930
 we start the robot the robot has come 1 2 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.300
 the problem is solved correctly the robot executed 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.550
 the current creation has returned to base and so 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.159
 task completed 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.310
 we made our program means yours 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.180
 the task is now to write to my notebook 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.990
 this one 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.990
 about
