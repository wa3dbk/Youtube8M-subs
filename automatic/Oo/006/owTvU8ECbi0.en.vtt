00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you know keep skating I think that's the

you know keep skating I think that's the
biggest<00:00:37.050> thing<00:00:37.200> over<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.680> got<00:00:37.829> to

yeah<00:01:52.290> exactly<00:01:52.409> i<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:52.950> that's<00:01:53.130> huge<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.460> i

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
yeah exactly i think that's huge and i

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490 
yeah exactly i think that's huge and i
came<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.970> came<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.450> yesterday<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.079> three<00:01:55.439> or

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
came in came in yesterday so I three or

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260 
came in came in yesterday so I three or
three<00:01:55.890> or<00:01:55.950> four<00:01:56.130> days<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.579> kind<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
three or four days here to kind of get a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.700 
three or four days here to kind of get a
customer<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> time<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.049> get<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> legs<00:01:58.380> going
