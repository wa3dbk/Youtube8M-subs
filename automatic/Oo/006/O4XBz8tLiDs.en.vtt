00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
i still get the weight up i still

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.190 
i still get the weight up i still
complete<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.710> rep<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.700> again<00:01:48.000> i<00:01:48.420> was<00:01:48.990> putting

i'm doing a smith machine bent row this
is<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> little<00:02:26.010> bit<00:02:26.100> more<00:02:26.280> strict<00:02:26.670> version<00:02:26.900> of

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
is a little bit more strict version of

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.500 
is a little bit more strict version of
the<00:02:28.170> row<00:02:28.350> then<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.250> saw<00:02:29.460> last<00:02:29.880> week<00:02:30.270> when<00:02:30.450> i

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the row then you saw last week when i

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.860 
the row then you saw last week when i
put<00:02:30.690> my<00:02:30.810> back<00:02:31.020> video<00:02:31.380> up<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:33.330> Smith<00:02:33.570> Machine<00:02:33.600> I

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
put my back video up the Smith Machine I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.120 
put my back video up the Smith Machine I
like<00:02:34.140> because<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.530> could<00:02:34.650> put<00:02:34.770> my<00:02:34.800> center<00:02:35.100> of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
like because I could put my center of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.190 
like because I could put my center of
gravity<00:02:35.190> back<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.180> then<00:02:36.360> pull<00:02:36.630> my<00:02:36.870> center<00:02:37.170> of

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
gravity back and then pull my center of

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.350 
gravity back and then pull my center of
gravity<00:02:37.320> forward<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.790> I'm<00:02:39.060> really

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
gravity forward so that I'm really

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.750 
gravity forward so that I'm really
getting<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.750> barbell<00:02:40.200> deep<00:02:40.890> into<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> hip

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
forward on my toes I'm keeping my upper

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.460 
forward on my toes I'm keeping my upper
torso<00:03:08.310> at<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.460> 45<00:03:08.910> degree<00:03:08.940> angle<00:03:09.320> push<00:03:10.320> it

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
torso at a 45 degree angle push it

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.180

and<00:03:14.450> then<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.900> workout<00:03:16.230> was<00:03:16.380> pretty<00:03:16.620> low

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
and then this workout was pretty low

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.650 
and then this workout was pretty low
volume<00:03:17.340> as<00:03:17.910> opposed<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.330> some<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.630> other

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
volume as opposed to some of the other

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.120 
volume as opposed to some of the other
workouts<00:03:19.050> you<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.200> see<00:03:19.470> me<00:03:19.650> deal<00:03:19.800> with<00:03:19.950> high

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
workouts you can see me deal with high

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.980 
workouts you can see me deal with high
volume<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.360> change<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.750> up<00:03:21.870> a

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
volume this is just to change it up a

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.960 
volume this is just to change it up a
little<00:03:22.020> bit<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.530> did<00:03:22.950> more<00:03:23.130> sets<00:03:23.430> than<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:23.730> on

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
little bit I did more sets than this on

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.270 
little bit I did more sets than this on
the<00:03:24.060> single<00:03:24.660> arm<00:03:24.810> dumbbell<00:03:25.230> row<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:26.130> is

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
the single arm dumbbell row but this is

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.040 
the single arm dumbbell row but this is
the<00:03:26.400> only<00:03:26.430> one<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:26.910> actually<00:03:27.090> got<00:03:27.570> good<00:03:27.810> film

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
the only one that actually got good film

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.620 
the only one that actually got good film
footage<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:28.740> is<00:03:28.860> with<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> 200<00:03:29.400> pound
