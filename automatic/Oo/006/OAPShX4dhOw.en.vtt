00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
Michael Keaton has a little less to do

Michael Keaton has a little less to do
on<00:03:44.310> camera<00:03:44.640> here<00:03:45.120> than<00:03:45.300> in<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.540> first<00:03:45.750> Batman

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050

on camera here than in the first Batman
film<00:03:46.560> but<00:03:47.280> his<00:03:47.400> portrayal<00:03:47.820> Batman<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.420> still

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
film but his portrayal Batman is still

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.900 
film but his portrayal Batman is still
the<00:03:48.720> best<00:03:48.960> of<00:03:49.200> my<00:03:49.350> eyes<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:50.220> seems<00:03:50.550> that<00:03:50.700> he<00:03:50.880> is

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
the best of my eyes it seems that he is

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.610 
the best of my eyes it seems that he is
Batman<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.750> Bruce<00:03:51.870> Wayne<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.380> just<00:03:52.470> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
Batman and Bruce Wayne is just the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.590 
Batman and Bruce Wayne is just the
character<00:03:53.010> he<00:03:53.070> has<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.340> play<00:03:53.490> in<00:03:53.610> public<00:03:53.760> which

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
character he has to play in public which

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.030 
character he has to play in public which
is<00:03:54.630> why<00:03:54.870> he<00:03:54.960> makes<00:03:55.110> such<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.350> good<00:03:55.530> match<00:03:55.770> with

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
is why he makes such a good match with

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:08.200 
is why he makes such a good match with
Selina<00:03:56.430> Kyle<00:03:56.730> in<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.030> movie
