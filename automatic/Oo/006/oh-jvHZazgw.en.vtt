video I'll have the scores down in the
bottom<00:01:16.729> corner<00:01:16.789> skate<00:01:17.270> or<00:01:17.770> just<00:01:19.479> going<00:01:20.479> IV<00:01:20.719> to

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
bottom corner skate or just going IV to

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.020 
bottom corner skate or just going IV to
doing<00:01:21.140> some<00:01:21.289> high<00:01:21.439> fives<00:01:21.679> there<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.280> that's

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
doing some high fives there and that's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.940 
doing some high fives there and that's
what<00:01:23.149> we<00:01:23.240> do<00:01:23.329> these<00:01:23.509> in<00:01:23.689> these<00:01:23.780> high<00:01:23.990> throw<00:01:24.259> and

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
what we do these in these high throw and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.139 
what we do these in these high throw and
then<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.759> think<00:01:26.030> oh<00:01:26.210> yeah<00:01:26.659> steal<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.200> club
