00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:09.230
 normally to get a new 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.000
 plant we use reproduction to 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.919
 through seeds but there is another 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.620
 way of doing it that is the reproduction 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.510
 through cuttings for this we take 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.120
 a plant and we cut a part 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.430
 normally a leaf or a stem and 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.040
 we get a genetically 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.200
 equal to the mother plant ie a clone 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.180
 in this way if we are facing 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.970
 a copy as spectacular as this one 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.430
 hibiscus or this rosemary we can obtain and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.740
 have an equal copy in our house 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.900
 that this will come from the next 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.410
 way we will cut in the case of and 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.180
 disqus 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.790
 let's cut a branch 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.110
 with at least 2 outbreaks and respecting 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.600
 polarity of that is very important not 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.989
 we can invest we will proceed to plant 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.510
 we clean it a little bit of everything that are 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.489
 leaves and so on as this does not 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.730
 interesting because it would consume us energy 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.000
 of the plant and we will leave for example 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.660
 a little leaf above that cut through the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.510
 half this outbreak that in principle had 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.600
 genetic information to issue leaves 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.700
 what we are going to do is change the and 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.479
 say no and here I want you to do 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.610
 roots we will help from field in 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.910
 make natural tea a product based 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.680
 of aux in as cyber flours and cytokines 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.899
 which are phytohormones that are the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.610
 responsible for changing that information and 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.750
 tell of this outbreak 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.640
 I want roots we dip to improve the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.000
 dust adhesion 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.270
 and we put together the painted cutting above all 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.250
 through the cutting area we take a stick and 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.740
 in this and this we have previously 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.900
 placed a specific substrate with 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.119
 posadas semilleros something very important 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.700
 also for the success of the cuttings 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.869
 this substrate is worth to make nurseries 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.130
 and also to make cuttings we plant 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.530
 and we cover well 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.990
 in the same way let's do something 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.550
 similar with this rosemary that told you 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.769
 we will cut a rod neither very new nor very 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.170
 old around 10 15 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.200
 centimeters and we will clean the whole sheet 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.930
 of the base because this green material 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.480
 consumes energy and we want this 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.269
 sprout devote all the energy to do 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.599
 roots and generate a new plant and what 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.630
 same wet the wet simply what 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.880
 What it does is favor the adherence of 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.380
 ellen make natural tea make up 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.030
 they make natural tea in addition to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.670
 You can also use cuttings 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.739
 when you pose in seeds when 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.739
 do plantations and transplants 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.360
 we pierce because this way when nailing is not 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.740
 the dust drags us but we have left 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.690
 well attached to the cutting and we cover 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.490
 field in natural ante root in addition to the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.530
 phytohormones mentioned 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.520
 supplemented with micronutrients like 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.780
 copper boron zinc iron or manganese these 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.420
 they are very important because when 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.550
 begin to leave the first roots 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.010
 will serve as a nutrient and food for 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.380
 that they become strong roots by 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.510
 that's very interesting that the three or 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.210
 four first risks that you make of the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.700
 cuttings do it with diluted product 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.000
 a field envelope in they make natural tea 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.280
 diluted in two liters of water and apply 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.890
 for irrigation that are well moist but 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.920
 as always without puddling and nothing else 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.770
 watering heat temperature and you will see how in 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.240
 little time of this copy you will have 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.240
 obtained a new plant
