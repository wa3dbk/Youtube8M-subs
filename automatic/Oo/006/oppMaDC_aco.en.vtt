00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.790
 the comic meaning and here I see you already 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.740
 smile and that's normal because the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.050
 comics has a very bad reputation 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.980
 and we must admit that she is 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.130
 justified 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.260
 the comics years was drawn in a few 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.600
 hours only by a graphic designer who 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.320
 was not specifically a typographer at 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.269
 within microsoft in 1994 is at 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.890
 the origin actually what happened 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.060
 is that there was software that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.189
 was being developed which 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.099
 was called microsoft bob which is a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.540
 software actually for for kids a 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.340
 software with a little dog a little 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.469
 dog in which evolve in a universe 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.180
 very cartoon very cartoon with 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.530
 full of colors so for children and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.940
 the little dog was there to learn 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.809
 to children how to use a 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.600
 computer etc 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 and so it's a pretty educational thing there 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.860
 so there was this seven people who 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.800
 were working at microsoft at the time who 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.690
 is called vincent asshole and this 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.059
 nobody watched the software whose who 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
 was in its development phase and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.289
 realized that the bubbles in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.000
 which dog speak and well the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.700
 text that was in the bubbles was 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.530
 composed in times new novel and there he 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.060
 has said it is weird because the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.640
 times in you man it's a so a 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.110
 very very constructed character and his 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.259
 newspaper character reports what 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.270
 weary enough austere and saclay badly enough 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.890
 which is not wrong with the rest 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.920
 that is to say so very cartoon full of 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.720
 colors etc and so he looked around 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.180
 of him and around him there was 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.259
 a few copies of a comic book 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.259
 american comics 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.659
 watchmen so he watched watchmen he has 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.360
 looked at the lettering of watchmen and there are 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.430
 decide in a few hours to make a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.750
 font of character inspired by the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.700
 lettering of the comic book 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.409
 question except that he just had a good 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.640
 mouse it was a screen not very 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.930
 good quality extra extra and then 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.170
 especially he really did in a few 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.570
 hours 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.119
 so no it's not that good 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.640
 true that it sticks better with the idea 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.820
 the graphic universe of the software so 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.560
 microsoft bob but hey it's as 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.049
 typography quoted not fabulous but of 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.689
 anyway what he drew he has 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.880
 absolutely not draw a typography 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.110
 intended to be distributed used 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.860
 for by other people in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.410
 other areas 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.760
 it should only be used in 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.159
 this software here 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.269
 point bar and obviously it's not the 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.010
 everything that happened the leaders 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.060
 from microsoft have seen the police from 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.629
 character in question they are ten years old 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.409
 it's not bad we go there distributed with 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.040
 microsoft windows 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.640
 and then after there was internet etc etc 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.890
 etc. 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.379
 in a few years the comics years went 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.549
 found on the earth 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.840
 and when I say on the whole earth 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.900
 that is to say, the comics we have 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.599
 found on wedding invitations 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.980
 on things I want to say where we 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.959
 wait a little bit, ie for example 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.849
 papers just again 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.379
 here it's here that you go for 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.690
 go to the bathroom or then there is 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.549
 no more paper in the machine to do 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.260
 photocopies that kind of stuff there that 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.129
 it goes well it's the problem 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.450
 is that the comic supposed to find 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.040
 really everywhere everywhere everywhere 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.139
 everywhere, that is to say that we even 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.879
 found engraved on a tombstone 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.129
 that is to say, it has even been found on 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.659
 the side of an ambulance the logo of a 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.769
 ambulance in comic without saying that if you 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.389
 are sick in the ambulance and you 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.440
 know these great comics without you have 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.900
 a little bit scared and it's a little bit 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.209
 normal so in short all that has made that 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.400
 more and more there are quite a few people a 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.489
 everywhere we started to hate 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.109
 comics really puts to hate him the 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.540
 comics designer years ago when she him 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.129
 take it all with finally a little 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.449
 of humor and distance anyway 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.609
 he does not really have a choice now 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.739
 because his baby sound him a little bit 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.440
 escaped from the hands but the fact is there 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.250
 today the comics is one 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.019
 typographic and found himself on the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.180
 whole earth that everyone knows 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.129
 that a lot of people have used is not 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.930
 as would have required for example the 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.699
 Pope Benedict 16 that he still 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.949
 used for all legends of 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.780
 photos from the photo album of the official pope 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.430
 so that's still a little bit of a 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.370
 little bit scary when you think about it 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.569
 what is certainly certain is that in 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.549
 as a typographer 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.590
 the only advice I want that I 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:01.159
 can you give compared to comics 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.159
 years old and please do not use it
