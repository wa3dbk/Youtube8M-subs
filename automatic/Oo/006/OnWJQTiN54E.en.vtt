00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.069
 Y 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.180
 what's up branding forward I'm director 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.470
 of physical production of the whole club and 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.470
 I come from Barcelona 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.410
 we did not take long to get used to 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.540
 because being the same language and a climate 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.610
 that follows this similar to Spain a climate 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.950
 good that continues to accustom us and that 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.809
 the food still costs us a little 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.120
 because the spicy and all these things 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.680
 typical of Mexican culture we 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.680
 It costs a bit to adapt to it 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.850
 in the club gym pachuca here 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.530
 enters 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.190
 prison to these basic forces and is 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.190
 like my second house 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.030
 this 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.040
 the power work that we have 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.490
 made the conics is a job of 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.490
 speed 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:23.440
 and this is where the players are changed 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.450
 of first division before each 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.220
 training everyone has their chapel 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.410
 Custom has each its own 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.510
 television with skype have their xbox 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.370
 they have custom showers here 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.630
 we have the jacuzzi next to the jacuzzi 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.250
 We found two pools where 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.840
 we combine cold water pool and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.610
 hot water pool to perform 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.910
 the contrasts and accelerate the process of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.910
 recover 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.580
 they are power-oriented exercises 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.940
 and we work it through the doors 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.940
 eccentric 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.000
 do not 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.000
 was not 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.070
 is coming out like no exit in the 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.750
 field actually goes there and works 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.100
 crews in two equal phases happens 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:21.050
 concentric when it starts and phases 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:22.520
 delivering brakes doing a job 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.060
 especially in sub-17 sub-20 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.770
 implementing a whole new way of 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.120
 work with all the monitoring and in 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.580
 as to the development of the force that 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.780
 that's completely new here, not me 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.440
 I think you can visit all the clubs 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:41.140
 here you will not see one that trains with gps yes 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.140
 and heart rate hardly 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.439
 Y 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.430
 have a boy in the foreground very 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.860
 committed very professional and that to 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.620
 over the years undoubtedly with its 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.989
 youth his impetus and his passion will go 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.030
 giving the possibility of being able to count on 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.500
 one of the best department of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.500
 physiology of the exercise of the world 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.680
 a pleasure and have a good trip 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.680
 return to Spain until soon
