killing<00:00:24.090> people<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.170> think<00:00:25.550> everything

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
killing people but I think everything

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.630 
killing people but I think everything
has<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> good<00:00:27.180> side<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.900> bad<00:00:27.930> side<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.710> they

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
should see the good side that our drones

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:40.180 
should see the good side that our drones
that<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.859> save<00:00:32.250> lives

that<00:02:29.620> rescue<00:02:30.010> teams<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.150> they

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
that rescue teams have is that they

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.630 
that rescue teams have is that they
can't<00:02:31.630> rescue<00:02:32.200> well<00:02:32.500> at<00:02:32.709> night<00:02:33.010> when<00:02:33.459> they

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
can't rescue well at night when they

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.240 
can't rescue well at night when they
lose<00:02:33.849> people<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.480> people<00:02:34.840> drown<00:02:35.080> they<00:02:35.830> have<00:02:36.069> to

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
lose people of people drown they have to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.729 
lose people of people drown they have to
move<00:02:36.519> with<00:02:37.480> boats<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.049> they<00:02:38.170> don't<00:02:38.349> have<00:02:38.500> good

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
move with boats and they don't have good

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.940 
move with boats and they don't have good
vision<00:02:38.980> at<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.910> sea<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.170> robot<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.590> give

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
vision at the sea so this robot can give

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.640 
vision at the sea so this robot can give
a<00:02:41.980> good<00:02:42.370> vision<00:02:42.579> from<00:02:42.849> above<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:44.200> can<00:02:44.380> find

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
a good vision from above and we can find

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.460 
a good vision from above and we can find
people<00:02:45.310> with<00:02:45.489> thermal<00:02:46.120> cameras<00:02:46.540> easily<00:02:47.110> at

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
people with thermal cameras easily at

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.559 
people with thermal cameras easily at
night<00:02:47.530> as<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:48.610> can<00:02:48.760> see<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.090> tests<00:02:49.329> that

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
night as you can see in the tests that

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.479 
night as you can see in the tests that
we<00:02:49.780> done<00:02:49.959> at<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.349> Caspian<00:02:50.799> Sea<00:02:50.829> there<00:02:51.310> was<00:02:51.340> a

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
we done at the Caspian Sea there was a

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.759 
we done at the Caspian Sea there was a
competition<00:02:51.910> between<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.599> robot<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
competition between the robot and the

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.100 
competition between the robot and the
lifeguard<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.970> robot<00:02:55.329> with<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.540> mission<00:02:55.959> in

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
lifeguard the robot with the mission in

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.800 
lifeguard the robot with the mission in
22<00:02:56.709> seconds<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.790> lifeguard<00:02:58.299> in<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.599> same

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
22 seconds but the lifeguard in the same

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.580 
22 seconds but the lifeguard in the same
mission<00:02:59.019> in<00:02:59.319> 91<00:02:59.799> seconds<00:03:00.220> that's<00:03:00.849> in<00:03:01.000> 70

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
mission in 91 seconds that's in 70

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.319 
mission in 91 seconds that's in 70
second<00:03:02.590> difference<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.370> can<00:03:03.910> be<00:03:04.090> very

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
second difference it can be very

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.860 
second difference it can be very
important<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:04.989> saving<00:03:05.440> human<00:03:05.739> lives<00:03:06.870> these

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
important for saving human lives these

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.660 
important for saving human lives these
are<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.170> developments<00:03:08.889> of<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.250> lab<00:03:09.430> in

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
are the developments of the lab in

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.720 
are the developments of the lab in
future<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:11.350> platform<00:03:11.620> can<00:03:12.160> be<00:03:12.310> used<00:03:12.519> on

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
future so this platform can be used on

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.780 
future so this platform can be used on
water<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:14.440> can<00:03:14.650> charge<00:03:15.069> it<00:03:15.280> from<00:03:15.519> solar

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
water and we can charge it from solar

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.420 
water and we can charge it from solar
cell<00:03:16.150> we<00:03:16.389> can<00:03:16.569> use<00:03:16.810> satellites<00:03:17.769> for

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
cell we can use satellites for

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.750 
cell we can use satellites for
information

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.229 

national<00:03:22.760> companies<00:03:23.750> want<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.410> buy<00:03:25.239> 23

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
national companies want to buy 23

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.710 
national companies want to buy 23
grounds<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:27.349> use<00:03:28.310> them<00:03:28.610> at<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:29.000> coast<00:03:29.239> but<00:03:29.569> we

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
grounds to use them at the coast but we

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.900 
grounds to use them at the coast but we
have<00:03:29.870> told<00:03:30.290> them<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.680> wait<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.160> we<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.370> see<00:03:31.700> how

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
have told them to wait so we can see how

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.750 
have told them to wait so we can see how
the<00:03:32.239> final<00:03:32.510> prototypes<00:03:33.260> work<00:03:33.590> at<00:03:34.129> the<00:03:34.340> Caspian

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
the final prototypes work at the Caspian

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.089 
the final prototypes work at the Caspian
Sea<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.269> can<00:03:35.420> sell<00:03:35.660> them<00:03:35.870> twenty<00:03:36.410> two<00:03:36.920> or

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
Sea so we can sell them twenty two or

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.400 
Sea so we can sell them twenty two or
three<00:03:37.340> robots<00:03:37.640> news<00:03:38.390> about<00:03:38.690> pars<00:03:39.049> was

and<00:03:46.069> develop<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.120> robot<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:49.239> love<00:03:50.239> research

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
and develop the robot I love research

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.309 
and develop the robot I love research
and<00:03:51.019> on<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.250> other<00:03:52.370> hand<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.940> love<00:03:53.390> helping

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
and on the other hand I love helping

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.759 
and on the other hand I love helping
people

people

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.199 
people
so<00:03:55.579> I<00:03:55.910> do<00:03:56.030> research<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.599> helps<00:03:57.349> people<00:03:58.209> these

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
so I do research that helps people these
