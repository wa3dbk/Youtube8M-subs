This is the final countdown, Trevelyan.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.500
I love how the music picks up at this point.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.400
Oh, shit.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.600
HURRY UP!

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.300
Is it just me, or does this song sounds vaguely like the Macarena theme...

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.700
AH SHIT, YOU SMUG FUCKER.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.700
I'm gonna get you, mothafucka.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.700
OUT OF MY WAY.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.049
Oh, I got a job to finish alright.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.800
Move you assholes, this is between me and HIM!

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.700
Oh yeah?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.800
I'm better at busting a cap in someone's ass, nigga.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.300
Just like in the movie.

It's all in a day's work for Bond.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.600
And that's the end of the story-line! Check out Part 20 for the Aztec level. Part 19 is the credits with Bond and Natalya making out.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.900
WHOOO!!! OH YEAH!
