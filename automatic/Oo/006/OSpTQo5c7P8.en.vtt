00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everyone my dear friends with 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.340
 you were and 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.719
 This is a small bonus on the construction of the bench 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:17.010
 in which maybe you will sell 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:20.520
 any things well in general pretty pretty 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.769
 many seller here on servers and this 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.369
 video will you be very helpful 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.210
 so first we need to put here 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.789
 such a frame 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.160
 that is, here we put 2 blocks through 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.370
 edinburgh retreat three blocks set still 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.040
 also two blocks yes, but I think everything is clear 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 now we need to put it like this 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.670
 here's a step 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:49.530
 and here it is like this 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.230
 so here I am thinking back 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.200
 we usually put the steps which 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.830
 afterwards we will replace 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.829
 yes somehow now in the middle I 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.070
 I think you can put the hatch like this 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:10.230
 so let's save 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.300
 big track out of the trunk for 5 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.620
 we have 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.320
 but if you build of course in the city so 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.610
 but how could she be there further from passing 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.040
 here and here inside 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.420
 did as follows we will need 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.160
 glass and glowing stones so we them 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.720
 we take down we are still amazed by one block 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:42.560
 insert and put the glass here 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:47.570
 well I think everything is clear so now we 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:52.910
 we put on 2 on 2 exact walls from 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:56.000
 cobblestone like that yes and now 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.710
 here here we spend semi blocks 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.220
 a small line so so yes and she is with us 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.930
 will go up that is so so 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.210
 I â€™m still getting back now 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:17.760
 here we draw this line and 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:23.360
 from above so here we cut yes now this 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:27.150
 you can close the parties with you 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.310
 here we have such a place so 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.880
 like a shop pretty small then 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.200
 to save space the workbench we will post 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.680
 it is in this hole 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.920
 That is, with this you can just 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.330
 clicking on it and now we circle not here 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:50.850
 so here are quartz plates yes but I think 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.040
 everything is clear now he is now now 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.880
 here I think you can put floral 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.670
 pots 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.390
 here a couple of flowers and most importantly us 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:10.000
 need a framework we put them 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:10.000
 like this way and here 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.900
 Here and we would have turned such a whole 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.989
 stand sheet 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.230
 Well, here's the food you can take to the attack and 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.390
 here we insert any food that is 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.530
 which you will sell it and 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.220
 insert 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:33.880
 I, for example, will insert a pie of cookies mushrooms 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:39.310
 pork cake and watermelon maybe 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:43.750
 watermelon juice or something like that's right 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.799
 can see that is what is here 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.410
 sold now you can put here 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.459
 sign and write your name on it 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:59.140
 so that everyone knows who if anything to handle 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:02.349
 I will write it's just like here 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.069
 yes here goes passes to and and sees by 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:10.470
 traced the letter from sell then something then 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:14.940
 now we break it and set 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:19.920
 put the stove here so here we are 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:24.020
 we put so chests it I think it is necessary 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.700
 break out and and well put here just 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.520
 quartz block so here now 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.230
 insert the end of ender chest 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.760
 Yes, and and in my opinion the whole coverage, that is, 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:43.980
 two stoves fit two chests here 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:48.390
 Enderman's chest and workbench 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.490
 my all this yes to the shop and how to get 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.380
 can't be noticed except how to open 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.850
 hatch here 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.040
 so pretty pretty 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.090
 turned out and if you liked it 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.170

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:09.760
