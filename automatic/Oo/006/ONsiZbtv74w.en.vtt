00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
what we're trying to do is get this

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.330 
what we're trying to do is get this
enough<00:02:47.840> room<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.140> slide<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.620> roller<00:02:48.860> off<00:02:49.100> on

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
enough room to slide the roller off on

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.090 
enough room to slide the roller off on
the<00:02:49.940> right<00:02:50.150> side<00:02:50.450> there's<00:02:50.720> also<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:51.170> collar<00:02:51.590> and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
the right side there's also a collar and

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100 
the right side there's also a collar and
we're<00:02:52.610> going<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.790> want<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.060> perform<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.870> same

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
we're going to want to perform the same

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.020 
we're going to want to perform the same
thing<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.530> we<00:02:54.680> did<00:02:54.800> on<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.040> left<00:02:55.250> side<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
thing that we did on the left side the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.310 
thing that we did on the left side the
right<00:02:56.210> side<00:02:56.240> can<00:02:56.630> be<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.750> little<00:02:56.990> tricky

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
right side can be a little tricky

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.410 
right side can be a little tricky
because<00:02:57.470> we<00:02:57.770> actually<00:02:57.920> have<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.520> shaft<00:02:59.030> there

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
because we actually have the shaft there

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.040 
because we actually have the shaft there
that<00:03:00.110> drives<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.830> pickup<00:03:01.160> roller<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:02.960> we

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
that drives the pickup roller and so we

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.300 
that drives the pickup roller and so we
want<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.320> make<00:03:03.440> sure<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:06.800> kind<00:03:07.070> of<00:03:07.130> gets

want to make sure that that kind of gets

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.190 
want to make sure that that kind of gets
out<00:03:07.490> of<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.670> way<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> little<00:03:08.000> bit<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.420> this

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
out of the way a little bit and this

out of the way a little bit and this
collar<00:03:10.000> sometimes<00:03:11.000> can<00:03:11.710> can<00:03:12.710> kind<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:12.980> give

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
collar sometimes can can kind of give

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.120 
collar sometimes can can kind of give
you<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.250> little<00:03:13.520> bit<00:03:13.610> more<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.910> a--<00:03:14.800> can<00:03:15.800> kind<00:03:16.070> of

you a little bit more of a-- can kind of

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.760 
you a little bit more of a-- can kind of
make<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.340> frustrated<00:03:16.550> actually<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:18.500> again

make you frustrated actually and again

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.470

what<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.070> goal<00:03:19.220> is<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:20.030> we<00:03:20.150> want<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.390> get

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
what the goal is is that we want to get

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.190 
what the goal is is that we want to get
this<00:03:20.600> collar<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:21.080> move<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.560> right<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:23.210> by

this collar to move to the right and by

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.840 
this collar to move to the right and by
doing<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:24.530> that'll<00:03:25.070> give<00:03:25.190> us<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.460> room<00:03:25.640> to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
doing so that'll give us the room to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.630 
doing so that'll give us the room to
pull<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.210> roller<00:03:26.510> off<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.130> collar<00:03:31.400> on

back<00:03:34.850> far<00:03:35.180> enough<00:03:35.210> where<00:03:35.570> we<00:03:35.600> can<00:03:35.840> get<00:03:35.990> this

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
back far enough where we can get this

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.440

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
what you're going to go through to so

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.460 
what you're going to go through to so
again<00:03:50.390> just<00:03:50.630> what<00:03:50.810> we're<00:03:50.960> trying<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.260> do<00:03:51.350> is

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
again just what we're trying to do is

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.650 
again just what we're trying to do is
rotate<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:52.130> collar<00:03:52.370> on<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.700> right<00:03:52.910> until<00:03:53.570> it

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
rotate this collar on the right until it

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.060 
rotate this collar on the right until it
slides<00:03:53.840> over<00:03:54.020> that<00:03:54.230> shaft<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.710> off<00:03:54.830> where<00:03:55.010> it

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
slides over that shaft and off where it

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.340 
slides over that shaft and off where it
gives<00:03:55.220> us<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.520> room<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.850> pop<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.350> pickup

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
gives us the room to pop this pickup

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.470 
gives us the room to pop this pickup
roller<00:03:57.560> out<00:03:57.800> of<00:03:58.220> its<00:03:58.370> socket

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.910 

and<00:04:02.480> again<00:04:02.720> this<00:04:02.840> can<00:04:03.020> be<00:04:03.080> kind<00:04:03.890> of

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
and again this can be kind of

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.920 
and again this can be kind of
frustrating<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:06.400> was<00:04:07.400> going<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.580> do<00:04:07.730> this<00:04:07.930> video

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
frustrating I was going to do this video

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.550 
frustrating I was going to do this video
in<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:09.890> one<00:04:10.820> approach<00:04:11.210> but<00:04:11.240> I<00:04:11.840> think<00:04:12.320> with<00:04:12.470> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
in in one approach but I think with the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.979 
in in one approach but I think with the
time<00:04:12.740> can<00:04:13.010> there<00:04:13.730> we<00:04:13.760> go<00:04:14.000> okay<00:04:14.600> mines<00:04:14.990> out<00:04:15.200> now

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
time can there we go okay mines out now

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.330 
time can there we go okay mines out now
your<00:04:17.989> replacement<00:04:18.620> roller<00:04:18.799> won't<00:04:19.040> come<00:04:19.220> with

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
your replacement roller won't come with

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.039 
your replacement roller won't come with
a<00:04:19.370> little<00:04:19.609> idler<00:04:20.060> wheels<00:04:20.269> they<00:04:20.690> don't<00:04:20.840> need<00:04:20.959> to

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
a little idler wheels they don't need to

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.690 
a little idler wheels they don't need to
be<00:04:21.170> replaced<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.100> what<00:04:22.250> you're<00:04:22.370> going<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.550> want

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
be replaced so what you're going to want

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.330 
be replaced so what you're going to want
to<00:04:22.760> do<00:04:22.880> is<00:04:23.030> reinstall<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.320> idler<00:04:24.890> rollers<00:04:25.190> on

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
to do is reinstall the idler rollers on

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.610 
to do is reinstall the idler rollers on
the<00:04:25.460> left<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.820> right<00:04:25.970> side<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:27.470> you'll

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
the left and the right side and you'll

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.800 
the left and the right side and you'll
notice<00:04:27.830> on<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.160> end<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.610> shaft<00:04:28.850> one<00:04:29.570> sides

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
notice on the end of the shaft one sides

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.390 
notice on the end of the shaft one sides
a<00:04:29.900> little<00:04:30.110> bigger<00:04:30.290> than<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.560> other<00:04:30.650> side<00:04:31.070> and

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
a little bigger than the other side and

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.650 
a little bigger than the other side and
that's<00:04:31.670> because<00:04:31.970> when<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.210> goes<00:04:32.330> into<00:04:32.510> the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
that's because when it goes into the

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.980 
that's because when it goes into the
drive<00:04:33.190> coupler<00:04:34.570> everything<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.690> very

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
drive coupler everything is very

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.010 
drive coupler everything is very
straight<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.630> won't<00:04:40.240> it<00:04:41.240> will<00:04:41.510> allow<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:41.840> to

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
straight and won't it will allow you to

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.230 
straight and won't it will allow you to
only<00:04:42.740> put<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.130> on<00:04:43.220> one<00:04:43.280> weight<00:04:43.760> but<00:04:44.030> if<00:04:44.120> you

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
only put it on one weight but if you

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.930 
only put it on one weight but if you
force<00:04:44.570> this<00:04:44.870> roller<00:04:45.170> it<00:04:45.650> will<00:04:45.920> definitely<00:04:46.160> go

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
force this roller it will definitely go

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.610 
force this roller it will definitely go
on<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.330> wrong<00:04:47.480> way<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:47.750> you<00:04:47.870> could<00:04:48.050> crack<00:04:48.380> the

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
on the wrong way and you could crack the

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.340 
on the wrong way and you could crack the
end<00:04:48.770> of<00:04:48.890> this<00:04:48.980> pickup<00:04:49.880> roller<00:04:50.210> start<00:04:51.050> off<00:04:51.170> with
