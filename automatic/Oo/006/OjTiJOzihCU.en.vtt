00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
going to try to teach you how to do fast

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.540 
going to try to teach you how to do fast
planche<00:00:11.280> fakies<00:00:15.770> so<00:00:16.770> basically<00:00:17.220> for

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
planche fakies so basically for

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.730 
planche fakies so basically for
fastplant<00:00:18.000> keep<00:00:18.869> your<00:00:19.020> foot<00:00:19.199> kind<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.560> close

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
fastplant keep your foot kind of close

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.890 
fastplant keep your foot kind of close
to<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> edge<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.520> your<00:00:20.609> tail<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.119> your<00:00:21.869> front

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
to the edge of your tail and your front

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.160 
to the edge of your tail and your front
foot<00:00:22.230> at<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.980> angle<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.960> grab

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
foot at an angle so that you can grab

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.910 
foot at an angle so that you can grab
the<00:00:25.439> side<00:00:26.660> instead<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.750> grabbing<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.199> nose<00:00:28.410> so

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the side instead of grabbing the nose so

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.840 
the side instead of grabbing the nose so
you<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.189> more<00:00:29.369> control<00:00:29.670> over<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.380> I

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
you have more control over it and I

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.280 
you have more control over it and I
started<00:00:32.850> practicing<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.480> flat<00:00:33.780> ground<00:00:34.079> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
started practicing on flat ground I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.630 
started practicing on flat ground I
think<00:00:34.559> that's<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> best<00:00:34.950> way<00:00:35.239> is<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:37.640> really

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
think that's the best way is just really

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
think that's the best way is just really
good<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:40.790> I'm<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.000> try<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> quarter

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
good and I'm just try it on the quarter

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.080 
good and I'm just try it on the quarter
pipe<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.079> go<00:00:43.200> up<00:00:43.550> good<00:00:44.550> amount<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.820> speed

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
pipe just go up good amount of speed

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.380 
pipe just go up good amount of speed
take<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.200> back<00:00:46.350> foot<00:00:46.379> off<00:00:46.789> just<00:00:47.789> jump<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.619 

so<00:00:59.300> on<00:00:59.719> the<00:00:59.899> fastplant<00:01:00.260> fakie<00:01:00.879> you<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.420> could

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
so on the fastplant fakie you you could

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.240 
so on the fastplant fakie you you could
do<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:02.899> like<00:01:03.079> halfway<00:01:03.290> up<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.680> wall<00:01:03.710> and

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
do it like halfway up the wall and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.399 
do it like halfway up the wall and
practice<00:01:04.850> them<00:01:04.970> like<00:01:05.180> kind<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.510> like<00:01:06.110> kind<00:01:06.350> of

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
practice them like kind of like kind of

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.290 
practice them like kind of like kind of
early<00:01:06.680> grab<00:01:06.890> them<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.100> little<00:01:07.310> bit<00:01:07.460> cooler<00:01:08.150> if

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
early grab them a little bit cooler if

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.109 
early grab them a little bit cooler if
you<00:01:08.360> don't<00:01:08.630> but<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.890> good<00:01:10.100> way<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.310> build

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
you don't but it is a good way to build

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.600 
you don't but it is a good way to build
up<00:01:11.270> your<00:01:11.390> confidence<00:01:12.130> work<00:01:13.130> your<00:01:13.280> way<00:01:13.369> up<00:01:13.400> the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
up your confidence work your way up the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.310 
up your confidence work your way up the
wall<00:01:13.729> slowly<00:01:14.060> until<00:01:14.600> eventually<00:01:14.780> you'll<00:01:15.229> be

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
wall slowly until eventually you'll be

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.890 
wall slowly until eventually you'll be
doing<00:01:15.560> them<00:01:15.680> off<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.890> coping<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.900> blasting

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
doing them off the coping and blasting

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.920 
doing them off the coping and blasting
them<00:01:21.729> so<00:01:22.729> before<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:23.270> learn<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.450> fastplant

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
them so before you learn the fastplant

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.420 
them so before you learn the fastplant
fakie<00:01:24.470> you're<00:01:24.830> going<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.040> want<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.280> be

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
fakie you're going to want to be

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.190 
fakie you're going to want to be
comfortable<00:01:25.790> coming<00:01:26.240> back<00:01:26.390> in<00:01:26.570> fakie

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
comfortable coming back in fakie

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.810 
comfortable coming back in fakie
so<00:01:28.240> maybe<00:01:29.240> learn<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.350> rock<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.680> fakie

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.330 

maybe<00:01:34.820> try<00:01:35.270> some<00:01:35.600> air<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.229> fakies<00:01:36.710> just

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
maybe try some air to fakies just

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.920 
maybe try some air to fakies just
grabbing<00:01:37.759> in<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.000> same<00:01:38.210> spot

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.790 

and<00:01:43.600> like<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.690> said<00:01:44.750> practice<00:01:45.290> them<00:01:45.440> on<00:01:45.500> flat

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
and like I said practice them on flat

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.580 
and like I said practice them on flat
ground<00:01:47.050> halfway<00:01:48.050> up<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.260> ramp

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
ground halfway up the ramp

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.410 
ground halfway up the ramp
whatever<00:01:49.190> get<00:01:49.580> comfortable<00:01:49.880> taking<00:01:50.330> your

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
whatever get comfortable taking your

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.960 
whatever get comfortable taking your
foot<00:01:50.570> off<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.280> just<00:01:52.280> get<00:01:52.430> comfortable<00:01:52.730> going

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
foot off and just get comfortable going

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.760 
foot off and just get comfortable going
back<00:01:53.210> fakie<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.630> soon<00:01:54.110> enough<00:01:54.350> it'll<00:01:54.620> work

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
back fakie and soon enough it'll work

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.980 
back fakie and soon enough it'll work
out

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
