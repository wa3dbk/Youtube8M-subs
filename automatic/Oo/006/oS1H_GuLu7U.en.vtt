 I already have one more one 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.350

 let's go first, we take note of the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.260

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.129

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.030
 what is that a trend sport 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.840

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.820
