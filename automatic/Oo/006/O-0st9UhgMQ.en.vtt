00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.320
 When I first saw the East China Sea 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.160
 When he first came to Seoul 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.880
 He was really pure in his face at the time. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.360
 Feeling novel to all kinds of things 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.860
 Because I started working as a trainee at SM company earlier. 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.780
 At that time, it seems that he first approached me. 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.180
 In retrospect, his face is really pure. 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.140
 The first time I came, I saw him in the dining hall. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.620
 First of all, there is an idea of ​​"communicating to a friend in Seoul." 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.320
 I hope everyone can get closer soon. 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.400
 And adapt to this company 

00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:00.738
 As a Super Junior 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.920
 Our performance stage is group dance 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.560
 Or a more gorgeous show 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.740
 And the stage of our two group is cheerful and joyful. 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.240
 Compare the look of funky 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 There are also diverse music that we like. 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.540
 That is when we have opinions 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 Captain Tegu (Litte) will send messages to members to ask ideas 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.800
 What is the message? 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.080
 We have a chat room that exchanges messages. 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.480
 Saying something like this in the chat room 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.720
 What do you think? 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.440
 Collect their opinions and add the idea of ​​the captain 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.380
 If you do this, you will be able to solve it.
