only<00:02:51.659> this<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.680> part<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> biathlon<00:02:53.340> so

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
only this is part of the biathlon so

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.430 
only this is part of the biathlon so
imagine<00:02:54.269> not<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.450> doing<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:54.840> 10<00:02:55.170> minutes

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
imagine not just doing one 10 minutes

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.569 
imagine not just doing one 10 minutes
that<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:55.769> two<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.910> same<00:02:57.120> day<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
that but two in the same day so just the

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.069 
that but two in the same day so just the
jerk<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.000> he<00:03:00.090> cleans<00:03:00.329> it<00:03:00.420> up<00:03:00.569> once<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:00.989> you

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
jerk so he cleans it up once and you

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.030 
jerk so he cleans it up once and you
could<00:03:01.200> touch<00:03:01.349> your<00:03:01.470> shoulders<00:03:01.829> at<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:01.980> top

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
could touch your shoulders at the top

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.259 
could touch your shoulders at the top
but<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.430> have<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.790> reset<00:03:03.239> them<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.910> notice

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
but you have to reset them so notice

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.569 
but you have to reset them so notice
when<00:03:06.450> he<00:03:06.599> brings<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.349> weight<00:03:07.530> down<00:03:07.560> he<00:03:08.280> lifts

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
when he brings that weight down he lifts

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.640 
when he brings that weight down he lifts
his<00:03:08.670> heels<00:03:09.000> he<00:03:09.090> absorbs<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.870> weight<00:03:10.049> because

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
his heels he absorbs that weight because

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.750 
his heels he absorbs that weight because
if<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.859> just<00:03:11.040> pull<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.280> weight<00:03:11.549> down

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
if you just pull that weight down

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.309 
if you just pull that weight down
straight<00:03:12.090> down<00:03:12.120> you're<00:03:12.480> wasting<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:13.260> much

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
straight down you're wasting so much

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.470 
straight down you're wasting so much
energy<00:03:13.560> you're<00:03:13.980> using<00:03:14.159> all<00:03:14.400> your<00:03:14.430> arms<00:03:14.909> so<00:03:15.450> he

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
energy you're using all your arms so he

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.690 
energy you're using all your arms so he
absorbs<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.170> weight<00:03:16.349> with<00:03:17.040> his<00:03:17.159> hips<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
absorbs that weight with his hips and

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.199 
absorbs that weight with his hips and
his<00:03:17.790> heels

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.280

going up on the platform just to just do

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.039 
going up on the platform just to just do
it<00:03:59.669> for<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.879> first<00:04:00.060> time<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.510> depends<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:00.930> your

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
it for the first time it depends on your

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.460 
it for the first time it depends on your
goals<00:04:01.489> so<00:04:02.489> progression<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:04.230> know<00:04:04.319> you're

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
goals so progression is you know you're

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.809 
goals so progression is you know you're
going<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.650> want<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:04.859> practice<00:04:05.040> five<00:04:05.430> reps<00:04:05.669> a

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
going to want to practice five reps a

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.479 
going to want to practice five reps a
minute<00:04:06.150> for<00:04:06.750> two<00:04:07.379> minutes<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.889> then<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.250> next

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
minute for two minutes and then the next

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.439 
minute for two minutes and then the next
time<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:08.730> train<00:04:08.970> you're<00:04:09.090> going<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.269> want<00:04:09.419> to

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
time you train you're going to want to

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.360 
time you train you're going to want to
go<00:04:09.599> six<00:04:10.199> reps<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.560> minute<00:04:10.769> for<00:04:10.949> three<00:04:11.190> minutes

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
go six reps a minute for three minutes

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.770 
go six reps a minute for three minutes
so<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:11.669> you're<00:04:12.000> gonna<00:04:12.120> get<00:04:12.269> longer<00:04:12.510> and

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
so you you're gonna get longer and

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.569 
so you you're gonna get longer and
longer<00:04:12.840> every<00:04:13.109> time<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.560> train<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.099> then

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
longer every time you train and then

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.550 
longer every time you train and then
eventually<00:04:14.879> you're<00:04:15.569> strong<00:04:15.930> enough<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.440> your

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
eventually you're strong enough and your

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.589 
eventually you're strong enough and your
endurance<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:17.699> can<00:04:17.849> last<00:04:18.389> that

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
endurance is up that you can last that

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.210 
endurance is up that you can last that
10<00:04:18.810> minutes<00:04:19.139> under<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.500> weight<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:20.070> you've
