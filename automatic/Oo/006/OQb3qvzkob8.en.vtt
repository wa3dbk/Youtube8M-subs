 his partner yann alrick mortreuil 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.470
 I am alone 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.810
 still 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.700
 if it's us 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.400
 knew 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.400
 both seasons of the tournament 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.010
 only that 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.680
 a snorkel 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.590
 tall dreaded the resort of dance 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.480
 Contemporary Has it succeeded at it 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.120

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.269
 vote for talent there was you

 call 39 81 we go talent this is 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.370
 party for the party judges and one 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.010
 starts with jaume at a merger but 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.769
 still not obvious because there 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.709
 visit the world of fred astaire and the 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.590
 world of pietragalla and corinne the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.110
 final result ben it's not bad at all 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.329
 tk return to the world of 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.450
 contemporary and I find that it was 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.519
 very positive affirmed and for me it's 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.799
 very important because it's not 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.930
 something easy to return to 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.060
 something that a bit negative for 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.200
 you but the result was wonderful 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.000
 at the foxtrot 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.190
 we still have to work a little bit on the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.260
 framework is not the cat but when you 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.840
 moves in space must the body 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.970
 flight where the dynamic movement of 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.130
 space moves more we need more 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.459
 big steps a little otherwise you'll stop 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.160
 a little bit but for me talent 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.450
 Now it means talented tto 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.660
 has for fierce her for luminous 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.730
 thank you here is the huge field thank you 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.440
 actually I would already like to say that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.330
 the courtyard was really well cut 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.920
 it's true you've followed the nuance of 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.110
 the song to be on very stuff 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.580
 aerial in the foxtrot is sure to be 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.120
 more combative in the tale during the 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.850
 contemporary 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.920
 I would like to say that your contemporary 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.640
 compared to the first week this is the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.640
 day and night 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.430
 huge 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.660
 it works on the tone we saw 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.010
 that movements come from the belly 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.810
 things you did not do at the beginning of 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.910
 bus camp missions and you see that 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.310
 everything finally changes all your 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.500
 gestures all your arms and legs 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.510
 also another instead of wearing 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.740
 for all that all this work that you 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.220
 did in such a short time 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:13.830
 bravo brad smith I had spoken beyond 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.090
 the interpretation last week and 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.260
 this week I spent a moment 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.020
 great to watch you dance ya 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.450
 still there is still it's normal it's 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.620
 normal there are still moments in 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.450
 terms of techniques that are at 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.280
 actually work the frame 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.960
 attention it started very well and 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.150
 all of a sudden elbows fell to 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.670
 legs a little too far apart 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.880
 my taste but you know what 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.260
 I loved watching this performance 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.700
 I very much wanted to gratify a talent 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.350
 I buy last Saturday it was your 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.180
 first I buy what is it tonight 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.100
 yes so wait i'll book if 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.580
 I buy or not but I will tell you 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.440
 only at home 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.360
 what more can I say about my 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.240
 colleagues ie that maybe 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.250
 maybe add a sentence by saying 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.440
 that I feel that your 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.740
 personality is hatching and 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.300
 that you have your own rita dance you take 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.220
 possession of the dance 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.390
 actually there is still I am 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.060
 agree with you the little problems 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.430
 from frame to poop but I would say that 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.410
 as a crisis I loved watching you 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:23.480
 to dance and for all that I will tell the 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.510
 place of jean marc jahn 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.740
