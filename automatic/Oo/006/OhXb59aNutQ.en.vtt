 Let's take a look at the state law from hello these days. 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.920
 Take this first plan major Seven cords and slow down the two patterns

 I'll play hageteupnida 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:36.020
 If you are interested in this, please feel free to use the shop.

 Next, hold the d minor Seven framing the law of the same two words pattern 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.190
 Let's take a look. 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.190
 Ah 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.960
 Next, let 's look at 40 weeks by connecting the two codes 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:20.320
 222 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.320
 : C holding the Seven Minor code let's play a word patterns 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.689
 222 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.719
 Proverbs hold the f-code and would like this pattern once. 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.719
 Ah 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.740
 Next, the b flat Seven managers hold eupni will do'll re-open 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:49.219
 c - f he played Earth cracked the code b 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:58.630
 Let's try playing the pattern of your words. 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:58.630
 5 ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:10.759
 In the middle of the coach b plan major seven cord 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:16.180
 Next, there is a part that comes out after 14 years of age. 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.180
 I'm going to ask you to link the Tom Hardy pattern slowly. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.290
 to ah 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.819
 By building a little faster connection Suppose a brother 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.920
 U 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:49.040
 Housewives will proceed to a total of eight words 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:55.480
 al oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.480
 to be too 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:05.650
 Next, let's take a look at the chorus method. 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.709
 In the cool part of the code progress in the cross 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.709
 on 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 perl epo 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.310
 Each code is repeatedly connected 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:25.660
 I will play slowly. 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:31.520
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:38.680
