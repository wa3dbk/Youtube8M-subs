00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
I have to say admittedly the Stooges are

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.759 
I have to say admittedly the Stooges are
sounding<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:56.969> little<00:02:57.120> gutsy<00:02:57.900> er<00:02:57.930> than<00:02:58.560> they<00:02:58.709> did

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
sounding a little gutsy er than they did

on their previous full-length they are
completely<00:03:00.900> missing<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.379> mark<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.799> band

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980

that<00:03:50.699> has<00:03:51.569> never<00:03:52.109> really<00:03:52.319> been<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:52.859> Stooges

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
that has never really been the Stooges

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.129 
that has never really been the Stooges
strong<00:03:53.609> point<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.239> I'm<00:03:54.329> just<00:03:54.479> wondering<00:03:54.959> why

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
strong point so I'm just wondering why

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.379 
strong point so I'm just wondering why
they're<00:03:55.349> even<00:03:55.379> going<00:03:56.040> down<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.819> road<00:03:57.150> to

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
they're even going down this road to

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.420 
they're even going down this road to
begin<00:03:57.540> with<00:03:57.930> there<00:03:58.379> are<00:03:58.500> some<00:03:58.739> tracks<00:03:58.949> on<00:03:59.159> here

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
begin with there are some tracks on here

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.449 
begin with there are some tracks on here
that<00:03:59.609> have<00:03:59.909> lyrics<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:00.449> make<00:04:00.629> me<00:04:00.750> cry<00:04:01.019> and

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
that have lyrics that make me cry and

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.360 
that have lyrics that make me cry and
cringe<00:04:02.459> like<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.329> song<00:04:03.540> job<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:04.199> got<00:04:04.469> a<00:04:04.530> job<00:04:04.949> and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
cringe like the song job I got a job and

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.129 
cringe like the song job I got a job and
it<00:04:05.489> don't<00:04:05.729> pay<00:04:06.269> they're<00:04:06.750> just<00:04:07.049> the

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
it don't pay they're just the

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.740 
it don't pay they're just the
moments<00:04:07.469> where<00:04:07.590> he<00:04:08.040> pops<00:04:08.280> words<00:04:08.669> just<00:04:09.299> are<00:04:09.509> too

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
moments where he pops words just are too

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.469 
moments where he pops words just are too
obnoxious<00:04:09.930> for<00:04:10.799> words<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:12.030> be<00:04:12.150> completely

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
obnoxious for words to be completely

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.080 
obnoxious for words to be completely
honest<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.079> his<00:04:13.259> voice<00:04:13.469> it's<00:04:14.039> it's<00:04:14.489> like<00:04:14.789> him

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
honest and his voice it's it's like him

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.459 
honest and his voice it's it's like him
and<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.299> band<00:04:15.479> are<00:04:15.629> really<00:04:15.989> worried<00:04:16.380> about

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:16.469 
and the band are really worried about

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.800 
and the band are really worried about
how<00:04:17.039> it<00:04:17.250> sounds<00:04:17.609> at<00:04:17.729> all<00:04:17.820> whether<00:04:18.180> or<00:04:18.419> not<00:04:18.539> it's

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
how it sounds at all whether or not it's

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.020 
how it sounds at all whether or not it's
just<00:04:19.109> underwhelming<00:04:20.070> during<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.519> point<00:04:20.789> that

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
just underwhelming during a point that

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.969 
just underwhelming during a point that
is<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.750> guess<00:04:22.079> shooting<00:04:22.440> for<00:04:22.590> something<00:04:22.620> high

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
is I guess shooting for something high

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.909 
is I guess shooting for something high
energy<00:04:23.460> or<00:04:23.610> just<00:04:24.169> warbling

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
energy or just warbling

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.999 
energy or just warbling
awkwardly<00:04:26.819> or<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:27.449> off-pitch<00:04:28.439> on<00:04:28.710> some<00:04:28.919> of

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
awkwardly or just off-pitch on some of

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.469 
awkwardly or just off-pitch on some of
the<00:04:29.069> moments<00:04:29.249> where<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.580> seems<00:04:29.819> like<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.270> band

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
the moments where it seems like the band

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.059 
the moments where it seems like the band
is<00:04:30.629> pulling<00:04:31.229> together<00:04:31.349> something<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.860> little

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
is pulling together something a little

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.279 
is pulling together something a little
more<00:04:32.099> ballad<00:04:32.849> like<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.509> do<00:04:33.599> think<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.960> guitars

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
more ballad like I do think the guitars

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.439 
more ballad like I do think the guitars
overall<00:04:34.740> on<00:04:34.889> this<00:04:35.069> album<00:04:35.490> are<00:04:35.639> better<00:04:35.939> they're

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
overall on this album are better they're

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.899 
overall on this album are better they're
more<00:04:36.689> ferocious<00:04:36.900> it's<00:04:37.680> more<00:04:37.949> nasty<00:04:38.249> that's

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
more ferocious it's more nasty that's

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.450 
more ferocious it's more nasty that's
just<00:04:39.150> showing<00:04:39.479> those<00:04:39.659> canines<00:04:40.529> and<00:04:41.039> as<00:04:41.279> far<00:04:41.400> as

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
just showing those canines and as far as

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.489 
just showing those canines and as far as
guitars<00:04:41.909> and<00:04:42.210> drums<00:04:42.270> locking<00:04:43.020> together<00:04:43.139> and

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:43.499 
guitars and drums locking together and

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.200 
guitars and drums locking together and
making<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.889> groove<00:04:44.159> just<00:04:44.340> making<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.699> tough-ass

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
making a groove just making a tough-ass

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.260 
making a groove just making a tough-ass
vibe<00:04:45.569> songs<00:04:45.990> like<00:04:46.289> Dee<00:04:47.009> Dee's<00:04:47.189> dirty<00:04:47.789> deal<00:04:48.060> or

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
vibe songs like Dee Dee's dirty deal or

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.969 
vibe songs like Dee Dee's dirty deal or
ready<00:04:48.479> to<00:04:48.569> die<00:04:48.779> these<00:04:48.840> songs<00:04:49.259> really<00:04:49.620> have

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
ready to die these songs really have

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.219 
ready to die these songs really have
their<00:04:50.219> stuff<00:04:50.520> together<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.419> song<00:04:51.599> gun<00:04:51.930> 2

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
their stuff together and the song gun 2

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.110 
their stuff together and the song gun 2
is<00:04:52.439> pretty<00:04:52.710> good<00:04:52.979> as<00:04:53.189> far<00:04:53.370> as<00:04:53.430> guitars<00:04:53.909> and

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
is pretty good as far as guitars and

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.269 
is pretty good as far as guitars and
drums<00:04:54.150> go<00:04:54.569> but<00:04:54.810> there's<00:04:55.409> so<00:04:55.560> many<00:04:55.650> tracks<00:04:56.039> on

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:56.279 
drums go but there's so many tracks on

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.499 
drums go but there's so many tracks on
this<00:04:56.400> album<00:04:56.639> I<00:04:56.819> feel<00:04:56.999> like<00:04:57.120> would<00:04:57.240> have<00:04:57.360> gone

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
this album I feel like would have gone

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.110 
this album I feel like would have gone
over<00:04:57.569> so<00:04:58.020> much<00:04:58.229> better<00:04:58.560> if<00:04:58.860> agiza<00:04:59.639> vocals

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
over so much better if agiza vocals

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.890 
over so much better if agiza vocals
weren't<00:05:00.509> so<00:05:00.900> just<00:05:01.409> a<00:05:01.819> flat<00:05:02.819> overall<00:05:03.509> I<00:05:03.810> did

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
weren't so just a flat overall I did

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.689 
weren't so just a flat overall I did
think<00:05:04.319> this<00:05:04.409> album<00:05:04.620> was<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:04.949> step<00:05:05.279> up<00:05:05.430> from<00:05:05.610> the

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
think this album was a step up from the

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.390 
think this album was a step up from the
weirdness<00:05:06.139> however<00:05:07.139> that<00:05:08.039> doesn't

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
weirdness however that doesn't

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.969 
weirdness however that doesn't
necessarily<00:05:08.580> mean<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.599> I<00:05:10.169> enjoyed<00:05:10.740> it

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
necessarily mean that I enjoyed it

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.559 
necessarily mean that I enjoyed it
though<00:05:11.460> there<00:05:11.669> were<00:05:11.759> some<00:05:11.969> bright<00:05:12.180> spots

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
though there were some bright spots

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.119 
though there were some bright spots
coming<00:05:12.960> out<00:05:13.050> of<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.259> guitars<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.860> drums

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:14.129 
coming out of the guitars and the drums

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.540 
coming out of the guitars and the drums
together<00:05:15.029> I<00:05:15.889> didn't<00:05:16.889> really<00:05:17.099> care<00:05:17.279> for<00:05:17.339> the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
together I didn't really care for the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.850 
together I didn't really care for the
vocals<00:05:17.939> I'm<00:05:18.180> not<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.360> single<00:05:18.779> song<00:05:19.080> there<00:05:19.740> were

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
vocals I'm not a single song there were

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.100 
vocals I'm not a single song there were
some<00:05:20.129> tracks<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:21.060> didn't<00:05:21.659> really<00:05:21.900> care

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
some tracks that I didn't really care

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.200 
some tracks that I didn't really care
for<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.409> mix<00:05:22.650> either<00:05:22.860> or<00:05:23.669> it<00:05:23.789> felt<00:05:23.999> like<00:05:24.089> the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
for the mix either or it felt like the

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.850 
for the mix either or it felt like the
guitars<00:05:24.509> were<00:05:24.569> turned<00:05:24.930> up<00:05:25.080> so<00:05:25.259> high<00:05:25.529> I<00:05:25.560> can

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
guitars were turned up so high I can

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.619 
guitars were turned up so high I can
really<00:05:26.069> appreciate<00:05:26.490> much<00:05:26.909> of<00:05:27.029> anything<00:05:27.270> else

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:27.629 
really appreciate much of anything else

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.709 
really appreciate much of anything else
in<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.499> mix<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.099> like<00:05:30.029> I<00:05:30.180> mentioned<00:05:30.240> toward

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
in the mix and like I mentioned toward

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:32.059 
in the mix and like I mentioned toward
the<00:05:30.779> beginning<00:05:30.900> of<00:05:31.169> this<00:05:31.289> review<00:05:31.529> there<00:05:31.830> were

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
the beginning of this review there were
