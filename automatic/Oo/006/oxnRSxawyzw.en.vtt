keep this car and have it forever you
know<00:03:45.390> like<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> said<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:46.109> bring<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
know like I said you can bring it to the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.020 
know like I said you can bring it to the
Custom<00:03:46.859> Shop<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.190> can't<00:03:47.400> do<00:03:47.549> too<00:03:47.700> much<00:03:47.730> with

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
Custom Shop you can't do too much with

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.330 
Custom Shop you can't do too much with
it<00:03:48.090> obviously<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.320> is<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.560> alien<00:03:50.040> car<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.220> think

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
it obviously it is the alien car I think

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.069 
it obviously it is the alien car I think
it's<00:03:50.549> similar<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.910> single-player<00:03:51.540> where<00:03:51.989> you

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
it's similar to single-player where you

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.420 
it's similar to single-player where you
can't<00:03:52.290> really<00:03:52.470> customize<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.980> too<00:03:53.100> much<00:03:53.250> you

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
can't really customize it too much you

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.220 
can't really customize it too much you

unless<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.750> do<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> glitch<00:04:13.200> where<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.620> sell

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
unless you do the glitch where you sell

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.320 
unless you do the glitch where you sell
cars<00:04:14.010> over<00:04:14.280> five<00:04:14.459> hundred

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330
