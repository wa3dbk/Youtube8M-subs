on<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.640> imaging<00:02:46.090> site<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.590> they<00:02:47.740> now<00:02:47.890> have

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
on the imaging site so they now have

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.940 
on the imaging site so they now have
basically

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
basically

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.000 
basically
it<00:02:51.160> has<00:02:51.400> image<00:02:52.090> imaging<00:02:52.810> album

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
it has image imaging album

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.390 
it has image imaging album
example

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.220 

you<00:02:58.640> can<00:02:58.790> organize<00:02:59.000> your<00:02:59.420> pictures

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230

you can organize your pictures
by<00:03:01.650> my<00:03:02.069> tags<00:03:02.400> or<00:03:02.819> by<00:03:02.970> dates<00:03:03.239> when<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.810> have

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
by my tags or by dates when you have

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.640 
by my tags or by dates when you have
yeah

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.210 

you<00:03:10.189> can

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.130 

you<00:03:13.670> can<00:03:13.850> directly<00:03:14.210> upload<00:03:14.330> them<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.050> for

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
you can directly upload them so for

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.220 
you can directly upload them so for
example<00:03:15.530> if<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.740> if<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.130> wanted<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:16.990> upload<00:03:17.990> these

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
example if I if I wanted to upload these

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.820 
example if I if I wanted to upload these
things<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.680> OB<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.880> get<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.600> just<00:03:20.780> select<00:03:21.560> here

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
things to OB I get that just select here

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.910 
things to OB I get that just select here
share<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.340> o<00:03:22.460> V<00:03:22.640> or<00:03:23.330> Flickr<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.530> then

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
share on o V or Flickr and then

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.160 
share on o V or Flickr and then
basically<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:25.760> appears<00:03:26.060> right<00:03:26.210> away<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.750> my

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
basically it appears right away on my

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.280 
basically it appears right away on my
own

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
own

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.979 
own
and<00:03:28.500> as<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.549> take<00:03:29.760> pictures<00:03:30.180> because<00:03:30.629> of<00:03:30.900> the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
and as I take pictures because of the

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.589 
and as I take pictures because of the
GPS<00:03:31.439> built-in<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.610> report<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.480> location

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
GPS built-in I can report the location

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.229 
GPS built-in I can report the location
of<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.140> picture<00:03:34.500> directly<00:03:35.040> inside<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.090> that

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
of the picture directly inside so that

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.690 
of the picture directly inside so that
you<00:03:37.079> know<00:03:37.200> my<00:03:37.650> friends<00:03:37.980> might<00:03:38.129> see<00:03:38.340> where<00:03:38.579> I'm

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
you know my friends might see where I'm

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.030 
you know my friends might see where I'm
traveling<00:03:39.209> what<00:03:39.420> locations<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.049> go<00:03:40.260> or<00:03:40.890> if<00:03:40.950> I

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
traveling what locations I go or if I

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.530 
traveling what locations I go or if I
want<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.310> take<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.459> memory<00:03:41.700> like<00:03:42.390> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
want to take a memory like the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.149 
want to take a memory like the
restaurant<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.079> take<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> picture<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.829> they

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
restaurant I take a picture of it they

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.770 
restaurant I take a picture of it they
don't

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
don't

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.370 
don't
maybe<00:03:45.290> think<00:03:45.560> that<00:03:45.710> through<00:03:45.920> that

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
maybe think that through that

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.880 
maybe think that through that
the<00:03:47.440> location<00:03:48.100> as<00:03:48.220> well

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.100 

Maps<00:03:52.370> as<00:03:52.730> well<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.270> has<00:03:53.390> a<00:03:53.420> new<00:03:53.720> release<00:03:53.960> of

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
Maps as well so it has a new release of

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.520 
Maps as well so it has a new release of
the<00:03:54.260> no<00:03:54.380> p.m.<00:03:54.590> absolutely<00:03:55.130> integrated<00:03:55.460> GPS

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
the no p.m. absolutely integrated GPS

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.350 
the no p.m. absolutely integrated GPS
basically<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:58.610> nest<00:03:58.790> remote<00:03:59.180> as

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
basically you have the nest remote as

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.540 
basically you have the nest remote as
well<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.050> you<00:04:00.230> can<00:04:00.320> upgrade<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.830> eat<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.280> voice

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
well so you can upgrade to eat a voice

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.910 
well so you can upgrade to eat a voice
navigation<00:04:01.820> for<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.840> car

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.050 

or<00:04:06.220> the

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.699 

optimize<00:04:11.569> for<00:04:11.780> pedestrian<00:04:12.260> low<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:12.650> you

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
optimize for pedestrian low so you

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.290 
optimize for pedestrian low so you
example<00:04:13.310> if<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.490> want<00:04:13.640> to<00:04:13.730> go<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.940> subway

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
example if you want to go to subway

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.289 
example if you want to go to subway
stations<00:04:14.950> or<00:04:15.950> you<00:04:16.250> want<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.549> know<00:04:16.820> how<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.060> walk

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
stations or you want to know how to walk

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.160 
stations or you want to know how to walk

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
a lot more details also on the maps

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.350 
a lot more details also on the maps
including<00:04:24.350> satellite<00:04:24.590> images<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.520> can<00:04:26.210> show

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
including satellite images I can show
