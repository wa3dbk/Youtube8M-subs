00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.160
 at the place of the alleged tomb 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.170
 Mary 6 and found new finds 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.210
 now excavated in the historical part 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.340
 cities are interested and geologists 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.410
 who set about studying the samples 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.630
 land that can shed light 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.080
 my colleague recognized these studies 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.180
 Dmitry Kovalev having opened the graves which 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.279
 were under a concrete sarcophagus 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.650
 archaeologists continued their research 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.060
 under the brickwork of the walls and the female 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 members of the expedition 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.650
 discovered here are layers of soil 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.530
 at first nobody thought it was 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.399
 unique find conclusion later 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.579
 made geologists in stones soil literally 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.100
 mothballed 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.170
 more than 400 years 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.640
 Total 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.620
 stop the way back process then 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.110
 there are processes that go in. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.379
 actually up to human exposure to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.100
 you face a vision of up to 1 pack of them here in 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.100
 this soil as it were 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.520
 natural form preserved such 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.040
 Chuvash soil experts did not meet 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.440
 nor where expertise usually comes in 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.640
 samples that were broken by precipitation and 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.010
 groundwater 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.230
 experts call it secondary 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.120
 material in the soil which is found in 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.050
 excavation is the benchmark for 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.290
 research we can compare how much 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.400
 a change in this type of soil has occurred 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.990
 Chuvash Republic or in some other 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.210
 that zone which is close to us by 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.560
 climatic characteristics in 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.619
 the result of man-made here and then 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.990
 have everyone understand that the track was dropping 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.940
 was reduced then plowing was done 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.250
 soil samples are taken using 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.830
 special tools drill ground 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.350
 geologists do not immediately succeed 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.509
 hard layers interfere further 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.509
 have to work in several hands 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.430
 the soil was sent to the laboratory by geologists 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.680
 will be able to accurately determine what grew 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.360
 in this place many centuries ago this 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.640
 territory in the sixteenth centuries was 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.200
 do coffins occupied an earlier picture 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.880
 the experts will also try 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.500
 simulate the types of kovalev nikolai 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.500
 Yakovlev Republics
