is<00:00:08.830> it<00:00:09.040> is<00:00:09.400> in<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:10.719> just<00:00:10.900> won't<00:00:11.139> start<00:00:11.230> I<00:00:11.879> had<00:00:12.879> a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
is it is in it just won't start I had a

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.879 
is it is in it just won't start I had a
code<00:00:13.150> for<00:00:13.360> a<00:00:13.389> camshaft<00:00:13.660> sensor<00:00:14.049> so<00:00:14.469> I<00:00:14.530> went<00:00:14.830> to

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
code for a camshaft sensor so I went to

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.890 
code for a camshaft sensor so I went to
go<00:00:15.009> up<00:00:15.160> to<00:00:15.339> the<00:00:15.459> customer's<00:00:15.820> house<00:00:16.570> and

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
go up to the customer's house and

go up to the customer's house and
checked<00:00:17.140> it<00:00:17.200> out<00:00:17.910> what<00:00:18.910> I<00:00:18.940> did<00:00:19.180> was<00:00:19.330> I<00:00:19.450> actually

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
checked it out what I did was I actually

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.840 
checked it out what I did was I actually
yanked<00:00:20.470> on<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.710> engine<00:00:21.040> something<00:00:21.610> like<00:00:21.700> this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
yanked on the engine something like this

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.380 
yanked on the engine something like this
ain't<00:00:22.300> it<00:00:22.420> up<00:00:22.540> and<00:00:22.720> down<00:00:22.870> or<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.710> camshaft

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
ain't it up and down or the camshaft

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.970 
ain't it up and down or the camshaft
wiring<00:00:25.390> was<00:00:25.510> that<00:00:25.720> and<00:00:25.990> they<00:00:26.260> actually<00:00:26.440> lit

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
wiring was that and they actually lit

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.820 
wiring was that and they actually lit
right<00:00:27.160> up<00:00:27.220> by<00:00:28.120> right<00:00:28.360> up<00:00:28.540> and<00:00:28.780> had<00:00:29.560> all<00:00:29.710> these

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
right up by right up and had all these

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.270 
right up by right up and had all these
posts<00:00:30.220> for<00:00:30.340> that<00:00:30.490> sensor<00:00:31.000> so<00:00:31.920> when<00:00:32.920> I<00:00:32.950> seen<00:00:33.190> in

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
posts for that sensor so when I seen in

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.460 
posts for that sensor so when I seen in
the<00:00:33.340> past<00:00:33.490> is<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.790> engine<00:00:34.210> loom<00:00:34.330> is<00:00:34.510> not<00:00:35.230> all

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
the past is the engine loom is not all

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.490 
the past is the engine loom is not all
that<00:00:35.860> maybe<00:00:36.790> contact<00:00:37.360> but<00:00:37.930> it's<00:00:38.050> a<00:00:38.140> special

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
that maybe contact but it's a special

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.430 
that maybe contact but it's a special
kind<00:00:38.530> of<00:00:38.850> loom<00:00:39.850> but<00:00:40.570> yeah<00:00:40.750> it's<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.200> show<00:00:41.410> that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
kind of loom but yeah it's a show that

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.960 
kind of loom but yeah it's a show that
wire<00:00:41.770> and<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.220> second<00:00:42.550> i'll<00:00:42.640> show<00:00:42.820> you<00:00:42.880> but

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.060 

here's<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.390> camshaft<00:00:55.870> sensor<00:00:56.050> connector

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.079 

tens<00:01:01.910> look<00:01:02.120> good<00:01:02.300> everything<00:01:02.840> is<00:01:03.079> if<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:03.890> are

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089

tens look good everything is if you are
what<00:01:05.089> it<00:01:05.210> is<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.440> civic<00:01:06.830> wiring<00:01:07.640> as<00:01:08.180> you

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
what it is is the civic wiring as you

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.550 
what it is is the civic wiring as you
can<00:01:08.780> see<00:01:09.430> there's<00:01:10.430> awesome<00:01:11.000> their<00:01:11.840> wiring<00:01:12.140> and

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
can see there's awesome their wiring and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.640 
can see there's awesome their wiring and
you<00:01:13.010> notice<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.460> they<00:01:13.850> are<00:01:13.880> twisted<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.750> it

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
you notice that they are twisted and it

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.830 
you notice that they are twisted and it
has<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:15.800> special<00:01:16.250> kind<00:01:16.460> of<00:01:16.550> shielding<00:01:16.970> for<00:01:17.540> so

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
has a special kind of shielding for so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.630 
has a special kind of shielding for so
you'll<00:01:17.990> get<00:01:18.140> no<00:01:18.229> RF<00:01:18.650> signal<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.520> know

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
you'll get no RF signal you know

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.050 
you'll get no RF signal you know
interference<00:01:20.300> so<00:01:21.170> as<00:01:21.320> soon<00:01:21.440> as<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:21.700> hugs<00:01:22.700> on<00:01:22.910> it

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
interference so as soon as I hugs on it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.410 
interference so as soon as I hugs on it
I<00:01:23.210> think<00:01:23.420> from<00:01:23.600> right<00:01:23.810> here<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:24.020> jugs<00:01:24.410> on<00:01:24.619> it<00:01:24.770> I
