00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.769
 bots in call of duty 4 is very very 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 simple of the easiest things that 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.329
 there is worth putting a lot this tutorial 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.190

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.170
 and now you see you learn to move a lot of vale 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.719
 first of all if you want the mossos 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.110
 you download this file, then leave it in 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.579
 description of the link as the link of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.920
 mean fierce to a multiple to where the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.010
 rise is worth once you have it is that nothing 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.110
 of are five seconds to download 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.110
 here you have the folder with let's say 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.399
 is the base the mod goes of this is are 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.780
 instructions that may take away and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.230
 everything goes to put it we go to our 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.600
 the call of duty 4 folder 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.780
 It's usually like that, maybe you have that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.350
 instinct is worth my pc to taste hard drive 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.440
 you go to program files click on the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.560
 of class that brings you here steam steam 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.270
 apps like in this and we have the games 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.730
 that you have in steam in this case is that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.060
 at 24 you are already seeing that you have 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.580
 all your everything the content of the game 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.030
 and here is a folder called mods 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.580
 and if it is in three it is worth since I 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.250
 I have some I have a few and 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.170
 you only take this folder and the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.560
 drag is here I already have it I'm not going to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.649
 put but calm that is this 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.049
 and ready is this nothing that is put 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.600
 this here and that's it 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.119
 then to put them a lot of games 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.759
 I will leave the command in the description of 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.500
 video is worth opening the console and 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.899
 you know open if there is not a day of a 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.490
 well-explained and long tutorial 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.530
 many things you can do in box 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.070
 because the things you can do are amazing 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.640
 do and is to do so put bar svr 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:15.140
 low bar fish bots and the number by 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.900
 example 20 but clear to have forgiveness of 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.940
 it's not that you create a server to be able 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.940
 play so maximum number of players 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.300
 and see that you can put them on the webs 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.430
 OK 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.020
 I leave the description this to see 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.390
 tips that I give you 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.860
 do not put many is a human chaos type 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.860
 if you love yourself as well as bad it goes very well 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.010
 because I train a little here and things 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.360
 they were very good we were putting 30 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.310
 I think it's the maximum because then 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.610
 It's a little chaos but good if you want 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.740
 try it there I leave it and they are very 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.480
 bastards are guys those black ops that 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.880
 even if they do not see you they turn around suddenly and 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.850
 for me to greece there are more commands from 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.920
 you host part in this way to lower the 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.950
 rhythm in the range its the difficulty and 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.070
 all this because is not it difficult 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.920
 not much less, but sometimes I fear you 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.870
 they kill without green you almost know many call 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.850
 titan I do not know if yes, if you can touch 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.230
 all this I think so if you do not look at it 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.100
 to touch up and myself personally 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.260
 since I started from scratch do the mod and nothing 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.620
 I leave it here now I leave you a 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.870
 fragment with the ak-47 that start at 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.940
 play with that and done less I'll leave a 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.290
 example so you can see how it works and 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.690
 such and nothing a pleasure but last ask 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.460
 sorry your inactive days have been 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.790
 parties of my town I have had 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.270
 exams etc but calm that I come back 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.610
 the normality is missing 4 subs for 2 500 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.320
 I said it rudd no pardon I said it to see 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.770

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.780
