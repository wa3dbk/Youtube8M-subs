what<00:02:22.610> I'll<00:02:22.730> do<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.239> just<00:02:23.510> go<00:02:23.690> ahead<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.580> scribe

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
what I'll do is just go ahead and scribe

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.360 
what I'll do is just go ahead and scribe
this<00:02:25.850> out<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.269> know<00:02:26.299> mark<00:02:26.630> around<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:27.370> also

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
this out you know mark around it also

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.430 
this out you know mark around it also
forgot<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.850> cut<00:02:29.090> off<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.390> in<00:02:29.660> flush<00:02:30.080> with<00:02:30.350> the

forgot to cut off this in flush with the
wood<00:02:30.560> going<00:02:30.950> down<00:02:31.190> through<00:02:31.400> there<00:02:31.640> that's<00:02:31.970> a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
wood going down through there that's a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.850 
wood going down through there that's a
big<00:02:32.239> whoopsie<00:02:32.660> but<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.870> went<00:02:33.200> ahead<00:02:33.290> marked<00:02:33.709> at

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
big whoopsie but I went ahead marked at

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.370 
big whoopsie but I went ahead marked at
least<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.400> cut<00:02:35.269> out<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.540> cardboard<00:02:35.870> when

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
least I can cut out the cardboard when

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.560 
least I can cut out the cardboard when
then<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.920> take<00:02:37.250> this<00:02:37.430> off<00:02:37.640> after<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.180> hot<00:02:38.360> glue

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
then I take this off after the hot glue

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.160 
then I take this off after the hot glue
dries<00:02:39.370> then<00:02:40.370> that'll<00:02:40.670> be<00:02:40.700> squared<00:02:41.690> up<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.080> I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
dries then that'll be squared up so I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.330 
dries then that'll be squared up so I
can<00:02:42.320> put<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.739> on<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.920> wood<00:02:43.390> we're<00:02:44.390> gonna<00:02:45.340> soon

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
can put it on the wood we're gonna soon

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.600 
can put it on the wood we're gonna soon
as<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.780> cools<00:02:47.780> down<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:48.049> bit<00:02:48.280> put<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.370> up<00:02:49.459> on

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
as this cools down a bit put it up on

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.630 
as this cools down a bit put it up on
the<00:02:49.700> wood<00:02:49.880> then<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:51.100> after<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.160> cut<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:52.519> of

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
the wood then and after I cut that of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.860 
the wood then and after I cut that of
course<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.230> mark<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.350> out<00:02:54.500> but<00:02:54.739> I'll<00:02:54.830> have<00:02:55.040> to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
course and mark it out but I'll have to

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.660 
course and mark it out but I'll have to
after<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:56.900> mark<00:02:57.799> it<00:02:57.950> out<00:02:58.040> I'm<00:02:58.220> gonna<00:02:58.340> have<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.549> go

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
after I mark it out I'm gonna have to go

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.750 
after I mark it out I'm gonna have to go
back<00:02:58.700> over<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.269> there<00:02:59.450> probably<00:02:59.959> with<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
back over it there probably with the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.590 
back over it there probably with the
little<00:03:01.760> Oh<00:03:01.820> square<00:03:03.940> just<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.209> make<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.510> a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
little Oh square just to make it a

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.449 
little Oh square just to make it a
little<00:03:05.780> bit<00:03:06.049> shorter<00:03:06.560> it's<00:03:06.769> a<00:03:06.890> quarter<00:03:07.250> inch

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
little bit shorter it's a quarter inch

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.490 
little bit shorter it's a quarter inch
will<00:03:08.090> allow<00:03:08.360> for<00:03:08.769> carpet<00:03:09.769> on<00:03:09.890> both<00:03:10.130> sides<00:03:10.430> a

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
will allow for carpet on both sides a

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.870 
will allow for carpet on both sides a
little<00:03:12.500> out<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.709> go<00:03:12.860> around<00:03:13.040> both<00:03:13.250> sides<00:03:13.580> so

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
little out to go around both sides so

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.380 
little out to go around both sides so
about<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> quarter<00:03:14.420> inch<00:03:14.450> shorter<00:03:16.239> go<00:03:17.239> ahead

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
about a quarter inch shorter go ahead

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.360 
about a quarter inch shorter go ahead
now<00:03:17.600> wait<00:03:18.110> for<00:03:18.350> this<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.500> cool<00:03:18.829> it's<00:03:19.160> still<00:03:19.340> a

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
now wait for this to cool it's still a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.900 
now wait for this to cool it's still a
little<00:03:19.489> tacky<00:03:19.790> I'm<00:03:20.150> feeling<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:22.549> can<00:03:22.670> hear<00:03:22.820> it

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
little tacky I'm feeling you can hear it

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.080 
little tacky I'm feeling you can hear it
-<00:03:23.060> kinda<00:03:25.150> anyways<00:03:26.180> that'd<00:03:26.720> be<00:03:26.750> next<00:03:27.880> here<00:03:28.880> is

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
- kinda anyways that'd be next here is

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.089 
- kinda anyways that'd be next here is
the<00:03:29.300> design<00:03:29.480> all<00:03:29.900> cut<00:03:30.290> out<00:03:30.470> right<00:03:30.739> here<00:03:31.040> for

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
we've done here is after we got the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.850 
we've done here is after we got the
plywood<00:03:57.100> cut<00:03:57.370> out<00:03:57.550> we<00:03:58.050> set<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.170> on<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.410> deck<00:03:59.620> in

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
plywood cut out we set it on the deck in

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.680 
plywood cut out we set it on the deck in
there<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:00.370> had<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:00.610> all<00:04:00.760> squared<00:04:01.209> up<00:04:01.510> just

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
there and had it all squared up just

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.600 
there and had it all squared up just
like<00:04:01.780> we're<00:04:01.930> going<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.110> want<00:04:02.319> it<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.620> we

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
like we're going to want it and we

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.940 
like we're going to want it and we
clamped<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.390> down<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.470> way<00:04:05.620> we<00:04:05.800> can

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
clamped it down to it that way we can

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.820 
clamped it down to it that way we can
bring<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.310> plywood<00:04:06.760> over<00:04:06.880> here<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:08.530> could

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
bring the plywood over here and we could

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.150 
bring the plywood over here and we could
work<00:04:09.580> with<00:04:09.610> it<00:04:09.970> by<00:04:10.810> marking<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.530> out<00:04:11.680> in<00:04:11.890> here

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
work with it by marking it out in here

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.530 
work with it by marking it out in here
and<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.519> had<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.760> mark<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.060> on<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.269> side<00:04:13.480> that

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
and I had to mark it on this side that
