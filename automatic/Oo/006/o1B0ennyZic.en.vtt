00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.949
 hello friends a warm greeting from your 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.990
 marcelo good coach newly arrived 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.869
 from whom and again the same question 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.270
 it seems to be the million dollar question that 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.849
 I can do what I should not eat 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.039
 for more good results like 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.500
 I always say are four things that 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.680
 we must avoid to get better 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.680
 results the exercise is fundamental 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.629
 to get faster results but 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.239
 the exercise is simply 30 per 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.239
 hundred of all the effort the food is 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.280
 70 percent to get benefits 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.040
 or faster result then the 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.890
 four the four things that I always say 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.309
 that you have to minimize because it's very good 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.890
 difficult to break bad habits then 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.100
 must be minimized so that the body 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.340
 get used to this new habit and so not 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.680
 it's in that whim of eating meals 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.320
 sugary for example the sugar what 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.780
 first you have to minimize the second 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.090
 it's the fritters that is because it's pure 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.880
 frying fat are not good and what 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.830
 It also makes them clog the arteries that 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.390
 is where the blood circulates and there comes 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.600
 blood pressure and many many 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.659
 other things that we can list that are 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.250
 bad are the fat the writing is that 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.670
 minimize and you can eliminate a lot 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.770
 best 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.979
 there are many foods that can be changed 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.110
 from the fry to the oven 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.210
 they are healthier then we said the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.759
 sugar is unfortunately hidden 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.030
 everything you have to minimize the consumption of 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.310
 sugar 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.290
 it's the fritters that is not for nothing 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.049
 good and is harmful to health 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.640
 because it covers the arteries the third one is 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.220
 the white flours the white flours 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.610
 they have high caloric content and the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.790
 last day that I will hate many is 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.619
 alcohol alcohol alcohol is your 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.020
 language there are many times that people 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.840
 man mainly from back what 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.380
 we see if skinny and spinning have 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.050
 a keen good thing that's pure and with 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.120
 the alcohol unfortunately comes to us 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.470
 here to men and women to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.570
 us in other parts of the body 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.769
 also as under the French laurent 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.959
 and vagina tail then four things that 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.459
 you have to minimize and you have to record it 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.830
 head because it forms 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.450
 exercises that they do to me if they do not see me and 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.190
 I minimize these four things are not going to 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.540
 have results and they will get angry with 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.100
 yourselves that you never see 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.000
 results then again 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.680
 list are the sugar the flours 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.540
 white the fritters and was the cob 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.820
 then in my friends and my friends already 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.580
 they know it but also the results in 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.260
 the gym and they kill themselves working is 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.810
 because somewhere they are doing something 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.720
 wrong check if they are consuming other 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.770
 four things incidiÃ³ are consuming 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.900
 in great quantities 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.030
 Of course they will not see results 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.430
