hi<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.629> was<00:00:06.779> watching<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.259> Steve<00:00:07.560> Ramsey<00:00:07.859> video

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
hi I was watching a Steve Ramsey video

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.400 
hi I was watching a Steve Ramsey video
the<00:00:08.550> other<00:00:08.670> day<00:00:08.880> he<00:00:09.510> was<00:00:09.570> making<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.080> project

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
the other day he was making a project

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.240 
the other day he was making a project
and<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.250> scrap<00:00:11.670> wood<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.330> thought<00:00:13.290> what<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> great

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
and a scrap wood I thought what a great

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.110 
and a scrap wood I thought what a great
idea

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
idea

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.070 
idea
I've<00:00:15.480> got<00:00:15.690> truckloads<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.650> stuff<00:00:16.890> exhibit<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
I've got truckloads this stuff exhibit a

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.720 
I've got truckloads this stuff exhibit a
B<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.439> C<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:21.170> with<00:00:22.170> all<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.410> scrap<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.310> since

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
B and C so with all that scrap and since

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.960 
B and C so with all that scrap and since
it's<00:00:23.910> Christmas<00:00:24.090> time<00:00:24.600> maybe<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.140> great<00:00:25.350> idea

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
it's Christmas time maybe a great idea

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.500 
it's Christmas time maybe a great idea
to<00:00:26.970> make<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.390> really<00:00:28.019> simple<00:00:29.119> Christmas<00:00:30.119> tree

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
to make a really simple Christmas tree

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.560 
to make a really simple Christmas tree
so<00:00:31.199> first<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:32.040> need<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> build<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.700> crate<00:00:33.030> for

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
so first up we need to build a crate for

00:00:33.570 --> 00:01:18.570 
so first up we need to build a crate for
the<00:00:33.660> base<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.559> tree

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.130 

so<00:01:19.580> that's<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.030> base<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.720> Christmas<00:01:21.110> tree

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
so that's the base of the Christmas tree

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.920 
so that's the base of the Christmas tree
all<00:01:21.830> done<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.730> I<00:01:22.910> reckon<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.330> looks<00:01:23.570> pretty

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
all done and I reckon it looks pretty

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.260 
all done and I reckon it looks pretty
good<00:01:24.170> now<00:01:24.710> all<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:24.950> need<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.250> do<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.610> put<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.910> block

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
good now all I need to do is put a block

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.840 
good now all I need to do is put a block
of<00:01:27.070> for<00:01:28.070> before<00:01:28.540> into<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.660> bottom<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:31.670> that

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
of for before into the bottom of that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.350 
of for before into the bottom of that
Christmas<00:01:32.300> tree<00:01:32.330> base<00:01:32.890> crate<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.850> that's

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
Christmas tree base crate and that's

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.140 
Christmas tree base crate and that's
what<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.840> Christmas<00:01:36.229> tree<00:01:36.650> will<00:01:37.040> go<00:01:37.190> into<00:01:37.430> now

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
what the Christmas tree will go into now

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.180 
what the Christmas tree will go into now
I'm<00:01:38.240> going<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.540> screw<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.050> in<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.530> not<00:01:39.830> nail

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
I'm going to screw this in and not nail

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.040 
I'm going to screw this in and not nail
it<00:01:40.400> because<00:01:40.910> when<00:01:41.060> Christmas<00:01:41.420> times<00:01:41.630> finished

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
it because when Christmas times finished

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.800 
it because when Christmas times finished
I'll<00:01:42.440> take<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.070> out<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.670> use<00:01:44.300> this<00:01:44.450> crate

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
I'll take that out and use this crate

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.130 
I'll take that out and use this crate
for<00:01:45.380> something<00:01:45.680> else<00:01:49.510> now<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.570> threaded<00:01:51.110> rod

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
for something else now the threaded rod

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.380 
for something else now the threaded rod
is<00:01:51.680> going<00:01:52.010> to<00:01:52.130> go<00:01:52.250> right<00:01:52.520> through<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
is going to go right through to the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.540 
is going to go right through to the
bottom<00:01:53.810> of<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.110> crate<00:01:54.440> I<00:01:54.740> don't<00:01:55.190> want<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.369> nut

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
bottom of the crate I don't want the nut

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.730 
bottom of the crate I don't want the nut
to<00:01:55.700> stand<00:01:55.970> proud<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.720> base<00:01:56.960> someone's

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
to stand proud of the base someone's

the actual branch starts off at two

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.509 
the actual branch starts off at two
inches<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.640> every<00:03:02.239> second<00:03:02.690> lot<00:03:03.280> drops<00:03:04.280> down

inches and every second lot drops down

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.050 
inches and every second lot drops down
or<00:03:05.090> quarter<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:06.290> an<00:03:06.500> inch<00:03:06.700> now<00:03:07.700> with<00:03:07.910> your

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
or quarter of an inch now with your

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.270 
or quarter of an inch now with your
branches<00:03:08.600> you'll<00:03:09.080> need<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.380> cut<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> hole<00:03:09.680> in

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
branches you'll need to cut a hole in

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.729 
branches you'll need to cut a hole in
the<00:03:10.400> end<00:03:10.639> for<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.329> trunk<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.720> go<00:03:11.840> through<00:03:12.170> now

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
the end for the trunk to go through now

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.270 
the end for the trunk to go through now
this<00:03:13.010> is

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
this is

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.650 
this is
a really<00:03:13.520> good<00:03:13.700> tip<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:15.410> prevent<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:17.390> from

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
a really good tip to prevent that from

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.380 
a really good tip to prevent that from
happening<00:03:18.250> because<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.490> hole<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:20.000> too<00:03:20.180> close

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
happening because the hole is too close

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.840 
happening because the hole is too close
to<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.690> end<00:03:20.900> get<00:03:21.770> your<00:03:21.920> length<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.250> wood<00:03:22.430> the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
to the end get your length of wood the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.930 
to the end get your length of wood the
length<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.180> timber<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:24.280> drill<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.490> holes<00:03:25.730> in

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
length of timber and drill the holes in

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.440 
length of timber and drill the holes in
it<00:03:26.060> first<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.750> then<00:03:27.350> cut<00:03:27.770> your<00:03:28.400> branches<00:03:28.940> to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
it first and then cut your branches to

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.199 
it first and then cut your branches to
length<00:03:29.920> so<00:03:30.920> now<00:03:31.100> we're<00:03:31.280> ready<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.730> assemble

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
length so now we're ready to assemble

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.880 
length so now we're ready to assemble
the<00:03:32.390> Christmas<00:03:32.780> tree<00:03:33.050> and<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:33.380> first<00:03:33.739> thing

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
the Christmas tree and the first thing

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.120 
the Christmas tree and the first thing
we<00:03:33.950> need<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.130> do<00:03:34.370> is<00:03:34.850> to<00:03:35.060> secure<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.780> track<00:03:36.170> to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
we need to do is to secure the track to

00:03:37.130 --> 00:04:05.470 
we need to do is to secure the track to
the<00:03:37.160> base<00:04:03.069> it's<00:04:04.069> now<00:04:04.250> time<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.910> start<00:04:05.030> putting

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480

now to keep it all tight and stop the

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.030

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
branches from moving around

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.400 
branches from moving around
I'm<00:04:54.220> not<00:04:54.430> tired<00:04:54.699> all<00:04:54.970> down<00:04:55.240> with<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.840> nut<00:04:56.139> and

branding

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.790 

well<00:05:46.340> that<00:05:46.490> didn't<00:05:46.790> turn<00:05:46.970> out<00:05:47.030> too<00:05:47.480> bad<00:05:47.510> I<00:05:48.110> wake

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800

that dries give it a bit of ass and then

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.430 
that dries give it a bit of ass and then
I<00:05:51.560> think<00:05:51.830> we're<00:05:52.010> ready<00:05:52.100> for<00:05:52.490> decorating<00:05:52.610> and

now just add a bit of color a bit of
shading<00:05:59.260> to<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.290> crepe<00:06:00.790> to<00:06:01.790> make<00:06:01.970> it<00:06:02.120> a<00:06:02.150> bit

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
shading to the crepe to make it a bit

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.220 
shading to the crepe to make it a bit
more<00:06:02.510> authentic<00:06:04.420> and<00:06:05.420> now<00:06:05.600> we'll<00:06:05.750> finish<00:06:05.960> off

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
more authentic and now we'll finish off

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.790 
more authentic and now we'll finish off
