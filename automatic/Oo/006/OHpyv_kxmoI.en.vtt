first<00:00:40.190> we<00:00:40.340> installed<00:00:40.670> rating<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:40.940> barrier<00:00:41.270> in

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
first we installed rating a barrier in

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.450 
first we installed rating a barrier in
part<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.110> Attic<00:00:42.500> you<00:00:42.829> can<00:00:42.980> see<00:00:43.160> from<00:00:43.280> these

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
part of the Attic you can see from these

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.520 
part of the Attic you can see from these
pictures<00:00:43.670> we<00:00:43.969> put<00:00:44.000> about<00:00:44.360> three<00:00:44.750> rows<00:00:45.500> of

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
pictures we put about three rows of

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.100 
pictures we put about three rows of
atticfoil<00:00:46.340> on<00:00:46.579> one<00:00:47.120> side<00:00:47.360> of<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.600> attic<00:00:47.930> and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
atticfoil on one side of the attic and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.619 
atticfoil on one side of the attic and
then<00:00:48.620> we<00:00:48.770> came<00:00:48.980> in<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.340> put<00:00:49.520> one<00:00:49.760> strip<00:00:50.180> off<00:00:50.450> to

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
then we came in and put one strip off to

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.389 
then we came in and put one strip off to
the<00:00:50.750> side<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.559> then<00:00:51.739> we<00:00:51.829> would<00:00:51.980> do<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.190> thermal

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
the side so then we would do the thermal

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.920 
the side so then we would do the thermal
imaging<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:53.059> can<00:00:53.210> get<00:00:53.360> a<00:00:53.390> really<00:00:53.629> good

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
imaging you can get a really good

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.260 
imaging you can get a really good
picture<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:54.559> what<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.190> looks<00:00:55.370> like<00:00:55.550> we<00:00:56.090> also

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
picture of what it looks like we also

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.260 
picture of what it looks like we also
left<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.719> end<00:00:56.870> near<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.079> gable<00:00:57.530> end<00:00:57.850> open<00:00:58.850> so

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
left the end near the gable end open so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.299 
left the end near the gable end open so
you<00:00:59.329> can<00:00:59.510> see<00:00:59.719> that<00:00:59.930> too<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:00.920> let's<00:01:01.100> take<00:01:01.280> a

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
you can see that too so let's take a

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.069 
you can see that too so let's take a
look<00:01:01.579> at<00:01:01.699> what<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.940> actual<00:01:02.090> thermal<00:01:02.570> imaging

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
look at what the actual thermal imaging

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.560 
look at what the actual thermal imaging
looks<00:01:03.590> like

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.200 

over<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.659> radiant<00:01:08.020> barrier<00:01:08.049> about<00:01:08.409> 170<00:01:09.210> 374

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
over the radiant barrier about 170 374

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.639 
over the radiant barrier about 170 374
degrees<00:01:10.539> without<00:01:11.079> the<00:01:11.350> radiant<00:01:11.619> barrier

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
degrees without the radiant barrier

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:20.849 
degrees without the radiant barrier
about<00:01:12.130> 160<00:01:13.289> 667<00:01:14.289> degrees<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.380> tests<00:01:20.590> show<00:01:20.740> an

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
about 160 667 degrees the tests show an

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.919 
about 160 667 degrees the tests show an
increase<00:01:21.189> of<00:01:21.369> about<00:01:21.459> 6<00:01:21.850> or<00:01:21.969> 7<00:01:22.030> degrees<00:01:22.569> over

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
increase of about 6 or 7 degrees over

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.870 
increase of about 6 or 7 degrees over
the<00:01:23.020> radiant<00:01:23.350> barrier<00:01:23.380> which<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:24.310> exactly

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
the radiant barrier which is exactly

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.940 
the radiant barrier which is exactly
what<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.179> Department<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.719> Energy<00:01:26.079> determined

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
what the Department of Energy determined

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.709 
what the Department of Energy determined
in<00:01:27.009> their<00:01:27.159> studies<00:01:27.579> about<00:01:28.119> two<00:01:28.359> to<00:01:28.539> ten

degrees over a radiant barrier now let's
look<00:01:31.119> at<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.329> specific<00:01:31.840> areas<00:01:32.229> over<00:01:32.829> the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
look at the specific areas over the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.399 
look at the specific areas over the

radiant barrier in the upper right the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.569 
radiant barrier in the upper right the
bare<00:01:40.929> roof<00:01:41.170> it<00:01:41.469> was<00:01:41.920> reading<00:01:42.189> about<00:01:42.599> 166<00:01:43.599> or

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
bare roof it was reading about 166 or

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.339 
bare roof it was reading about 166 or
167<00:01:45.579> degrees<00:01:45.670> if<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.539> look<00:01:46.689> at<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.899> area<00:01:47.170> to

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
167 degrees if you look at the area to

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:49.619 
167 degrees if you look at the area to
the<00:01:47.469> far<00:01:47.709> left<00:01:47.759> near<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.789> gable<00:01:49.209> end<00:01:49.360> where<00:01:49.539> we

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:49.629 
the far left near the gable end where we

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:51.839 
the far left near the gable end where we
had<00:01:49.840> no<00:01:49.869> radiant<00:01:50.469> barrier<00:01:50.799> it<00:01:51.069> was<00:01:51.549> also

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849 
had no radiant barrier it was also

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:54.539 
had no radiant barrier it was also
reading<00:01:52.179> about<00:01:52.360> 168<00:01:53.319> degrees<00:01:53.649> so<00:01:54.399> this

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
reading about 168 degrees so this

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.449 
reading about 168 degrees so this
