kind<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.690> sitting<00:00:42.930> there<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> Miami

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the previous draft now I will say that I

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
the previous draft now I will say that I
thought<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.560> situation<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
thought for the situation and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.160 
thought for the situation and
circumstance<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.750> Buffalo<00:01:22.110> Bills

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
circumstance that the Buffalo Bills

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.190 
circumstance that the Buffalo Bills
found<00:01:22.650> themselves<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.640> 2015<00:01:24.570> NFL<00:01:24.659> Draft

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.070 
found themselves in the 2015 NFL Draft
they<00:01:25.350> didn't<00:01:25.710> okay<00:01:26.250> job<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.000> thought<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.930> got

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
they didn't okay job I thought they got

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.539 
they didn't okay job I thought they got
some<00:01:28.350> guys<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> could<00:01:28.950> come<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.369> contribute

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
some guys I could come in and contribute

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.690 
some guys I could come in and contribute
I<00:01:30.409> like<00:01:31.409> some<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> things<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.460> did

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700

I like some of the things that they did
in<00:01:32.820> their<00:01:32.939> draft<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.420> thought<00:01:33.600> they<00:01:33.780> could<00:01:33.810> have

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
in their draft I thought they could have

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.289 
in their draft I thought they could have
done<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.290> lot<00:01:34.619> worse<00:01:34.890> than<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.579> did

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
done a lot worse than they actually did

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.859 
done a lot worse than they actually did
I<00:01:36.509> now<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.229> terms<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.790> draft<00:01:39.240> Oh<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.659> lot

I now in terms of this draft Oh in a lot

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.539 
I now in terms of this draft Oh in a lot
of<00:01:39.990> ways<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.439> ultimately<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.130> measured

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
Ronald Darby at a Florida State I know a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.380 
Ronald Darby at a Florida State I know a
lot<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.590> people<00:02:16.739> were<00:02:17.040> higher<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.580> PJ<00:02:18.000> Williams

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
lot of people were higher on PJ Williams

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.930 
lot of people were higher on PJ Williams
I<00:02:18.540> was<00:02:18.930> not<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.500> thought<00:02:19.920> Ronald<00:02:20.340> Darby<00:02:20.519> was

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
I was not I thought Ronald Darby was

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.490 
I was not I thought Ronald Darby was
frankly<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> better<00:02:21.660> football<00:02:22.140> player<00:02:22.170> I

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
frankly the better football player I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.080 
frankly the better football player I
thought<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.860> was<00:02:22.980> more<00:02:23.190> physical<00:02:23.610> than<00:02:23.640> PJ

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
thought it was more physical than PJ

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.490 
thought it was more physical than PJ
Williams<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.690> thought<00:02:25.080> he<00:02:25.200> had<00:02:25.230> more

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
Williams I thought he had more

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.110 
Williams I thought he had more
versatility<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.220> flexibility<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.849> terms<00:02:26.879> of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
versatility and flexibility in terms of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.690 
versatility and flexibility in terms of
what<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.330> could<00:02:27.450> do<00:02:27.569> with<00:02:27.599> him<00:02:27.870> defensively

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
what you could do with him defensively

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.190 
what you could do with him defensively
so<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.760> was<00:02:29.879> a<00:02:29.970> good<00:02:30.150> solid<00:02:30.480> pick<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
so it was a good solid pick for the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380 
so it was a good solid pick for the
Buffalo<00:02:31.620> Bills<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:32.040> round<00:02:32.280> number<00:02:32.580> two<00:02:32.790> some

Buffalo Bills in round number two some

player<00:04:43.470> this<00:04:43.919> prospect<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.759> so<00:04:44.970> far<00:04:45.240> superior

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
player this prospect is so far superior

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.110 
player this prospect is so far superior
that<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.229> have<00:04:46.470> no<00:04:46.710> choice<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.789> answer

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
that you have no choice and the answer

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.010 
that you have no choice and the answer
was<00:04:48.300> no<00:04:48.620> Sammy<00:04:49.620> Watkins<00:04:49.949> really<00:04:50.759> good<00:04:51.030> but

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
was no Sammy Watkins really good but

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.200 
was no Sammy Watkins really good but
he's<00:04:52.169> no<00:04:52.349> Odell<00:04:52.740> Beckham<00:04:53.069> jr.<00:04:53.099> and<00:04:53.669> he<00:04:54.030> might

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
he's no Odell Beckham jr. and he might

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.619 
he's no Odell Beckham jr. and he might
not<00:04:54.360> even<00:04:54.509> be<00:04:54.690> Mike<00:04:55.020> Evans<00:04:55.259> so<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.190> bills

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
not even be Mike Evans so the bills

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.350 
not even be Mike Evans so the bills
traded<00:04:57.629> up<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:58.020> get<00:04:58.469> maybe<00:04:58.979> perhaps<00:04:59.460> at<00:05:00.000> best

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
traded up to get maybe perhaps at best

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.890

a mistake because Watkins is going to be
a<00:05:28.770> really<00:05:29.159> good<00:05:29.279> NFL<00:05:29.580> player<00:05:30.000> it's<00:05:30.719> just<00:05:31.139> again

as I keep emphasizing how much better

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.110

was not a really good quarterback class
at<00:06:26.039> all<00:06:26.190> and<00:06:26.430> I<00:06:26.909> understand<00:06:27.389> why<00:06:27.479> they<00:06:27.779> didn't

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
at all and I understand why they didn't

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.809 
at all and I understand why they didn't
address<00:06:28.319> that<00:06:28.650> position<00:06:29.159> maybe<00:06:29.340> in<00:06:29.669> the

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 
address that position maybe in the

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.330 
address that position maybe in the
second<00:06:30.150> or<00:06:30.270> third<00:06:30.300> round<00:06:30.810> but<00:06:31.529> maybe<00:06:31.919> it<00:06:32.159> was<00:06:32.310> a

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
second or third round but maybe it was a

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.950 
second or third round but maybe it was a
position<00:06:32.909> they<00:06:33.029> should<00:06:33.300> have<00:06:33.419> addressed<00:06:33.659> at

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
position they should have addressed at

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.019 
position they should have addressed at
some<00:06:34.169> point<00:06:34.440> time<00:06:34.710> maybe<00:06:35.460> in<00:06:35.639> the<00:06:35.729> sixth<00:06:36.000> round

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.029 
some point time maybe in the sixth round

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.430 
some point time maybe in the sixth round
instead<00:06:36.360> of<00:06:36.509> taking<00:06:36.750> somebody<00:06:36.990> like<00:06:37.110> a<00:06:37.139> Tony

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
instead of taking somebody like a Tony

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.270 
instead of taking somebody like a Tony
Stewart<00:06:37.919> from

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
Stewart from

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.100 
Stewart from
Clemson<00:06:38.670> maybe<00:06:39.240> you<00:06:39.420> take<00:06:39.600> somebody<00:06:39.810> like<00:06:39.960> a

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
Clemson maybe you take somebody like a

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.520 
Clemson maybe you take somebody like a
crisp<00:06:41.060> crisp<00:06:42.060> honor<00:06:42.389> from<00:06:42.840> Colorado<00:06:43.260> State

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
crisp crisp honor from Colorado State

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.470 
crisp crisp honor from Colorado State
Pueblo<00:06:43.980> just<00:06:44.760> throwing<00:06:45.030> it<00:06:45.120> out<00:06:45.240> there<00:06:45.300> I

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
Pueblo just throwing it out there I

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.850 
Pueblo just throwing it out there I
still<00:06:45.690> can't<00:06:45.900> figure<00:06:46.050> out<00:06:46.139> why<00:06:46.350> he<00:06:46.560> wasn't

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
still can't figure out why he wasn't

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.180 
still can't figure out why he wasn't
drafted<00:06:47.040> um<00:06:48.110> but<00:06:49.110> in<00:06:49.290> general<00:06:49.500> I<00:06:49.919> thought<00:06:50.040> the

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
drafted um but in general I thought the

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.610 
drafted um but in general I thought the
bills<00:06:50.400> did<00:06:50.700> solid<00:06:51.270> based<00:06:51.780> off<00:06:52.080> of<00:06:52.110> the

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
bills did solid based off of the

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.470 
bills did solid based off of the
situation<00:06:53.220> they<00:06:53.340> found<00:06:53.580> themselves<00:06:53.760> in<00:06:54.150> it

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
situation they found themselves in it

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.450 
situation they found themselves in it
was<00:06:54.630> kind<00:06:54.840> of<00:06:54.900> a<00:06:54.990> c-plus<00:06:55.590> draft<00:06:56.040> type<00:06:56.280> of

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
was kind of a c-plus draft type of

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.650 
was kind of a c-plus draft type of
performance<00:06:56.639> when<00:06:57.090> you<00:06:57.150> factor<00:06:57.389> in<00:06:57.630> the

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
performance when you factor in the

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.629 
performance when you factor in the
Watkins<00:06:58.169> deal<00:06:58.440> and<00:06:58.680> this<00:06:59.100> class<00:06:59.310> could<00:06:59.550> have

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
Watkins deal and this class could have

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.580 
Watkins deal and this class could have
been<00:06:59.730> a<00:06:59.760> whole<00:06:59.940> lot<00:06:59.970> more<00:07:00.330> I<00:07:00.570> still<00:07:01.050> like<00:07:01.350> what

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
been a whole lot more I still like what

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.030 
been a whole lot more I still like what
they<00:07:01.740> did<00:07:01.800> with<00:07:01.980> the<00:07:02.310> pics<00:07:02.520> that<00:07:02.700> they<00:07:02.850> had
