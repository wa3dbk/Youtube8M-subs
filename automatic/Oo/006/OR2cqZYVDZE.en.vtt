00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
 has traction 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.420
 point 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.099
 or 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:25.080
 or sound like the national anthem in the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.869
 homeland but without lies like dad 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.470
 unclog the can since the product is what 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.720
 does matters 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.520
 It sounds great as when the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 water collides with the broken ones we go for 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.840
 forward that my car does not have 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.330
 reverse five speeds but with 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.280
 quite a diet goal for me notebooks with 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.800
 bianchi see your company no matter what 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.800
 outside but the inside does not matter the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.989
 word but the concept my accent passed 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.989
 to be of noted in taking out and science but 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.210
 is still 100% Mexican all with the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.350
 hands you have to slide us through the bid 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.140
 paranormal creex in the mythical with a 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.440
 parallel but see if you see it I bring it a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.580
 school and the talent that hurts sounds 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.480
 it sounds 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480
 yes no 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.170
 sounds good sounds sounds good as 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.360
 coins in pocket the illusion of a 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.159
 needed to hear that sound the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.310
 Eyes shine for words I am 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.439
 rapper but but he puts zero because this 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.630
 it's not fashion cheating the fuck 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.830
 listened to and the trash in place I am 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.290
 recyclable that's why it does not fix 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.450
 I have no foresight to dominate the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.420
 micro is not strong as if it were to wheel 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.090
 of fortune fortune and if love were 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.310
 money I would be a millionaire but the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.040
 money is ambition so I'm staying with 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.140
 micro letters and rhymes on stage the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.960
 love for rap does not pay any salary 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.060
 it sounds good like the song of a canary 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.460
 the cell phone rings is through the neighborhood and not 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.790
 the radio the rap keeps sounding embellishes 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.790
 my neighborhood sounds sounds good 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.820
 but sounds sounds sounds good sounds good sounds 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.820
 all right 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.410
 or not 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.550
 up in the car and me his rap with rap 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.040
 heads backwards it's more to hold on 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.930
 the disgusting fines ask how I do it 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.320
 style in the closet a breath at 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.320
 vocabulary 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.750
 ah
