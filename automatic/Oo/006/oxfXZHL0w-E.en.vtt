already<00:00:37.620> guessed<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> game<00:00:38.219> based<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
already guessed the game based on the

path<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.149> DOSBox<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.140> case<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.500> haven't

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
path and DOSBox but in case you haven't

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.910 
path and DOSBox but in case you haven't
it's<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.030> first-person<00:00:42.329> shooter<00:00:42.660> by<00:00:43.290> monolith

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it's a first-person shooter by monolith

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
it's a first-person shooter by monolith
it<00:00:44.640> was<00:00:44.760> originally<00:00:45.149> gonna<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.420> by<00:00:45.539> 3d<00:00:45.870> realms

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
it was originally gonna be by 3d realms

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.619 
it was originally gonna be by 3d realms
but<00:00:46.410> monolith<00:00:47.399> bought<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> rights<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
but monolith bought the rights to it and

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.229 
but monolith bought the rights to it and
