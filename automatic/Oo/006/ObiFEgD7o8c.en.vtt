 segovia with meters yo 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.040
 let nothing come with the story of 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.850
 cassava on high 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.350
 d'alotto aroca drawer and the uncle dynamism 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.400
 that is mondaine you go 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.400
 and my beloved 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:38.700
 Senior partner neither card or toriba and anima 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.070
 and gretel me every box and from kinect we go to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.590
 stop here you are already at that moment that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.920
 you say he's saying I understand nothing 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.300
 connie mack from 6 to caravaca night or you're 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.310
 of those who says I understand those little 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.159
 conversations do not but I do not understand what 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.399
 which says the most narrative Japanese the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.440
 description the staging does not 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.509
 well this what happens with these 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:10.470
 novels this level you need a n 2 already 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.680
 well well settled and pulling more for the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 n 1 the kind of vocabulary you're going to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.209
 find here is fictional is literary 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.459
 it's a kind of Japanese that's for nothing 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.709
 appears in the daily conversation nobody 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.230
 is going to say otorrino 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.310
 this way nobody is going to say out there 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.160
 I 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.800
 these words we usually say them 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.630
 in conversation with another kind of 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.489
 words when they are fictional 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.680
 literary as they always happen 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.800
 pull the synonyms pull the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.620
 vocabulary to make it richer for 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.300
 make it more nuanced nicer and in the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.239
 after all are words that do not 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.519
 you use for nothing if you're one of those who 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.530
 says I have cojones says I do not have 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.840
 level but I have a few balls of the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.430
 host and I recognize you because the mere 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.470
 fact that you're studying 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.519
 Japanese that you have us you have a lot 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:11.019
 value and I admire you but a moment if 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:13.900
 you have the shock level and 1828 tomato 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.680
 nudge to email is not worth the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.810
 investment of time to read this that 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.269
 I know you're passionate that I know you like 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.099
 that I know that the best of the world that to me 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.799
 the same thing happens to me and now I have the 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.549
 lucky to be able to read it very well but what 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.860
 It happens when you are a shock and a no 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.819
 is starting or in elementary shock and 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.209
 one or two is not good for this if one is 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.400
 little is good for this level you need more 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.760
 what happens you say good there are two problems 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.859
 enormously serious and it is that you will learn 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.780
 a lot of vocabulary and that's very good 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.999
 you say that bad has that 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.389
 Well, it has a very bad thing and it is 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:57.969
 that you will learn literary vocabulary from 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.489
 novel and you will be mixing it with the 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.760
 Japanese that you know about conversation and 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.799
 you'll say but this is used in conversation and 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.319
 the words that I know that I learned in 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.569
 the novel and in the comics is everything then 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.340
 it is used and what difference and you will have so many 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.949
 synonyms to say the same thing in the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.220
 head that you will lose the north you will not know 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:20.500
 that is practical and that is not practical 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.530
 will create more confusion and what not 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.150
 you want in Japanese is to be more 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.039
 confused and that second big problem 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.800
 what you are going to have is the investment of 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:34.120
 time as it is said in Japanese chikao goes 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.070
 gallinari time is money my friend and that 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.020
 it's very important you have a little time 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.300
 or if you are lucky to have a lot 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.120
 for this language much better but if 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.080
 you have little time you'll see what 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.900
 in 100-hour versions it is 100 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.930
 hours to collect a profit of 10 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.210
 hours in effectiveness you are not interested 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.040
 do that you will say you will be thinking already 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.220
 but if I put on such a big challenge 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.699
 like this one, what I'm going to pick up is 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.040
 a great benefit a great skill a 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.470
 great improvement does not happen this way in the 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.870
 languages ​​in the languages ​​say the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.900
 experts who know not I study 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.650
 the experts say that to improve on 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:22.120
 your language you need your level plus one more 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:25.210
 but not your level more legs is to say no 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.490
 can you be like a benin a if you do not give me 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.430
 shit that you have in front of you to a 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.160
 kaka if you have a pay you do not have to flower 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.889
 these that you are going to eat you alive 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.110
 you say good but I'm going to be strong 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.690
 It's not going to kill you, it's not worth it 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.490
 then what's worth doing is 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.530
 what we do first wait for the 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.050
 translation in Spanish in English and 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.659
 second 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.629
 more simple things than if they are in your 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.419
 level of shock and 12 for the level of 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.949
 shock and 1 are the readings that 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.629
 I have been recommending for a long time now 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.720
 learn vocabulary precisely for 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:02.610
 that vocabulary and understanding and how 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.919
 sleeves for me the perfect ones for 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.110
 learn are these two those of doraemon 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.479
 any of the new series that is the 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.940
 from platinum the old the original the one 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.819
 we all know and then this manga that 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.220
 it seems perfect to me this is very simple 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.500
 a series of 16 volumes that are read 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.199
 very fast and the Japanese I assure you that 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.539
 seem to have written the script the 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.389
 he made himself said Wells 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.620
 today 12 because it is very easy one I have 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:32.159
 also a video for there is a reading 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.900
 assisted so my nasal collide 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.569
 this microsite according to where it emits 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.190
 according to where I take 10 k because I do not 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.039
 you try to read you left the first 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.800
 page of this manga on my website so that 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:47.039
 you can read it and test yourself to see 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.870
 If what you have in front of you really 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.210
 It's at your level and it's worth the 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.050
 investment or wait for the 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.270
 movie 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.400
 that maybe it's the smartest thing in this 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.440
 but I know you, you want 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.440
 read it on your own from that
