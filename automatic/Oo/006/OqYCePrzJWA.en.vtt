00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.219
I WANT DOLLAR MEAL--

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:26.493 align:start size:97% position:3%
- FIVE RODEO CHEESEBURGERS...
- Woman over speaker:<i> 
  Five rodeos.  Okay.</i>

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:31.031
<i> ...TWO CHICKEN SANDWICH.</i>

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.834
- Woman:<i> Anything else?</i> 
- Man:<i> TWO SMALL DRINKS,</i>

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:39.372 
AND GIVE ME
A LARGE DR. PEPPER.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:43.576
-<i> $11.48.</i>

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:47.447 
<i> First window.
 Thank you.</i>

 Maria Gonzalez:
<i> WE DIDN'T EVEN THINK
 ABOUT HEALTHY EATING</i>

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:05.198 size:78% position:39%
<i> BECAUSE WE USED TO THINK
 EVERYTHING WAS HEALTHY.</i>

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:09.602
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:13.873 align:start size:91% position:9%
- HAVE A NICE DAY.
- YOU TOO.  THANK YOU
  VERY MUCH.  HERE YOU GO.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.880 
 Maria:
<i> NOW THAT I KNOW
 THAT THE FOOD IS</i>

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.884 size:78% position:39%
<i> REALLY UNHEALTHY FOR US,</i>

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:31.224 
<i> I FEEL GUILTY
 GIVING IT TO MY KIDS.</i>

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:38.631 
<i> BUT WE DON'T HAVE
 TIME TO COOK BECAUSE
 WE LEAVE AT 6:00.</i>

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:45.238 
<i> WE DON'T GET HOME
 UNTIL 9:00, 10:00 AT NIGHT.</i>

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:51.644 
<i> WHEN YOU HAVE ONLY
 A DOLLAR TO SPEND</i>

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:55.648 
<i> AND YOU HAVE
 TWO KIDS TO FEED,</i>

00:01:55.648 --> 00:02:00.186 
<i> EITHER YOU GO
 TO THE MARKET</i>

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:03.923 
<i> AND TRY TO FIND
 SOMETHING THAT'S CHEAP</i>

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:07.994 
<i> OR JUST GO STRAIGHT
 THROUGH A DRIVE-THRU</i>

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:12.665 
<i> AND GET TWO SMALL
 HAMBURGERS FOR THEM</i>

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:16.536 
<i> AND "OKAY, HERE.
 EAT THEM."</i>

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:20.406  line:0%
THIS IS WHAT'S
GONNA FILL HER UP,

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:26.012  line:0%
NOT THAT ONE SINGLE ITEM
AT THE MARKET.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.427
LOOK AT THE BROCCOLI.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:45.231
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE, MAN.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.977 align:start size:78% position:22%
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
  TO EAT THEN?
- MAMA.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:04.317 align:start size:88% position:13%
FIRST CHECK TO SEE
HOW MANY ARE THERE
FOR A POUND.

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:18.631 align:start size:94% position:6%
- UH, WE'RE NOT GETTING IT.
- WHY NOT?

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:22.034
YOU'D ONLY GET
TWO OR THREE. 

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:27.907 align:start size:75% position:25%
- NO.  COME ON.
- AWW!

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:44.456
Maria:
<i> WE CAN FIND CANDY
 THAT'S CHEAPER.</i>

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:48.394
<i> WE CAN FIND CHIPS
 THAT ARE CHEAPER.</i>

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:52.264
<i> THE SODAS ARE
 REALLY CHEAP.</i>

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:56.535 
SOMETIMES YOU LOOK
AT A VEGETABLE AND SAY

00:03:56.535 --> 00:04:01.607 
"OKAY, WE CAN GET
TWO HAMBURGERS OVER HERE

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:04.476 
FOR THE SAME AMOUNT
OF PRICE."

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:11.016
 Pollan:
<i> WHY IS IT
 THAT YOU CAN BUY</i>

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:15.955
<i> A DOUBLE-CHEESEBURGER 
 AT McDONALD'S FOR 99¢,</i>

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:21.827
<i> AND YOU CAN'T EVEN GET
 A HEAD OF BROCCOLI FOR 99¢?</i>

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:27.633 align:start size:97% position:3%
- YOU WANT THE SMALL ONE?
- WE'VE SKEWED OUR FOOD SYSTEM

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:31.770
TO THE BAD CALORIES

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.376
AND IT'S NOT
AN ACCIDENT.

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:44.650
I MEAN, THE REASONS
THAT THOSE CALORIES
ARE CHEAPER IS

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.788
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONES
WE'RE HEAVILY SUBSIDIZING.

00:04:55.327 --> 00:05:00.065
<i> AND THIS IS DIRECTLY TIED 
 TO THE KIND OF AGRICULTURE</i>

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:03.068
<i> THAT WE'RE PRACTICING</i>

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:07.339
<i> AND THE KIND
 OF FARM POLICIES WE HAVE.</i>

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:11.877
<i> ALL THOSE
 SNACK-FOOD CALORIES ARE</i>

00:05:11.877 --> 00:05:17.283
<i> THE ONES THAT COME
 FROM THE COMMODITY CROPS--</i>

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:20.953
<i> FROM THE WHEAT,
 FROM THE CORN</i>

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:24.356
<i> AND FROM THE SOYBEANS.</i>

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:29.161
<i> BY MAKING THOSE CALORIES
 REALLY CHEAP,</i>

00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:34.900
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS 
THAT THE BIGGEST PREDICTOR

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.237
OF OBESITY IS
INCOME LEVEL.

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:42.975
<i> OVER THE COURSE
 OF HUMAN HISTORY,</i>

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:46.645
<i> WE WERE STRUGGLING 
 TO MAKE SURE WE HAD</i>

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:50.983
<i> ENOUGH FOOD
 AND ENOUGH CALORIES</i>

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:55.721
<i> FOR A SIZABLE PERCENTAGE
 OF THE HUMAN RACE.</i>

00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:59.792
<i> NOW THE PROBLEM IS
 TOO MANY CALORIES.</i>

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:05.064
THE INDUSTRY
BLAMES OBESITY

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:09.335
ON A CRISIS OF PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:14.540
<i> BUT WHEN YOU'RE
 ENGINEERING FOODS</i>

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.945
<i> YOU ARE PRESSING
 OUR EVOLUTIONARY BUTTONS.</i>

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:25.417 line:0%
<i> THE FACT IS
 WE'RE HARDWIRED</i>

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:30.155 line:0%
<i> TO GO FOR THREE TASTES--</i>

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:35.627 line:0%
<i> SALT, FAT AND SUGAR.</i>

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:39.298
<i> THESE THINGS ARE
 VERY RARE IN NATURE</i>

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:45.170
<i> NOW SUGAR IS
 AVAILABLE 24/7</i>

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.640
<i> IN TREMENDOUS QUANTITIES.</i>

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:55.047
<i> WE'RE EATING
 HUNDREDS OF POUNDS
 OF THE STUFF A YEAR.</i>

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:59.385
<i> THIS DIET
 OF HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP</i>

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:02.788
<i> AND REFINED CARBOHYDRATES</i>

00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:06.859
LEADS TO THESE SPIKES
OF INSULIN

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:13.132
AND, GRADUALLY,
A WEARING DOWN 
OF THE SYSTEM

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:17.603
BY WHICH OUR BODY 
METABOLIZES SUGAR.

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:32.818
Maria:
<i> MY HUSBAND'S DIABETIC.</i>

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:37.022
<i> ONE OF MY MAIN CONCERNS IS</i>

00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:41.560
HE COULD LOSE HIS SIGHT.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:50.436
HE DOES GET INTO--
SOMETIMES HE'S SHAKING,

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:57.176
SO I'M AFRAID THAT
HE'S GONNA START NOT
BEING ABLE TO DRIVE,

00:07:57.176 --> 00:08:01.513
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
HE DOES FOR A PROFESSION.

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:07.319
<i> WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
 HIS MEDICINE.</i>

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:11.323
WHAT IS IT, $70?

00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:17.262 align:start size:53% position:47%
50 PILLS COSTS ME
ABOUT $130.

00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:20.732 
 Maria:
<i> BUT HE'S ON TWO
 DIFFERENT TYPES OF PILLS.</i>

00:08:20.732 --> 00:08:24.203 
$100-AND-SOMETHING
FOR ONE PILL

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:28.140 
AND THEN $100-
AND-SOMETHING FOR ANOTHER.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.211 
THAT TAKES A LOT
OF OUR INCOME AWAY.

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:38.684 
<i> WE'RE REALLY TIGHT
 FROM EITHER</i>

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:42.955 
<i> PAYING FOR HIS MEDICINE
 TO BE HEALTHY</i>

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:50.295 
<i> OR BUYING VEGETABLES
 TO BE HEALTHY.</i>

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:54.299 
SO WHICH ONE
SHOULD WE DO?
