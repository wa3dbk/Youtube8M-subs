00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello very good we all have a 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.179
 news the curiosity captures a pyramid 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.580
 on Mars and unleashes a great debate at 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.670
 I'll leave the image for you 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.080
 can appreciate the best and good, because 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.310
 robot curiosity for that photograph that is 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.800
 photographing forgiveness what is the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.949
 surface of Mars has sent it a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.830
 image where then what are the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.050
 ufÃ³logos especially since they are a little 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.469
 thus calling attention is no longer that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 because apparently they have captured a 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.739
 pyramid that stands out about what is the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 mountain mountain it appears to be 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.039
 that a mountain rises from what it is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.379
 from the ground no and well then it says that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.989
 apparently civilizations 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.350
 old ones of the earth and so what 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.899
 you see there is a pyramid and good the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.539
 pyramid was built by someone or 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.930
 some martian surface that's what 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.150
 many experts ask many people 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.950
 he draws attention to life 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.590
 strategy 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.420
 and well, apparently there are people who 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.759
 says that this could be a 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.009
 monument that is buried and then 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.350
 what remains the surface that is the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.560
 pyramid is that I'm talking then 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.200
 down below all that is what is a 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 monument if it were a monument would be 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 thing to catch and take out or 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.110
 dig to see exactly what is it 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 that hides there the truth is that no 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.610
 I know what you think of these things 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.369
 what happens and well it's a thing 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.799
 quite curious as I am saying that 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.090
 the curiosity has captured a pyramid in 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.670
 marte and has sparked a debate as I am 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.399
 counting but the thing does not stay here and it's 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.740
 that to another mysterious pyramid to a 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.799
 pretty big mystery and is that the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.640
 nasa finds a pyramid in the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.830
 dwarf planet called ceres and well then 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.869
 I will leave you also the images so that 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.810
 you can see it and apparently some 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.680
 bright lights are added to a figure 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.709
 triangular of 5 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.290
 meters high that the truth is I 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.560
 that one thing that if on Mars you think 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.799
 is that if another happens and these things do not 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.230
 I understand how it can be possible not 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:31.129
 I understand it so much mystery of one thing and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.379
 Yesterday I said that they had said that 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.120
 the area 51 exists good it was known that 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.239
 it existed but nobody had confirmed it 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.519
 like who says and well now this of 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.310
 the pyramids and tomorrow it's going to be that 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.709
 is going to be what surprises me I do not know 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.680
 what will you think but I the truth 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.889
 is that I get scared because it's a 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.069
 very strange thing to say yesterday that 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.290
 there is area 51 that there is not no 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.180
 no extraterrestrial that there not 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.900
 analyze none of this now some 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.700
