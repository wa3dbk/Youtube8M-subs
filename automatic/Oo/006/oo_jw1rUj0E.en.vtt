00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
and I learned a lot from it so I think I

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.669 
and I learned a lot from it so I think I
better<00:01:36.590> quit<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:38.240> you're<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.479> new<00:01:39.170> book<00:01:39.409> your

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
better quit and you're a new book your

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.459 
better quit and you're a new book your
anabolic<00:01:40.429> partner<00:01:41.210> Jimmy<00:01:41.960> Annie<00:01:42.109> took

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
anabolic partner Jimmy Annie took

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.139 
anabolic partner Jimmy Annie took
Pfeiffer<00:01:42.920> as<00:01:43.009> well<00:01:43.189> in<00:01:43.369> this<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.789> this<00:01:43.909> match

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
Pfeiffer as well in this in this match

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.880 
Pfeiffer as well in this in this match
and<00:01:44.509> how<00:01:44.810> do<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:44.899> see<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.140> combo<00:01:45.530> working

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
and how do you see the combo working

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.440 
and how do you see the combo working
together<00:01:46.009> well<00:01:46.399> I<00:01:46.429> think<00:01:46.609> I<00:01:46.909> had<00:01:47.090> him<00:01:47.119> covered

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
together well I think I had him covered

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.010 
together well I think I had him covered
first<00:01:47.840> day<00:01:48.020> pace<00:01:48.319> wise<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.209> but<00:01:50.209> I<00:01:50.240> think<00:01:50.659> when

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
first day pace wise so but I think when

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.690 
first day pace wise so but I think when
he<00:01:51.110> when<00:01:51.469> he<00:01:51.500> get<00:01:51.740> hit<00:01:52.009> got<00:01:52.159> his<00:01:52.280> five<00:01:52.459> for<00:01:52.640> the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
he when he get hit got his five for the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.309 
he when he get hit got his five for the
