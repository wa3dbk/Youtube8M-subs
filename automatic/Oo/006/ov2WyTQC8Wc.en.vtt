00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
that detail that is so unique through a

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.360 
that detail that is so unique through a
modern<00:00:50.239> city<00:00:50.870> in<00:00:51.050> North<00:00:51.230> America<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.129> at<00:00:52.250> the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
modern city in North America so at the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.580 
modern city in North America so at the
heart<00:00:52.640> is<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.239> same<00:00:53.420> games<00:00:53.690> vision<00:00:54.140> right<00:00:54.350> we

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
heart is the same games vision right we

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.080 
heart is the same games vision right we
were<00:00:54.859> starting<00:00:55.100> from<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.430> vision<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:55.910> then

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
were starting from a vision and then

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.540 
were starting from a vision and then
disrupt<00:00:56.960> is<00:00:57.109> a<00:00:57.140> very<00:00:57.379> scalable<00:00:57.980> technology

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
disrupt is a very scalable technology

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.270 
disrupt is a very scalable technology
very<00:00:59.300> scalable<00:00:59.840> game<00:01:00.050> engine<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:00.980> what<00:01:01.129> we're

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
very scalable game engine so what we're

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.430 
very scalable game engine so what we're
doing<00:01:01.309> is<00:01:01.789> we're<00:01:02.660> preserving<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.260> game

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
doing is we're preserving the game

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.469 
doing is we're preserving the game
experience<00:01:03.980> but<00:01:04.250> if<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.670> play<00:01:04.910> watch<00:01:05.089> dogs<00:01:05.330> on

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
experience but if you play watch dogs on

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:06.790 
experience but if you play watch dogs on
the<00:01:05.570> PlayStation<00:01:06.020> 4<00:01:06.229> we<00:01:06.350> want<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.619> make<00:01:06.770> sure

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
the PlayStation 4 we want to make sure

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.350 
the PlayStation 4 we want to make sure
that<00:01:07.160> we<00:01:07.280> use<00:01:07.460> all<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.940> consoles

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
that we use all of the consoles

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.930 
that we use all of the consoles
capability<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.500> all<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.190> games<00:01:10.399> Baylor<00:01:10.670> were

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
capability so all the games Baylor were

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.810 
capability so all the games Baylor were
able<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.390> make<00:01:11.570> longer<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:12.830> stronger<00:01:13.100> all<00:01:13.520> of

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
able to make longer and stronger all of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.880 
able to make longer and stronger all of
the<00:01:13.970> details<00:01:14.509> in<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.840> game<00:01:15.020> are<00:01:15.229> able<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.649> push

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
the details in the game are able to push

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.950 
the details in the game are able to push
forward<00:01:16.399> we<00:01:16.729> have<00:01:16.940> more<00:01:17.240> details<00:01:17.420> more

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
forward we have more details more

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.480 
forward we have more details more
immersion<00:01:18.530> we're<00:01:18.710> able<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.130> increase

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
immersion we're able to increase

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.520 
immersion we're able to increase
connectivity<00:01:19.880> increase<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.990> density<00:01:21.170> of

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
connectivity increase the density of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.830 
connectivity increase the density of
things<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:22.819> the<00:01:22.880> same<00:01:22.940> game<00:01:23.300> experience

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
things so it's the same game experience

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.690 
things so it's the same game experience
but<00:01:24.410> basically<00:01:24.770> magnifying<00:01:25.399> on<00:01:25.610> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
but basically magnifying on the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.600 
but basically magnifying on the
PlayStation<00:01:26.240> 4<00:01:26.440> it's<00:01:27.440> not<00:01:27.679> just<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.039> capacity

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
PlayStation 4 it's not just a capacity

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.710 
PlayStation 4 it's not just a capacity
of<00:01:28.640> new<00:01:29.110> machinery<00:01:30.110> it's<00:01:30.530> also<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:32.119> capacity

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
of new machinery it's also the capacity

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.930 
of new machinery it's also the capacity
of<00:01:32.750> players<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.440> create<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:34.250> interact<00:01:34.729> to

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
of players to create to interact to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.820 
of players to create to interact to
socialize<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.140> when<00:01:36.289> we<00:01:36.410> started<00:01:36.709> to<00:01:36.800> talk

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
socialize so when we started to talk

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.999 
socialize so when we started to talk
about<00:01:37.069> watch<00:01:37.340> dogs<00:01:37.780> at<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.899> Sony<00:01:39.140> they<00:01:39.649> got<00:01:39.860> it

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
about watch dogs at the Sony they got it

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.249 
about watch dogs at the Sony they got it
immediately<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.450> players<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.899> their

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
immediately it is the players and their

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.229 
immediately it is the players and their
behavior<00:01:42.709> that<00:01:43.130> will<00:01:43.340> actually<00:01:43.520> bring<00:01:43.970> what

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:44.239 
behavior that will actually bring what

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:47.410 
behavior that will actually bring what
next-gen<00:01:44.569> actually<00:01:45.319> means<00:01:46.030> we're<00:01:47.030> starting

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
next-gen actually means we're starting

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.930 
next-gen actually means we're starting
to<00:01:47.569> make<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.840> machine<00:01:48.200> as<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.979> acknowledge<00:01:49.670> ow

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
is always to recognize that and give

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.790 
is always to recognize that and give
more<00:03:48.910> power<00:03:49.150> for<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.600> reason<00:03:50.110> like<00:03:50.530> just

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
more power for a reason like just

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.340 
more power for a reason like just
provide<00:03:51.340> more<00:03:51.670> possibilities<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:53.110> that<00:03:53.260> we

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
provide more possibilities so that we

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.699 
provide more possibilities so that we
can<00:03:53.500> constantly<00:03:54.040> grow<00:03:54.490> that<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.930> form<00:03:56.290> of

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709
