episodes<00:01:08.720> hopefully<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:10.820> anyway<00:01:11.820> starts

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
episodes hopefully I think anyway starts

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.760 
episodes hopefully I think anyway starts
out<00:01:12.750> again<00:01:14.240> this<00:01:15.240> time<00:01:15.509> they're<00:01:16.110> rolling<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
out again this time they're rolling and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
out again this time they're rolling and
there's<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.490> each<00:01:17.610> side<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.119> can't

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
there's one on each side so you can't

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.850 
there's one on each side so you can't
have<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> dodge<00:01:18.720> them<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.320> go<00:01:19.650> back<00:01:19.830> up

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
have to dodge them and then go back up

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.270 
have to dodge them and then go back up
on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> other<00:01:20.280> side<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:20.939> did

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
on the other side like I just did

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.679 
on the other side like I just did
little<00:01:23.280> livers<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> get

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
little livers and then you have to get

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:37.310 
little livers and then you have to get
this<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:27.170> right

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.820 

it's<00:01:38.320> kind<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.590> hard<00:01:39.659> sign<00:01:40.659> it's<00:01:40.930> not<00:01:41.080> easy<00:01:41.320> I'm

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
longer than 15 minutes I thought the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330 
longer than 15 minutes I thought the
limit<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.930> 4<00:02:35.260> hours<00:02:35.590> or<00:02:35.890> something<00:02:36.160> like<00:02:36.280> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
limit is 4 hours or something like that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.699

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
and then I tried to add episode 3 to my

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.270 
and then I tried to add episode 3 to my
playlist<00:03:16.390> but<00:03:17.320> I'm<00:03:17.560> retarded<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.250> I

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
playlist but I'm retarded so I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.160 
playlist but I'm retarded so I
accidentally<00:03:18.790> deleted<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.359> I<00:03:19.780> had

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
accidentally deleted it so I had

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.630 
accidentally deleted it so I had
uploaded<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.739> again<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.280> that's<00:03:21.459> why<00:03:21.609> I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
uploaded it again and that's why I

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.160 
uploaded it again and that's why I
probably<00:03:21.880> doesn't<00:03:22.180> have<00:03:22.299> very<00:03:22.630> many<00:03:22.810> views

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
probably doesn't have very many views

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.140 
probably doesn't have very many views
right<00:03:23.799> here<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.220> says<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.430> get<00:03:24.609> a<00:03:24.670> secta<00:03:24.970> to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
right here it says you get a secta to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.539 
right here it says you get a secta to
the<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.870> Alliance<00:03:26.350> well<00:03:26.530> above<00:03:26.769> all<00:03:27.100> I'm

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
the to the Alliance well above all I'm

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.520 
the to the Alliance well above all I'm
really<00:03:27.940> starting<00:03:28.269> to<00:03:28.299> audio<00:03:28.780> or<00:03:29.019> anything<00:03:29.230> but

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
really starting to audio or anything but

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.710 
really starting to audio or anything but
yeah<00:03:30.010> anyone<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.609> then<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:31.030> figured<00:03:31.359> out<00:03:31.450> that

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
yeah anyone and then I figured out that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.569 
yeah anyone and then I figured out that
before<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.829> had<00:03:32.980> uploaded<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.430> video

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
before that I had uploaded a video

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.580 
before that I had uploaded a video
called<00:03:33.970> don't<00:03:34.540> never<00:03:34.870> like<00:03:35.079> this<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.440> why<00:03:35.530> you

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
called don't never like this is why you

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.069 
called don't never like this is why you
don't<00:03:35.709> let<00:03:35.859> your<00:03:35.950> friends<00:03:36.220> decorate<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.090> that

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
don't let your friends decorate and that

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.190 
don't let your friends decorate and that
had<00:03:38.290> copyrighted<00:03:38.799> music<00:03:38.890> on<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.750> then<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
had copyrighted music on it so then I

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.539 
had copyrighted music on it so then I
think<00:03:41.260> that's<00:03:41.530> why<00:03:41.739> I<00:03:41.769> didn't<00:03:42.160> allow<00:03:42.370> me<00:03:42.519> to

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
think that's why I didn't allow me to

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.720 
think that's why I didn't allow me to
upload<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> video<00:03:43.000> over<00:03:43.359> 20<00:03:43.630> minutes<00:03:43.900> because

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.770 

because<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.940> fact<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.600> had

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
because of the fact that that had

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.260 
because of the fact that that had
happened<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.709> then<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.190> don't<00:03:50.640> once<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.910> deleted

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
happened and then I don't once I deleted

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.170 
happened and then I don't once I deleted
that<00:03:51.390> video<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:53.160> actually<00:03:53.550> was<00:03:53.910> able<00:03:54.030> to

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
that video I I actually was able to

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.699 
that video I I actually was able to
upload<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.569> videos<00:03:54.840> longer<00:03:55.080> than<00:03:55.319> that

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
upload the videos longer than that

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.570 
upload the videos longer than that
so<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.190> basically<00:03:56.520> deleted<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.990> video<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:58.740> it

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580
