groceries asked I really had to think

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.299 
groceries asked I really had to think
about<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.840> seeing<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.440> how<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> hadn't<00:00:41.100> spent

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
about it seeing as how I hadn't spent

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.790 
about it seeing as how I hadn't spent
any<00:00:41.370> time<00:00:41.550> thinking<00:00:42.090> about<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.420> before<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
any time thinking about it before the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.680 
any time thinking about it before the
answer<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.899> neither<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:47.090> maybe<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.539> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
answer is neither or maybe it's that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.479 
answer is neither or maybe it's that
it's<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> little<00:00:49.200> bit<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.620> both<00:00:50.899> let<00:00:51.899> me<00:00:51.989> explain

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
it's a little bit of both let me explain

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.229 
it's a little bit of both let me explain
remember<00:00:53.489> when<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> elements<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> harmony

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
remember when the elements of harmony

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.119 
remember when the elements of harmony
wouldn't<00:00:54.840> work<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.289> main<00:00:55.469> six<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:56.039> they

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
wouldn't work for the main six when they

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.540 
wouldn't work for the main six when they
were<00:00:56.190> tainted<00:00:56.460> by<00:00:56.699> discord<00:00:57.859> alright<00:00:58.859> let's

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
were tainted by discord alright let's

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:21.749 
were tainted by discord alright let's
get<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.850> over<00:01:00.449> with

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.160 

it's<00:01:22.759> as<00:01:22.939> if<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.180> elements<00:01:23.630> were<00:01:23.750> aware<00:01:24.110> of

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's as if the elements were aware of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.690 
it's as if the elements were aware of
the<00:01:24.409> fact<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.860> main<00:01:25.009> 6<00:01:25.310> were<00:01:25.460> both

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the fact that the main 6 were both

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.090 
the fact that the main 6 were both
incomplete<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.659> not<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.170> exemplary<00:01:27.680> ponies

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
incomplete and not the exemplary ponies

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.399 
incomplete and not the exemplary ponies
they<00:01:28.250> used<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.610> be<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:29.750> makes<00:01:30.020> me<00:01:30.170> think<00:01:30.350> that

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
they used to be that makes me think that

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.990 
they used to be that makes me think that
the<00:01:30.530> elements<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.890> harmony<00:01:30.950> actually<00:01:31.850> have

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
the elements of harmony actually have

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.050 
the elements of harmony actually have
consciences<00:01:32.509> on<00:01:32.990> some<00:01:33.350> level<00:01:33.700> it's<00:01:34.700> kind<00:01:34.970> of

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
consciences on some level it's kind of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.359 
consciences on some level it's kind of
like<00:01:35.149> Thor's<00:01:35.509> hammer<00:01:35.840> Mjolnir<00:01:36.500> whether

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
that others can use Mjolnir if they're

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.100 
that others can use Mjolnir if they're
wearing<00:01:54.710> some<00:01:54.950> kind<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.250> special<00:01:55.490> gloves<00:01:56.110> now

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
harmony get enough magic to give them

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.069
