00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:02.980 
and you have to realize if you come as

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.700 
and you have to realize if you come as
far<00:00:03.220> as<00:00:03.490> we<00:00:03.700> did<00:00:03.730> that's<00:00:04.600> the<00:00:05.110> results<00:00:05.560> of

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.710 
far as we did that's the results of

time we can be the first first eyes in
the<00:00:29.769> world<00:00:30.039> to<00:00:30.279> see<00:00:30.460> something<00:00:30.730> new<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.509> know

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
the world to see something new you know

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.979 
the world to see something new you know
that<00:00:32.129> that<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.770> know<00:00:35.800> every<00:00:36.780> every<00:00:37.780> day

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
that that that you know every every day

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.930 
that that that you know every every day
has<00:00:38.350> that<00:00:38.590> promise<00:00:39.039> and<00:00:39.370> of<00:00:39.550> course<00:00:39.789> it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
has that promise and of course it

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.900 
has that promise and of course it
doesn't<00:00:40.120> happen<00:00:40.359> every<00:00:40.690> day<00:00:40.719> but<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:42.430> it's

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
doesn't happen every day but but it's

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.569 
doesn't happen every day but but it's
when<00:00:43.239> you<00:00:43.510> when<00:00:44.260> you<00:00:44.289> see<00:00:44.649> that<00:00:44.800> first<00:00:45.160> glimpse

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
when you when you see that first glimpse

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.750 
when you when you see that first glimpse
of<00:00:45.699> something<00:00:46.030> that<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:48.129> makes

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
of something that it's it makes

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.360 
of something that it's it makes
everything<00:00:49.030> else<00:00:49.269> really<00:00:50.199> worth<00:00:50.680> while<00:00:50.949> we

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
everything else really worth while we

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.259 
everything else really worth while we
were<00:00:51.489> working<00:00:51.699> with<00:00:53.219> developing<00:00:54.219> prodrugs<00:00:54.879> in

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
were working with developing prodrugs in

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.599 
were working with developing prodrugs in
other<00:00:55.390> words<00:00:55.629> drugs<00:00:56.379> it<00:00:56.620> can<00:00:56.859> be<00:00:57.039> cleaved<00:00:57.460> by

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
other words drugs it can be cleaved by

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.389 
other words drugs it can be cleaved by
certain<00:00:58.059> enzymes<00:00:58.480> in<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.870> tumor<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.589> to<00:01:00.190> be

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
certain enzymes in a tumor to to be

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.730 
certain enzymes in a tumor to to be
active<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.500> we<00:01:02.620> wondered<00:01:02.980> well<00:01:03.190> if<00:01:03.460> we<00:01:03.789> can

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 
active and so we wondered well if we can

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.480 
active and so we wondered well if we can
use<00:01:05.740> this<00:01:06.720> use<00:01:07.720> this<00:01:07.990> approach<00:01:08.740> maybe<00:01:09.130> we

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
use this use this approach maybe we

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.680 
use this use this approach maybe we
could<00:01:09.700> also<00:01:09.880> use<00:01:10.060> this<00:01:10.440> basic<00:01:11.440> idea<00:01:11.830> for<00:01:12.690> for

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
could also use this basic idea for for

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.290 
could also use this basic idea for for
detecting<00:01:14.320> enzyme<00:01:14.890> activity<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:15.700> serum<00:01:16.030> we

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
detecting enzyme activity and a serum we

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.980 
detecting enzyme activity and a serum we
had<00:01:16.540> to<00:01:16.690> design<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:17.940> nanoparticle<00:01:18.940> of<00:01:19.210> about<00:01:19.510> 20

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
had to design a nanoparticle of about 20

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.660 
had to design a nanoparticle of about 20
nanometers<00:01:20.770> which<00:01:21.400> has<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.060> ability<00:01:22.600> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
nanometers which has the ability to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.940 
nanometers which has the ability to
quench<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:25.120> light<00:01:25.360> often<00:01:26.290> organic

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
quench the light often organic

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.160 
quench the light often organic
sensitizer<00:01:27.520> that's<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.970> day<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.540> this<00:01:28.960> dye

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
sensitizer that's a day and this dye

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.680 
sensitizer that's a day and this dye
shines<00:01:29.650> if<00:01:30.190> you<00:01:30.370> put<00:01:30.730> some<00:01:30.910> light<00:01:31.090> on<00:01:31.330> it<00:01:31.360> shows

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
shines if you put some light on it shows

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.340 
shines if you put some light on it shows
fluorescence<00:01:32.230> but<00:01:32.530> only<00:01:33.100> if<00:01:33.280> it's<00:01:34.120> free<00:01:35.080> of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
fluorescence but only if it's free of

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.380 
fluorescence but only if it's free of
the<00:01:35.710> nanoparticles<00:01:36.550> so<00:01:36.700> if<00:01:36.820> those<00:01:37.090> are

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
the nanoparticles so if those are

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.010 
the nanoparticles so if those are
together<00:01:37.690> then<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:39.310> dye<00:01:39.970> doesn't<00:01:40.510> shine<00:01:40.720> and

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
together then the dye doesn't shine and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.470 
together then the dye doesn't shine and
there<00:01:41.500> is<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.620> linker<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:42.160> this<00:01:42.640> linker<00:01:43.060> can<00:01:43.360> be

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
there is a linker and this linker can be

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.080 
there is a linker and this linker can be
chopped<00:01:43.960> by<00:01:44.230> an<00:01:44.380> enzyme<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.980> that's<00:01:45.820> how<00:01:46.030> we

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
chopped by an enzyme and that's how we

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.660 
chopped by an enzyme and that's how we
detect<00:01:46.570> our<00:01:46.690> cancer<00:01:47.200> enzymes<00:01:47.620> so<00:01:48.160> in<00:01:48.520> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
detect our cancer enzymes so in the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.540 
detect our cancer enzymes so in the
absence<00:01:48.820> of<00:01:49.270> an<00:01:49.390> enzyme<00:01:50.160> nanoparticle<00:01:51.160> entire

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
absence of an enzyme nanoparticle entire

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.580 
absence of an enzyme nanoparticle entire
together<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.780> presence<00:01:52.870> of<00:01:53.290> an<00:01:53.410> enzyme

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
together in the presence of an enzyme

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.930 
together in the presence of an enzyme
they<00:01:54.400> become<00:01:55.030> loose<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.690> then<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.020> dye<00:01:56.260> shows

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
they become loose and then the dye shows

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.060 
they become loose and then the dye shows
fluorescence<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.330> number<00:01:58.660> of<00:01:58.840> photons<00:01:59.770> we

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
fluorescence so the number of photons we

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.370 
fluorescence so the number of photons we
get<00:02:00.250> out<00:02:00.460> or<00:02:00.730> just<00:02:00.850> how<00:02:01.210> much<00:02:01.390> light<00:02:01.720> we<00:02:02.170> get

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
get out or just how much light we get

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.210 
get out or just how much light we get
out<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.910> indicative<00:02:03.910> of<00:02:04.390> how<00:02:05.020> active<00:02:05.650> this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
out is indicative of how active this

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.660 
out is indicative of how active this
enzyme<00:02:06.790> is<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:07.780> blood<00:02:08.379> serum<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.069> then

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
enzyme is in blood serum and then

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.240 
enzyme is in blood serum and then
reduces<00:02:10.239> tests<00:02:10.659> for<00:02:10.840> 15<00:02:11.439> enzymes<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.579> parallel

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
reduces tests for 15 enzymes in parallel

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.170 
reduces tests for 15 enzymes in parallel
and<00:02:13.430> get<00:02:14.090> something<00:02:14.630> which<00:02:14.780> we<00:02:14.960> call<00:02:15.230> forties

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and get something which we call forties

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.150 
and get something which we call forties
signature<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:17.750> showing<00:02:18.080> how<00:02:18.350> much<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.920> each

hypothesis<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:23.000> works<00:02:23.210> on<00:02:23.920> every

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
hypothesis is that it works on every

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.150 
hypothesis is that it works on every
solid<00:02:25.700> tumor<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.570> solid<00:02:26.990> tumor<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.590> tumor

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
solid tumor a solid tumor is a tumor

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.760 
solid tumor a solid tumor is a tumor
somewhere<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:28.880> your<00:02:29.000> body<00:02:29.300> not<00:02:29.630> like<00:02:29.900> leukemia

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
somewhere in your body not like leukemia

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.810 
somewhere in your body not like leukemia
for<00:02:31.190> instance<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.680> solid<00:02:34.220> tumor<00:02:34.550> has

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
for instance and so a solid tumor has

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.060 
for instance and so a solid tumor has
problems<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.840> has<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.290> connect<00:02:36.650> with<00:02:36.709> blood

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
problems it has to connect with blood

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.840 
problems it has to connect with blood
supply<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.940> has<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:39.110> go<00:02:39.530> against<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.430> tissue

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
supply it has to go against the tissue

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.970 
supply it has to go against the tissue
and<00:02:41.180> then<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.840> course<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:42.200> has<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.380> colonize

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
and then of course it has to colonize

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.729 
and then of course it has to colonize
the<00:02:43.250> whole<00:02:43.430> body<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.660> these<00:02:44.930> enzymes<00:02:45.410> are

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
the whole body and so these enzymes are

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.610 
the whole body and so these enzymes are
helping<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.489> tumor<00:02:47.090> doing<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.260> we're

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
helping the tumor doing just that we're

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.979 
helping the tumor doing just that we're
actually<00:02:48.890> testing<00:02:49.520> this<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.880> on<00:02:50.270> human<00:02:50.690> serum

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
actually testing this on on human serum

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.400 
actually testing this on on human serum
samples<00:02:51.470> now<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:53.209> we're<00:02:53.900> collaborating

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
samples now and and we're collaborating

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.050 
samples now and and we're collaborating
with<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.650> University<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.100> Kansas<00:02:55.370> cancer

Torres<00:04:46.600> in<00:04:46.750> my<00:04:46.900> case<00:04:47.170> that's<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.560> special<00:04:47.950> case
