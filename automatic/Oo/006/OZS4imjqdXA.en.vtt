00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.830
 or the obstacles as they are today I bring you 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.320
 this revision of the extensions that I 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.599
 they sent me to resist for me this is a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.790
 American page and they sent me 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.920
 the silk hitachi model and well I'll 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.410
 to leave some clips here so that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.480
 see how he originally came to a blond 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.910
 platinum and I saw them in this color for 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.730
 I could dye them as well as my hair came 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.160
 in this little box like that came a little but 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.879
 it was but had it been for the trip and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.040
 here the extensions came in 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.989
 super nice the box and came super 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.480
 well wrapped and did not linger like 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.340
 three days to arrive 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.380
 where the extensions came from 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.080
 there was a small sample that could 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.570
 open earlier to test if you liked the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.790
 long and thick and if you did not like 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.730
 He could return at no cost and I 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.860
 I sent in the one you really wanted 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.190
 they send to the whole world and 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.180
 it costs nine dollars with 95 and also 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.490
 I 'm going to leave some customers 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.460
 how I had these extensions because 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.100
 blond obviously not going to match 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.720
 with my hair so I had to dye the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.910
 to dye the extensions we are going to 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.659
 put on a plastic or paper 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.969
 uses 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.619
 and we're going to start applying the color more 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.749
 dark we want if we want 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.330
 make a gradient or if we can not also 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:43.340
 dye those of a single color 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.440
 we are going to apply it also with the brush 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.960
 vertical so that it diffuses after 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.060
 better with the other color and do not forget 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.010
 go through all the milestones milestones to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.200
 that there are no white strands or those 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.200
 let's continue with the pink color 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.710
 then I will rotate it and I will do the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.659
 same process on the other side and also 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.979
 assuring me of the same thing that does not want 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.979
 no trace of yellow hairs nor 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.979
 blond 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.319
 I'm going to wrap the whole extension in 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.000
 same bag and I'll leave it for about 45 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.070
 minutes and I'm going to rinse 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.950
 this is the structure that I use to have 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.230
 my extensions and my hair is this 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.050
 the men 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.910
 of brides beige color and this is 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.440
 fuchsia there is also one clear that I 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.680
 had previously used it called 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.080
 it was called magenta but it's like a tone 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.580
 more orange were pretty seemed to 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.980
 me but only that hair a little 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.020
 darker then there suddenly it 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.420
 note that it is darker there and here 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.550
 is the tone as more vibrant and real 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.230
 so this is the tincture that I used and 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.230
 for extensions that have as 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.150
 some purple tones use these paintings 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.830
 that are how I bought them in a 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.380
 hairdresser is erased a little the name 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.120
 but they are like this model I saw them in 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.980
 a hairdresser in angola so I do not know 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.260
 if they will sell it elsewhere and it was a 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.959
 purple tone and fuchsia the extensions 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.780
 they are super super soft, they are good hair 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.450
 human says there that they are from remy hair no 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.850
 I know what it is but supposes it is but 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.680
 100% human human so they are super 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.680
 soft and you can dye them you can 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.570
 decolorize you can wave them smooth 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.820
 et cetera any process that could 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.860
 Do your hair can do it to 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.070
 These extensions also extensions 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.570
 they came like in this little hand they come 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.519
 also like wigs and all that 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.290
 where you can store so you do not 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.209
 spoil us entangle and those things like that 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.880
 that super good when you're going to do the 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.670
 purchase they ask you to choose also the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.350
 long you want and the amount of 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.090
 grams because for example if you have very 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.190
 little but he will not ask you for 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.829
 thickest extensions in the world and you 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.470
 it's going to be like that below and you, but 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.230
 thin not do not go well then 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.989
 there they give you this option to choose I asked 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:05.180
 the platinum color in blondie long 22 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:07.070
 inches and weight I ordered 200 grams and asked 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.440
 200 grams because my hair is super 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.390
 thick and I have enough then yes 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.310
 I was asking for less I will stay like a 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.920
 down here and my hair cup 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.140
 bulky so there you have 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.880
 that to go seeing in agreement is a hair and of 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.590
 according to what you want if you want to dye 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.510
 the after all this I 'm going to 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.190
 leave a video below that explains them 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.650
 more or less the colors are shown 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.479
 in comparison the long and all that for 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.230
 If you want to buy it, you can 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.240
 to choose 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.790
 this model of expressions because they have 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.070
 several have as one single curtain 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.620
 they have like horse pellets 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.230
 extension have several models but to 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.350
 me send me the circuit 8 and these 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.150
 they have a value of 79 dollars but now 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.180
 are with an offer of 20 percent to 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.430
 63 dollars so they can go to the page 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.650
 to see if they like them and that if the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.450
 they want to buy and I also want them 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.220
 teach how I enduro my hair because 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.340
 something that I had been asked so much 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.630
 and the way I do it is the same 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.000
 what I did with the extensions 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.920
 only that when I have my hair 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.590
 they have the extensions looks much more 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.620
 bulky but I do it the same 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.870
 way exactly and not custom to do it 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.730
 with iron because the ripple lasts me 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.130
 less so I always do it with a 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.500
 wavy now that you are going to see 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.780
 now later we are going to start 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.240
 applying our extensions and in the 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.670
 very thin first layer I will put a 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.980
 extension of three clips 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.690
 then also in the second layer I'm going to 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.860
 put another three clip and there I will go 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.840
 alternating as I want so I put 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.060
 one of integrates another of a single color 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.830
 so the next layer I'm going to put the 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.190
 thicker extension is that of four 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.190
 clips 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.789
 in the next layer I'm going to put three 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.710
 extensions of two clips and I'm going to 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.250
 start putting the center one and then 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.250
 those on the sides 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.310
 in the following layers I will put 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.800
 Two extensions of two clips too 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.340
 but in the side parts of my 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.470
 hair or my head and finally I'm going to 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.810
 put these extensions on a single clip 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.320
 I'm going to see where I'm lacking a bit 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.830
 of hair or if I want to give more volume to 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.830
 somewhere 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.090
 then to nullify my hair I'm going to 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.780
 split my hair in two and I'm going to 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.509
 start with bending backwards with a 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.150
 atypical canceller that you have and 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:40.510
 I use a range 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.820
 which is called titanium and I'm going to take 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.500
 strands mixing my natural hair with 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.060
 the extensions so that there is much more 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.060
 natural and better 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.220
 I'm going to do this all over my hair 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:01.980
 and first in the first layer obviously 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:04.560
 and then in the second 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:09.270
 finally I will make 23 appointments to the 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:11.490
 sides to make it look nicer and 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.430
 I will sign with a boy pin they are a 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.570
 pin or whatever they call him and this would be 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.570
 as the final look 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.730
 I hope you liked it and if you have 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.560
 some doubt do not hesitate to leave it work 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.730
 in the comments my social networks 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.860
 it will also be in the box 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.960
 information in case you want to follow me like this 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.460
 that that is very good and we see the 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.410
 next video chao 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.259
 hi everyone how are you today I bring you 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.479

 kylie jenner and they uploaded it a 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:45.370

 super nice
