tutorial on how to make a wheel or even

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.140 
tutorial on how to make a wheel or even
a<00:00:15.900> ball<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.830> patterns<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.680> take<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> look<00:00:20.150> we're

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
a ball in patterns and take a look we're

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.960 
a ball in patterns and take a look we're
going<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.390> use<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.750> shape<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.820> one

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
going to use this shape here is the one

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.269 
going to use this shape here is the one
with<00:00:24.180> four<00:00:25.170> corners<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> bottom<00:00:26.010> not

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
with four corners in the bottom not

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.450 
with four corners in the bottom not
three<00:00:26.960> you<00:00:27.960> can<00:00:28.140> make<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.500> yourself<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.220> can

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
three you can make this yourself you can

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460 
three you can make this yourself you can
find<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.910> different<00:00:30.090> places<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.260> can

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
find it different places but you can

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.110 
find it different places but you can
create<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.130> we're<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.969> cover

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
create it and we're not going to cover

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.990 
create it and we're not going to cover
it<00:00:33.300> exactly<00:00:33.630> how<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.840> create<00:00:34.260> shapes<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.579> this

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it exactly how you create shapes in this

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750 
it exactly how you create shapes in this
tutorial<00:00:36.420> now<00:00:36.570> yeah<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.460> far

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
tutorial now yeah as you get this far

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.860 
tutorial now yeah as you get this far
there's<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.239> thing<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.450> could<00:00:39.719> be

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
there's one thing that could be

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.440 
there's one thing that could be
practical<00:00:40.379> which<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.710> namely<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.820> make

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
practical which is namely that you make

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.389 
practical which is namely that you make
a<00:00:42.480> support<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> reason<00:00:43.530> why

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.970 

these<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.899> least<00:00:49.079> help<00:00:49.350> keep<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.920> in

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
these will at least help keep it in

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
these will at least help keep it in
place<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.640> bit<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.480> not<00:00:51.600> necessary

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
place a little bit it's not necessary

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.479 
place a little bit it's not necessary
but<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.949> practical<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:56.010> reason<00:00:56.340> why

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
but it can be practical the reason why

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.139 
but it can be practical the reason why
is<00:00:56.730> that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
is that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.020 
is that
as<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.570> build<00:00:58.100> at<00:00:59.100> least<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.730> thing<00:00:59.879> that

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
as you build at least one one thing that

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.520 
as you build at least one one thing that
can<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.210> practical<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.079> something<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
can be practical is to have something to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.630 
can be practical is to have something to
stand<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:05.180> just<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.450> little<00:01:06.780> work<00:01:06.990> area

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
stand on here just a little work area

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.630 
stand on here just a little work area
because<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.880> reacts<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:10.100> various<00:01:11.100> things<00:01:11.460> like

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
because it reacts to various things like

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.060 
because it reacts to various things like
you<00:01:12.600> pushing<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> around<00:01:14.210> but<00:01:15.210> also<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you pushing it around but also so I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.260 
you pushing it around but also so I
don't<00:01:17.250> want<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.490> standing<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.850> top<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
don't want to be standing on top of it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.830 
don't want to be standing on top of it
because<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.780> will<00:01:18.840> add<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.290> weight<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.570> as<00:01:21.570> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
because I will add my weight to it as I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.310 
because I will add my weight to it as I
complete<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:23.150> in<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.560> balanced<00:01:25.560> manner<00:01:27.320> in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
complete this in a balanced manner in

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
complete this in a balanced manner in
most<00:01:28.650> cases<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.490> will<00:01:29.640> break<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.960> put

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
most cases this will break as I as I put

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.899 
most cases this will break as I as I put
the<00:01:31.680> final<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.520> will<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.729> just

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the final one in and it will be just

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.330 
the final one in and it will be just
become<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.689> wheel<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> can't<00:01:35.159> really

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
become a a wheel and you can't really

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.830 
become a a wheel and you can't really
build<00:01:35.700> anything<00:01:36.090> more<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:37.820> however

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
build anything more on it however

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.880 
build anything more on it however
because<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.140> support<00:01:40.380> chair<00:01:40.770> now

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
because I have this support chair now

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
because I have this support chair now
and<00:01:41.040> I'm<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.280> running<00:01:41.610> around<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and I'm not running around on it it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.450 
and I'm not running around on it it
didn't<00:01:42.899> happen<00:01:42.960> usually<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.860> will<00:01:43.979> break<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
didn't happen usually it will break it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.950 
didn't happen usually it will break it
will<00:01:44.549> get<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.780> blade

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
will get a little a little blade

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.260 
will get a little a little blade
shearing<00:01:46.290> overcome<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> movable<00:01:47.340> object<00:01:47.759> all

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
shearing overcome a movable object all

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.429 
shearing overcome a movable object all
of<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> sudden<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.930> can't<00:01:49.140> build

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
of a sudden then you can't build

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.010 
of a sudden then you can't build
anything<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.250> it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
anything more on it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
anything more on it
that<00:01:52.020> wasn't<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> case<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.740> time<00:01:52.939> now<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.299> if

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that wasn't the case this time now so if

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.209 
that wasn't the case this time now so if
I<00:01:54.899> didn't<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.649> would<00:01:55.860> now<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I didn't do that this would now be a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.950 
I didn't do that this would now be a
movable<00:01:56.640> object<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.149> could<00:01:57.270> remove<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.719> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
movable object we could remove this and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.730 
movable object we could remove this and
we<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.140> start<00:01:58.290> pushing<00:01:58.500> around<00:01:58.710> and<00:02:00.619> but<00:02:01.619> we

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
we can start pushing around and but we

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.910 
we can start pushing around and but we
want<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.130> something<00:02:02.549> else<00:02:03.530> we<00:02:04.530> want<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
want to do something else we want to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.749 
want to do something else we want to
make<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> full

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
make it a full

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.499 
make it a full
Vall<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.289> say<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.819> you<00:02:09.910> just<00:02:10.060> do<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.330> like

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
Vall so to say and you just do that like
