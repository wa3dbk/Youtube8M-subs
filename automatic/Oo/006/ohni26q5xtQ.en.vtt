00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
based on the version one point our 11.8

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.650 
based on the version one point our 11.8
point<00:03:52.780> for<00:03:52.959> whatever<00:03:53.290> it's<00:03:53.470> on<00:03:53.590> now<00:03:53.830> and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
point for whatever it's on now and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.380 
point for whatever it's on now and
Infinity<00:03:55.660> Blade<00:03:55.750> 2<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.580> on<00:03:57.580> one<00:03:58.000> point<00:03:58.209> three

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
Infinity Blade 2 is on one point three

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.509 
Infinity Blade 2 is on one point three
point<00:03:58.630> two<00:03:59.110> it's<00:03:59.380> had<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.590> lot<00:03:59.860> of<00:03:59.890> time<00:04:00.310> to

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
point two it's had a lot of time to

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.759 
point two it's had a lot of time to
mature<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.300> I<00:04:01.630> think<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.380> if<00:04:02.470> anybody

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
mature and I think that if anybody

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.160 
mature and I think that if anybody
through<00:04:03.040> will<00:04:03.190> get<00:04:03.340> better<00:04:03.519> with<00:04:03.760> updates

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
through will get better with updates

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.150 
through will get better with updates
content<00:04:05.170> packs<00:04:05.350> will<00:04:05.530> make<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.769> better<00:04:05.950> maybe

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
content packs will make it better maybe

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.060 
content packs will make it better maybe
that<00:04:06.340> linear<00:04:06.580> aspect<00:04:07.000> will<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.180> removed

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
that linear aspect will be removed

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.890 
that linear aspect will be removed
crossing<00:04:09.070> my<00:04:09.100> fingers<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.730> duel<00:04:10.150> gets<00:04:10.450> its

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
crossing my fingers that duel gets its

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.290 
crossing my fingers that duel gets its
improved<00:04:11.760> like<00:04:12.760> it's<00:04:13.000> faster

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300
