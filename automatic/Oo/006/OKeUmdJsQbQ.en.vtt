also<00:03:10.200> taken<00:03:10.500> out<00:03:10.800> for<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.580> reload<00:03:12.209> mechanism

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
also taken out for the reload mechanism

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.830 
also taken out for the reload mechanism
just<00:03:13.200> because<00:03:13.410> um<00:03:13.790> just<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.910> get<00:03:15.090> your<00:03:15.360> fantic

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
look into there and yeah but this is how

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.060 
look into there and yeah but this is how
you<00:03:19.590> take<00:03:19.830> out<00:03:20.040> video<00:03:20.370> magazine<00:03:22.070> it's

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
you take out video magazine it's

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.240 
you take out video magazine it's
basically<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.940> long<00:03:24.480> shot<00:03:24.660> itself<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.410> think<00:03:26.130> it

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
basically a long shot itself I think it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.490 
basically a long shot itself I think it
fires<00:03:26.810> 10-15<00:03:27.810> meters<00:03:27.959> i<00:03:28.200> think<00:03:28.380> that's

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
fires 10-15 meters i think that's

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.199 
fires 10-15 meters i think that's
correct<00:03:28.830> i'm<00:03:29.430> not<00:03:29.550> actually<00:03:29.730> going<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.030> shoot

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
correct i'm not actually going to shoot

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.000 
correct i'm not actually going to shoot
because<00:03:30.360> i<00:03:30.540> have<00:03:30.660> them<00:03:30.810> got<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.200> rillo<00:03:31.560> mixes

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
because i have them got the rillo mixes

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.760 
because i have them got the rillo mixes
macanudo<00:03:32.670> we<00:03:33.420> load<00:03:33.630> mechanism<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.680> i'm

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
macanudo we load mechanism in so i'm

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.300 
macanudo we load mechanism in so i'm
actually<00:03:34.920> going<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.090> shoot<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:38.190> is

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
actually going to shoot it this is

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.870 
actually going to shoot it this is
basically<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.940> or<00:03:39.720> halo<00:03:39.959> saw<00:03:40.290> i<00:03:40.530> use<00:03:41.489> lots<00:03:41.790> of

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
basically it or halo saw i use lots of

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.310 
basically it or halo saw i use lots of
reference<00:03:42.239> pictures<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.690> get<00:03:42.840> risk<00:03:43.020> together

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
reference pictures to get risk together

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.470 
reference pictures to get risk together
so<00:03:44.250> i<00:03:44.280> can<00:03:44.400> get<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.640> colors<00:03:44.970> white<00:03:45.150> or<00:03:45.360> as

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
so i can get the colors white or as

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.090 
so i can get the colors white or as
close<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.750> as<00:03:45.959> possible<00:03:46.380> think<00:03:46.709> if<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:46.920> got

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
close to as possible think if you got

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.370 
close to as possible think if you got
four<00:03:47.130> join<00:03:47.600> on<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.750> hailer<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.170> that's

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
four join on the hailer so that's

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.290 
four join on the hailer so that's
obviously<00:03:49.860> much<00:03:50.280> different<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.820> enough<00:03:51.060> gun

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
obviously much different to enough gun

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.180 
obviously much different to enough gun
