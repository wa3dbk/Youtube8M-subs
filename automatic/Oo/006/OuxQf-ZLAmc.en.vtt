00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.480
 compadrito today we are 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 preparing we are preparing ground 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.039
 because next week is Easter 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.779
 but I start with the dishes today 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.269
 taught how to prepare a chilean water but in 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.769
 this occasion is black so much 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.300
 attention with the English because they are going to 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.449
 be happening here under the screen like this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.449
 what 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.800
 there he has taught them to do the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.960
 aguachile that is commonly green 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 later I have taught to do also the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 red chile water and this time 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.410
 I'm going to teach you the black chile water 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 how to do we need ink from 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.100
 squid and horta go everywhere 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.379
 squid ink for the season 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.969
 entering by all are leaving the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.140
 nothing ink what happens is that right now 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.579
 we are using a lot then in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.949
 either side find it in the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.020
 supermarkets in the markets especially 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.399
 in the seafood markets we are going to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.399
 start first marinating 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.460
 the shrimp in a mixture that is going to be 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.860
 of lemon do not scare me and the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.390
 price and get that down 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.090
 peron kilos of money for your kidneys 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.430
 ufi but I already made sure and already under the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.740
 lemon price then we have the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.750
 Lemon juice, make sure you do not go 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.940
 there's a little seed and we're going to 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.100
 add a cube you do not see polvito 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.659
 because I already undid a cube of 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.399
 shrimp concentrate and there what 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.840
 we started to mix regular mixes and 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.850
 please to dissolve 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.590
 perfectly to the best that can be 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.110
 because if you do not have cubes or 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.580
 shrimp concentrates in Cuba and what 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.530
 you have powder you can add a 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.750
 spoonful that pretty much what they can 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.850
 go making a bucket approximately and 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.619
 that's so that's the way in the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.390
 that I prepare the awÃ¡ chiles because 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.810
 I do not like that that brings you what 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.880
 lemon acid acid chili level that 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.399
 after it is added to me I like to give it 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.039
 a little touch of shrimp flavor because 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.020
 that's what chill them eat 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.070
 almost always to me it tastes like pure lemon 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.110
 with Chile 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.030
 I always try to season that solution 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.680
 lemon with a little concentrate 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.990
 then I have the shrimp ready 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.940
 removed the shell I made a cut 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.950
 especially the tenderloin I remove the oats and 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.630
 I'll rinse again so it does not get 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.550
 adhered no tube cachito 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.520
 digestive or vein is almost also 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.110
 Once the rinses are thoroughly rinsed dry and 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.570
 I put them to Marin to return to 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.200
 solutions or are practically cooked not 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.270
 negative for negative when one eats 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.790
 the pse said when we eat water chile 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.120
 in this case we are eating raw 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.000
 the lemon is not what the lemon does 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.560
 denaturalize the protein and change it 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.209
 the color but you follow it you see it 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.470
 they touch the movements but we 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.470
 than cooking it so that after 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:03:00.430
 right here we are going to put a little bit of what 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.959
 what are you seeing and do not you see a little 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.570
 the onion and huawei I will tackle a 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.490
 little more for the time and I'm also going to 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.350
 add cucumbers here 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.850
 that we leave it there to marinate if they have 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.530
 what cover we cover and we take it to 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.590
 refrigeration and we're going to let it marinate 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.640
 about 20 to 25 minutes 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.310
 it is only to absorb the taste 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.890
 not to sew ok then it goes to 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.860
 refrigerator and from this side I'm going to do 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.820
 the water chile that is water with chile 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.820
 we need serrano peppers 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.010
 has regretted the emigration to this does not 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.970
 I've removed the seeds because that's what 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.450
 try this has to explain the facts 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.160

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.440
