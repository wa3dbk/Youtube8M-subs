biochar<00:02:29.320> here's<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.640> first<00:02:31.510> batch<00:02:31.840> test

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
biochar here's the first batch test

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.860 
biochar here's the first batch test
batch<00:02:32.620> let's<00:02:32.860> see<00:02:32.980> what<00:02:33.130> happens

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
batch let's see what happens

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.090 
batch let's see what happens
winds<00:02:34.870> picking<00:02:35.080> up<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.380> little<00:02:35.710> bit<00:02:35.860> which

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
winds picking up a little bit which

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.670 
winds picking up a little bit which
won't<00:02:36.340> hurt<00:02:36.640> but<00:02:36.970> it's<00:02:37.120> awful<00:02:37.450> dry<00:02:37.720> I've<00:02:38.470> got<00:02:38.650> a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
won't hurt but it's awful dry I've got a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.190 
won't hurt but it's awful dry I've got a
nice<00:02:38.950> buffer<00:02:39.490> zone<00:02:39.730> okay<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.600> pulled<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.990> top

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
nice buffer zone okay I pulled the top

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.130 
nice buffer zone okay I pulled the top
off<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.650> reload<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.420> because<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.600> pine<00:02:43.870> burns

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
off to reload it because this pine burns

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.580 
off to reload it because this pine burns
very<00:02:44.560> hot<00:02:44.740> very<00:02:45.250> fast<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:47.200> looks<00:02:47.410> like

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
very hot very fast and it looks like

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.290 
very hot very fast and it looks like
we've<00:02:47.740> kind<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.040> reached<00:02:48.250> critical<00:02:48.520> mass<00:02:48.820> here

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
we've kind of reached critical mass here

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.390 
we've kind of reached critical mass here
you<00:02:49.480> can<00:02:49.660> see<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:51.430> crack<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:53.100> all<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
you can see that crack and all of the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.750 
you can see that crack and all of the
gas<00:02:54.670> that's<00:02:55.150> coming<00:02:55.240> off<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:57.960> wood<00:02:58.960> inside

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
gas that's coming off of the wood inside

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.699 
gas that's coming off of the wood inside
that's<00:03:00.760> not<00:03:01.030> from<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.480> wood<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.470> deal

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
that's not from the wood in the deal

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.030 
that's not from the wood in the deal
there<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.220> wood<00:03:03.370> inside<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:04.410> outer<00:03:05.410> drum<00:03:05.890> is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
there the wood inside the outer drum is

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.470 
there the wood inside the outer drum is
almost<00:03:06.310> gone<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:08.350> are<00:03:08.500> burning<00:03:08.950> off<00:03:12.180> all<00:03:13.180> of

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
almost gone so we are burning off all of

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.380 
almost gone so we are burning off all of
the<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.780> can<00:03:13.930> see<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.230> here<00:03:14.410> on<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:15.150> side<00:03:16.150> as

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
the you can see it here on the side as

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.160 
the you can see it here on the side as
well<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.850> we<00:03:18.850> are<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:19.240> burning<00:03:19.450> off<00:03:19.780> all<00:03:20.020> the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
well so we are just burning off all the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.390 
well so we are just burning off all the
gas<00:03:21.270> from<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.390> wood<00:03:22.680> okay<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:23.709> sealed<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.370> back

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
gas from the wood okay I sealed it back

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.370 
gas from the wood okay I sealed it back
up<00:03:24.550> and<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.000> can<00:03:25.030> see<00:03:25.360> all<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.660> gas<00:03:25.900> coming

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
up and you can see all that gas coming

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.900 
up and you can see all that gas coming
off<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.680> end<00:03:26.830> looks<00:03:27.160> like<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.340> burner<00:03:27.640> on<00:03:27.880> a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
off the end looks like a burner on a

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.520 
off the end looks like a burner on a
stove<00:03:28.950> that's<00:03:29.950> not<00:03:30.160> coming<00:03:31.050> none<00:03:32.050> of<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.320> is

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
stove that's not coming none of this is

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.940 
stove that's not coming none of this is
coming<00:03:32.860> from<00:03:32.950> inside<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.519> barrel<00:03:34.890> this<00:03:35.890> is

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
coming from inside the barrel this is

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.030 
coming from inside the barrel this is
all<00:03:36.310> coming<00:03:36.700> from<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.330> wood<00:03:37.540> inside<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:41.040> you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
all coming from the wood inside and you

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.160 
all coming from the wood inside and you
know<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.300> don't<00:03:43.300> know<00:03:43.360> how<00:03:43.480> long<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.720> leave<00:03:43.989> it

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
know I don't know how long to leave it

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.830 
know I don't know how long to leave it
I'm<00:03:44.260> gonna<00:03:44.380> wait<00:03:44.590> till<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.890> quits<00:03:45.100> gassing<00:03:45.610> off

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
I'm gonna wait till it quits gassing off

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.330 
I'm gonna wait till it quits gassing off
but<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:46.870> did<00:03:47.110> put<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.410> lid<00:03:47.590> back<00:03:47.830> on<00:03:47.860> so<00:03:48.310> it

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
but I did put the lid back on so it

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.030 
but I did put the lid back on so it
wouldn't<00:03:48.670> continue<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.300> burn<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:50.560> deprive<00:03:50.890> it

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
wouldn't continue to burn to deprive it

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.910 
wouldn't continue to burn to deprive it
of<00:03:51.100> oxygen<00:03:51.310> once<00:03:51.850> it's<00:03:52.060> through<00:03:52.120> gassing<00:03:52.920> so

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
of oxygen once it's through gassing so

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.150 
of oxygen once it's through gassing so
I'm<00:03:54.100> gonna<00:03:54.220> leave<00:03:54.489> it<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:54.880> come<00:03:54.940> back<00:03:55.540> and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
I'm gonna leave it and come back and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.570 
I'm gonna leave it and come back and
we'll<00:03:57.160> see<00:03:57.780> what<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:58.810> looks<00:03:59.110> like<00:03:59.320> in<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.680> couple

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
we'll see what it looks like in a couple

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.800 
we'll see what it looks like in a couple
ways<00:04:01.260> check<00:04:02.260> this<00:04:02.500> out<00:04:02.800> yeah<00:04:03.400> that's<00:04:04.090> awesome

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
ways check this out yeah that's awesome

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.710 
ways check this out yeah that's awesome
look<00:04:05.680> at<00:04:05.769> this<00:04:06.690> it's<00:04:07.690> exactly<00:04:08.820> it's<00:04:09.820> light<00:04:10.209> it

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
look at this it's exactly it's light it

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:20.780 
look at this it's exactly it's light it
almost<00:04:11.200> tinkles<00:04:12.780> it's<00:04:13.780> hot<00:04:14.760> but<00:04:16.979> watch<00:04:17.979> this

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:28.089 

you<00:04:21.790> can<00:04:21.970> hear<00:04:22.240> it

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:34.309 

can<00:04:29.099> you<00:04:29.189> hear<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:33.330> got<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.509> ceramic

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
can you hear that it's got a ceramic

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:46.089 
can you hear that it's got a ceramic
sound<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.009> almost<00:04:37.639> as<00:04:38.639> a<00:04:38.729> note<00:04:42.590> so<00:04:43.590> that

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:52.839 

looks<00:04:47.099> to<00:04:47.340> be<00:04:48.259> like<00:04:49.259> a<00:04:49.289> perfect<00:04:51.139> first<00:04:52.139> batch

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
looks to be like a perfect first batch

00:04:52.849 --> 00:05:00.170 
looks to be like a perfect first batch
biochar<00:04:58.099> considering<00:04:59.099> you<00:04:59.189> only<00:04:59.340> use<00:04:59.610> five<00:04:59.969> to

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
biochar considering you only use five to

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.209 
biochar considering you only use five to
10%<00:05:00.419> in<00:05:00.900> your<00:05:01.080> garden<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.740> have<00:05:03.949> six<00:05:04.949> or<00:05:05.099> eight

10% in your garden I have six or eight
cycles<00:05:06.210> of<00:05:06.509> this<00:05:06.689> will<00:05:06.930> probably<00:05:07.199> give<00:05:07.500> me

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
cycles of this will probably give me

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.480 
cycles of this will probably give me
enough<00:05:07.800> for<00:05:07.830> everything<00:05:08.159> I'm<00:05:08.370> going<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.610> do<00:05:09.409> so
