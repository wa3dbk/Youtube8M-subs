 again awake he tried to 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.680
 restoring by all means its success 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.300
 but that did not change anything 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.280
 it was summer and it was still day 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:07.379
 outside how could pebbles 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.180
 sleep in a room so clear he 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.120
 decided to sleep in the other direction 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.439
 without result either pebble 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.120
 could not really go back to sleep 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.359
 and he was starting to be bad 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.579

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.329

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.919

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.709

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.250
 curious to see what his grandmother 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.239
