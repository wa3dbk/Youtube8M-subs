00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.500 
going to test it out with a little
mastodon<00:00:20.620> so<00:00:21.010> I'm<00:00:21.430> recording<00:00:21.820> the<00:00:22.120> other<00:00:22.270> end

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
headset on my computer here and so we're

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.810 
headset on my computer here and so we're
going<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:26.830> switch<00:00:27.010> back<00:00:27.190> and<00:00:27.250> forth<00:00:27.460> between

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
going to switch back and forth between

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.520 
going to switch back and forth between
what<00:00:28.120> the<00:00:28.270> camera<00:00:28.630> here<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:29.080> microphone<00:00:29.440> on

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530

person<00:00:32.649> on<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.800> other<00:00:32.890> end<00:00:33.100> of<00:00:33.280> your<00:00:33.370> call

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
person on the other end of your call

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.329 
person on the other end of your call
would<00:00:33.699> hear<00:00:33.879> so<00:00:34.149> let's<00:00:34.989> play<00:00:35.170> some<00:00:35.320> music<00:00:38.339> yeah

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
would hear so let's play some music yeah

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.680 
would hear so let's play some music yeah
okay<00:00:39.609> so<00:00:39.640> where<00:00:39.940> it's<00:00:40.120> not<00:00:40.269> very<00:00:40.420> well

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
okay so where it's not very well

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.809 
okay so where it's not very well
presumably<00:00:41.350> here<00:00:41.949> we<00:00:42.010> just<00:00:42.519> then

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:42.819 
presumably here we just then

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:49.700 
presumably here we just then
we're<00:00:43.480> going<00:00:43.569> to<00:00:43.629> turn<00:00:43.780> it<00:00:43.899> out

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.110 

work<00:00:50.710> because<00:00:51.160> it<00:00:51.250> has<00:00:51.399> a<00:00:51.430> little<00:00:51.670> lighten<00:00:51.910> up

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
work because it has a little lighten up

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.119 
work because it has a little lighten up
on<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.809> front<00:00:53.050> of<00:00:53.109> it<00:00:53.230> but<00:00:53.620> actually<00:00:53.949> makes

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
on the front of it but actually makes

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.549 
on the front of it but actually makes
contact<00:00:54.640> with<00:00:54.789> your<00:00:55.000> stage<00:00:55.269> and<00:00:56.199> what<00:00:56.379> that

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
contact with your stage and what that

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.619 
contact with your stage and what that
does<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:57.129> it<00:00:57.280> allows<00:00:57.609> us<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:58.180> detect<00:00:58.449> the

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
does is it allows us to detect the

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.810 
does is it allows us to detect the
vibrations<00:00:59.289> that<00:00:59.530> tell<00:00:59.800> from<00:00:59.980> your<00:01:00.039> voice<00:01:00.190> and

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
vibrations that tell from your voice and

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.850 
vibrations that tell from your voice and
still<00:01:01.570> turn<00:01:01.750> out<00:01:01.809> any<00:01:02.050> other<00:01:02.140> noise<00:01:02.500> that's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
still turn out any other noise that's

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.399 
still turn out any other noise that's
not<00:01:03.039> a<00:01:03.070> filter<00:01:03.550> is<00:01:03.730> very<00:01:03.940> vibrates<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.809> so

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
not a filter is very vibrates and so

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.680 
not a filter is very vibrates and so
presumably<00:01:05.880> what's<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.030> power<00:01:07.240> on<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.570> other

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
presumably what's the power on the other

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.570 
presumably what's the power on the other
than<00:01:07.869> tears<00:01:08.110> is<00:01:08.530> what's<00:01:08.950> your<00:01:09.130> hearing<00:01:09.460> right

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
than tears is what's your hearing right

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.270 
than tears is what's your hearing right
now<00:01:09.640> which<00:01:10.509> is<00:01:10.540> pretty<00:01:11.259> much<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.740> start<00:01:12.130> your

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
now which is pretty much to start your

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.680 
now which is pretty much to start your
voice<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.759> a<00:01:12.820> little<00:01:13.060> bit<00:01:13.149> of<00:01:13.180> stuff<00:01:13.450> in<00:01:13.600> the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
voice and a little bit of stuff in the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.940 
voice and a little bit of stuff in the
background<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:19.479> there<00:01:20.170> are<00:01:20.350> two<00:01:20.500> volume

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
background because there are two volume

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.919 
background because there are two volume
buttons<00:01:21.250> on<00:01:21.399> this<00:01:21.520> pen<00:01:21.789> track<00:01:22.030> it's<00:01:22.300> supposed

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
buttons on this pen track it's supposed

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.169 
buttons on this pen track it's supposed
to<00:01:23.350> dynamically<00:01:24.130> adjust<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.580> volume<00:01:24.729> up<00:01:25.030> and

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
to dynamically adjust the volume up and

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.060 
to dynamically adjust the volume up and
down<00:01:25.240> depending<00:01:25.570> on<00:01:25.990> Andrew<00:01:26.320> of<00:01:26.409> noise<00:01:26.619> levels

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
down depending on Andrew of noise levels

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.830 
down depending on Andrew of noise levels
in<00:01:27.580> practice<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.149> find<00:01:28.390> that<00:01:28.479> there's<00:01:28.659> metal

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
in practice I find that there's metal

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.160 
in practice I find that there's metal
work<00:01:29.110> really<00:01:29.289> well<00:01:29.440> it<00:01:30.310> does<00:01:30.550> have<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:31.360> volume

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
work really well it does have a volume

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.139 
work really well it does have a volume
button<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.770> cycle<00:01:33.220> space<00:01:33.460> that<00:01:33.789> troubles

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
button that cycle space that troubles

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.120 
button that cycle space that troubles
the<00:01:34.210> volume<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:34.569> then<00:01:34.690> back<00:01:34.869> down<00:01:34.899> again

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the volume and then back down again

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.410 
the volume and then back down again
forgot<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.280> hassle<00:01:36.700> i<00:01:36.759> wish<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.000> too<00:01:37.030> just<00:01:37.330> a
