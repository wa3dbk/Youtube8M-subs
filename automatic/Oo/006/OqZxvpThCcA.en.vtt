 I welcome today on the set 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.910
 match and the ball of tiercé magazine 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.189
 hello mathieu hello alex hello to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.390
 all so mathieu this friday night 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.609
 towards the racecourse of paris 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.070
 vincennes a quinté + 5 5 with only 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.260
 fourteen starters a race reserved to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.510
 European and French horses from 6 to 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.369
 7 years ago there is only one horse that will attempt 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.079
 in the distance and the number 14 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 so today in the summary of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.649
 the show the analysis of the race by 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.870
 mathieu a sound of the tracks his 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.370
 prognosis is the most important mathieu 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.230
 with fourteen starters this is your 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.620
 five-in-five game board 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.820
 this is it mathieu we attack I 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.739
 think there is a very good favorite in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.000
 this ordeal you told me also you 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.160
 were very confident with him his numbers 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.579
 11 new way and martens in addition to flights 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.920
 currently 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.570
 here they have managed a great shot 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.100
 two on the palms of cavaillon tuesday 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.960
 by the way you were now on 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.739
 the racetrack they reissued in addition the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.090
 Wednesday in Bourges 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 here are the Wednesdays at the borealie in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.500
 the stride so new way it's really 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.880
 sure of the race horse they 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.220
 stay on 2 health walk in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.170
 province the levels will evolve on a 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 route at your convenience water trail 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.939
 flat I think it's really very 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.860
 very competitive on the tracks 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.700
 place he is surely late 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.590
 earnings 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.060
 so deferré of the four they get 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.530
 transcend before the blow and have 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.509
 really a lot of assets in his game 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.009
 it is a reinforced concrete base for a door 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.540
 in this quintet of agreement besides the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.979
 martens brothers where we say since he 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.500
 was castrated this winter the knight 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.840
 really transformed it finally shows all 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.189
 who are elected from here it was 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.810
 a little bit mean and since that was 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.090
 transformed and there really crossed a 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.070
 course and it really remains to wholesale 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.479
 belated agree after wanted to oppose 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 the other humor staying in and mef that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.720
 falls well is our noise from the tracks 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.430
 jean luc bigeon did not hide that he 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.229
 had prepared for this race it's 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.729
 recent course apparently opened it 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.439
 and have brought him the best for this 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.200
 commitment it is still at 190 euros 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.250
 from hindsight to he would be frankly disappointed in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.960
 not fight for the first places 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.790
 especially since it will be deferré of the four 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.230
 déferré later is all there 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.790
 so much mf 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.440
 he must now be very close to 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.480
 its best level as you have it 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.880
 said he also had me several times 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.860
 this winter there is no need to keep your account 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.150
 from his recent music we can note 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.320
 he has a very good success deferré 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.360
 later I think he was 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.890
 three times more to a success a second 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.260
 place quite vincennes to 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.900
 vincennes so the commitment and of 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.160
 quality is also slightly behind 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.680
 gains it's really a very beautiful 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.030
 commitment to him with him he must 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.320
 show patient at the beginning of the journey and 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.300
 really do a last few kilometers 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.650
 he never has the piece last year in 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.380
 the second part of the course 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.030
 so frankly it's a very good 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.130
 favorite so if we go with good 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.330
 things good basics before the blow by 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.410
 against in third position you 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.940
 hold a competitor who we know 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.600
 still little on our soil is the 12 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.920
 march a jet 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.160
 they come running to the cape 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.750
 fourth is pretty good end of 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.670
 race that day the cape 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.410
 he will be associated again with 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.660
 beige devils the commitment is to 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.980
 quality 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.880
 the plot should perfectly him 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.350
 how much we know that horses 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.050
 aliens are still better on 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.730
 the trees ahead + me serious and 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.490
 hands so brave handy 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.959
 joes verbeek is in great shape so 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.520
 before the shot all the lights are green 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.959
 in addition unlike the cape it will be 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.300
 free of four feet it will be déferré 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.709
 four feet so it's the same 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.900
 really a lot of assets in his game 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.360
 okay then in fourth position 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.730
 you keep ljm bn at the national djembe 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.370
 he dribbles the dj kid cool him small 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.050
 track on the course of sion 2 that's it and 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.209
 it's really great on the course 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.980
 in his last outing to saint-omer 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.680
 was intended to bring him to the best of his ability 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.540
 this commitment there we appealed to jmb 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.460
 it will be deferré of the four feet one can 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.050
 Note that 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.610
 the last time he was unsheathed 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.570
 four feet wins at the beginning capella 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.970
 August so he must hide the effort 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.680
 as long as possible but with gm 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.030
 but we do not risk much 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.680
 on arrival sure shot on arrival and shot 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.750
 sure in the five for the victory I 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.120
 see a little bit barred but cushion 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.620
 Icy white chord to a horse by 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.570
 against a lot more complicated this issue 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.160
 6 rice timakova he comes from elsewhere 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.520
 to be disqualified it was on the grass to 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.110
 dieppe 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.030
 but before, it makes a beautiful impression 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.500
 here is t-mac at the werder it is certainly more 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.510
 known under saddle but I have 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.560
 really been impressed by his success 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.480
 on the racecourse of mauquenchy 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.130
 that day he took the lead and he 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.550
 printed a very supported train to 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.520
 test 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.780
 we never saw them again with the key or 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.460
 to be complicated is in the first 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.340
 even big glitch tony the beller will have to 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.170
 ensure his training but if he 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.790
 manages to leave on on the right leg 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.200
 he is able to make a number 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.910
 Besides, I'm sure if the quinté 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.020
 5/5 been on the big track you the 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.640
 stirs up much higher I think 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.730
 that he is carved to succeed on the 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.610
 2700 meters from the big track so there 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.010
 frankly it's a very good and oceans 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.120
 okay then another big underdog 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.410
 this time maybe it's the number 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.310
 two terroirs of men you keep it 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.440
 in sixth position 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.420
 his music is a little scary this must 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.010
 it's a horse that is often in 3d at 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.000
 aliens problems it's a shame 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.100
 because he's the same on 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.670
 the racecourse of the capelle he realized a 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.870
 number there is some time ago 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.510
 it is a horse very very hard to the effort 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.670
 for me it is slightly late earnings 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.650
 also if he manages to quickly take 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.360
 at the feeding agreement she seems to him he 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.160
 is able to realize a number so 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.570
 a 60 to 1 puts at all costs in the 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.910
 selection here especially we did 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.190
 call to franck ouvrie so they own 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.570
 a good chance for me okay so 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.310
 we keep the number two soils of 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.140
 zune for lovers of big odds 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.450
 and to touch the 5 of 5 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.860
 only one competitor on the second rung 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.360
 it was said earlier on the 14th 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.970
 swirl of aze and he makes a comeback 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.590
 so you keep it a little info 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.510
 mathieu on him no but for me it's 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.340
 it's kind of the class horse of 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.810
 lot class is certainly he took the 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.490
 most of his trot gains 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.140
 but we must remember that this winter 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.500
 on the 2700 meters of the big track 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.440
 he trot on the foot of a 13 in a 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.160
 lot won by the good jean horse 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.300
 loïc claude deuroir appointed tet china so 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.680
 he can take precautions in 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.810
 leaving and for me the front is not 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.420
 an exceptional lot either so if he 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.710
 there is a race with rhythm it is 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.600
 able to make the distance is him 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.380
 also display a rating 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.090
 speculative 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.650
 all the more we know this one at trot 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.120
 mounted on the small track it's a blow 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.680
 sure practically so that's really 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.330
 profile he appreciates that's it and then in 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.890
 more after it evolve without bunt 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.470
 at his own convenience so no no 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.860
 it's a boxer okay so we keep 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.540
 as well 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.310
 finally you complete your selection and 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.320
 15 falcon had mostly van province the 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.360
 this wax not born here is not born 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.460
 he is a brave horse he is honest he 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.250
 always gives his maximum he should 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.620
 quickly find yourself in the battle 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.690
 it will take the driver along the rail but 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.200
 if there are several 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.910
 favorites 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.100
 the oil is able to take a 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.370
 fourth or fifth place to beautiful 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.160
 side 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.020
 okay so mathieu old quinté + 5 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.130
 5 only fourteen starters but that's 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.200
 not always the most 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.139
 easy to decipher mom of course the 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.159
 c1 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.349
 there are horses that still remains 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:51.469
 bad enough I tried two outsiders 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:53.749
 but that remains keira likely in 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:55.879
 the first meters of race so must 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:57.080
 not hesitate and expand the combinations 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.669
 okay what are we going to do everything to 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.529
 time for the moment we are waiting for your 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.360
 selection in numbers then the base 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:06.169
 full race the number 11 the 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:09.199
 new way on 13 torgon mf on march the 12th 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:11.870
 reject the saying take it cool the ciss 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:14.810
 team covered with rice from the terroir of 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.960
 ulmes the 14th swirl of aze and and the 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.370
 set 6 meals so this is Friday 13 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.409
 years we know for them for 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.759
 superstitious it's often it's 

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:24.860
 often luck or bad luck 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.509
 hope for them who will have them in 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.279
 this test of luck and especially 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.610
 with your advisor to play five on 

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:30.710
 five 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.870
 so integral ballet integral of the 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.759
 race on the 11th and the 13 year old follows behind 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.860
 three believe in their associates on the 12th 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:38.810
 says 6 on 2 September 14 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.279
 the horses of the pronoun we add the 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.659
 two regrets a calypso does what one 

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:43.849
 did not speak who will be unburdened from 

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:46.639
 four feet and also the 9/9 perrine 

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:47.810
 which makes a game at 28 euros to 50% on 

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.349
 the author point fr so a game 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.060
 interesting 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:51.919

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.909

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:54.919
 take the piggy bank 

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:57.620
 I do not think we really know 

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:59.839

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.939
