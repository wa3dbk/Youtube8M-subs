00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.170
 I'm going to show you how beautiful I am about cleaning it up 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.200
 and I have to ask you very often if I can show it is that I will go now 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.459
 once 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.989
 and what you need is aon 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.479
 Apeldoorn 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.859
 Pier received the 70 percent incident we get from an ordinary pharmacy 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.849
 and what a disc 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:22.769
 in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.109
 and something where the iron bar you or 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.109
 I use soft side of whip can 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.950
 2 i would like a brief explanation how i do it 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.530
 then it is not really very dirty 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.800
 digital 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.630
 you can see a bit of dirt here 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.280
 m it often comes ten years here is those dirty brown grains and that is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.890
 those are her products that are now the fact of the semifinals and the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.720
 hands even when you pass by 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.000
 Then of course you have to go make Celtic goes on to tell 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.650
 Well 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.200
 what i had to do 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.520
 I have I discovered you and this is really not super good for theft of 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.580
 maybe a second or bad but 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.500
 Imagine you had to postpone cleaning haci 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.570
 then it works well 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.760
 sometimes you have iran dirty brown rats here 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.229
 well what worked on it gets a hard off worked on is the par to it 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.960
 put 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.670
 I don't put on but can put on 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.810
 and while it heats up 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.910
 with this 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.060
 as soon as passing by 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.690
 8 heats up very quickly 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.510
 and that will not work if you go but it does not take action 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.000
 I found out by accident when a man can handle it with this one 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.890
 and I say that filth I immediately fell far away 59 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.600
 gulsen calculator 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.330
 so you can if you do why for the show 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.030
 and then that holds 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 but that of course is not counted before it is going on 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.980
 9 even if you have nothing to do with just a plant and they sit down 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.520
 to make 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.289
 fourth place is a lot than you can try 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.360
 Tabor generally just completely clean during the best 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.349
 use alcohol 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.349
 and already cooled yes it is always handy to have a house 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.609
 tamara 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.070
 I would think so and of but you can 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.099
 cleaning agent is of course all fine though 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.420
 from now on it can be pretty bad 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.549
 what here it is often a coating on 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.829
 quotes from a special something made range of certain things should not go on 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:33.569
 to do 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.229
 And pure alcohol is where the safest number of cows had this Verkerk 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.289
 cleaning evaporates winner in 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.739
 it will not affect those plates 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.629
 that's what you do 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.629
 a little alcohol cotton pad 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.669
 in italy society 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:02.239
 it will always think that I actually always have it before the movie 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.949
 I do a little research final of watching what 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.699
 what is and is not allowed 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.969
 and it is not really clear back to his face of what is best 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.549
 but I do notice a lot of people and hairdressers but they also use this 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:14.249
 just 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.249
 for pure alcohol 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:23.389
 and I have 70 percent to 99 and oil is a lot more expensive seventy percent 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.389
 of great use 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.979
 i had like 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.509
 nothing changed 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.409
 so bottle on the street 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.159
 in three years before that 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.159
 the guide 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.849
 a disgrace 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.549
 heard bicycles 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.780
 well let the dry wait everything 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.929
 argos that in their own words, live band guests have recently left themselves 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.429
 well then can happen 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.740
 and just do it once in a while 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.889
 she might not have been 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.409
 and I sit Zijlstra is for the curling iron that you can just with supporters 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.259
 feyenoord the longest traffic jam 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.449
