00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.860 

not<00:01:49.370> to<00:01:49.490> be<00:01:49.580> honest<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.060> took<00:01:50.270> mine<00:01:50.420> out<00:01:50.630> of<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
not to be honest I took mine out of the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.690 
not to be honest I took mine out of the
freezer<00:01:51.200> first<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:51.860> then<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:51.979> put<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.400> into<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
freezer first and then I put it into the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.430 
freezer first and then I put it into the
refrigerator<00:01:52.870> because<00:01:53.870> I<00:01:54.020> didn't<00:01:54.290> have<00:01:54.409> that

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
refrigerator because I didn't have that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.650 
refrigerator because I didn't have that
much<00:01:54.680> time<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.040> I'm<00:01:55.580> gonna<00:01:55.700> start<00:01:55.970> walking<00:01:56.270> it

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
much time so I'm gonna start walking it

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.650 
much time so I'm gonna start walking it
with<00:01:57.290> my<00:01:57.710> roller<00:01:58.280> just<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.910> get<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.150> flatten

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
with my roller just to get it to flatten

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.810 
with my roller just to get it to flatten
out<00:01:59.780> because<00:02:00.080> again<00:02:00.229> it's<00:02:00.530> pretty<00:02:00.979> pretty

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
out because again it's pretty pretty

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.940 
out because again it's pretty pretty
cold<00:02:02.180> or<00:02:02.540> you<00:02:02.960> can<00:02:03.110> let<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.380> set<00:02:03.530> out<00:02:03.590> for<00:02:03.890> a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
cold or you can let it set out for a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.680 
cold or you can let it set out for a
couple<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.369> minutes<00:02:04.700> before<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.150> do<00:02:05.300> this<00:02:05.479> as

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
couple of minutes before you do this as

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.800 
couple of minutes before you do this as
well<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:07.119> trick<00:02:08.119> here<00:02:08.390> if<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.570> want<00:02:08.750> to

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
well and the trick here if you want to

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.199 
well and the trick here if you want to
keep<00:02:09.050> it<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.500> uniform<00:02:10.220> circle<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:10.970> want<00:02:11.150> to

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
keep it a uniform circle you want to

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.910 
keep it a uniform circle you want to
start<00:02:11.540> your<00:02:11.959> rolling<00:02:12.320> pin<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.740> middle

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
start your rolling pin in the middle

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.190 
start your rolling pin in the middle
work<00:02:13.220> your<00:02:13.430> way<00:02:13.550> out<00:02:13.730> towards<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.450> edges<00:02:14.990> and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
work your way out towards the edges and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.100 
work your way out towards the edges and
keep<00:02:15.620> turning<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.970> roll<00:02:17.240> it<00:02:17.270> out<00:02:17.570> turn<00:02:18.080> it

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
keep turning it so roll it out turn it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.800 
keep turning it so roll it out turn it
roll<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.590> out<00:02:18.950> turn<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.850> always<00:02:20.300> start

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
roll it out turn it and always start

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.340 
roll it out turn it and always start
from<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.110> center<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.690> I'm<00:02:23.690> just<00:02:23.870> taking<00:02:24.200> a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
from the center and I'm just taking a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.860 
from the center and I'm just taking a
pizza<00:02:24.739> cutter<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.400> make<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.730> more<00:02:26.000> prettier

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
pizza cutter to make it more prettier

big<00:03:18.400> deal<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:19.709> now<00:03:20.709> we're<00:03:20.890> just<00:03:21.010> going<00:03:21.250> to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
big deal and now we're just going to

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.699 
big deal and now we're just going to
start<00:03:21.549> rolling<00:03:22.269> up<00:03:22.359> our<00:03:22.599> crust<00:03:22.989> it's<00:03:23.349> hard<00:03:23.560> to

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
start rolling up our crust it's hard to

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.860 
start rolling up our crust it's hard to
explain<00:03:24.069> so<00:03:24.220> just<00:03:24.640> kind<00:03:24.819> of<00:03:24.879> watch<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.390> have<00:03:25.569> my

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
explain so just kind of watch I have my

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.440 
explain so just kind of watch I have my
right<00:03:26.530> index<00:03:27.099> finger<00:03:27.250> that's<00:03:27.760> pushing<00:03:28.030> up<00:03:28.299> the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
right index finger that's pushing up the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.270 
right index finger that's pushing up the
dough<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:29.019> then<00:03:29.500> I'm<00:03:29.620> folding<00:03:29.829> it<00:03:30.099> over
