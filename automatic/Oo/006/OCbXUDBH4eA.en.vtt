okay welcome to this part of this PHP
tutorial<00:00:03.870> series

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
tutorial series

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.530 
tutorial series
the<00:00:05.940> reason<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.330> part<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:08.150> following<00:00:09.150> part

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
the reason this part is following part

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.070 
the reason this part is following part
four<00:00:10.010> is<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.940> basically<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.480> got<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> end

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
four is that basically I got to the end

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.829 
four is that basically I got to the end
of<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.559> uploaded<00:00:13.950> all<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.190> videos<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
of the I uploaded all the videos and

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.210 
of the I uploaded all the videos and
realize<00:00:15.839> had<00:00:15.990> forgotten<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.920> logout

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
realize had forgotten to do the logout

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.970 
realize had forgotten to do the logout
page<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:18.210> whoops<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:21.750> part<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.350> referred<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.680> as

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
page so whoops the part I referred to as

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.980 
page so whoops the part I referred to as
the<00:00:23.070> next<00:00:23.220> part<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.029> previous<00:00:24.510> tutorial

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the next part in the previous tutorial

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.630 
the next part in the previous tutorial
is<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.340> part<00:00:26.609> following<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:28.140> video<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:29.130> think

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
is the part following this video I think

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.370 
is the part following this video I think
you'll<00:00:29.910> still<00:00:30.090> work<00:00:30.359> don't<00:00:31.019> want<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> record

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you'll still work don't want to record

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
you'll still work don't want to record
it<00:00:31.529> all<00:00:31.590> again<00:00:31.859> or<00:00:32.430> edit<00:00:32.790> any<00:00:32.820> videos<00:00:33.239> or

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930 
it all again or edit any videos or
upload<00:00:34.410> any<00:00:34.590> more<00:00:34.739> videos<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.670> yeah<00:00:35.820> this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
upload any more videos so yeah this

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.060 
upload any more videos so yeah this

would be like five minutes long so

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.590 
would be like five minutes long so
honestly<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.820> okay<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
honestly I have about okay this is the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.229 
honestly I have about okay this is the
first<00:00:39.750> video<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.370> I'm<00:00:41.370> gonna<00:00:41.579> upload<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
first video that I'm gonna upload that I

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.910 
first video that I'm gonna upload that I
have<00:00:42.420> said<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:43.200> five<00:00:43.410> minutes<00:00:43.620> long<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
have said is about five minutes long and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.150 
have said is about five minutes long and
may<00:00:44.430> even<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.850> less<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.350> log<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.649> page<00:00:46.680> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
may even be less and the log out page is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.709 
may even be less and the log out page is
incredibly<00:00:47.700> simple<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
incredibly simple so I'm just going to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.369 
incredibly simple so I'm just going to
make<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.260> about<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.610> page<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.870> also

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
make this about that page I also

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.260 
make this about that page I also
demonstrate<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.239> be

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
demonstrate this in the what will be

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
demonstrate this in the what will be
part<00:00:54.660> six<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:56.059> this<00:00:57.059> series<00:00:57.949> basically<00:00:58.949> like

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
part six of this series basically like

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
part six of this series basically like
the<00:01:00.239> other<00:01:00.359> pages<00:01:00.829> included<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.039> init<00:01:02.430> file

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the other pages included the init file

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.570 
the other pages included the init file
this<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:05.339> reason<00:01:05.549> for

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
this one will not do that the reason for

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.580 
this one will not do that the reason for
this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.049> require

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
this is that we don't want it to require

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.500 
this is that we don't want it to require
a<00:01:07.619> login<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.340> any<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> other

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
a login or any of the other

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
a login or any of the other
functionality<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> init<00:01:10.979> file

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
functionality that the init file

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.160 
functionality that the init file
provides<00:01:11.520> all<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.780> destroy

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
provides all we want to do is destroy

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.980 
provides all we want to do is destroy
the<00:01:13.320> session<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.310> move<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> what

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the session and just move on so what

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
the session and just move on so what
we're<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.590> first<00:01:16.950> start<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
we're going to do is first start the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.539 
we're going to do is first start the
session<00:01:17.850> sort<00:01:18.210> manually<00:01:19.159> start<00:01:20.159> session

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
session sort manually start session

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.890 
session sort manually start session
session<00:01:21.479> start<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:24.840> we

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
session start like so and then what we

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.179 
session start like so and then what we
going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.350> set<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.619> session<00:01:26.040> variable

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
going to do is set the session variable

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.350 
going to do is set the session variable
because<00:01:26.850> remember<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.659> had<00:01:28.009> session

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
because remember like we had session

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.560 
because remember like we had session
username<00:01:31.909> what<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:32.970> need<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.270> remove

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
username what we need to do is remove

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.590 
username what we need to do is remove
this<00:01:33.840> basically<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.770> what<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
this basically so what we can do is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.670 
this basically so what we can do is
unset<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.189> like<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.930> but<00:01:39.930> what<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.619> do

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
unset that like so but what we can do

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.819 
unset that like so but what we can do
instead<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.420> set<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> actual

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
instead of that is set to the actual

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.310 
instead of that is set to the actual
session<00:01:44.100> variable<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.970> there's<00:01:45.270> equal<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> an

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
session variable so there's equal to an

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.880 
session variable so there's equal to an
empty<00:01:46.590> array

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
empty array

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.139 
empty array
what<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.460> will<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.000> remove

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
what will that will do is remove

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.420 
what will that will do is remove
everything<00:01:48.990> from<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.470> session<00:01:49.649> it'll<00:01:50.159> set<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
everything from a session it'll set the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.020 
everything from a session it'll set the
session<00:01:50.729> back<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.060> its<00:01:51.210> default<00:01:51.329> empty<00:01:52.020> array

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
session back to its default empty array

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
session back to its default empty array
so<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.750> case<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.049> ever<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> add<00:01:55.649> any

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
so just in case we ever have to add any

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.590 
so just in case we ever have to add any
more<00:01:55.860> session<00:01:56.430> data<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:57.149> don't<00:01:57.240> want<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> leave

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
more session data we don't want to leave

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.050 
more session data we don't want to leave
things<00:01:57.780> lying<00:01:58.200> around<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.520> what<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.850> gonna<00:01:59.939> do

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
things lying around so what I'm gonna do

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.350 
things lying around so what I'm gonna do
is<00:02:01.460> session<00:02:02.570> equals<00:02:03.570> array

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
is session equals array

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.550 
is session equals array
like<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.140> we're<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.530> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
like that and then we're going to do a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.190 
like that and then we're going to do a
session<00:02:08.840> destroy

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
session destroy

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.770 
session destroy
what<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> system<00:02:11.069> destroy<00:02:11.550> function<00:02:12.030> does<00:02:12.209> as

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
what the system destroy function does as

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.930 
what the system destroy function does as
far<00:02:13.319> as<00:02:13.410> far<00:02:13.620> as<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.800> know<00:02:13.920> anyway<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.430> removes

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
far as far as I know anyway is removes

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.630 
far as far as I know anyway is removes
the<00:02:15.150> cookie<00:02:15.480> pretty<00:02:15.840> much<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.620> don't<00:02:16.980> think

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the cookie pretty much I don't think

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.640 
the cookie pretty much I don't think
actually<00:02:18.090> deletes<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.480> session<00:02:18.780> file<00:02:21.650> mmm

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
actually deletes the session file mmm

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.080 
actually deletes the session file mmm
okay<00:02:23.040> sorry<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.370> don't<00:02:23.730> think<00:02:24.000> he<00:02:24.060> actually

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
okay sorry I don't think he actually

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.910 
okay sorry I don't think he actually
deletes<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.599> session<00:02:24.870> file<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.680> he<00:02:25.769> just

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
deletes the session file I think he just

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.339 
deletes the session file I think he just
removes<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> cookie<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.930> can<00:02:28.050> check<00:02:28.230> on

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
removes the cookie so you can check on

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.320 
removes the cookie so you can check on
that<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> might<00:02:28.769> be<00:02:28.890> wrong<00:02:29.099> please<00:02:29.519> don't<00:02:29.730> tell

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
session we're just going to redirect the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.270 
session we're just going to redirect the
user<00:02:39.599> back<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.140> index<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.860> site<00:02:41.040> in

user back to the index of the site in

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160 
user back to the index of the site in
this<00:02:41.640> case<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:41.970> me<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.090> was<00:02:42.209> protected<00:02:42.750> for

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
this case for me it was protected for

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.839 
this case for me it was protected for
you<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.380> probably<00:02:43.470> index<00:02:44.040> or<00:02:44.310> just<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.730> could

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
you it probably index or just you could

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.370 
you it probably index or just you could
just<00:02:44.910> do<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> slash<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.019> I'm<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.170> going<00:02:46.319> to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
just do a slash so I'm just going to

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:55.759 
just do a slash so I'm just going to
header<00:02:49.040> location<00:02:52.970> texted<00:02:53.970> dr.<00:02:54.299> PHP<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
header location texted dr. PHP the

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.229 
header location texted dr. PHP the
reason<00:02:56.010> we<00:02:56.130> don't<00:02:56.250> need<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.790> called<00:02:57.030> died

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
reason we don't need to called died

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.699 
reason we don't need to called died
after<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.930> because<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.319> at<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.530> end<00:02:58.590> of

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
after this is because this at the end of

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.860 
after this is because this at the end of
the<00:02:58.769> script<00:02:58.980> anyway<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.030> calling<00:03:00.390> died<00:03:00.569> won't

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
the script anyway so calling died won't

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.900 
the script anyway so calling died won't
prevent<00:03:01.170> any<00:03:01.410> more<00:03:01.620> code<00:03:01.950> being<00:03:02.190> executed<00:03:02.489> so

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
prevent any more code being executed so

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.509 
prevent any more code being executed so
it's<00:03:03.000> going<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.180> leave<00:03:03.299> four<00:03:03.450> out<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:05.370> yeah

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
it's going to leave four out so yeah

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.150 
it's going to leave four out so yeah
that<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.209> actually<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.599> end<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:06.900> video

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that is actually the end of this video

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.099 
that is actually the end of this video
I<00:03:08.190> won't<00:03:08.790> demonstrate<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.510> because<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.049> do

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
I won't demonstrate it because I do

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.009 
I won't demonstrate it because I do
demonstrate<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:10.950> part<00:03:11.280> six<00:03:11.780> which<00:03:12.780> used<00:03:12.989> to

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
demonstrate it in part six which used to

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.650 
demonstrate it in part six which used to
be<00:03:13.140> part<00:03:13.170> five<00:03:13.850> which<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> video<00:03:15.359> I<00:03:15.420> mean

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
be part five which is the video I mean

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.900 
be part five which is the video I mean
when<00:03:16.049> I<00:03:16.079> say<00:03:16.260> next<00:03:16.470> part<00:03:16.739> in<00:03:16.920> part<00:03:17.250> four<00:03:17.579> I<00:03:17.790> was

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
when I say next part in part four I was

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.620 
when I say next part in part four I was
just<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.209> confusing<00:03:18.660> I'm<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.079> sorry<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.480> yeah

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
just so confusing I'm so sorry so yeah

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.890 
just so confusing I'm so sorry so yeah
that<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.819> not<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:24.000> end<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.690> last

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
that is not the end but this is the last

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.199 
that is not the end but this is the last
video<00:03:25.079> I'm<00:03:25.260> recording<00:03:25.709> I've<00:03:26.700> confused<00:03:27.000> myself

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
video I'm recording I've confused myself

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.729 
video I'm recording I've confused myself
I<00:03:27.600> think<00:03:27.810> it'll<00:03:27.930> make<00:03:27.989> more<00:03:28.200> sense<00:03:28.260> as<00:03:28.590> you

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
I think it'll make more sense as you

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.259 
I think it'll make more sense as you
follow<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.100> through<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.519> be<00:03:29.609> honest<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:30.030> should

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
follow it through to be honest I should

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.150 
follow it through to be honest I should
stop<00:03:30.630> saying<00:03:31.049> about<00:03:31.230> how<00:03:31.319> confusing<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.920> okay

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
stop saying about how confusing is okay

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.559 
stop saying about how confusing is okay
