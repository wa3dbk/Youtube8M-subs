00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
complicated thing in the world I think

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.680 
complicated thing in the world I think
there's<00:00:40.309> a<00:00:40.370> lot<00:00:40.640> more<00:00:40.670> things<00:00:41.059> far<00:00:41.660> more

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
there's a lot more things far more

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.150 
there's a lot more things far more
complicated<00:00:42.140> than<00:00:42.440> that<00:00:42.530> it's<00:00:42.800> actually<00:00:43.070> one

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
complicated than that it's actually one

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.889 
complicated than that it's actually one
of<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.370> easiest<00:00:43.699> but<00:00:43.940> it's<00:00:44.090> just<00:00:44.239> for<00:00:44.719> some

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
of the easiest but it's just for some

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.240 
of the easiest but it's just for some
reason<00:00:45.230> people<00:00:45.379> have<00:00:45.559> got<00:00:45.679> this<00:00:45.800> idea<00:00:46.160> in

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
reason people have got this idea in

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.270 
reason people have got this idea in
their<00:00:46.340> head<00:00:46.579> no<00:00:47.090> picking<00:00:48.079> up<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.289> fish<00:00:48.500> lovely

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
me so when it's plastic it goes away

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.290

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
okay so that's been on there for about

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.010 
okay so that's been on there for about
90<00:01:16.490> seconds<00:01:16.880> if<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:17.270> look<00:01:17.570> around<00:01:17.900> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
90 seconds if you just look around the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.870 
90 seconds if you just look around the
edge<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.410> fish<00:01:18.590> there<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.220> white<00:01:19.460> part<00:01:19.790> is

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
edge of the fish there the white part is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.010 
edge of the fish there the white part is
the<00:01:19.940> part<00:01:20.240> that's<00:01:20.360> cooking<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:20.930> it's

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
the part that's cooking so it's

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.140 
the part that's cooking so it's
basically<00:01:21.500> more<00:01:21.830> than<00:01:22.070> 50%<00:01:22.400> cooked<00:01:22.970> already

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
basically more than 50% cooked already

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.560 
basically more than 50% cooked already
so<00:01:23.540> all<00:01:23.720> we're<00:01:23.900> gonna<00:01:24.020> do<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:24.530> very<00:01:25.100> gently

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
pick it up now because we haven't

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.020 
pick it up now because we haven't
touched<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.130> there's<00:01:28.400> no<00:01:28.550> way<00:01:28.730> that<00:01:28.880> it's

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
touched it there's no way that it's

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.230 
touched it there's no way that it's
gonna<00:01:29.180> stick<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:29.990> over<00:01:30.410> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
okay they always miss this analytic

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910 
okay they always miss this analytic
reading<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> heat<00:01:39.630> off<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.619> spit<00:01:40.830> out
