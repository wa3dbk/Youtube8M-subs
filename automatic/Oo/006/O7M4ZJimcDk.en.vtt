00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560 

I<00:00:00.089> got<00:00:00.930> a<00:00:00.960> package<00:00:07.189> and<00:00:08.189> some<00:00:08.370> super<00:00:08.550> fancy<00:00:09.000> LED

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
I got a package and some super fancy LED

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:19.929 
I got a package and some super fancy LED
bulbs<00:00:17.750> if<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.930> were<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> take<00:00:19.320> one<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.619> these

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
bulbs if I were to take one of these

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.450 
bulbs if I were to take one of these
31:57<00:00:20.939> LED<00:00:21.330> bulbs<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.930> plug<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.859> into<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.100> stock

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
31:57 LED bulbs and plug it into a stock

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.250 
31:57 LED bulbs and plug it into a stock
tail<00:00:23.730> light<00:00:23.910> circuit<00:00:23.939> board<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
tail light circuit board of a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.439 
tail light circuit board of a
trailblazer<00:00:25.769> when<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.519> hit<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> brake<00:00:27.119> it

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
trailblazer when I hit the brake it

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.630 
trailblazer when I hit the brake it
would<00:00:27.750> blow<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.410> brake<00:00:28.590> light<00:00:28.830> fuse<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
would blow the brake light fuse and the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.830 
would blow the brake light fuse and the
reason<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.920> pin<00:00:32.160> outs<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
reason is is that the pin outs on this

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.520 
reason is is that the pin outs on this
31:57<00:00:33.840> ball<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.890> match<00:00:35.630> 31:57<00:00:36.630> socket<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
31:57 ball do not match 31:57 socket of

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.650 
31:57 ball do not match 31:57 socket of
the<00:00:37.800> trail<00:00:38.010> blade<00:00:38.219> now<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.270> way<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.480> get

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the trail blade now the way to get

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
the trail blade now the way to get
around<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.050> would<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.800> by<00:00:40.980> what's<00:00:41.340> called

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
around that would be to by what's called

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.560 
around that would be to by what's called
SRC<00:00:42.420> K<00:00:42.719> style<00:00:43.730> LEDs<00:00:44.730> they're<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.950> $35<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> pair

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
SRC K style LEDs they're like $35 a pair

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.729 
SRC K style LEDs they're like $35 a pair
whereas<00:00:48.570> I've<00:00:48.840> got<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.230> four<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.559> these<00:00:49.680> for

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
whereas I've got all four of these for

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.479 
whereas I've got all four of these for
$4<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:52.110> modification<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> have

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
$4 so this modification is going to have

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.549 
$4 so this modification is going to have
two<00:00:53.670> purposes<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> give<00:00:55.260> us<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
two purposes it's going to give us the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.639 
two purposes it's going to give us the
dual<00:00:55.770> Park<00:00:56.100> circuit<00:00:57.059> boards<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:58.260> they're

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
dual Park circuit boards but they're

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.740 
dual Park circuit boards but they're
also<00:00:58.829> going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.309> rewired<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.180> accommodate

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
also going to be rewired to accommodate

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.830 
also going to be rewired to accommodate
these<00:01:00.989> non<00:01:01.230> SRC<00:01:01.980> K<00:01:02.190> bulbs<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.820> did<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> quad

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
these non SRC K bulbs I did the quad

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
these non SRC K bulbs I did the quad
Parkes<00:01:04.260> online<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.129> they're<00:01:05.909> still<00:01:06.150> holding

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
here I have the first modified board

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.259 
here I have the first modified board
next<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.160> stock<00:02:29.489> one<00:02:29.700> if<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.940> were<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
next to a stock one if you were just to

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.150 
next to a stock one if you were just to
open<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.750> up<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.950> we've

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
open it up so what you can see is we've

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.420 
open it up so what you can see is we've
added<00:02:32.400> two<00:02:33.209> more<00:02:33.390> tabs<00:02:33.680> here<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.830> here<00:02:35.100> this

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
added two more tabs here and here this

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.449 
added two more tabs here and here this
will<00:02:35.610> give<00:02:35.760> us<00:02:35.790> our<00:02:36.440> dual<00:02:37.440> parks<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
will give us our dual parks in the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.059 
will give us our dual parks in the
circuit<00:02:38.819> boards<00:02:39.120> then<00:02:40.110> we've<00:02:40.260> done<00:02:40.470> some<00:02:40.709> a

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
circuit boards then we've done some a

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.070 
circuit boards then we've done some a
little<00:02:41.310> bit<00:02:41.549> of<00:02:41.640> reorienting<00:02:42.269> what<00:02:42.660> each<00:02:42.780> pin

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
little bit of reorienting what each pin

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.320 
little bit of reorienting what each pin
does<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:43.980> was<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.340> accommodate<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.940> 9s

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
does and this was to accommodate the 9s

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.620 
does and this was to accommodate the 9s
rck<00:02:45.959> bulbs<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.620> built<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.580> one<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.849> fired<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.480> up

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
rck bulbs I built this one I fired it up

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.300 
rck bulbs I built this one I fired it up
everything<00:02:48.989> works<00:02:49.319> great<00:02:49.680> I'm<00:02:50.010> going<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.250> go

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
everything works great I'm going to go

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.410 
everything works great I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.640> build<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.030> one

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
ahead and build this one

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.440 
ahead and build this one
these<00:02:51.810> LEDs<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.680> used<00:02:53.010> for<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:54.299> for

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
these LEDs that I used for just for

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.479 
these LEDs that I used for just for
testing<00:02:54.810> purposes<00:02:55.230> they<00:02:55.380> kind<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.680> suck<00:02:55.920> and

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
testing purposes they kind of suck and

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.970 
testing purposes they kind of suck and
the<00:02:56.790> reason<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.320> no<00:02:58.440> matter<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:58.829> it's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
the reason is is that no matter if it's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.569 
the reason is is that no matter if it's
in<00:02:59.160> bright<00:02:59.430> or<00:02:59.670> dim<00:03:01.190> everything<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.370> face

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
in bright or dim everything on the face

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.120 
in bright or dim everything on the face
lights<00:03:02.850> up<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:04.200> difference<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.769> bright<00:03:05.100> and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
lights up the difference in bright and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.670 
lights up the difference in bright and
dim<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.579> on<00:03:05.760> how<00:03:06.209> many<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.600> these<00:03:06.690> LEDs<00:03:07.230> inside

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
dim is on how many of these LEDs inside

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.670 
dim is on how many of these LEDs inside
the<00:03:07.829> bulb<00:03:08.040> lit<00:03:08.250> up<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.140> I've<00:03:10.140> tried<00:03:10.320> doing<00:03:10.560> a

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
the bulb lit up so I've tried doing a

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.960 
the bulb lit up so I've tried doing a
little<00:03:10.829> thing<00:03:11.010> with<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.250> camera<00:03:11.459> didn't

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
little thing with the camera didn't

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.420 
little thing with the camera didn't
really<00:03:12.150> pick<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.450> up<00:03:12.570> good<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:14.280> eye<00:03:14.310> I

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
really pick it up good to the eye I

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.460 
really pick it up good to the eye I
could<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.150> reflector<00:03:15.720> when<00:03:16.079> it<00:03:16.200> was<00:03:16.320> on

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
could see the reflector when it was on

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.960 
could see the reflector when it was on
break<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:17.130> know<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.430> little<00:03:17.489> bit<00:03:17.760> brighter

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
break you know be a little bit brighter

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:30.680 
break you know be a little bit brighter
then<00:03:18.870> if<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.140> break<00:03:19.319> was<00:03:19.530> released

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.020 

see<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.740> don't<00:03:31.830> have<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.130> load<00:03:32.310> resistor<00:03:32.850> in

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
see I don't have the load resistor in

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.880 
see I don't have the load resistor in
for<00:03:33.270> it<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:33.990> gonna<00:03:34.110> have<00:03:34.260> hyper<00:03:34.530> flash

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
for it so it's gonna have hyper flash

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.850 
for it so it's gonna have hyper flash
this<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.270> shove<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.720> what<00:03:37.710> you're

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
this is just a shove it what you're

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.740 
this is just a shove it what you're
seeing<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.700> result<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:39.210> this<00:03:39.360> particular

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
seeing is the result of this particular

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.670 
seeing is the result of this particular
LED<00:03:40.410> which<00:03:40.680> which<00:03:41.340> obviously<00:03:41.670> sucks<00:03:42.120> but

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
LED which which obviously sucks but

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.990 
LED which which obviously sucks but
you'll<00:03:43.680> see<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.010> dim<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.400> bright<00:03:44.580> difference

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
you'll see the dim and bright difference

00:03:45.000 --> 00:04:01.390 
you'll see the dim and bright difference
in<00:03:45.450> there

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.459
