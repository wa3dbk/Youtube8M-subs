00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
and then just listen to my advice is

held<00:00:39.480> by<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.720> song

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
held by the song

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.400 
held by the song
so<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:42.090> first<00:00:42.740> step<00:00:43.740> you<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.490> do<00:00:44.970> this

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
so the first step you have to do this

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.240 
so the first step you have to do this
just<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.620> play<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.340> bass<00:00:48.150> strings<00:00:48.920> only<00:00:49.920> the

just to play the bass strings only the
strings<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.300> mute<00:00:51.870> button<00:00:52.910> three<00:00:53.910> strings

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
strings and a mute button three strings

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
strings and a mute button three strings
so<00:00:54.990> it<00:00:55.980> sounds<00:00:56.490> like<00:00:56.700> this<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.670> play

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
so it sounds like this and you will play

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.190 
so it sounds like this and you will play
advise<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:01.470> strokes<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.850> third<00:01:03.150> fret<00:01:06.200> again

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
advise down strokes the third fret again

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.730 
advise down strokes the third fret again
to<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.890> top<00:01:08.729> three<00:01:09.210> strings<00:01:09.560> then<00:01:10.560> we'll

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
to just top three strings then we'll

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.830 
to just top three strings then we'll
move<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.490> fifth<00:01:11.819> fret<00:01:12.319> B<00:01:13.319> the<00:01:13.469> same<00:01:14.840> shape

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
move to the fifth fret B the same shape

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.169

so<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.710> top<00:01:17.310> three<00:01:17.700> strings<00:01:17.999> a<00:01:19.639> little<00:01:20.639> bit

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
so the top three strings a little bit

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.380 
so the top three strings a little bit
faster

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390
