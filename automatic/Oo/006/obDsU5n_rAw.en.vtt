ask<00:00:03.149> an<00:00:03.480> astronomer

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.820 

why<00:00:09.330> isn't<00:00:09.599> sudo<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.320> planet<00:00:10.830> anymore<00:00:12.710> when<00:00:13.710> we

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
why isn't sudo a planet anymore when we

why isn't sudo a planet anymore when we
ask<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> question<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.700> what<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.480> isn't<00:00:15.809> a

planet we're really just talking about

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.410 
planet we're really just talking about
how<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.119> define<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.810> word<00:00:19.050> planet<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.430> ancient

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
how we define the word planet in ancient

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.769 
how we define the word planet in ancient
times<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.260> didn't<00:00:22.500> really<00:00:22.650> need<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.920> definition

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
times we didn't really need a definition

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.120 
times we didn't really need a definition
astronomers<00:00:24.779> noticed<00:00:24.990> five<00:00:25.439> star<00:00:25.920> like

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
astronomers noticed five star like

astronomers noticed five star like
objects<00:00:26.730> Mercury<00:00:27.300> Venus<00:00:27.570> Mars<00:00:27.750> Jupiter<00:00:28.439> and

objects Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
objects Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and
Saturn<00:00:29.189> they<00:00:29.580> didn't<00:00:29.849> move<00:00:30.000> around<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
Saturn they didn't move around with the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.389 
Saturn they didn't move around with the
other<00:00:30.689> stars<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.380> seemed<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.619> wander<00:00:31.949> through

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
other stars but seemed to wander through

other stars but seemed to wander through
the<00:00:32.489> sky<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.480> word<00:00:33.660> planet<00:00:33.989> comes<00:00:34.500> from<00:00:34.680> an

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the sky the word planet comes from an

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.209 
the sky the word planet comes from an
ancient<00:00:34.800> Greek<00:00:35.280> word<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.760> meant<00:00:35.969> wanderer

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
ancient Greek word that meant wanderer

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.229 
ancient Greek word that meant wanderer
eventually<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.340> figured<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> earth

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
eventually we figured out that the earth

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.450 
eventually we figured out that the earth
is<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> planet<00:00:39.750> -<00:00:40.140> orbiting<00:00:40.890> around<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> Sun

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
is a planet - orbiting around the Sun

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
is a planet - orbiting around the Sun
just<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.149> others<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.710> pretty

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
just like the others and that was pretty

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
just like the others and that was pretty
much<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> solar<00:00:44.940> system<00:00:45.390> until<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
much it for the solar system until the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.100 
much it for the solar system until the
age<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.379> telescopes<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:48.360> next<00:00:48.660> planet<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> be

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
age of telescopes the next planet to be

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.979 
age of telescopes the next planet to be
discovered<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.739> Uranus<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.370> 1781<00:00:51.030> followed

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
discovered was Uranus in 1781 followed

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.310 
discovered was Uranus in 1781 followed
by<00:00:52.140> Neptune<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.770> 1846<00:00:53.730> these<00:00:54.719> planets<00:00:55.140> are

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.740 
by Neptune in 1846 these planets are
huge<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.520> too<00:00:56.699> far<00:00:56.969> away<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.300> ancient

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
huge but just too far away for ancient

huge but just too far away for ancient
astronomers<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:58.940> but<00:00:59.940> did<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> know<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
astronomers to see but did you know that

in 1801 astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.750 
in 1801 astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi
discovered<00:01:03.000> another<00:01:03.870> planet<00:01:04.439> or<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.580> he

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
discovered another planet or so he

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.679 
discovered another planet or so he
thought<00:01:07.430> Piazzi<00:01:08.430> found<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.880> spherical<00:01:09.479> body

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
thought Piazzi found a spherical body

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.560 
thought Piazzi found a spherical body
about<00:01:10.110> 600<00:01:10.830> miles<00:01:11.010> across<00:01:11.270> orbiting<00:01:12.270> between

Mars and Jupiter the planet which is
smaller<00:01:15.869> than<00:01:15.990> our<00:01:16.259> Moon<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.770> called<00:01:17.009> Ceres

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
smaller than our Moon was called Ceres

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
smaller than our Moon was called Ceres
in<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.630> case<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.140> wasn't<00:01:19.290> too<00:01:19.500> distant<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
in this case it wasn't too distant to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.090 
in this case it wasn't too distant to
see<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.759> too<00:01:20.970> small<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.500> problem<00:01:22.920> however

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
see but too small the problem however

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.980 
see but too small the problem however
was<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.759> series<00:01:24.270> had<00:01:24.479> buddies<00:01:25.009> lots<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.280> them

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
was that series had buddies lots of them

was that series had buddies lots of them
the<00:01:27.990> very<00:01:28.200> next<00:01:28.470> year<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.979> smaller<00:01:29.400> object

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the very next year a smaller object

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.789 
the very next year a smaller object
named<00:01:30.060> palace<00:01:30.509> was<00:01:30.720> discovered<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> two

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
named palace was discovered and two

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.429 
named palace was discovered and two
years<00:01:32.040> after<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.400> another<00:01:32.970> named<00:01:33.210> Juno<00:01:33.659> we

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
years after that another named Juno we

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319 
years after that another named Juno we
now<00:01:34.650> know<00:01:34.920> about<00:01:35.220> thousands<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.119> similar

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
now know about thousands of similar

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.620 
now know about thousands of similar
bodies<00:01:37.310> instead<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.430> having<00:01:38.759> thousands<00:01:39.540> of

new planets to the solar system
astronomers<00:01:41.939> decided<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.540> made<00:01:42.720> more<00:01:42.899> sense

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
astronomers decided it made more sense

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.679 
astronomers decided it made more sense
to<00:01:43.409> group<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.890> objects<00:01:44.399> together<00:01:44.689> they

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
to group these objects together they

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.170 
to group these objects together they
named<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.990> new<00:01:46.110> class<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.649> objects<00:01:47.280> asteroids

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
named a new class of objects asteroids

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.880 
named a new class of objects asteroids

isn't<00:02:13.709> bigger<00:02:14.190> than<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.520> earth<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.940> Tombaugh

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
isn't bigger than the earth as Tombaugh

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.110 
isn't bigger than the earth as Tombaugh
initially<00:02:16.260> thought<00:02:16.610> instead<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:17.910> got<00:02:18.060> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
initially thought instead it's got a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.390 
initially thought instead it's got a
huge<00:02:18.420> moon<00:02:18.750> nearby<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.560> fact<00:02:19.800> some<00:02:20.130> people

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
huge moon nearby in fact some people

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.430 
huge moon nearby in fact some people
called<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.850> binary<00:02:21.330> planet<00:02:21.600> or<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> double

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
called it a binary planet or a double

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.449 
called it a binary planet or a double
planet<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.810> with<00:02:25.019> Ceres

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
planet and just like with Ceres

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.830 
planet and just like with Ceres
astronomers<00:02:26.459> discovered<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.090> Pluto<00:02:27.600> isn't

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
astronomers discovered that Pluto isn't

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.190 
astronomers discovered that Pluto isn't
alone<00:02:28.430> beginning<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> early<00:02:29.810> 1990s<00:02:30.810> they

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
alone beginning in the early 1990s they

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.410 
alone beginning in the early 1990s they
started<00:02:31.620> finding<00:02:32.040> other<00:02:32.250> objects<00:02:32.880> similar<00:02:33.150> to

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
started finding other objects similar to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.840 
started finding other objects similar to
Pluto<00:02:33.750> some<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.920> whoa<00:02:35.130> are<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.430> Sedna

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
Pluto some like whoa are and Sedna

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.930 
Pluto some like whoa are and Sedna
were<00:02:35.970> almost<00:02:36.209> as<00:02:36.630> big<00:02:36.920> then<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.069> 2005

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
were almost as big then in 2005

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.880 
were almost as big then in 2005
astronomers<00:02:39.480> announced<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.530> they'd<00:02:40.680> found

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
astronomers announced that they'd found

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.970 
astronomers announced that they'd found
an<00:02:41.100> object<00:02:41.340> named<00:02:41.940> Eris<00:02:42.510> even<00:02:43.319> bigger<00:02:43.680> than

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
an object named Eris even bigger than

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.180 
an object named Eris even bigger than
Pluto<00:02:44.269> so<00:02:45.269> are<00:02:45.630> all<00:02:46.019> these<00:02:46.590> planets

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
Pluto so are all these planets

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.910 
Pluto so are all these planets
astronomers<00:02:48.120> wondered<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.989> same<00:02:49.019> thing<00:02:49.470> and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
astronomers wondered the same thing and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.449 
astronomers wondered the same thing and
in<00:02:50.640> August<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.150> 2006<00:02:52.080> astronomers<00:02:52.560> from<00:02:53.190> all

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
in August of 2006 astronomers from all

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.190 
in August of 2006 astronomers from all
over<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.760> world<00:02:53.910> met<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.480> finally<00:02:54.840> decided

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
over the world met and finally decided

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.550 
over the world met and finally decided
on<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.470> formal<00:02:56.040> definition<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:57.030> planet<00:02:57.560> Pluto

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
on a formal definition of a planet Pluto

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.410 
on a formal definition of a planet Pluto
and<00:02:58.620> its<00:02:58.829> buddies<00:02:59.160> didn't<00:02:59.610> make<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.850> cut<00:03:00.120> and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
and its buddies didn't make the cut and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.880 
and its buddies didn't make the cut and
now<00:03:00.750> they're<00:03:00.989> known<00:03:01.170> as<00:03:01.200> dwarf<00:03:01.799> planets

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
now they're known as dwarf planets

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.860 
now they're known as dwarf planets
but<00:03:04.890> don't<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.430> upset<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.849> Pluto<00:03:06.360> isn't<00:03:06.750> a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
but don't be upset that Pluto isn't a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.259 
but don't be upset that Pluto isn't a
full-fledged<00:03:07.530> planet<00:03:07.980> anymore<00:03:08.269> instead

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
full-fledged planet anymore instead

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.059 
full-fledged planet anymore instead
think<00:03:09.599> how<00:03:09.720> exciting<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.409> is<00:03:10.439> that<00:03:10.890> there's

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
think how exciting it is that there's

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.589 
think how exciting it is that there's
still<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.549> much<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.730> learn<00:03:11.909> about<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.390> solar

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
still so much to learn about the solar

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.410 
still so much to learn about the solar
system<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.379> that<00:03:14.010> science<00:03:14.400> can<00:03:14.760> continue<00:03:15.239> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
system and that science can continue to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.300 
system and that science can continue to
set<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.780> record<00:03:15.930> straight<00:03:16.110> even<00:03:16.860> when<00:03:17.280> our

set the record straight even when our
