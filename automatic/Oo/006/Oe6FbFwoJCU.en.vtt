00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
need one bobber stop one slide float the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.390 
need one bobber stop one slide float the
proper<00:00:24.480> egg<00:00:24.720> weight<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.470> go<00:00:25.619> below<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.130> slide

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
proper egg weight to go below the slide

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.050 
proper egg weight to go below the slide
flow<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.420> you're<00:00:28.080> also<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.710> need<00:00:29.060> three

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
flow and you're also going to need three

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.110 
flow and you're also going to need three
beads<00:00:31.669> just<00:00:32.669> little<00:00:32.880> bobber<00:00:33.090> stop<00:00:33.450> beads<00:00:35.120> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
beads just little bobber stop beads the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.459 
beads just little bobber stop beads the
first<00:00:36.360> thing<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> we're<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> use<00:00:37.320> this

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
first thing is we're going to use this

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.979 
first thing is we're going to use this
as<00:00:37.649> our<00:00:37.739> mainline<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.790> got<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.420> inch<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
as our mainline just got this inch to a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.940 
as our mainline just got this inch to a
knot<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.829> float<00:00:41.370> will<00:00:41.579> stop<00:00:42.739> first<00:00:43.739> thing

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
knot so the float will stop first thing

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.900 
knot so the float will stop first thing
we're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.520> we're<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> take

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.190 
we're going to do is we're going to take
your<00:00:45.090> mainline<00:00:45.300> we're<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.930> take<00:00:46.079> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
your mainline we're going to take this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.190 
your mainline we're going to take this
bobber<00:00:46.469> stop<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.640> we're<00:00:47.760> gonna<00:00:47.850> run<00:00:48.200> that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
bobber stop and we're gonna run that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.630 
bobber stop and we're gonna run that
through<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.070> plastic<00:00:50.550> tube<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.460> looks

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
through the plastic tube so it looks

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.790 
through the plastic tube so it looks
something<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
something like that

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.080 
something like that
next<00:00:58.800> thing<00:00:58.920> we're<00:00:59.039> gonna<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.309> we're<00:01:00.030> gonna

next thing we're gonna do we're gonna
pinch<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.079> thread<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.920> bobber<00:01:02.100> stop<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
pinch the thread of the bobber stop and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.109 
pinch the thread of the bobber stop and
slide<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> plastic<00:01:03.420> piece<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.820> like<00:01:05.820> so

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
slide the plastic piece out like so

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.890 
slide the plastic piece out like so
cinch<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:09.119> slide<00:01:09.420> float<00:01:09.720> is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
cinch that down now your slide float is

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.219 
cinch that down now your slide float is
in<00:01:10.049> control<00:01:11.210> next<00:01:12.210> we're<00:01:12.330> gonna<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.720> we're

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
in control next we're gonna do we're

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.090 
in control next we're gonna do we're
gonna<00:01:13.320> take<00:01:13.619> our<00:01:13.799> bead<00:01:15.740> clips<00:01:18.770> we're<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
gonna take our bead clips we're going to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.469 
gonna take our bead clips we're going to
slide<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> main<00:01:21.990> line<00:01:23.479> right

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
slide that on to the main line right

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.550 
slide that on to the main line right
below<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> bobber<00:01:24.990> stop

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
below the bobber stop

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.380 
below the bobber stop
so<00:01:26.070> look<00:01:26.250> something<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:28.159> next<00:01:29.159> step

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
so look something like that next step

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.539 
so look something like that next step
will<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.930> slide<00:01:31.229> flow<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:32.009> happens<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
will be your slide flow this happens to

to your egg sinker like I said it's a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.460 
to your egg sinker like I said it's a
quarter-ounce<00:02:09.690> float<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.200> I've<00:02:10.289> got<00:02:10.440> a

you're fishing 10 feet of water you can
just<00:03:52.950> slide<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.640> up<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:55.680> become<00:03:55.890> 10

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
just slide this up and you become 10

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.819 
just slide this up and you become 10
feet<00:03:56.760> if<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.420> got<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.600> fish<00:03:57.870> five<00:03:58.170> feet<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.680> can

feet if you got a fish five feet you can

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.520 
feet if you got a fish five feet you can
slide<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.459> down<00:03:59.720> but<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:00.780> also<00:04:00.930> like<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.230> do

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
slide this down but I also like to do

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.849 
slide this down but I also like to do
when<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.310> cinch<00:04:02.670> these<00:04:02.880> down<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.510> actually<00:04:04.410> take

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
when I cinch these down I actually take

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.580 
when I cinch these down I actually take
these<00:04:05.100> two<00:04:05.400> tags<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.350> cut<00:04:07.590> these<00:04:07.799> off<00:04:09.590> like

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
these two tags and I cut these off like

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.740 
these two tags and I cut these off like
so<00:04:10.890> so<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.730> way<00:04:11.880> they're<00:04:12.030> just<00:04:12.180> not<00:04:12.329> dangling

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
so so that way they're just not dangling

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.370 
so so that way they're just not dangling
around

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380
