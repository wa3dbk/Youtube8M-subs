00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.160
 this year 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.570
 good laugh capable of another half 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 but 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.950
 the laity 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.950
 two 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.570
 I smile 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.570
 it will only be passed 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.159
 all right 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.320
 Languages 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280
 good 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.900
 nobody found out about anything 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.880
 when hearing 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.630
 it is pirated 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 to 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.290
 serene 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.030
 and here 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.530
 how perfect your voice in perfect reality 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.470
 I have listened to your voice with much 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.510
 feeling with a lot of love you have done the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.870
 melismas that the wool has given you 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.400
 walked through the song you know that I 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.350
 choose me or not does not matter but 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.350
 congratulations, thank you very much 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.629
 what's your name alexandra fernandez 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.689
 alexandra and how old are you 13 13 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.909
 you know when when I start the song 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.920
 'la a carignano we turned to see 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.230
 because it is always a risk to sing a 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.329
 song that technically has just been 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.489
 on the rise we have not just heard it in the 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.510
 voice of bruno mars and it was also a great 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.040
 song and we were very afraid that 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.769
 We were going to listen because we still have 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.510
 the voice of bruno mars in the head but 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.120
 you did it so your way with a voice 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.129
 so beautiful you do not need piano themes 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.470
 also which talks about how it fills up 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.019
 voice to all ears 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.480
 thank you very much for doing it and good 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.189
 I hope of course you choose me but 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.299
 I just wanted to compliment you congratulations 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.150

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.209

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.310
 is that since I heard the first note 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.819
 from your voice I just squeezed that 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.950
