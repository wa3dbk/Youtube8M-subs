 hello youtube friends welcome to me 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:10.179
 first video tutorial today I will teach you to 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:13.240
 How to remove the calpe is 2014 2013 or 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.250
 2012 in any of those three works 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.640
 it's a very easy and simple trick 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.119
 let's start we open our fish in this 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.210
 case i will open mipes 2012 you what 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.279
 they open the fish they have 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.579
 to blows that want to remove the act 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.910
 I open like this because this is my patch on 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.910
 My PC 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.390
 and once you're starting the game what 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.270
 minimize with the windows key of 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.090
 created site if they know it or if not with 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.550
 the control key without releasing the key 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.350
 escape 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:53.670
 they press and the game will be minimized 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.680
 and then we went to the part 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.659
 bottom of the pc down here to the bar 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.969
 of tasks we give a right click and we 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.870
 we direct to start the administrator of 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.840
 tasks we give a click 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 here we go to the processes tab 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.039
 and it will open all the processes that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.039
 there is in our computer we look for 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.980
 here the pes 2012 point exe or the thousand peso 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.360
 thirteen or fourteen 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.610
 the one that you have executed 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.150
 I run in 2012 post 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.690
 the selection of this fish 2012 exc 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.690
 let's say a right click 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.479
 we went to establish priority and 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.830
 the right hand would open another 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.320
 little box 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.480
 we go to high here we give a 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.640
 click and another box will appear 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.850
 and we only give a click on change 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.140
 priority 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.620
 and ready we close 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.580
 we enter our game we maximize it 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.640
 we enter and ready 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.230
 they start playing in this case I'll 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.450
 I will close 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.280
 because if I do not play it will run slow 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.110
 because I'm recording you 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.320
 will run perfectly 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.750
