00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.080
 [Music] 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.660
 I do not think you let yourself show on camera 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.539
 really hello guys how are you in the day 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.539
 today as you can see I'm with 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.990
 My puppy was good because he left 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.119
 cachi cachi cachi match and here is 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.079
 I'm funny because I 've brought it to the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.330
 aesthetics in animal already and rape it because 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.330
 They leave a lot of hair and cause allergy 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.010
 unfortunately but good and apart if you 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.820
 keeps cleaner cooler since 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.050
 hot but my love 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.930
 it's a good hatch and it 's a little bit 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.930
 as you can see by his tail 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.640
 and I realized that I've never done a 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.500
 video about kachin well listen to that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.410
 Noise is because he likes to chase 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.990
 a matus matus is a cat that I room and 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.080
 have decided to make a such the tar of the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.060
 mascot or the tag of the furry friend 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.490
 there is a youtube for a while now 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.730
 because I want to teach them how to get off 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.770
 and it has almost completely changed my life 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.260
 since I have it, my life has changed 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.520
 complete and that is something very nice and the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.369
 he's really handsome, so 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.220
 how not to show it off so let's see 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.710
 I'm going to make the mascot tag 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.710
 look for it because I do not know here 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.980
 20 let's answer some questions from 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.710
 youtube is worth if it is 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:52.830
 well what is the name of your pet 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.830
 hey it's hatch and waves to the camera 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.180
 what kind of breed is your dog 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.670
 it's a pouf or they're called pugs or 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.210
 something like that but good is a little I like 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.709
 plus 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.780
 tell them fugitive carlinos by how much 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.790
 you've had your pet good 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.620
 here I have it since December as 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.700
 early December 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.700
 but my love 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.319
 as you had your good pet post 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.459
 on my social networks on facebook and in 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.110
 twitter if people knew about 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.110
 someone who was giving an adoption 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.270
 a puppy because then basically I 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.520
 I felt a little lonely and allowed and 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.640
 apart I wanted to take care of someone they know and 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.370
 not so much a baby or an elder if not 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.459
 I wanted a puppy and that the bear I have a 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.480
 cat and I like cats but do not be 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.090
 a dog is like patxi hashish can 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.590
 chase the cat 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.690
 now I feel alone again you love me 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.690
 stay all the video that's cheating 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:15.060
 mention something about the person in your 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:18.299
 pet and funny things I think good 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.040
 hatch and he is super affectionate too 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.019
 Affectionate and too social love 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.150
 people never run out of battery or 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.840
 come out almost as you can see you will never be 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.840
 finish the stack 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.470
 is very very very playful and I say is 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.200
 I am 8 months old and it seems to me 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.849
 very kid is very playful do not give 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.830
 fear of animals is super brave 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.200
 then suddenly in the park you will be 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.790
 throws the biggest dogs and the 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.670
 big dogs like they say that but 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.080
 with this wrinkled dwarf but it is 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.299
 It is very good with everyone, it's like very 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.280
 social likes to interact a lot with 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.540
 other people and with their animals to 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.280
 all the people who think that the 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.720
 Bucs are calm because I before 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.299
 have a little research about the 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.769
 bucs and said they were calm let me 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.329
 tell them that no bucs are not 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.400
 calm for nothing I'm already when 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.079
 Haci age but I think you have to 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.620
 take a walk many times you have to 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:14.410
 play a lot with him because if he does not get 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.510
 crazy crazy like that makes 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.010
 load it 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.190
 and the truth is that check is very 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.190
 smart 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.410
 I say is made to eat the cat poop for 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.940
 call my attention makes pranks for 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.860
 call my attention to them and see that I do not 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.380
 I'm fighting like right now you 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.320
 I assure you that he is going to grab something or he goes 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.430
 and he likes to play wynton I'm going to 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.430
 teach now 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.649
 [Music] 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.130
 question number 7 is what does your 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.350
 relationship with your dog for you good the 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.700
 truth is that it almost saved my life 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.380
 when I was looking for a puppy and 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.750
 got hashish and I was in a stage of 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.580
 my life very sad I say I was like 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.270
 coming out of that depression but the truth 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.190
 is that I felt that I needed something 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.720
 and even though I had a lot of work 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.540
 I kept thinking about things and 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.240
 people that the truth did not want to think 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.490
 and hutch and pulled me out of that hatch and pulled me out 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.590
 a lot of depression and changed my life 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.840
 for good it makes me laugh makes me a lot 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.540
 company the truth is that I never thought 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.100
 that a puppy could become your 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.840
 literal best friend as they say that the 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.540
 dog is man's best friend ever 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.520
 I thought about it but now he confirmed that it is 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.100
 true what are your memories 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.200
 favorites with your pet 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:47.300
 hashish because it basically when 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.890
 when you travel and yazira very very very 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.720
 little boy then did not want to miss 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.810
 his little brothers and his mom 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.720
 so I literally treat it like 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.080
 my son and I think he thinks he came out of 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.410
 my hatch age and think that I gave birth to 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.660
 hatch and they know then it 's very funny 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.670
 because with other people and coexists 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.130
 ok but it's very calm and with me it's 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.050
 as mom and mom came and I say is 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.110
 father but there are times that I say or do not say 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.210
 is very very dependent on me but 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.790
 I say father and I laugh a lot 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.500
