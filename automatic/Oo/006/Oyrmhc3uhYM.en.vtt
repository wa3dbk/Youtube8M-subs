00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
around the set of tools so this is for

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.720 
around the set of tools so this is for
the<00:02:44.780> new<00:02:44.930> format<00:02:45.230> obviously<00:02:45.890> like<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.550> said

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
the new format obviously like I said

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.880 
the new format obviously like I said
earlier<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.750> there<00:02:48.320> isn't<00:02:48.530> really<00:02:48.590> anything

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
earlier and there isn't really anything

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.440 
earlier and there isn't really anything
I<00:02:49.010> want<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.220> say<00:02:49.400> about<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.730> monster<00:02:49.970> on<00:02:50.180> up<00:02:50.330> i

I want to say about the monster on up i

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.320 
I want to say about the monster on up i
don't<00:02:50.480> think<00:02:51.010> except<00:02:52.010> for<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.910> kind<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.150> have

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
don't think except for you kind of have

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.800 
don't think except for you kind of have
to<00:02:53.360> run<00:02:53.660> these<00:02:53.840> as<00:02:54.350> targets<00:02:54.950> for<00:02:55.070> recruiter

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
to run these as targets for recruiter

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.750 
to run these as targets for recruiter
and<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:57.620> think<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:57.980> just<00:02:58.190> totally<00:02:58.340> took<00:02:58.640> it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
and I think if I just totally took it

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.250 
and I think if I just totally took it
out<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:58.970> deck<00:02:59.180> I'd<00:02:59.330> be<00:02:59.420> really<00:02:59.570> upset<00:02:59.990> so

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
out of the deck I'd be really upset so

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.570 
out of the deck I'd be really upset so
even<00:03:01.010> though<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:01.220> not<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.550> great

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
even though it's not that great

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.730 
even though it's not that great
sometimes<00:03:02.240> I<00:03:02.510> think<00:03:02.600> yourself<00:03:02.990> to<00:03:03.050> run<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.440> so

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
sometimes I think yourself to run it so

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.490 
sometimes I think yourself to run it so
I'm<00:03:04.550> going<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.760> run<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:06.170> then<00:03:06.320> for<00:03:06.440> the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
I'm going to run it and then for the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.530 
I'm going to run it and then for the
spells<00:03:06.800> I'm<00:03:07.670> running<00:03:07.910> through<00:03:08.060> adecco<00:03:08.210> Valley

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
spells I'm running through adecco Valley

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.320 
spells I'm running through adecco Valley
because<00:03:08.810> everybody<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.920> running<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.580> msg<00:03:11.090> and

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
because everybody is running to msg and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.060 
because everybody is running to msg and

then they're going to be sighting in
like<00:03:13.910> dust<00:03:14.210> tornado<00:03:14.600> or<00:03:14.720> something<00:03:15.200> else<00:03:15.680> to

like dust tornado or something else to
counter<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:18.170> necrovalley<00:03:18.740> because

counter the necrovalley because

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.890 
counter the necrovalley because

gravekeeper's obviously still going to
be<00:03:20.990> a<00:03:21.020> threat<00:03:21.230> for<00:03:21.410> everybody<00:03:21.770> so<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.730> really

because I just don't want to have to
know<00:03:28.220> my<00:03:28.490> guess<00:03:28.640> lose<00:03:28.880> out<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.620> getting<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.740> my

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
know my guess lose out on getting to my

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.920 
know my guess lose out on getting to my
necrovalley<00:03:31.220> with<00:03:31.640> like<00:03:31.820> a<00:03:31.850> common<00:03:32.660> down<00:03:32.810> or

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
necrovalley with like a common down or

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.290 
necrovalley with like a common down or
something<00:03:33.140> because<00:03:33.790> because<00:03:34.790> they<00:03:34.910> got<00:03:35.090> rid

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
something because because they got rid

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.600 
something because because they got rid
of<00:03:35.360> two<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:36.020> you<00:03:36.860> know<00:03:36.950> if<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.280> didn't<00:03:37.460> run<00:03:37.580> a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
of two and you know if I didn't run a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.100 
of two and you know if I didn't run a
third<00:03:37.850> then<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.150> obviously<00:03:38.570> wouldn't<00:03:38.900> be<00:03:39.020> able

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
third then I obviously wouldn't be able

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.090 
third then I obviously wouldn't be able
to<00:03:39.260> get<00:03:39.410> that<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:40.070> yes<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.940> would<00:03:40.970> three<00:03:41.300> on<00:03:42.100> Hank

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
to get that so yes I would three on Hank

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.620 
to get that so yes I would three on Hank
all<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.580> pretty<00:03:43.820> standard<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.600> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
all this is pretty standard and the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.470 
all this is pretty standard and the
spells<00:03:45.020> as<00:03:45.230> well<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.370> pretty<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:46.880> mean

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
spells as well this is pretty I mean

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.760 
spells as well this is pretty I mean
it's<00:03:47.600> kind<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.900> generic<00:03:48.260> deck<00:03:48.410> until<00:03:48.620> you

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
it's kind of a generic deck until you

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.310 
it's kind of a generic deck until you
get<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.040> trap<00:03:49.310> line<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.640> i<00:03:49.730> guess<00:03:49.790> but<00:03:50.320> only

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
get to the trap line up i guess but only

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.710 
get to the trap line up i guess but only
running<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.650> stellas<00:03:52.100> just<00:03:52.430> because<00:03:52.670> i<00:03:53.000> don't

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
running to stellas just because i don't

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.870 
running to stellas just because i don't
know<00:03:53.810> just<00:03:54.650> seems<00:03:54.860> more<00:03:55.040> more<00:03:55.400> consistent

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
know just seems more more consistent

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.300 
know just seems more more consistent
that<00:03:56.000> way<00:03:56.320> since<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.500> last<00:03:57.620> time<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:57.920> ran<00:03:58.070> three

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
that way since the last time I ran three

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.890 
that way since the last time I ran three
steles<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.820> was<00:03:58.940> also<00:03:59.180> running<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.660> lights

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
steles I was also running the lights

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.410 
steles I was also running the lights
Ford<00:04:00.140> engine<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:01.070> kind<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:01.910> made<00:04:02.030> more<00:04:02.240> sense

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
Ford engine so kind of made more sense

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.480 
Ford engine so kind of made more sense
to<00:04:02.630> run<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.900> then<00:04:03.050> but<00:04:03.350> now<00:04:03.980> I'm<00:04:04.160> five<00:04:04.370> or

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
to run it then but now I'm five or

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.449 
to run it then but now I'm five or
thirty<00:04:04.580> two<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.959> then<00:04:06.170> yeah<00:04:06.410> I<00:04:06.650> guess<00:04:07.280> those

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
thirty two and then yeah I guess those

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.480 
thirty two and then yeah I guess those
are<00:04:07.490> all<00:04:07.730> self-explanatory<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.860> then<00:04:10.220> from

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
are all self-explanatory and then from

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.090 
are all self-explanatory and then from
traps<00:04:11.030> card<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:11.959> want<00:04:12.020> to<00:04:12.140> talk<00:04:12.230> about<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:12.770> guess

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
traps card I want to talk about I guess

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
prison i think is necessary main deck to

prison i think is necessary main deck to
might<00:04:20.239> even<00:04:20.419> be<00:04:20.600> good<00:04:20.780> too<00:04:20.960> i<00:04:21.169> haven't<00:04:21.890> tried

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
might even be good too i haven't tried

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.270 
might even be good too i haven't tried
to<00:04:22.310> just<00:04:22.640> try<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.820> one<00:04:23.030> so

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
to just try the one so

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.400 
to just try the one so
far<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:24.270> dimensional<00:04:24.780> prison<00:04:24.900> is<00:04:25.170> pretty

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
far but dimensional prison is pretty

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.370 
far but dimensional prison is pretty
necessary<00:04:25.590> since<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.460> lost<00:04:26.670> your<00:04:27.110> books<00:04:28.110> you

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.460 
only have one now which is really
unfortunate<00:04:29.850> because<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:31.230> could<00:04:31.290> have<00:04:31.410> been

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
unfortunate because that could have been

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.120 
unfortunate because that could have been

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
hole and then torrential mirror force so

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.840 
hole and then torrential mirror force so
I<00:04:57.090> mean<00:04:57.960> basically<00:04:58.680> if<00:04:59.190> they<00:04:59.340> have<00:04:59.460> one<00:04:59.610> back

I mean basically if they have one back
row<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.330> can<00:05:00.570> go<00:05:00.720> for<00:05:00.930> game<00:05:01.140> I<00:05:01.320> just<00:05:01.560> like<00:05:01.710> to

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
kind of like a noobish way to look at it

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.460 
kind of like a noobish way to look at it
but<00:05:08.130> just<00:05:08.730> saw<00:05:09.600> it<00:05:09.660> was<00:05:09.810> just<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.080> great<00:05:10.200> car

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
but just saw it was just a great car

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.830 
but just saw it was just a great car
especially<00:05:10.650> dicks<00:05:11.070> that<00:05:11.360> rely<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.510> keeping

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
especially dicks that rely on keeping

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.030 
especially dicks that rely on keeping
their<00:05:12.960> monsters<00:05:13.320> on<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.440> field<00:05:13.560> like<00:05:13.890> this

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
their monsters on the field like this

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.810 
their monsters on the field like this
deck<00:05:14.220> does<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:16.169> then<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:17.130> oppression

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
deck does and then the oppression

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.250 
deck does and then the oppression
depression<00:05:18.510> i<00:05:18.600> think<00:05:18.750> is<00:05:18.870> very<00:05:19.020> very

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
depression i think is very very

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.730 
depression i think is very very
necessary<00:05:19.710> now<00:05:20.810> last<00:05:21.810> format<00:05:22.200> I<00:05:22.320> know<00:05:22.380> Frasier

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
necessary now last format I know Frasier

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.980 
necessary now last format I know Frasier
and<00:05:22.860> those<00:05:23.040> guys<00:05:23.220> didn't<00:05:23.520> run<00:05:23.669> this<00:05:23.850> but<00:05:24.630> I

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
and those guys didn't run this but I

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.560 
and those guys didn't run this but I
think<00:05:25.050> you<00:05:25.410> have<00:05:25.590> to<00:05:25.620> run<00:05:25.919> it<00:05:25.950> it's<00:05:26.700> just<00:05:26.940> it's

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
think you have to run it it's just it's

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.360 
think you have to run it it's just it's
just<00:05:27.630> it's<00:05:27.780> just<00:05:28.020> way<00:05:28.260> too<00:05:28.320> like<00:05:28.740> one<00:05:28.950> sided<00:05:29.280> of

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
just it's just way too like one sided of

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.750 
just it's just way too like one sided of
a<00:05:29.430> card<00:05:29.700> and<00:05:30.060> if<00:05:30.750> you<00:05:30.900> can<00:05:30.990> get<00:05:31.110> your

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
a card and if you can get your

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.260 
a card and if you can get your
descendant<00:05:32.760> and<00:05:32.850> your<00:05:34.700> recruiter<00:05:35.700> combo

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
descendant and your recruiter combo

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.110 
descendant and your recruiter combo
going<00:05:36.450> then<00:05:36.810> this<00:05:37.350> card's<00:05:37.620> is<00:05:37.710> even<00:05:37.950> better

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
going then this card's is even better

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.480 
going then this card's is even better
and<00:05:39.120> then<00:05:39.240> I<00:05:39.330> rather<00:05:39.479> 17<00:05:39.990> tools<00:05:40.200> right<00:05:41.100> now<00:05:41.280> I'm

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
and then I rather 17 tools right now I'm

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.950 
and then I rather 17 tools right now I'm
honestly<00:05:41.789> thinking<00:05:41.850> about<00:05:42.180> you<00:05:42.390> bumping<00:05:42.780> this

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
honestly thinking about you bumping this

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.260 
honestly thinking about you bumping this
up<00:05:43.169> to<00:05:43.289> two<00:05:43.500> or<00:05:44.220> buffing<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.640> prison<00:05:44.910> up<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.120> do

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
up to two or buffing the prison up to do

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.219 
up to two or buffing the prison up to do
but<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.470> seven<00:05:47.310> tool<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:47.550> really<00:05:47.789> good<00:05:48.229> just

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
but the seven tool is really good just

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.770 
but the seven tool is really good just
because<00:05:49.560> this<00:05:50.370> formats<00:05:50.729> still<00:05:51.180> trapped<00:05:51.570> base

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
because this formats still trapped base

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.330 
because this formats still trapped base
like<00:05:52.020> it<00:05:52.140> was<00:05:52.229> last<00:05:52.350> format<00:05:52.770> just<00:05:52.979> be<00:05:53.100> able<00:05:53.160> to

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.159 
stop a warning and really miss your punt
it<00:05:55.650> up<00:05:55.770> or<00:05:56.250> be<00:05:56.820> able<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.090> stop<00:05:57.419> their<00:05:57.720> traps

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
it up or be able to stop their traps

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.469 
it up or be able to stop their traps
done<00:05:58.440> because<00:05:59.430> traps<00:05:59.700> done<00:05:59.910> is<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.060> huge<00:06:00.270> card

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
done because traps done is a huge card

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.240 
done because traps done is a huge card
right<00:06:00.630> now<00:06:00.780> seven<00:06:01.560> tool<00:06:01.740> is<00:06:01.830> just<00:06:01.979> a<00:06:02.039> really
