hundred<00:02:02.040> percent<00:02:02.220> hard<00:02:03.410> but<00:02:04.410> i<00:02:04.590> would<00:02:04.800> say

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
hundred percent hard but i would say

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.550 
hundred percent hard but i would say
about<00:02:05.570> 90%<00:02:06.570> hardness<00:02:08.960> so<00:02:09.960> you<00:02:10.020> get<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.320> nice

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560

we need to sharpen them because the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.380 
we need to sharpen them because the
motion<00:02:46.560> blows<00:02:46.800> made<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.250> nail<00:02:47.430> quite<00:02:47.670> soft<00:02:48.000> so

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
motion blows made the nail quite soft so

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.199 
motion blows made the nail quite soft so
we<00:02:48.510> need<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.780> bring<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.170> sharpness<00:02:49.620> back

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
we need to bring that sharpness back

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.600 
we need to bring that sharpness back
into<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.390> nails<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.860> I've<00:02:53.010> sharpened<00:02:53.310> it

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
into the nails so I've sharpened it

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.520 
into the nails so I've sharpened it
twice<00:02:53.910> because<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.780> particular<00:02:54.989> shot

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
twice because for this particular shot

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.670 
twice because for this particular shot
that's<00:02:56.420> given<00:02:57.420> me<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.540> pretty<00:02:57.810> good<00:02:57.900> result<00:02:58.410> and

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.539 

I<00:03:01.680> might<00:03:02.209> sharpen<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.590> once<00:03:04.590> more<00:03:07.040> yes<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.340> think

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
I might sharpen it once more yes I think

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.750 
I might sharpen it once more yes I think
that's<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:09.000> better<00:03:09.120> result<00:03:10.100> okay<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.160> now<00:03:11.489> I'll

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
that's a better result okay so now I'll

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.479 
that's a better result okay so now I'll
add<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.510> new<00:03:13.080> layer<00:03:13.290> fill<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.980> with<00:03:14.130> fifty

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
add a new layer fill it with fifty

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.020 
add a new layer fill it with fifty
percent<00:03:14.760> grey<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:16.350> make<00:03:16.500> sure<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:17.130> it's<00:03:17.850> set

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
percent grey and make sure that it's set

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.280 
percent grey and make sure that it's set
to<00:03:18.060> overlay<00:03:19.310> now<00:03:20.310> with<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.549> brush<00:03:20.850> set<00:03:21.299> at<00:03:21.600> ten

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
to overlay now with a brush set at ten

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.720 
to overlay now with a brush set at ten
to<00:03:22.500> fifteen<00:03:22.830> percent<00:03:24.290> in<00:03:25.290> white<00:03:25.650> I'm<00:03:26.070> going<00:03:26.640> to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
to fifteen percent in white I'm going to

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.330 
to fifteen percent in white I'm going to
do<00:03:26.850> two<00:03:27.000> highlights

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:44.210 

okay<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.030> we<00:03:35.330> just<00:03:35.360> paint<00:03:35.959> in<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:38.269> highlights

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.480 

and<00:03:44.310> once<00:03:45.240> we've<00:03:45.450> done<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.890> we'll<00:03:46.890> also<00:03:47.190> do

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
and once we've done that we'll also do

00:03:47.490 --> 00:04:00.300 
and once we've done that we'll also do
the<00:03:47.610> same<00:03:47.880> for<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.630> shadows

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.190 

okay<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.000> I'm<00:04:01.300> just<00:04:01.480> going<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.750> go<00:04:01.810> ahead<00:04:02.020> now

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
okay so I'm just going to go ahead now

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.590 
okay so I'm just going to go ahead now
and<00:04:03.300> do<00:04:04.300> this

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:27.100 

now<00:04:09.600> I'll<00:04:09.840> apply<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.230> shadows

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.779 

once<00:04:27.710> you've<00:04:27.889> done<00:04:28.039> the<00:04:28.189> shadows<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:29.569> can<00:04:29.719> see

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
once you've done the shadows you can see

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:37.420 
once you've done the shadows you can see
that<00:04:31.789> if<00:04:31.879> I<00:04:32.000> do<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:33.500> before<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.750> after<00:04:36.430> it's

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
that if I do the before and after it's

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.390 
that if I do the before and after it's
quite<00:04:37.729> a<00:04:37.789> dramatic<00:04:38.590> difference<00:04:39.590> between<00:04:40.310> the

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
quite a dramatic difference between the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.589 
quite a dramatic difference between the
two<00:04:40.610> on<00:04:41.300> one<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.810> nails<00:04:42.050> look<00:04:42.409> smooth<00:04:42.770> shiny

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
two on one the nails look smooth shiny

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:48.610 
two on one the nails look smooth shiny
without<00:04:44.620> imperfections<00:04:47.409> it's<00:04:48.409> quite

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
without imperfections it's quite

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.629 
without imperfections it's quite
incredible<00:04:48.770> really<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:51.500> go<00:04:52.039> on<00:04:52.159> have<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.430> go
