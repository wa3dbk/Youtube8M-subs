00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
paper backing so that the technology is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.050 
paper backing so that the technology is
very<00:02:17.800> complicated<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.390> what<00:02:19.930> we<00:02:20.020> do<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.819> we<00:02:21.819> lay

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
very complicated so what we do is we lay

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.250 
very complicated so what we do is we lay
out<00:02:22.360> our<00:02:22.989> fabric<00:02:23.880> we<00:02:24.880> take<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.420> sticky<00:02:26.019> side

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
out our fabric we take the sticky side

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.220 
out our fabric we take the sticky side
of<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> glue<00:02:26.890> which<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.430> obvious<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.390> put<00:02:29.080> it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
of the glue which is obvious you put it

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.910 
of the glue which is obvious you put it
down<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:30.340> press<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.599> then<00:02:31.870> voila<00:02:33.060> it's

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
down you press it on and then voila it's

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.630 
down you press it on and then voila it's
on<00:02:35.920> there<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:38.340> there's<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.519> many

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
on there and then there's so many

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.029 
gorgeous hot I just sewed I did a little
zigzag<00:05:36.930> around<00:05:37.199> here<00:05:37.440> which<00:05:37.620> I'll<00:05:37.740> hold<00:05:37.889> it

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
zigzag around here which I'll hold it

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.279 
zigzag around here which I'll hold it
all<00:05:38.159> together<00:05:38.280> nicely<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:39.180> think<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.110> what<00:05:40.229> we

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
all together nicely I think that what we

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.350 
all together nicely I think that what we
should<00:05:40.320> do<00:05:40.650> is<00:05:40.889> do<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.159> zigzag<00:05:41.520> around<00:05:42.000> the

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
should do is do a zigzag around the

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.240 
should do is do a zigzag around the
whole<00:05:43.130> thing<00:05:44.419> so<00:05:45.419> we<00:05:45.509> put<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.840> star<00:05:46.169> on<00:05:46.199> and<00:05:47.130> we

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
whole thing so we put the star on and we

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.860 
whole thing so we put the star on and we
sewed<00:05:47.490> it<00:05:47.610> with<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.849> yellow<00:05:48.060> from<00:05:48.509> the<00:05:48.630> top

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
sewed it with the yellow from the top

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.969 
sewed it with the yellow from the top
and<00:05:49.169> then<00:05:49.860> I<00:05:49.949> flipped<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:50.639> over<00:05:51.860> where<00:05:52.860> the

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
and then I flipped it over where the

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.370 
and then I flipped it over where the
opening<00:05:53.460> was<00:05:53.699> and<00:05:54.120> then<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.419> sewed<00:05:54.719> just<00:05:55.080> around

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
opening was and then I sewed just around

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.550 
opening was and then I sewed just around
the<00:05:55.530> opening<00:05:55.949> edge<00:05:56.130> which<00:05:56.580> made<00:05:57.080> you<00:05:58.080> know<00:05:58.229> the
