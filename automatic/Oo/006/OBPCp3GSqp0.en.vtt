00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
down for this class setup and what I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
down for this class setup and what I
like<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.879> use<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.390> thing<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.079> sucks

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
like to use now the thing that sucks

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.319 
like to use now the thing that sucks
about<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.850> only<00:00:48.030> use<00:00:48.180> three

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
about it is you can only use three

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.930 
about it is you can only use three
attachments<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.890> three<00:00:50.129> attachments<00:00:50.760> are

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
attachments so the three attachments are

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.360 
attachments so the three attachments are
quick<00:00:51.270> draw<00:00:51.539> advanced<00:00:52.079> rifling<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.710> stock<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
quick draw advanced rifling in stock I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
quick draw advanced rifling in stock I
recommend<00:00:53.820> using<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.420> three<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.840> them<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
recommend using all three of them I

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.560 
recommend using all three of them I
think<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.980> works<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.460> best<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.210> don't<00:00:57.390> miss

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
think it works the best you don't miss

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.939 
think it works the best you don't miss
as<00:00:57.719> many<00:00:57.899> shots<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> little<00:00:58.859> bit

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
as many shots and you have a little bit

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.040 
as many shots and you have a little bit
more<00:00:59.129> range<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.699> advanced<00:01:00.030> rifling<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.020> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
more range with advanced rifling so I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.959 
more range with advanced rifling so I
highly<00:01:01.379> recommend<00:01:01.680> using<00:01:02.219> those<00:01:02.520> three

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
highly recommend using those three

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.200 
highly recommend using those three
attachments<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.670> grind<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
attachments it can be kind of a grind to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.539 
attachments it can be kind of a grind to
get<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.439> best<00:01:07.650> way<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.250> level

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
get them and the best way to like level

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.830 
get them and the best way to like level
up<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> gun<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.540> kills

put the pellets inside the gun and then
you<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.270> add<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.899> more

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you have to like add a little bit more

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.569 
you have to like add a little bit more
stuff<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:46.649> push<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.920> down<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
stuff and then push it down with the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789 
stuff and then push it down with the
stick<00:01:47.880> because<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.720> kind<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> musket

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
stick because it's kind of like a musket

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.490 
stick because it's kind of like a musket
it's<00:01:50.040> crazy<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.970> feels<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.479> you're<00:01:52.079> using<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it's crazy it feels like you're using a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.429 
it's crazy it feels like you're using a
civil<00:01:52.890> war<00:01:53.100> gun<00:01:53.399> from<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> 1800s<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
civil war gun from like the 1800s and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.340 
civil war gun from like the 1800s and
it's<00:01:56.250> pretty<00:01:56.520> ridiculous<00:01:56.759> guys<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.540> overall

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
it's pretty ridiculous guys so overall

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 
it's pretty ridiculous guys so overall
this<00:01:58.590> class<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.549> right<00:02:00.119> i<00:02:00.149> mean<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.750> gun

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
this class is all right i mean this gun

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.859 
this class is all right i mean this gun
is<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.680> best<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.700> kind<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.540> did<00:02:03.719> what<00:02:03.840> I

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
is not the best so I kind of did what I

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.710 
is not the best so I kind of did what I
could

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
could

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.960 
could
with<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.140> class<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.740> like<00:02:06.160> I<00:02:06.280> said<00:02:06.340> guys<00:02:06.730> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
with the class so like I said guys the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.510 
with the class so like I said guys the
tangents<00:02:07.510> are<00:02:07.600> quick<00:02:07.930> draw<00:02:08.229> advanced<00:02:08.979> rifling

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
tangents are quick draw advanced rifling

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.460 
tangents are quick draw advanced rifling
and<00:02:09.729> stock<00:02:10.090> quick<00:02:10.450> drops<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:11.050> can<00:02:11.200> aim<00:02:11.320> down

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
and stock quick drops you can aim down

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.980 
and stock quick drops you can aim down
the<00:02:11.530> sights<00:02:11.650> faster<00:02:12.400> advanced<00:02:13.150> rifling<00:02:13.690> so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
the sights faster advanced rifling so

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.720 
the sights faster advanced rifling so
you<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> longer<00:02:14.950> range<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.670> then

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
you can have a longer range and then

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.910 
you can have a longer range and then
stock<00:02:16.120> for<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.720> can<00:02:16.870> move<00:02:17.080> faster<00:02:17.350> when

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
stock for you can move faster when

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.010 
stock for you can move faster when
aiming<00:02:18.280> down<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> sights<00:02:18.840> another<00:02:19.840> thing

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
aiming down the sights another thing
