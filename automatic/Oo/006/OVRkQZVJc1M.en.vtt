 I understand dragging us to nintendo ds sudoku master for photos are 8 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.039
 as you can see to start it may be it appears less still with options 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.039
 tarqui tutorial 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.510
 a punch 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.830
 has bothered to put the tutorial for all those who do not know 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.750
 use 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.530
 but he will play a sudoku and also to play despite putting you fire as we can 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.900
 see we can find how the controls are handled 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.900
 and here it is very well detailed 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 exactly 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.830
 they are also on top of sudoku 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.190
 tricks annotations and aids 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.730
 many options to know how to play 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.960
 and be a master the sudoku 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 let's start 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.340
 often want to say level can Saturday choose between practice 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.120
 easy 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.620
 normal 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.710
 and hard 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.140
 and also provides a level that can follow 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.070
 so what you have to see little by little while Alvarez passing sudoku 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.369
 top part will appear more 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.730
 the sudoku and stars but you can not abae at first you can not 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.210
 and did well or levels 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.130
 they have to go little by little 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.939
 let's put easy on the bottom will appear 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.640
 the stars that are getting to depend on the difficulty level of the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.830
 sudoku how quickly with mud with which 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.560
 not finished at the top the level appears because it is playing i 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.390
 the total of those crazy and when you're going to give you sounding the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.099
 they are marking themselves lush 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.120
 This question, as I said earlier, is achieved through 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.560
 stars that goes holding 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.219
 little by little while he has passed game 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.499
 let's play in easy 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.390
 this kid corpse there is much more difficulty 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.450
 in when selected to be easy at the bottom to agree tactile can 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.410
 select the fire you want 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.159
 that the top 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.870
 the sudoku will appear to make attention squares towards the eyes 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.870
 let's go first to see how to be first 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.500
 at the top when pizarro play the master sudoku appear the 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.629
 sudoku in stealth that are making the stump numbers the level appears 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.449
 of the sudoku number and the time with the 100 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.950
 the real time that you are acting with 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.160
 to know the time that guti lass to soften it whole and in addition to this day 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.989
 is that you have at the bottom for johanna can play with both the 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.579
 pencil like 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.420
 as with the diagonals and the buttons of the nintendo ds itself 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.910
 henne in the skin you can select the box where you can 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.049
 you can put the numbers on top also noted 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:25.339
 here as we can observe copó observe to put the skin we usually esquivel 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.209
 numbers that is to say it very well 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.279
 because sometimes confused albistur written a 4 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:35.259
 and I bet moves and also turn off this lotion to write on one side there 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.119
 an option to be able 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.239
 write the possible numbers with which with those who 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.659
 with what can be in that box 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.169
 and you can select those if you can not live here that seems low 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.069
 a very simple thing 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.110
 also say that with the two letter castles 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.040
 can you know in which line up 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.569
 and the options so that the numbers do not match 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.840
 I have to remember as qiagen and vertical game toads and 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.109
 horizontally the numbers can be repeated days 1 to 9 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.079
 and in the same cell you can not repeat 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.079
 a 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.949
 only nine numbers very simple 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.739
 it also appears in nothing on the device itself when I could without options 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.050
 you can erase the data perez and other fighters and also the music say that 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.819
 the music can get a bit repetitive 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.249
 and there are only three types of music 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.999
 and they are very melodic 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.360
 and there I think they can get to sleep aránguiz 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.280
 you can also change the bottom workers from the top that looks better 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.279
 There are different colors 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:47.580
 you can also start again continue ahead easy 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.869
 there will also be serious to tell you you say shots this apart from watching play with the 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:05.999
 tactile you can also and is that the numbers well to his say that seven 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.029
 playing the hows for the restorer 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.559
 Now separate each pair and the numbers you can say 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:17.089
 placing two boxes and is the violation would do by exposing frames 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:20.089
 four boxes as possible but you can perform 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.889
 also say that apart from economics still with the days taken by the 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.460
 own buttons of the ds with the crosshead moves 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.539
 costco and you can also all or nothing with one's own powers 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:36.349
 console 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.710
 Yes with this house in the USA 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.770
 this and other data I say that I prefer the pencil and paper much more 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.379
 comfortable 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:49.759
 you can also go step by step to interest back little water towards 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.759
 in front of this if you have made a mistake 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.930
 his famous april 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:58.889
 notimex 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.400
 the graphics are very simple only until they have made in 3d the objects that are 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.369
 move through the background 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:09.839
 I just think that sudoku does not require much more than it is a pulse docu 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:14.319
 that has become a rage and I do not want to play with the role, so you go where 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.969
 be because it's side 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.389
 and solved 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.389
 we are going to make difficult you did 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.030
 To prove 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.410
 that are English Sudoku are not just combined costs 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.520
 as it can happen with paper 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.520
 so that the increase of the tribute to little by little 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.330
 once and this all sudoku masters b 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.889
 from nintendo ds 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.659
 I still do not play 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:46.210
 what is very simple with very repetitive music but that the cat for 

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:48.730
 those trips by subway and to play 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.819
 to achieve that cowardly minute 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.469
 It requires recreation at the same time and they played masters by marcel
