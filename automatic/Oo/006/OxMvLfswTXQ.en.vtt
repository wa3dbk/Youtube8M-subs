00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.340
 We are sharing playing ball that 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.650
 on this occasion offers us a ball 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.589
 how are they if we are in front of the 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.750
 new rap 4 the recent release that 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.550
 we have done in the Peruvian market is is 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.899
 a vehicle that everyone already knew in 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.339
 the previous version but here we are 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.409
 presenting a vehicle completely 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.379
 renewed does not change only the design 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.090
 exterior but the engine and the entire design 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.479
 inside the vehicle is a car 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.610
 completely new that is already starting to 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.550
 show the new line the design of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.289
 toyota that will start to be seen in the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.030
 renovations of the different models to 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.429
 over time from here to 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.550
 ahead is not a car that has a 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.320
 more stylized line a 2.5 engine 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.250
 liters also comes a version of 2 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.750
 liters 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.390
 there are four by four four by two 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.970
 automatic mechanics so for all 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.800
 the tastes good I think one of the 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.659
 most important changes is the engine in 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.840
 the previous version brings a 2.4 engine 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.609
 liters this is a 2.5 engine 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.649
 that the variation in displacement is 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.229
 small this engine would incorporate the 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.060
 bt and dual system which gives greater 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.250
 power and lower fuel consumption 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.700
 that is a first important change and what 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.520
 another is the design externally is a 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.560
 very well thought out design very very nice 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.569
 with very dynamic lines but 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.670
 internally it is a design very well 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.289
 worked with finishes very much 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.060
 detail but also extremely 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.190
 comfortable is a car that has higher 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.899
 interior space has grown a little 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 in dimensions then it does a little 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.459
 more comfortable more friendly to be 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.040
 inside the car for driving or 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:23.920
 for passengers and 32.5 and the part 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.250
 starts at 26,500 in version 2 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.280
 liters 4 for 2 mechanics and ends like 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.920
 in 32,500 the 4x4 version 2.5 liters 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.110
 automatic for part of this pair this 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.120
 toyota year good this year we have several 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.650
 things throughout the first semester 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.900
 let's have a couple more releases 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.079
 that we are going to invite them to us 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.670
 accompany us let's have a process 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.170
 old man a process of expansion in these 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.720
 dealer networks 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.780

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.480
 central sierra city there are several 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.480
 cities north to south to the center by

 year in cities where we were already

 present and in cities where no 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.560
 we were present so our 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.069
 offer to be enhanced with a portfolio 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.630
 more complete and strengthened and with greater 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.790
 greater number of points of sale to 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.790
 national level thanks to you
