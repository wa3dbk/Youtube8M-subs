of the desires we have is to get this
kind<00:00:29.230> of<00:00:29.410> let's<00:00:30.070> say<00:00:30.220> sensibilities<00:00:30.880> into

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
kind of let's say sensibilities into

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
computer as the main design tool but we

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.639 
computer as the main design tool but we
also<00:00:39.280> have<00:00:39.579> to<00:00:39.820> desire<00:00:40.719> to<00:00:41.079> make<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.440> physical

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
also have to desire to make the physical

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.670 
also have to desire to make the physical
what<00:00:42.160> we<00:00:42.280> create<00:00:42.610> on<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.820> computer<00:00:43.300> so<00:00:43.989> we<00:00:44.500> don't

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
what we create on a computer so we don't

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.529 
what we create on a computer so we don't
want<00:00:44.829> it<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.129> stay<00:00:45.339> a<00:00:45.370> rendering<00:00:45.760> that's<00:00:46.329> not

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
want it to stay a rendering that's not

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.090 
want it to stay a rendering that's not
enough<00:00:46.749> for<00:00:46.780> us<00:00:47.050> we<00:00:47.289> really<00:00:47.320> want<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.859> make<00:00:48.010> it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
enough for us we really want to make it

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.349 
enough for us we really want to make it
physically<00:00:48.609> in<00:00:48.670> a<00:00:48.730> way<00:00:50.339> at<00:00:51.339> the<00:00:51.399> beginning<00:00:51.519> you

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
physically in a way at the beginning you

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.599 
physically in a way at the beginning you
start<00:00:52.420> making<00:00:53.170> models<00:00:53.859> by<00:00:53.980> hand<00:00:54.249> you<00:00:54.579> can

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
start making models by hand you can

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.479 
start making models by hand you can
actually<00:00:55.269> do<00:00:55.480> let's<00:00:56.379> say<00:00:56.469> models<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:57.039> complex

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
actually do let's say models of complex

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.910 
actually do let's say models of complex
curved<00:00:57.760> geometries<00:00:58.390> by<00:00:58.870> hand<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.319> mean<00:00:59.499> go<00:00:59.739> deep

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
curved geometries by hand I mean go deep

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.709 
curved geometries by hand I mean go deep
deep<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.339> hundred<00:01:00.609> years<00:01:00.730> ago<00:01:00.969> but<00:01:01.449> on<00:01:01.600> the

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
deep that a hundred years ago but on the

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.569 
deep that a hundred years ago but on the
other<00:01:01.780> hand<00:01:01.899> it<00:01:02.199> is<00:01:02.319> very<00:01:02.350> time-consuming<00:01:02.769> you

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
other hand it is very time-consuming you

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.690 
other hand it is very time-consuming you
need<00:01:03.789> to<00:01:03.879> be<00:01:03.969> very<00:01:04.150> precise<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:06.220> is<00:01:06.280> something

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
need to be very precise it is something

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.340 
need to be very precise it is something
that<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:06.909> very<00:01:07.000> costing<00:01:07.570> because<00:01:08.229> you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
that is very costing because you

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.090 
that is very costing because you
outsource<00:01:09.040> that<00:01:09.250> most<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.729> time<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:11.100> model

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
outsource that most of the time a model

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.610 
outsource that most of the time a model
the<00:01:12.220> size<00:01:12.370> of<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.760> shoebox<00:01:12.970> would<00:01:13.600> take<00:01:13.870> for

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
the size of a shoebox would take for

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.280 
the size of a shoebox would take for
sure<00:01:14.800> four<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.190> five<00:01:15.400> six<00:01:16.000> days<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.690> if<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.990> HP

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
sure four to five six days and if the HP

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.499 
sure four to five six days and if the HP
machine<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.680> same<00:01:17.920> size<00:01:18.159> would<00:01:18.460> take<00:01:18.729> 24

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
machine the same size would take 24

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.080 
machine the same size would take 24
hours<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.659> HP<00:01:23.200> designjet<00:01:23.320> 3d<00:01:24.280> provided<00:01:25.000> us

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
hours so the HP designjet 3d provided us

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.330 
hours so the HP designjet 3d provided us
with<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.360> possibility<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.320> increase<00:01:27.130> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
with the possibility to increase the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.639 
with the possibility to increase the
speed<00:01:27.670> which<00:01:27.880> means<00:01:28.149> that<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.509> save<00:01:28.750> several

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
speed which means that we save several

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.279 
speed which means that we save several
days<00:01:30.009> and<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.640> shipping<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.570> also<00:01:31.930> things

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
days and in shipping and also things

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.469 
days and in shipping and also things
every<00:01:33.039> day<00:01:33.219> that<00:01:33.430> you<00:01:33.520> get<00:01:33.670> more<00:01:33.969> that<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:34.390> can

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
every day that you get more that you can

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.719 
every day that you get more that you can
put<00:01:34.719> in<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:34.930> design<00:01:35.289> is<00:01:36.039> of<00:01:36.250> course<00:01:36.490> an

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
put in a design is of course an

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.850 
put in a design is of course an
advantage<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.600> competition<00:01:37.719> process

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.940 

it's<00:01:42.860> very<00:01:43.070> simple<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.549> use<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:44.360> is<00:01:44.479> actually

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
it's very simple to use it is actually

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.680 
it's very simple to use it is actually
just<00:01:45.950> sitting<00:01:46.250> there<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.760> working<00:01:46.970> basically

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
just sitting there and working basically

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.090 
just sitting there and working basically
like<00:01:47.930> one<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.350> other<00:01:48.440> guys<00:01:48.650> working<00:01:49.040> in

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
like one of the other guys working in

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.300 
like one of the other guys working in
the<00:01:49.220> office<00:01:50.800> nothing<00:01:51.800> is<00:01:51.890> too<00:01:52.010> complicated

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
the office nothing is too complicated

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.730 
the office nothing is too complicated
for<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.760> machine<00:01:52.909> everything<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.320> design

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
for a machine everything that you design

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.040 
for a machine everything that you design

complicated is to do something by hand
like<00:02:04.100> this<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:06.399> impossible<00:02:07.399> in<00:02:07.460> my<00:02:07.580> eyes<00:02:07.790> and

like this is impossible in my eyes and

like this is impossible in my eyes and
with<00:02:08.869> another<00:02:09.110> technology<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.890> would<00:02:09.979> be<00:02:10.130> very

in thinkable from automaker we're

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.830 
in thinkable from automaker we're
actually<00:02:22.430> at<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> moment<00:02:22.820> working<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.630> high

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
riser and in China I don't think that we

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.330 
riser and in China I don't think that we
could<00:02:26.660> have<00:02:26.840> done<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.320> models<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.860> any<00:02:28.160> other

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
could have done the models in any other

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.340 
could have done the models in any other

way faster than with it now with the HP
designjet<00:02:30.530> 3d<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:32.450> really<00:02:32.660> gave<00:02:32.810> us<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
designjet 3d it really gave us the

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.500 
designjet 3d it really gave us the
opportunity<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:34.100> react<00:02:34.430> very<00:02:34.610> fast<00:02:34.730> first

opportunity to to react very fast first

opportunity to to react very fast first
of<00:02:35.660> all<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.230> architectural<00:02:37.130> demands<00:02:37.489> of

of all on the architectural demands of

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.610 
of all on the architectural demands of
course<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.060> our<00:02:38.180> design<00:02:38.600> but<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.500> other

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
course in our design but on the other

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.800 
course in our design but on the other
hand<00:02:39.890> also<00:02:40.130> we<00:02:40.550> could<00:02:40.730> react<00:02:41.000> very<00:02:41.180> fast<00:02:41.540> on

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
hand also we could react very fast on

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.680 
hand also we could react very fast on
the<00:02:41.959> specifics<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.130> customer<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:46.690> think

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
the specifics of the customer I think

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.150 
the specifics of the customer I think
one<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.989> biggest<00:02:48.170> advantages<00:02:48.380> of<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
one of the biggest advantages of the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160 
one of the biggest advantages of the
machine<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.940> robustness<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.780> models

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
machine is the robustness of the models

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.229 
machine is the robustness of the models
that<00:02:51.470> dropped<00:02:51.799> one<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.310> models<00:02:53.000> they<00:02:53.120> were

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
that dropped one of the models they were

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.840 
that dropped one of the models they were
made<00:02:53.420> with<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.750> HP<00:02:54.079> designjet<00:02:54.200> 3d<00:02:55.010> print<00:02:55.280> and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
made with the HP designjet 3d print and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.850 
made with the HP designjet 3d print and
I<00:02:55.910> was<00:02:56.030> like<00:02:56.120> oh<00:02:56.540> my<00:02:56.780> god<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.170> dropped<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.650> it

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
I was like oh my god I dropped it it

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.920 
I was like oh my god I dropped it it
dropped<00:02:58.160> on<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.340> floor<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.930> nothing

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
dropped on the floor and nothing

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.770 
dropped on the floor and nothing
happened<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:01.269> customers<00:03:02.269> it's<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.600> course

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
happened for customers it's of course

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.259 
happened for customers it's of course
great<00:03:03.320> it's<00:03:03.739> for<00:03:04.010> them<00:03:04.130> always<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.519> surprise<00:03:04.820> to

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
great it's for them always a surprise to

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.449 
great it's for them always a surprise to
see<00:03:05.560> basically<00:03:06.560> what<00:03:06.769> they<00:03:06.920> are<00:03:06.980> gonna<00:03:07.160> have

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
see basically what they are gonna have

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.860 
see basically what they are gonna have
at<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.700> end<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.030> day<00:03:08.180> when<00:03:08.360> they<00:03:08.450> build<00:03:08.660> it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
at the end of the day when they build it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.530 
at the end of the day when they build it
in<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.650> very<00:03:09.950> detailed<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.820> sophisticated

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
in a very detailed and sophisticated

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.270 
in a very detailed and sophisticated
model<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:11.930> think<00:03:11.959> it's<00:03:12.230> very<00:03:12.440> satisfying<00:03:12.680> for

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
model I think it's very satisfying for

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.130 
model I think it's very satisfying for
them<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.150> sometimes<00:03:14.600> difficult<00:03:14.810> to

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
them it is sometimes difficult to

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.500 
them it is sometimes difficult to
understand<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.670> potential<00:03:17.269> of<00:03:17.360> an

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
understand the potential of an

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.690 
understand the potential of an
architectural<00:03:18.019> space<00:03:18.290> completely

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
architectural space completely

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.330 
architectural space completely
looking<00:03:20.090> at<00:03:20.270> a<00:03:20.300> 2d<00:03:20.989> drew<00:03:21.170> presentation<00:03:21.860> but<00:03:22.220> if

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
looking at a 2d drew presentation but if

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.910 
looking at a 2d drew presentation but if
you<00:03:22.430> have<00:03:22.640> it<00:03:22.819> in<00:03:22.970> 3d<00:03:23.209> it's<00:03:23.720> really<00:03:24.170> take<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.800> in

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
you have it in 3d it's really take it in

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.009 
you have it in 3d it's really take it in
your<00:03:25.010> hands<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.459> then<00:03:25.610> it's<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.660> german<00:03:26.989> word

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
your hands and then it's a german word

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.890 
your hands and then it's a german word
called<00:03:27.440> bigger<00:03:27.739> -<00:03:27.890> yeah<00:03:28.879> which<00:03:29.450> means<00:03:29.690> we

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
called bigger - yeah which means we

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.750 
called bigger - yeah which means we
touch<00:03:30.110> something<00:03:30.470> but<00:03:31.040> simultaneously<00:03:31.280> you

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
touch something but simultaneously you

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.850 
touch something but simultaneously you
get<00:03:31.970> it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.920
