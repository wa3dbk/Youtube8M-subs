Army's<00:01:26.939> army<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.540> now<00:01:27.720> 50<00:01:28.140> compared<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> 87<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
Army's army is now 50 compared to 87 so

Army's army is now 50 compared to 87 so
but<00:01:31.229> obviously<00:01:31.380> he'll<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.009> move<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> much

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
but obviously he'll go move with a much

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.770 
but obviously he'll go move with a much

damage i believe from these hellions the
mirage<00:01:47.150> is<00:01:47.270> going<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.480> be<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.660> between<00:01:47.900> them

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
mirage is going to be the between them

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.750 
mirage is going to be the between them
and<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.380> majority<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.190> damage<00:01:49.400> as<00:01:49.730> the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
and the majority of that damage as the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.670 
and the majority of that damage as the
destructible<00:01:50.450> rocks<00:01:50.570> are<00:01:50.930> in<00:01:51.050> fact<00:01:51.260> armored

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
destructible rocks are in fact armored

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.610 
destructible rocks are in fact armored
so<00:01:52.160> they<00:01:52.250> deal<00:01:52.430> in<00:01:52.460> fact<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.940> full<00:01:53.150> 20<00:01:53.620> 20

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
so they deal in fact the full 20 20

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.980 
so they deal in fact the full 20 20
damage<00:01:54.800> then<00:01:55.250> minus<00:01:55.610> 24<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.180> armor<00:01:56.479> try<00:01:56.930> to

now hellions coming in from that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.760 
now hellions coming in from that
backside<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.660> perhaps<00:02:42.050> those<00:02:42.380> hellions<00:02:42.560> are

going to be coming in and try to take
down<00:02:43.880> some<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.150> those<00:02:44.270> drones<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.290> we'll<00:02:45.470> see

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
down some of those drones and we'll see

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
down some of those drones and we'll see
how<00:02:45.769> this<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:45.950> really<00:02:46.160> going<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.400> work<00:02:46.489> as

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
how this is really going to work as

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.890 
how this is really going to work as
those<00:02:47.209> early<00:02:47.450> ins<00:02:47.570> are<00:02:47.630> going<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.810> be<00:02:47.870> coming

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
those early ins are going to be coming

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.479 
those early ins are going to be coming
in<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.380> those<00:02:48.650> hellions<00:02:48.890> should<00:02:49.160> be<00:02:49.250> able<00:02:49.370> to

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
in and those hellions should be able to

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.400 
in and those hellions should be able to
take<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.790> lot<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.120> those<00:02:50.360> units<00:02:50.690> as<00:02:50.810> long<00:02:51.320> as

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
take on a lot of those units as long as

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.320 
take on a lot of those units as long as
those<00:02:51.530> zerglings<00:02:51.950> aliens<00:02:52.549> torching<00:02:52.940> up<00:02:53.060> so

those zerglings aliens torching up so
many<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.690> these<00:02:53.780> drones<00:02:54.410> in<00:02:54.620> here<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> group

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
many of these drones in here so a group

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.430 
many of these drones in here so a group
of<00:02:55.640> just<00:02:55.880> five<00:02:56.120> hellions<00:02:56.540> suiciding
