 good energy in our works 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.100
 the replacement of the infrastructure 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.349
 physical is one of the commitments that 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.519
 They have which is included in the plan 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.980
 environmental management of the project 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.710
 hydroelectric the quimbo la tia 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.539
 substitute are those days that can be 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.000
 see affected by the construction of 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.160
 project and that will be restored in its 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.109
 whole as part of the days 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.390
 substitutes in which the

 quimbo you will know the bridge that 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.670
 it will become the longest of our 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.589
 country what will mark a huge milestone

 importance for this region 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.600
 the restitution of roads that will take 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.180
 out for the construction of the project 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.950
 hydroelectric the quimbo will mean a 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.990
 important improvement in the routes that 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.110
 they connect the south of the department of 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.280
 huila will also bring employment and investment 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.280
 for the area of ​​influence 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.380
 the alternative is a work that lives 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.880
 the quimbo hydroelectric project 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.500
 must perform to replenish the roads 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.470
 existing that products from the reservoir that 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.330
 the project will be flooded the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.000
 project consists of four sections 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.460
 major in the first two sections 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.910
 are located between the giant road to 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.040
 the first section is 1.7 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.020
 kilometers in length that involves the 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.180
 construction of four bridges 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.450
 various lengths between 26 meters and 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.280
 180 meters section 2 is 3 kilometers 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.760
 800 meters involving construction 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.910
 of three bridges between 100 meters and 150 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.570
 meters section 3 is the section where 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.150
 The balsadero viaduct is involved 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.150
 of 1.8 kilometers in its entirety goes to 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.910
 have four and a half kilometers and the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.100
 section 4 is the section that goes towards the 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.110
 path of the gorge of 560 meters 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.490
 length that involves construction 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.490
 of a bridge of 26 meters 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.730
 as part of substitute pathways 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.520
 begins will build the viaduct that

 area of ​​influence of the quimbo but of 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.700
 the whole region offering a better 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.700
 connectivity with the rest of the country 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.880
 Well, the Garzón a grade viaduct is a
