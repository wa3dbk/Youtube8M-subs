aiming for with this custom the project

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060 
aiming for with this custom the project
began<00:00:39.719> when<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.320> saw<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> Teenage

Mutant Ninja Turtles cockroach
Terminator<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.100> figured<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.879> would<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
Terminator and figured that would be a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.630 
Terminator and figured that would be a
great<00:00:45.539> base<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:45.870> meek<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> project

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
great base for meek but as the project

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.250 
great base for meek but as the project
progressed<00:00:48.210> beyond<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> cockroach

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
progressed beyond the cockroach
