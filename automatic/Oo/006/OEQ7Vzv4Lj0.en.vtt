00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.000
 the power supply we use 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.059
 every day is somehow 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.550
 wheat grain charge every day 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.480
 we are used to eating bread dough 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.430
 pizza entered in common use then 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.140
 every day somehow 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.509
 we overload our body of 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.279
 nutrients that are contained in this 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.070
 type of food in this type of 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.620
 cereal the problem that though 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.480
 contains nutrients in the same way 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.629
 with you or any other nutrient one of 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.030
 these anti nutrients is the gluten that 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.899
 the grain contains in a high quantity the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.760
 gluten goes neither especially in grains 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.100
 presidents on the market in this 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.930
 period in our day and a 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.079
 year modified in some way to 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.149
 have a higher yield for a one 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.899
 high gluten content compared to 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.309
 oldest grains iran the old and this 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.280
 gluten is not always good for us 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.720
 rather organism is going to overload the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.770
 our intestines to affect the villi 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.210
 intestinal for which does not allow one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.670
 right evacuation then a right one 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.920
 body detox the advice 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.320
 which I can give you is to use 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.700
 also alternatives to the classic 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.990
 wheat there are many others and others 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.979
 foods that can be used 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.549
 daily so as not to overload ourselves 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.860
 of this kind says real or otherwise 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.229
 of the connected gluten can be in 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.000
 first of all the rice that used a lot 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.380
 especially in asia from populations 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.570
 asian my always recommends 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.150
 use a brown rice maybe 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.979
 biodynamic that can be found peacefully 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.090
 now trade in commerce or 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.799
 rice has a very high amount of salts 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.570
 minerals and vitamins I always talk about 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.119
 brown rice obviously another 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.790
 content of mineral salts of vitamins e 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.530
 does well contrary to what one thinks 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.810
 brown rice makes white intestine e 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.440
 the bacterial flora for which you use it 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.660
 used I say daily but 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.820
 use it often enough 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.980
 nowadays we also find rices 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.690
 so many varieties so there is not only 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.370
 plus the integral variety but you can 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.220
 find various types of rice like the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.750
 hard 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.790
 the rice that is a black rice that has 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.500
 a lot of fiber is its own 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.220
 for a high fiber content and 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.650
 iron so recommended to anyone 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.070
 maybe have issues related to 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.850
 iron deficiency or even for 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.680
 detoxify our best 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.760
 intestine for a high fiber content 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.370
 which has other rices to use are 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.170
 Thai red rice today one 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.590
 quality that also arrived in Italy 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.590
 by now we use it very often that the 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.140
 basmati rice and all these rices 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.650
 contain lots of mineral salts and 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.510
 vitamins other types of foods that 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.330
 we can introduce them as substitutes 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.640
 just in the classic pasta that 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.209
 they eat daily can be 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.230
 gods can be quinoa amaranth 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.270
 or buckwheat is still little 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.490
 used and little known I see them 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.410
 advice and b after directions on 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.780
 I recommend each of these 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.030
 hire them precisely because they have a low 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.940
 almost non-existent content actually of 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.709
 gluten and can only be very versatile 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.780
 to be used in the teasing kitchen than with 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.430
 children with small children for 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.070
 example I use so much the best 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.300
 the mile to many properties a 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:44.180
 lots of lots of vitamins are needed 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.769
 hair for example is good hair 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.610
 to nails contains vitamin A vitamin 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.160
 f 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.890
 I recommend it on children just 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.360
 started weaning or children a 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.670
 little older does not even of 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.769
 lego meatballs start from the millet that 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.320
 they serve who are palatable eat them 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.080
 gladly and contain many 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.220
 Amino acids vitamins that do well too 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.739
 for their growth 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.269
 another another little food 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.660
 known and little used e 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.090
 amaranth, only very small seeds 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.000
 very small beans even those from 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.500
 use with vegetables knows that there you 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.310
 can use a lot with i 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.109
 children 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.210
 amaranth among other things to an act 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.110
 content also of lysine which is good for you 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:30.830
 the organism is and can also be used 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.229
 for cases of herpes and relapsing i 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.080
 high lysine contents help the 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.210
 our organism for which an amino acid 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.520
 important that we do not produce alone 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.680
 then take it with one feed 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.460
 of foods as found in 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.860
 abundance is another of amaranth 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.569
 little used food than me 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.910
 I often recommend using the chi no 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.930
 also china is found in beans and is 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.910
 this is also very versatile in the kitchen 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.090
 scalded a few minutes before and you can 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.400
 always use those vegetables 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.930
 contains the characteristic of all 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.090
 kiki places and essential amino acids 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.250
 which contain that respect however to the 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.500
 wheat contain the greatest measures 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.320
 Minerals and vitamins are few 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.000
 refined so they keep almost all 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.470
 their properties that later pass into the 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.900
 our organism 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.569
 the other advice I can give you at 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.280
 these days peaks that yes 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.840
 can use as an alternative to 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.720
 classic song can also be found below 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.610
 milk form so milk sees such 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.320
 which can also be used in 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.060
 our own daily diet 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.550
 to take vitamins minerals 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.550
 amino acids of which they are rich
