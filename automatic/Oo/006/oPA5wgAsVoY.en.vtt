00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
and it's that little thing missing who

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.199 
and it's that little thing missing who
knows<00:02:21.470> maybe<00:02:21.650> Andy<00:02:22.430> was<00:02:22.580> carrying<00:02:22.880> something

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209

as well tonight and you know he can play

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.180 
as well tonight and you know he can play
but<00:02:26.870> it's<00:02:27.020> just<00:02:27.230> not<00:02:27.380> quite<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.650> same<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
but it's just not quite the same and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.790 
but it's just not quite the same and
it's<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:29.030> misses<00:02:29.440> when<00:02:30.440> you're<00:02:30.560> in<00:02:30.680> these

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
players it's not enough and that's what

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.680 
players it's not enough and that's what
