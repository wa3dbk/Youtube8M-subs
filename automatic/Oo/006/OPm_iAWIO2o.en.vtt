and the deployment of the blade feels
pretty<00:03:08.819> good<00:03:09.060> let<00:03:09.239> me<00:03:09.269> show<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.540> again<00:03:10.489> ok<00:03:11.489> so

it's<00:03:13.680> pretty<00:03:13.859> good<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:15.680> once<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.890> blade<00:03:17.040> is

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
it's pretty good and once the blade is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.159 
it's pretty good and once the blade is
open<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.549> can<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:18.090> can<00:03:18.239> actually<00:03:18.389> lock<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
open you can you can actually lock the

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.349 
open you can you can actually lock the
safety<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.010> now<00:03:20.220> this<00:03:20.430> blade<00:03:20.669> will<00:03:20.880> not<00:03:20.910> close

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
safety and now this blade will not close

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.349 
safety and now this blade will not close
no<00:03:21.630> matter<00:03:21.780> what<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.169> do<00:03:22.319> will<00:03:22.530> not<00:03:22.560> close

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
when you do want to close the blade just

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.530 
when you do want to close the blade just
like<00:03:25.769> most<00:03:26.010> automatic<00:03:26.700> knives<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.209> just<00:03:27.389> hold

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
like most automatic knives you just hold

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
blade and it closes back up like that

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.539 
blade and it closes back up like that

could tell it was very nicely made yeah

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.860 
could tell it was very nicely made yeah
and<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.130> other<00:05:05.160> thing<00:05:05.370> is<00:05:05.699> the<00:05:06.000> Chinese

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
and the other thing is the Chinese

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.170 
and the other thing is the Chinese
version<00:05:07.259> of<00:05:07.349> this<00:05:07.530> knife<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.190> fast<00:05:08.550> with<00:05:09.090> the

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
version of this knife the fast with the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.270 
version of this knife the fast with the
spring<00:05:09.449> assist<00:05:09.750> uses<00:05:10.139> a<00:05:10.169> cheaper<00:05:10.680> grade<00:05:10.919> steel

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
spring assist uses a cheaper grade steel

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.200 
spring assist uses a cheaper grade steel
as<00:05:11.520> well<00:05:11.759> I<00:05:12.060> think<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:13.229> cheaper<00:05:13.979> coating<00:05:14.970> on<00:05:15.090> the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
as well I think a cheaper coating on the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.689 
as well I think a cheaper coating on the
blade<00:05:15.479> and<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:16.620> few<00:05:16.830> other<00:05:17.009> things<00:05:17.130> that<00:05:17.430> are

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
blade and a few other things that are

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.610 
blade and a few other things that are
different<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:18.570> this<00:05:18.720> one<00:05:18.870> feels<00:05:19.020> very<00:05:19.380> well

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
different but this one feels very well

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.680 
different but this one feels very well
made<00:05:19.860> it's<00:05:20.550> gonna<00:05:20.759> be<00:05:20.909> probably<00:05:21.270> my<00:05:21.539> new

when<00:06:09.750> you<00:06:09.840> open<00:06:10.199> it<00:06:10.289> even<00:06:10.889> though<00:06:10.979> the<00:06:11.159> spring

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
when you open it even though the spring

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.409 
when you open it even though the spring
assist<00:06:11.789> and<00:06:13.219> you<00:06:14.219> can<00:06:14.400> see<00:06:14.639> let<00:06:14.820> me<00:06:14.880> put<00:06:15.330> them

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
assist and you can see let me put them

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.110 
assist and you can see let me put them
side-by-side<00:06:15.659> it<00:06:16.620> is<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:16.889> smaller<00:06:17.400> knife<00:06:17.699> than

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
side-by-side it is a smaller knife than

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.920 
side-by-side it is a smaller knife than
the<00:06:18.270> Gerber<00:06:19.699> but<00:06:20.699> as<00:06:20.820> far<00:06:21.030> as<00:06:21.060> weight<00:06:21.389> the

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
the Gerber but as far as weight the

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.110 
the Gerber but as far as weight the
Gerber<00:06:22.320> is<00:06:22.380> only<00:06:22.560> a<00:06:22.949> little<00:06:23.550> bit<00:06:23.699> heavier<00:06:24.030> I

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
Gerber is only a little bit heavier I

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.469 
Gerber is only a little bit heavier I
can<00:06:24.300> barely<00:06:24.479> even<00:06:24.750> tell<00:06:25.139> actually<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:26.300> as<00:06:27.300> I

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
can barely even tell actually and as I

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.089 
can barely even tell actually and as I
said<00:06:27.539> the<00:06:27.780> length<00:06:28.020> doesn't<00:06:28.469> really<00:06:28.650> seem<00:06:29.070> to

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
said the length doesn't really seem to

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.390 
said the length doesn't really seem to
bother<00:06:29.310> me<00:06:30.110> carrying<00:06:31.110> it<00:06:31.289> so<00:06:31.620> I<00:06:31.949> think<00:06:32.190> this<00:06:32.310> is

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
bother me carrying it so I think this is

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.769 
bother me carrying it so I think this is
gonna<00:06:32.520> become<00:06:32.669> my<00:06:32.880> new<00:06:33.000> carry<00:06:33.270> I<00:06:33.419> like<00:06:33.630> this

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:33.779 
gonna become my new carry I like this

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.260 
gonna become my new carry I like this
knife<00:06:34.020> a<00:06:34.169> lot<00:06:34.349> this<00:06:35.279> will<00:06:35.460> be<00:06:35.550> regulated<00:06:36.150> to

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
knife a lot this will be regulated to

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.650 
knife a lot this will be regulated to
some<00:06:36.449> other<00:06:36.779> sort<00:06:37.139> of<00:06:37.260> duty<00:06:37.589> the<00:06:37.710> apparition

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
some other sort of duty the apparition

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.470 
some other sort of duty the apparition
also<00:06:39.140> very<00:06:39.380> nice<00:06:39.590> knife<00:06:40.550> you<00:06:40.940> know<00:06:41.030> benchmade

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
also very nice knife you know benchmade

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.800 
also very nice knife you know benchmade
makes<00:06:41.780> great<00:06:42.050> knives<00:06:42.910> in<00:06:43.910> fact<00:06:44.390> I<00:06:44.540> think<00:06:44.600> they

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
makes great knives in fact I think they

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.270 
makes great knives in fact I think they
make<00:06:44.990> better<00:06:45.200> knives<00:06:45.470> a<00:06:45.590> lot<00:06:45.620> it<00:06:45.860> most<00:06:46.100> of<00:06:46.250> the

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
make better knives a lot it most of the

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.310 
make better knives a lot it most of the
time<00:06:46.520> then<00:06:46.760> the<00:06:46.910> Gerber<00:06:47.360> then<00:06:47.750> Gerber<00:06:48.140> does

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
time then the Gerber then Gerber does

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.710 
time then the Gerber then Gerber does
but<00:06:49.100> in<00:06:49.190> this<00:06:49.310> case<00:06:49.580> this<00:06:49.850> Gerber<00:06:50.240> oh<00:06:50.270> six<00:06:50.600> is

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
but in this case this Gerber oh six is

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.290 
but in this case this Gerber oh six is
just<00:06:50.750> a<00:06:50.990> really<00:06:51.410> nice<00:06:51.590> knife<00:06:51.890> and<00:06:52.300> everything

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
just a really nice knife and everything

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.940 
just a really nice knife and everything
I<00:06:53.360> read<00:06:53.570> about<00:06:53.660> it<00:06:53.870> was<00:06:53.990> great<00:06:54.290> and<00:06:54.530> now<00:06:54.710> that<00:06:54.860> I

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:54.950 
I read about it was great and now that I

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.250 
I read about it was great and now that I
got<00:06:54.980> it<00:06:55.310> it<00:06:55.520> seems<00:06:55.820> to<00:06:56.060> be<00:06:56.240> true<00:06:56.660> that<00:06:57.050> it

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
got it it seems to be true that it

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.220 
got it it seems to be true that it
really<00:06:57.470> is<00:06:57.650> that<00:06:57.680> good<00:06:58.450> the<00:06:59.450> only<00:06:59.720> thing

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
really is that good the only thing

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.320 
really is that good the only thing

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
that's not so great between the two is

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.300 
that's not so great between the two is
benchmade<00:07:03.170> you<00:07:03.410> know<00:07:03.500> you<00:07:03.560> have<00:07:03.770> a<00:07:03.830> lifetime

send it to benchmade for sharpening and

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.790 
send it to benchmade for sharpening and
they<00:07:10.850> tightened<00:07:11.240> up<00:07:11.300> the<00:07:11.480> belt<00:07:11.690> clip<00:07:11.930> it<00:07:12.680> was

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
they tightened up the belt clip it was

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.350 
they tightened up the belt clip it was
loose<00:07:13.010> I<00:07:13.190> didn't<00:07:13.370> even<00:07:13.490> ask<00:07:13.700> them<00:07:13.880> to<00:07:14.060> do<00:07:14.210> that

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
loose I didn't even ask them to do that

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.290 
loose I didn't even ask them to do that
they<00:07:14.660> cleaned<00:07:15.230> out<00:07:15.470> the<00:07:16.190> inside<00:07:16.550> I<00:07:16.850> didn't

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
they cleaned out the inside I didn't

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.260 
they cleaned out the inside I didn't
even<00:07:17.390> ask<00:07:17.510> them<00:07:17.720> to<00:07:17.930> do<00:07:18.080> that<00:07:18.460> and<00:07:19.460> it's<00:07:20.000> free

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
even ask them to do that and it's free

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
even ask them to do that and it's free
and<00:07:20.300> it's<00:07:20.510> sort<00:07:20.690> of<00:07:20.720> like<00:07:20.870> the<00:07:20.990> knife<00:07:21.170> so

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.290 
and it's sort of like the knife so

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.690 
and it's sort of like the knife so
that's<00:07:21.470> good<00:07:21.650> Gerber<00:07:22.010> does<00:07:22.160> not<00:07:22.340> offer<00:07:22.550> that

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.700 
that's good Gerber does not offer that

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.670 
that's good Gerber does not offer that
so<00:07:23.120> you<00:07:23.720> would<00:07:23.810> have<00:07:23.870> to<00:07:24.020> send<00:07:24.230> it<00:07:24.410> somewhere

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
so you would have to send it somewhere

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.560 
so you would have to send it somewhere
to<00:07:24.800> get<00:07:24.890> sharpened<00:07:25.460> so<00:07:26.150> that's<00:07:26.270> really<00:07:26.480> the

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.570 
to get sharpened so that's really the

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.860 
to get sharpened so that's really the
only<00:07:26.600> disadvantage<00:07:27.580> but<00:07:28.580> overall<00:07:29.330> yeah<00:07:29.660> I

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:29.870 
only disadvantage but overall yeah I

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.650 
only disadvantage but overall yeah I
really<00:07:30.170> like<00:07:30.470> it<00:07:30.680> a<00:07:31.010> great<00:07:31.640> knife<00:07:31.850> it<00:07:32.180> comes<00:07:32.390> in

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:32.660 
really like it a great knife it comes in

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.020 
really like it a great knife it comes in
drop<00:07:32.960> point<00:07:33.260> blade<00:07:33.350> which<00:07:33.740> this<00:07:33.950> is<00:07:34.190> or<00:07:34.430> tanto

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.030 
drop point blade which this is or tanto

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.610 
drop point blade which this is or tanto
blade<00:07:35.180> and<00:07:37.030> it's<00:07:38.030> just<00:07:38.240> a<00:07:38.330> great<00:07:38.600> knife<00:07:38.840> and

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.620 
blade and it's just a great knife and

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.170 
blade and it's just a great knife and
something<00:07:40.280> that<00:07:40.370> I<00:07:40.430> think<00:07:40.490> is<00:07:40.730> actually<00:07:40.910> a

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:41.180 
something that I think is actually a

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.810 
something that I think is actually a
good<00:07:41.330> everyday<00:07:41.570> carry<00:07:41.960> the<00:07:42.590> Gerber<00:07:43.130> oh<00:07:43.310> six

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:43.820 
good everyday carry the Gerber oh six

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.390 
good everyday carry the Gerber oh six
truck<00:07:44.180> point
