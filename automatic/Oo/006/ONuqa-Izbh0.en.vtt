 new bookstore culture comes pretty good 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.430
 The tank feels plastic. 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.949
 bubble and everything else 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.370
 what it decides is certain that 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.649

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.840
 with fear because the 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.200

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.600

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.120

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.110

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.950

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.030
 And who are you think I bought there? 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.590
 this book in the original English cover 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.319
 You're tough, beautiful just because I'm 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.989
 come in and because I speak English 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.940
 I want to remind all of you that I am not 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.500
 doing this because I know I already said 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.819
 You 're sure that little is going to happen. 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.099
 make a crap at editing 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.709
 decide how they did with harry 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.750
 potter ge.net Remember, I did a video only 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.790
 showing the differences between editing 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:00.030
 Brazilian xexelenta and the fantastic beautiful 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.950
 Wonderful American Edition of Books 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.170
 then let them creased down the 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.250
 book about harry potter and 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.489
 I showed the difference between the two 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.870
 editions and that's why I bought this 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.849
 book in english 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.129
 good your Brazilian publishers had 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.049
 careful with this book mainly 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.229
 here this one is going to sell that neither the water 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.169
 we can be sure I would have 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.789
 saved to see what it would have saved 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.590
 to see the translation 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.630
 Maybe someone from the publishers is 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.789
 that comes from this book and think about it in 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.590
 time to assemble Brazilian edition 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.060
 this we see the video of harry 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.200
 Potter who has not seen yet I'll leave it at 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.880
 house downstairs 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.919
 I'm really looking forward to this book but 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.270
 while I can not imagine that just in the 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.310
 end of the year will be able to read this 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.310
 book but they then kiss
