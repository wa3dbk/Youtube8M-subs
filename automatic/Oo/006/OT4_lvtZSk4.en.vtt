00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.019
 this fair presents the domina plus wines model 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.329
 is a class b model that some exclusive features 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.759
 among these the main one certainly concerns 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.619
 the type of heating 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.210
 of which the machine is equipped is a heating system that allows to 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.519
 eliminate thermal shocks that are the main cause of wear 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.169
 of instruments especially of dynamic instrumentation such as turbines i 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.280
 handpieces 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.450
 the innovation of this elegant system to the use of a maid to me 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.530
 rather than stainless steel which has a thermal conduction 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.450
 10 times higher than that of stainless steel 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.390
 in addition to this we can use our own for this technical choice 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.880
 of resistances 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.909
 it is soft 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.370
 that make the room practically in bulls 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.370
 and these I can create a perfect thermal profile 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.640
 ok thanks to these features we not only give you the timing of 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.400
 sterilization that are certainly faster than other autoclaves 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.590
 of expenditure and measure 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.260
 but we have a much lower energy consumption and above all 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.100
 and we have the possibility to optimize the room 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.950
 as you can see inside we use baskets that I can 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 optimize the useful volume 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.370
 while many machines are entitled to the more or less standard stacked 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.450
 on them 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.310
 they lose about 20% of useful surface area 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.830
 grate this feature we can have on the 18 liter machine a 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.520
 load almost 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.540
 total 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.000
 it is the same or similar to machines with much larger volumes such as 22 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.270
 23 liters 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 with advantages in terms of time of effectiveness 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.369
 the machine is then very simple to be used practically afra 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.980
 is a series of programs already preset just select them 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.440
 press the start button and the machine automatically runs the whole cycle 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.329
 occurs under the control of the microprocessor 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:17.129
 for all d and is now monitored both the display level and level of 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.469
 archive 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.680
 the sterilization data can then be downloaded to the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.039
 printer for cycle tracking 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.389
 or through a very innovative system that is a system 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.909
 practically that I use of the usp keys 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.059
 on which all print data can be stored 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:40.999
 these can then be transferred to a computer or the memories kept 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.379
 on the flash drive 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.730
 without requesting 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.590
 archiving card slips so you lose time 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.329
 like all class b machines, this also clearly has a system 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:58.469
 air expulsion company made through a vacuum pump 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.519
 the vacuum pump is a very effective pump, we say designed to work 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.599
 even in critical conditions, therefore not only with air intake but 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.859
 also with steam and hot air suction 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:11.879
 the pump 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.919
 3,000 cycles are guaranteed on the ground 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.809
 after which it is necessary to make small revisions of the changes 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.359
 membranes 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.439
 hey everything works with extreme silence 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.289
 the machine can also be kept near the chair 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.180
 although we know that in a correct sterilization protocol we should 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.000
 use a specific area for sterilization separate from the king 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:38.039
 surgery 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:42.539
 in which then proceed the various treatment treatments clearly 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:45.789
 decontamination cleaning before cleaning 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:49.059
 of packaging and finally of sterilization 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:54.729
 for this purpose we could also see briefly the thermodisinfector of the 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:55.540
 a thousand that 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.509
 dental x - exclusive since many years and precisely for ground 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.369
 wash the thermo disinfect 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:07.809
 all the surgical instrumentation without the need of manual baggio therefore with 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:09.779
 many - risks 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:14.969
 for the staff and with an efficiency is a capacity to wash decisively 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.730
 higher than any type of washing
