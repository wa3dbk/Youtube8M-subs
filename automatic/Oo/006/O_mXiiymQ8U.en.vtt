00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:13.450
 source 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:13.450
 I do not know 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.329
 do not 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.610
 your arrival from chicago the selection 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.680
 Mexican had his only training in 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.670
 the Dallas Cowboys Stadium 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.020
 we heard some of the words of 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.090
 those selected and the chepo of the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.780
 tower of each morning commitment before 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.120
 Brazil 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.890
 the tri did his training on the doorstep 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.879
 closed although the good mood was 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.879
 evident among the players 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.960
 I have always had quality and in this 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.030
 there is also a lot and a lot of youth 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.490
 also experience especially more the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.980
 who play in Europe a great body 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.990
 technical a good organization a good 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.110
 living environment that is like a 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.030
 family jesus crown is satisfied by 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.530
 your performance and ensures that you would like 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.480
 participate in both Olympic games 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.180
 as in the World Cup tie 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.910
 well I visualize us not the truth 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.430
 that there are so many possibilities to play 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.440
 eliminator since it has been 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.510
 called has been taken into account 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.120
 also in olympic games I know that for 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.590
 there is the possibility and good one is 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.060
 have to visualize before being there 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.140
 not for the moment that the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.140
 opportunity can be prepared 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.290
 both equally are not a 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.790
 very important challenges in my career 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.020
 objectives that I have and hopefully we can 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.020
 participate in both 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.540
 on the other hand aldo de nigris highlighted the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.490
 good coupling with chicharito in the 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.990
 front although the ownership of 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.990
 none is guaranteed 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.530
 he is very mobile we are not 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.610
 different characteristics because it is 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.060
 very goal scorer very alive 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.399
 it is very this 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.470
 you can say smart the look of 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.390
 the mobility moves a lot and that to me 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.030
 I also do maps and function 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.770
 forms that you play from pole that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.040
 he occupied the stronghold more and in the area for 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.590
 to be able to make the goals and he has 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.500
 touched I must play with him we have 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.020
 felt very good 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.770
 yes but it is a bit similar for the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.080
 Pacifier comes out a little more but what 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.120
 I already have the coach's edition and when 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.310
 I miss it, I felt very good after 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.440
 in press conference the chepo of the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.330
 tower did not make excuses or bad 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.459
 conditions of the court nor the hierarchy 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.790
 of the rival make think in less than the 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.790
 triumph 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.770
 conditioning, seeking to be in the 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.060
 better conditions and is also part 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.250
 of what you set aside 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.819
 the circumstances of the last party and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.040
 with bosnia are not circumstances are not 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.099
 pretexts simply have to adapt 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.780
 quick not to be affected sometimes is 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.710
 Of course it is what affects the world 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.840
 but that is not my main goal 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.720
 my main objective is the preparation 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.310
 of the team with a view to the match 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.950
 Guiana that is the first of 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.800
 play off 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.170
 I do not get carried away 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.970
 recharging one of basij 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.130
 I have clear the objective of my 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.670
 preparation to teach against moyano 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.120
 It's very important 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.360
 because those parties if they give us something that 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.730
 it is very important that it is to be in a 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.490
 that's why we focus it that way 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.110
 always the important results of 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.110
 nothing helps you play well if you want 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.310
 is the aforementioned said we play as never and 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.030
 we lost as always better there is 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.440
 get used to winning 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.120
 after the training of the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.620
 Mexican team played the turn to the 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.209
 Brazil team that also 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.740
 noticed the poor conditions of the 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.770
 stadium court Cowboys 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.770
 dallas 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.000
 the Brazilians made a 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.310
 light training and like the 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.070
 Mexicans could not believe the size of 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.140
 the stadium screen the technician 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.360
 Menezes assured that the conditions of 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.260
 the court is not the ideal but it is not 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.700
 expand the Brazilian league has worse 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.890
 Marcelo also said confident that 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.330
 the court will not prevent your good play and 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.950
 believes that his selection arrives in good 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.960
 moment by rivals who have 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.350
 faced as by the coupling of 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.129
 your players 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.059
 well we are better we are 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:43.759
 knowing more and good I think we're 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:43.759
 better and it may be that we do well 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.419
 Of course they are all committed to the 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.399
 Mister's job and good everyone wants 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.159
 play the Olympics I'm also 

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:58.020
 working hard to get to the state 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.319
 of the field that worries taking in 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.319
 account 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.100
 good worried worry not me 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.710
 worries but the truth that with others 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.160
 stadiums with the field with the field well 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.310
 with the good grass we have to demonstrate 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.129
 the best in our football but also 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.830
 and what happens why not 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.500
 still trained and good I think we 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.390
 it's going to be a problem 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.790
 mexico will face brazil on sunday 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.410
 at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and then 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.080
 will focus on elimination duels 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.970
