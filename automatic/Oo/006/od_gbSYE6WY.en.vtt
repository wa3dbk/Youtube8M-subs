this<00:02:15.450> hole<00:02:15.720> here<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.650> looks<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.700> would

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
this hole here it looks like that would

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.949 
this hole here it looks like that would
be<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.819> silver<00:02:21.239> part<00:02:21.510> would<00:02:21.690> be<00:02:21.720> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
be the the silver part would be the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.729 
be the the silver part would be the
crankshaft<00:02:23.600> but<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.780> not<00:02:25.019> it's<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.380> a

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
crankshaft but it's not it's just a

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.680 
crankshaft but it's not it's just a
groove<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.519> bolt<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.910> warning<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.540> when

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
groove that the bolt is warning and when

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.979 
groove that the bolt is warning and when
it's<00:02:27.840> tightened<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.610> get

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
it's tightened so you have to get

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.830 
it's tightened so you have to get
something<00:02:30.989> small<00:02:31.380> enough<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> long<00:02:33.450> bolt

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
something small enough like a long bolt

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.530 
something small enough like a long bolt
to<00:02:34.290> go<00:02:34.410> inside<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.920> hole<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.459> touch<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
to go inside the hole and touch the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.949 
to go inside the hole and touch the
bottom<00:02:36.900> or<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:38.360> reach<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.510> bottom<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.840> the

I<00:03:13.880> think<00:03:14.880> that's<00:03:15.000> probably<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.450> common<00:03:16.670> problem

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
I think that's probably a common problem

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.000 
I think that's probably a common problem
with<00:03:17.790> this
