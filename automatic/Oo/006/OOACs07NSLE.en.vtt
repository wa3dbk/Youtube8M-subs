00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.400
 to his nieces who openly to me 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.760
 I really like this type of advertising 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.760
 viral 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.690
 because it's made from the sight it 's cheap 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.670
 it's a viral digital campaign it's because 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.810
 the social media of each club come out 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.380
 but neither is it inciting the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.330
 violence or when looking at the situation 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.220
 that is going to be the constant discourse of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.949
 people portrayed who do not know yet 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.260
 how the community is living 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.840
 efe atlas was very good this is my house 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.280
 there was no violence and the resource looks 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.280
 even in football is Jorge Vergara 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.680
 deployed violence from the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.100
 social condition that this country does not have 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 nothing to see an unfold not the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:58.219
 violence can not provoke a little more 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.219
 hot but by the fans 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.970
 full 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.590
 do not you think the atlas displays and 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.690
 let last assistance last 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.450
 of 5 percent because it is also 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:30.250
 the consumption that I am not good 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.080
 marketing is not a marketing 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.180
 healthy forgive me nines bring people 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.399
 of the kids to invite them in the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.110
 schools hand out flyers there are things 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:43.300
 much more direct with pen this 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.979
 they had picked up the chivas but it's 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.200
 well you saw how the chepo of 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.700
 the tower they are saying redemption 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.030
 queens and they say striped girls 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.830
 but nothing happens I think that one thing 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:01.320
 is that they spit is low in Lima 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.320
 dialogues is to reduce the level of dialogue 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:10.590
 like the candid mother 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.590
 that is verbal violence the deployed 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.970
 has a double message who is and who 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.470
 is the chivas with the hand where he played 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.120
 and they know that she is a queen indeed she is 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.120
 play is the last game in which 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.680
 we grab the testicles 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.870
 to exercise until he will continue 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:40.989
 of course there is depends on the creativity of 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:45.540
 each side chivas of the wonderful the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.540
 Leakage rivalry 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:07.890
 titles thirteen titles because they 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.890
 they have now to take advantage 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.349
 because it causes violence 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.049
 you have verified that this is displayed on 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:35.379
 Weekend 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:37.030
 causes provoke a win with this of 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.430
 the Iberian that was fine and a whole 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.140
 anthropology you get hundred that one 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.819
 what do you say the sport is for something 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.049
 playful to make water more os 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.049
 spit on the court of yours 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.049
 to get bored is argued fairly 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.700
 is fomenting violence which is 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.660
 asking is me and you just stated 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.660
 why not 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.840
 we put ourselves halfway because you did not say 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:18.660
 nothing these two but it seems to me that 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:18.660
 violence violence violence 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.270
 I have the same activity 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.270
 if left, they will not be attracted 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 d 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.950
 but possible your work to render 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.120
 and always looking with 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.830
 [Music] 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.950
 now I'm going to say it 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.940
 are the values ​​that it has always been for 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.440
 what 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.920
 that's why it's a song and that's why 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.920
 this session 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.470
 and it is what is unfair 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.880
 they need 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.520
 [Music] 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.080
 how 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.350
 who always says nothing to me that he wants 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.090
 go up to everything will be better 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.400
 with these types of strategies 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:17.280
 imagine what it has to be worth 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.280
 to gain courage not 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.060
 we look for pressure structure 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.580
 after a newspaper things that are 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.430
 structured 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:31.720
 how everyone has their way of 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.720
 Christmas things 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.970
 we all have our ways our 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.950
 values ​​and nothing else 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.760

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.959
 negative otherwise
