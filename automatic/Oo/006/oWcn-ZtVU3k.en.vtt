 Imagine that is something like city â€‹â€‹and city 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.590
 if you wanted to make something for you such 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.180
 thing because i thought i'm just sick 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.010
 making something like that I had planned a bit 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.779
 before the show so leave it in the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.039

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.660
 send to my twitter then open 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.240
 maybe Marx is just a thing for you 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.920
 the main topic today is natural 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.210
 guest roles or I want a guest I do 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.980
 do n't know 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 guest roles are not really good 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.579
 means on my channel and 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.350
 of course I will help you 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.170
 but i am middle person who say so 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.610
 then says van i just pick up with you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.969
 instead of you get a video on my 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.770
 channel 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.390
 so then i like to be with that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.210
 person because he is his joint 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.770
 submitted the good turf and then see 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 I also really can get it right and the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.770
 feel like it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.660
 that's why you love the video with 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.059
 record you and I like that much more 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.109
 because you i do a gas pull up on my 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.879
 channel 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.859
 So at baptism I actually do not on 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.140
 grass rollers you can of course do something 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.950
 Description 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.409

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.180

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.710

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.990

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.380
 this week my last grass beautiful upload 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.900
 I 'm going to do grass roll again but that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.580
 becomes van mind blown nl and I thought so 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.280
 that they did club but that is provisional 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.869
 the last guest we on my channel and yes 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.159

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.909

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.549
 so you can just have them wanted and send it 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.140
 to check your email to see if it's okay 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.700
