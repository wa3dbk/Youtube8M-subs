00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.630
 it is the material that creates the light on 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.179
 sun the electric ampoule or the worm 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 shining shows us every day 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.470
 but what is happening at the scale 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.109
 elementary it is at the end of the 19th century 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.480
 that two physicists alfred swamp 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.730
 liénard en france and émile vie chère en 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 Germany demonstrates that a particle 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.040
 charged loved by the light when she 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.989
 is accelerated the phenomenon concerns well 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.880
 sure the protons and ions but the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.370
 ideal candidate is undoubtedly 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.739
 the electron the charged particle 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.250
 the lightest so the easiest to 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.360
 move move but how do we 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.360
 let's see that there are several ways 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.160
 the atoms that constitutes an object are 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.080
 animated by an incessant movement and 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.390
 disorderly so-called stirring 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.640
 thermal or shock course 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.770
 they undergo various accelerations 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.740
 the electrons they contain and puts 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.270
 so constantly light 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.190
 the higher the temperature of the object is high 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.080
 the more the thermal agitation is 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.520
 important and more accelerations 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.049
 are strong 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.450
 the human body is but exclusively 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.799
 in the infrared the filament of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.930
 tungsten of an incandescent bulb 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.869
 produces light in the near 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.490
 infrared and the visible the sun to his 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.850
 maximum emission in the domain 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.149
 visible this light emitted by an object 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.149
 just because of its temperature is called 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.149
 incandescence 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.680
 unlike incandescent the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.290
 luminescence and light produced by 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.910
 excitations of the electrons in the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.340
 atoms the electrons occupy 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.010
 very precise energy levels we say that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.210
 these levels are quantified to pass 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.460
 from one level to another 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.080
 the electron has to absorb an energy 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.110
 equal to the difference between these two 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.640
 levels the excitation source can be 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.340
 a photon is the fault 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.690
 luminescence or a chemical reaction 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.820
 this is called bioluminescence the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.770
 excitation of the electron ie 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.550
 his return to a weaker state 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.260
 energy causes the emission of a photon 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.390
 the wavelength of the photon depends on 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.010
 the energy difference between the level 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.010
 departure and arrival 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.090
 when the electrons are free 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.840
 that is, they do not belong 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.180
 to atoms 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.040
 they can be accelerated by turning 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.740
 under the combined action of fields 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.940
 electrical and magnetic 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.620
 he then emits radiation 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.590
 electromagnetic that depends on their 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.730
 speed if the speed is much lower 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.770
 at the speed of light 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.330
 the beam is not clogged and 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.420
 the show takes place in a plane 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.910
 perpendicular to the trajectory if it 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.080
 is close to that of light 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.660
 the show is directed forward 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.000
 tendentially to the trajectory in 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.360
 a cone of very small aperture is 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.880
 the solar synchrotron radiation the 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.850
 electrons are relativistic it turns to 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.920
 99% of the speed of light with 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.920
 an energy of 2750 mev 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.850
 the synchrotron radiation is channeled 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.850
 to outputs the lines of light 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.069
 it offers a continuous spectrum that goes from 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.069
 the x-ray infrared 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.799
 experimenters selects a 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.110
 wavelength and then has a 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.430
 extremely powerful light for 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.430
 illuminate the studied sample 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.150
 until the 1960s the 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.340
 high energy physicists get 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.109
 complained of synchrotron radiation that 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.079
 meant a loss of energy in their 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.269
 particle accelerator it took 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.849
 a few scientists including yvette 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.040
 Cauchois in France to imagine how 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.319
 take advantage of this radiation and in 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.739
 make an indispensable tool for probing 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.739
 the material
