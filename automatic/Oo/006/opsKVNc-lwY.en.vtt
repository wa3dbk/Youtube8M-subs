00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
like this one or if it's a bird you just

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.189 
like this one or if it's a bird you just
got<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.270> an<00:00:18.420> older<00:00:18.720> bird<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.140> just

got and it's an older bird that just

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.260 
got and it's an older bird that just
hasn't<00:00:19.680> been<00:00:19.800> worked<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.490> think<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.150> of

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
hasn't been worked with I think one of

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.330 
hasn't been worked with I think one of
the<00:00:21.359> most<00:00:21.660> important<00:00:22.439> things<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:23.100> is

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the most important things we can do is

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.970 
the most important things we can do is
do<00:00:23.550> your<00:00:23.960> fundamentals<00:00:24.960> or<00:00:25.170> your<00:00:25.289> foundation

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
do your fundamentals or your foundation

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.920 
do your fundamentals or your foundation
in<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.820> beginning<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.449> that's<00:00:27.570> gonna<00:00:27.750> make

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
in the beginning and that's gonna make

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.500 
in the beginning and that's gonna make
everything<00:00:28.260> else<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.769> lot<00:00:28.949> easier<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.090> think

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
everything else a lot easier so I think

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.749 
everything else a lot easier so I think
how<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.960> hold<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.529> bird<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.610> most

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
how you hold the bird is one of the most

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.370 
how you hold the bird is one of the most
important<00:00:33.300> things<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.110> kind<00:00:34.290> of

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
important things we can do it kind of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.740 
important things we can do it kind of
sets<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.800> tone<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.180> everything<00:00:36.180> else<00:00:36.510> you're

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
sets a tone for everything else you're

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
sets a tone for everything else you're
gonna<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.110> later<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> show<00:00:38.790> you

you know stuff like that because I feel

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.310 
you know stuff like that because I feel
like<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:02.100> enables<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> birds<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.960> come<00:01:04.199> away

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
like that enables the birds to come away

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.050 
like that enables the birds to come away
from<00:01:04.500> pressure<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.309> their<00:01:05.549> own

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
from pressure on their own

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.990 
from pressure on their own
these<00:01:06.510> guys<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.930> pre<00:01:07.200> animals<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.460> my

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
these guys are pre animals and my

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.520 
these guys are pre animals and my
trainings<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.780> different<00:01:10.170> than<00:01:10.350> what

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
trainings a little different than what

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.149 
trainings a little different than what
you've<00:01:10.680> seen<00:01:10.950> before<00:01:11.270> I'm<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.510> real<00:01:12.750> big<00:01:12.930> on

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
you've seen before I'm not real big on

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.679 
you've seen before I'm not real big on
taking<00:01:14.159> food<00:01:14.340> away<00:01:14.490> from<00:01:14.880> them<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> using<00:01:15.540> as

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
taking food away from them and using as

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.230 
taking food away from them and using as
treats<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.619> them<00:01:17.070> overcoming<00:01:17.790> some<00:01:18.000> things

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
treats and them overcoming some things

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
treats and them overcoming some things
because<00:01:18.659> they're<00:01:18.930> hungry<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.590> think<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.310> can

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
because they're hungry I think we can

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.370 
because they're hungry I think we can
work<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.820> their<00:01:20.970> brain<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.570> God<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
work with their brain which God in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.920 
work with their brain which God in
nature<00:01:22.560> gave<00:01:22.950> them<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.549> use<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> release<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
nature gave them and use a release of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
nature gave them and use a release of
pressure<00:01:25.110> which<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.920> how<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.460> train<00:01:26.759> prey

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
pressure which is how we can train prey

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.480 
pressure which is how we can train prey
animals<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:27.960> gonna<00:01:28.110> pick<00:01:28.320> him<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:29.340> you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
guys are prey animals and release of

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.930 
guys are prey animals and release of
pressure<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:45.650> believe<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.980> what<00:02:47.190> really<00:02:47.640> trains

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
pressure I believe is what really trains

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.870 
pressure I believe is what really trains
them<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.320> what<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:49.950> want<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.670> as<00:02:50.850> soon

them and so what I want to do is as soon

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.060 
them and so what I want to do is as soon

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
as he's relaxed and calm which I think

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
as he's relaxed and calm which I think
he<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.420> then<00:02:54.420> I'll<00:02:54.600> put<00:02:54.810> him<00:02:54.900> back<00:02:58.670> which<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.850> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
he is then I'll put him back which is a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.950 
he is then I'll put him back which is a
bridge<00:03:00.650> that's<00:03:01.650> what<00:03:02.070> gives<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.460> time<00:03:02.730> to

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
bridge that's what gives you time to

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.990 
bridge that's what gives you time to
give<00:03:03.960> him<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.800> reward<00:03:05.220> which<00:03:05.490> i<00:03:05.640> think<00:03:05.700> is

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
give him the the reward which i think is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.180 
give him the the reward which i think is
release<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.510> pressure<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.170> then<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.040> can

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
release of pressure and then you can

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.210 
release of pressure and then you can
relax<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.630> more<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.020> do<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.440> over<00:03:10.770> norm

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
relax and the more you do this over norm

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.760 
relax and the more you do this over norm
over<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.880> better<00:03:12.150> they<00:03:12.390> get<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:13.260> eventually

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
over the better they get and eventually

my<00:03:35.850> training<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.420> little<00:03:36.630> different<00:03:37.110> I

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
my training is a little different I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.870 
my training is a little different I
think<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> lot<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:38.010> lot<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.430> things<00:03:38.580> you

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
think that a lot of lot of things you

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.210 
think that a lot of lot of things you
see<00:03:38.910> prey<00:03:39.900> animals<00:03:40.410> actually<00:03:40.830> have<00:03:41.010> their

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
see prey animals actually have their

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.979 
see prey animals actually have their
eyes<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.790> side<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.000> their<00:03:42.209> head<00:03:42.420> which<00:03:42.870> a

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
eyes on the side of their head which a

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.830 
eyes on the side of their head which a
bird<00:03:43.200> does<00:03:43.459> they<00:03:44.459> have<00:03:44.640> model<00:03:45.060> vision<00:03:45.540> which

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
bird does they have model vision which

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.830 
bird does they have model vision which
is<00:03:45.920> checking<00:03:46.920> out<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.190> distance<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.150> a

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
is checking out the distance of a

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.380 
is checking out the distance of a
predator<00:03:49.320> or<00:03:49.620> something<00:03:50.160> coming<00:03:50.400> toward<00:03:51.209> them

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
predator or something coming toward them

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.440 
predator or something coming toward them
and<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.800> what<00:03:53.040> happens<00:03:53.520> is<00:03:53.700> if<00:03:53.970> they<00:03:54.120> get<00:03:54.300> to

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
and so what happens is if they get to

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.910 
and so what happens is if they get to
the<00:03:54.540> point<00:03:54.720> where<00:03:54.989> they're<00:03:55.110> very<00:03:55.380> scared

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
the point where they're very scared

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.800 
the point where they're very scared
they're<00:03:56.850> gonna<00:03:57.000> take<00:03:57.330> off

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
they're gonna take off

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.020 
they're gonna take off
in<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.989> wild<00:03:58.320> they<00:03:58.470> fly<00:03:58.709> away<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.310> that's<00:03:59.850> how

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
in the wild they fly away and that's how

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.760 
in the wild they fly away and that's how
they<00:04:00.180> got<00:04:00.330> their<00:04:00.600> release<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.170> pressure<00:04:01.320> and

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
they got their release of pressure and

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.760 
they got their release of pressure and
that's<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.489> reward<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.810> what<00:04:04.110> we<00:04:04.260> want<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.620> do

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
that's a reward so what we want to do

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.920 
that's a reward so what we want to do
since<00:04:05.010> they<00:04:05.160> can't<00:04:05.459> get<00:04:05.670> away<00:04:05.810> generally<00:04:06.810> what

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
since they can't get away generally what

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.210 
since they can't get away generally what
happens<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.440> they<00:04:07.620> bite<00:04:07.920> or<00:04:08.360> they<00:04:09.360> get

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
happens is they bite or they get

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.890 
happens is they bite or they get
and<00:04:10.580> nervous<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.300> that's<00:04:11.480> because<00:04:11.780> they're

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
and nervous and that's because they're

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.480 
and nervous and that's because they're
going<00:04:12.140> in<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.290> reacting<00:04:12.800> side<00:04:13.010> of<00:04:13.100> your<00:04:13.220> brain

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
going in the reacting side of your brain

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.880 
going in the reacting side of your brain
and<00:04:13.760> they<00:04:14.180> can't<00:04:14.450> get<00:04:14.600> away<00:04:14.900> so<00:04:15.530> that's<00:04:15.650> when

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
and they can't get away so that's when

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.610 
and they can't get away so that's when
the<00:04:16.010> bad<00:04:16.190> behaviors<00:04:16.850> start<00:04:17.170> because<00:04:18.170> they

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
the bad behaviors start because they

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.699 
the bad behaviors start because they
can't<00:04:18.920> get<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.310> release<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:20.690> in<00:04:21.080> holding<00:04:21.680> the

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
can't get that release so in holding the

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.670 
can't get that release so in holding the
bird<00:04:21.950> like<00:04:22.130> this<00:04:22.390> petting<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:24.410> when<00:04:24.590> the

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
bird like this petting it and when the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.130 
bird like this petting it and when the
bird<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:24.980> calm<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:25.940> go<00:04:26.090> good<00:04:26.390> and<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:26.930> put

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
bird is calm and you go good and you put

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.760 
bird is calm and you go good and you put
it<00:04:27.230> back

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
it back

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.420 
it back
I<00:04:28.120> just<00:04:29.120> reduced<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.780> pressure<00:04:30.280> rewarded<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
I just reduced the pressure rewarded the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.030 
I just reduced the pressure rewarded the
bird<00:04:31.640> now<00:04:32.150> if<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.480> bird<00:04:32.690> is<00:04:32.810> antsy<00:04:33.440> moving

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
bird now if the bird is antsy moving

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.420 
bird now if the bird is antsy moving
around<00:04:34.280> fidgety<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.780> not<00:04:35.960> sitting<00:04:36.260> still<00:04:36.620> if

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
around fidgety and not sitting still if

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.420 
around fidgety and not sitting still if
we<00:04:37.700> got<00:04:37.880> uncomfortable<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.630> put<00:04:38.780> him<00:04:38.900> back

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
we got uncomfortable and put him back

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.240 
we got uncomfortable and put him back
then<00:04:40.430> we<00:04:40.670> would<00:04:40.820> reward<00:04:41.360> him<00:04:41.720> for<00:04:41.990> being<00:04:42.590> an<00:04:42.980> C

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
then we would reward him for being an C

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.180 
then we would reward him for being an C
fidgety<00:04:43.820> by<00:04:44.480> being<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.110> all<00:04:45.200> that<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.680> we<00:04:45.860> do

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
fidgety by being and all that and we do

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.610 
fidgety by being and all that and we do
not<00:04:46.430> want<00:04:46.790> to<00:04:46.880> do<00:04:47.000> that<00:04:47.210> because<00:04:47.990> then<00:04:48.380> pretty

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
not want to do that because then pretty

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.920 
not want to do that because then pretty
soon<00:04:48.880> you're<00:04:49.880> gonna<00:04:49.970> have<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.420> try<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:50.630> fix

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
soon you're gonna have to try to fix

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.230 
soon you're gonna have to try to fix
that<00:04:51.170> because<00:04:51.620> you've<00:04:52.100> just<00:04:52.130> rewarded<00:04:53.030> him

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
that because you've just rewarded him

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.960 
that because you've just rewarded him
for<00:04:54.170> being<00:04:54.320> that<00:04:54.560> way<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:55.310> release<00:04:55.760> the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
for being that way so release the

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.780 
for being that way so release the
pressure<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.570> think<00:04:57.260> is<00:04:57.860> one<00:04:58.070> of<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.250> best<00:04:58.520> ways

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
pressure I think is one of the best ways

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.030 
pressure I think is one of the best ways
to<00:04:59.000> work<00:04:59.120> with<00:04:59.150> these<00:04:59.420> guys<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.110> this<00:05:00.650> is<00:05:00.860> one

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
to work with these guys and this is one

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.390 
to work with these guys and this is one
of<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.220> first<00:05:01.520> things<00:05:02.650> is<00:05:03.650> basically<00:05:04.190> just

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
of the first things is basically just

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.450 
of the first things is basically just
walking<00:05:05.090> just<00:05:05.740> reacting<00:05:06.740> that's<00:05:07.070> all<00:05:07.220> it<00:05:07.370> is

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
walking just reacting that's all it is

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.180 
walking just reacting that's all it is
I'm<00:05:08.450> gonna<00:05:08.570> put<00:05:08.810> his<00:05:08.900> foot<00:05:09.110> there<00:05:09.320> get<00:05:09.980> him<00:05:10.040> in

I'm gonna put his foot there get him in

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.620 
I'm gonna put his foot there get him in
position<00:05:10.220> I'll<00:05:11.150> hold<00:05:11.360> them<00:05:11.540> in<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:12.080> cuddle<00:05:13.630> in

good and then you can put him back and
eventually<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:18.500> can<00:05:18.680> hold<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:18.980> longer<00:05:19.130> and

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
eventually you can hold it longer and

reason<00:05:30.020> what<00:05:30.140> the<00:05:30.260> shoulder<00:05:30.680> thing<00:05:30.919> too<00:05:31.160> is

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
reason what the shoulder thing too is

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.580 
reason what the shoulder thing too is
honestly<00:05:31.970> you<00:05:32.660> know<00:05:32.780> we<00:05:32.990> talked<00:05:33.200> about<00:05:33.350> how

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
honestly you know we talked about how

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.440 
honestly you know we talked about how
they<00:05:33.740> can<00:05:33.950> feel<00:05:34.520> more<00:05:34.550> dominant<00:05:35.120> cuz<00:05:35.330> they're

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
they can feel more dominant cuz they're

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.060 
they can feel more dominant cuz they're
high<00:05:35.690> well<00:05:36.020> naturally<00:05:36.169> they<00:05:36.560> want<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.800> get<00:05:36.950> up

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
high well naturally they want to get up

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.860 
high well naturally they want to get up
high<00:05:37.220> in<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.820> wild<00:05:38.120> they're<00:05:38.270> up<00:05:38.360> in<00:05:38.480> the<00:05:38.630> trees

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
high in the wild they're up in the trees

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.930 
high in the wild they're up in the trees
and<00:05:38.900> they<00:05:39.560> feel<00:05:39.740> safe<00:05:40.010> there<00:05:40.340> because<00:05:40.850> they

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
and they feel safe there because they

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.120 
and they feel safe there because they
can<00:05:41.090> stay<00:05:41.300> away<00:05:41.510> from<00:05:41.570> predators<00:05:41.950> but<00:05:42.950> the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
can stay away from predators but the

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.460 
can stay away from predators but the
fact<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.520> it<00:05:43.669> is<00:05:43.700> the<00:05:44.450> first<00:05:44.720> time<00:05:44.990> you<00:05:45.200> go<00:05:45.410> to

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
fact of it is the first time you go to

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.980 
fact of it is the first time you go to
get<00:05:45.710> them<00:05:45.860> off<00:05:45.980> your<00:05:46.190> shoulder<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:46.850> they<00:05:47.270> back

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
get them off your shoulder and they back

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.409 
get them off your shoulder and they back
away<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.800> get<00:05:49.040> away<00:05:49.250> from<00:05:49.310> you<00:05:49.669> then<00:05:50.240> they've

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
away and get away from you then they've

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.540 
away and get away from you then they've
released<00:05:50.930> that<00:05:51.230> pressure<00:05:51.530> and<00:05:51.890> they've

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
released that pressure and they've

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.540 
released that pressure and they've
taught<00:05:53.320> themselves<00:05:54.320> basically<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:55.220> get<00:05:55.430> away

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
taught themselves basically to get away

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.460 
taught themselves basically to get away
and<00:05:56.060> then<00:05:56.419> pretty<00:05:56.660> soon<00:05:56.780> you<00:05:57.110> see<00:05:57.290> people

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
and then pretty soon you see people

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.560 
and then pretty soon you see people
trying<00:05:58.100> to<00:05:58.220> scrape<00:05:58.460> them<00:05:58.640> off<00:05:58.850> their<00:05:59.060> shoulder

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
trying to scrape them off their shoulder

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.810 
trying to scrape them off their shoulder
and<00:05:59.960> and<00:06:00.200> so<00:06:00.800> forth<00:06:01.100> so<00:06:01.250> I<00:06:01.280> don't<00:06:01.550> believe

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
and and so forth so I don't believe

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.110 
and and so forth so I don't believe
that's<00:06:02.030> something<00:06:02.240> we<00:06:02.480> should<00:06:02.660> start<00:06:02.930> and<00:06:03.260> so

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
that's something we should start and so

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.060 
that's something we should start and so
position<00:06:05.120> where<00:06:05.720> you<00:06:05.870> hold<00:06:06.080> them<00:06:06.290> like<00:06:06.620> this<00:06:06.650> I

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
position where you hold them like this I

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.040 
position where you hold them like this I
think<00:06:07.160> is<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.610> key<00:06:08.000> and<00:06:08.240> it's<00:06:08.750> a<00:06:08.840> foundation

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
think is the key and it's a foundation

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.580 
think is the key and it's a foundation
to<00:06:09.770> your<00:06:10.550> training<00:06:11.000> and<00:06:11.390> what<00:06:12.110> we<00:06:12.230> should<00:06:12.410> do

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
to your training and what we should do

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.310 
to your training and what we should do
in<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.640> beginning<00:06:13.970> with<00:06:14.900> their<00:06:15.080> birds

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
in the beginning with their birds

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.989 
in the beginning with their birds
whether<00:06:15.620> it's<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:15.890> baby

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:16.999 
whether it's a baby

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.089 
whether it's a baby
or<00:06:17.659> an<00:06:17.749> older<00:06:17.989> bird<00:06:18.139> that<00:06:18.409> hasn't<00:06:18.589> been<00:06:18.889> worked

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
or an older bird that hasn't been worked

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.719 
or an older bird that hasn't been worked
with<00:06:20.379> and<00:06:21.379> like<00:06:21.559> I<00:06:21.679> said<00:06:21.739> wait<00:06:22.159> till<00:06:22.369> it's<00:06:22.489> calm

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
with and like I said wait till it's calm

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.239 
with and like I said wait till it's calm
don't<00:06:23.209> put<00:06:23.479> it<00:06:23.569> back<00:06:23.599> and<00:06:24.439> don't<00:06:24.649> release<00:06:25.039> that

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:25.249 
don't put it back and don't release that

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:27.579 
don't put it back and don't release that
pressure<00:06:25.459> when<00:06:26.449> the<00:06:26.569> bird<00:06:26.749> is<00:06:26.779> nervous<00:06:27.349> or

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:27.589 
pressure when the bird is nervous or

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:30.369 
pressure when the bird is nervous or
acting<00:06:28.219> up
