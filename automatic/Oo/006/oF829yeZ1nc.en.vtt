00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
very goal-oriented field so you really

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.020 
very goal-oriented field so you really
see<00:00:38.650> notice<00:00:39.100> patient<00:00:39.579> improvements

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030

sometimes<00:00:40.360> in<00:00:40.510> a<00:00:40.570> very<00:00:40.750> rapid<00:00:41.230> period<00:00:41.950> of<00:00:42.130> time

sometimes in a very rapid period of time

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.030 
sometimes in a very rapid period of time
and<00:00:43.540> then<00:00:43.899> I<00:00:43.960> sort<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.350> filed<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.710> up<00:00:44.800> with<00:00:45.010> a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
and then I sort of filed that up with a

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.880 
and then I sort of filed that up with a
hand<00:00:45.399> surgery<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.170> guess<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.500> couple<00:00:47.710> of

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
hand surgery for I guess a couple of

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.280 
hand surgery for I guess a couple of
reasons<00:00:48.010> one<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:49.180> anatomy<00:00:49.570> gahanna<00:00:49.899> of<00:00:50.079> the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
reasons one the anatomy gahanna of the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.940 
reasons one the anatomy gahanna of the
hand<00:00:50.500> fascinates<00:00:51.460> me<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.850> itself<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.800> really

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
hand fascinates me in itself it's really

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.500 
hand fascinates me in itself it's really
about<00:00:54.070> getting<00:00:54.280> patients<00:00:54.579> back<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:54.940> function

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
about getting patients back to function

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
about getting patients back to function
which<00:00:56.260> I<00:00:56.770> think<00:00:57.550> has<00:00:57.670> always<00:00:57.880> been<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.059> goal<00:00:58.300> in

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
which I think has always been a goal in

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.280 
which I think has always been a goal in
something<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.280> wanted<00:01:00.520> to<00:01:00.579> do<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:02.170> other

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
something I wanted to do and the other

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.930 
something I wanted to do and the other
sort<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.649> benefit<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.160> hand<00:01:03.340> surgery<00:01:03.520> really

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
sort of benefit of hand surgery really

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.670 
sort of benefit of hand surgery really
get<00:01:04.119> to<00:01:04.210> work<00:01:04.360> with<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.960> full<00:01:05.140> spectrum<00:01:05.439> of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
get to work with the full spectrum of

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.919 
get to work with the full spectrum of
patients<00:01:06.159> terms<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:07.090> newborns<00:01:07.600> all<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.869> way

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929 
patients terms of newborns all the way

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.539 
patients terms of newborns all the way
up<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.049> patients<00:01:08.649> who<00:01:08.709> are<00:01:08.740> hundred<00:01:09.249> years<00:01:09.399> old

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
up to patients who are hundred years old

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:16.260 
up to patients who are hundred years old
so<00:01:10.149> it's<00:01:10.509> gratify<00:01:13.829> besides<00:01:14.829> the<00:01:15.100> ages<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.729> you

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
so it's gratify besides the ages and you

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.660 
so it's gratify besides the ages and you
have<00:01:16.479> nerve<00:01:16.869> problems<00:01:17.499> you<00:01:17.799> have<00:01:18.009> skin

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
have nerve problems you have skin

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.359 
have nerve problems you have skin
problems<00:01:18.899> you<00:01:19.899> have<00:01:20.079> I<00:01:20.439> guess<00:01:20.679> problems<00:01:21.159> you

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
problems you have I guess problems you

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.730 
problems you have I guess problems you
know<00:01:21.459> newborns<00:01:22.060> congenital<00:01:22.719> problems<00:01:23.200> you

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
know newborns congenital problems you

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.069 
know newborns congenital problems you
have<00:01:23.859> fracture<00:01:24.249> problems<00:01:24.759> and<00:01:25.149> tendon<00:01:25.749> so<00:01:25.990> it

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
have fracture problems and tendon so it

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.440 
have fracture problems and tendon so it
really<00:01:26.340> sort<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.429> fills<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.850> whole<00:01:27.999> spectrum

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
really sort of fills the whole spectrum

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.839 
really sort of fills the whole spectrum
of<00:01:28.569> different<00:01:29.289> types<00:01:29.619> of<00:01:29.709> problems<00:01:29.920> all

treat them without surgery and you know
they're<00:02:07.679> very<00:02:07.860> happy<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:11.000> think<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.060> trend<00:02:12.299> now

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
they're very happy I think the trend now

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.930 
they're very happy I think the trend now
is<00:02:12.569> really<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:14.040> know<00:02:14.130> once<00:02:14.340> upon<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> time

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
is really you know once upon a time

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.910 
is really you know once upon a time
patients<00:02:15.630> we<00:02:15.750> had<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.959> immobilize<00:02:16.440> them<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.890> a

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
patients we had to immobilize them for a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
patients we had to immobilize them for a
long<00:02:17.040> time<00:02:17.280> after<00:02:17.670> broken<00:02:18.000> bones<00:02:18.209> or<00:02:18.420> after

long time after broken bones or after

long time after broken bones or after
even<00:02:19.500> complex<00:02:19.890> surgery<00:02:20.599> now<00:02:21.599> because<00:02:22.170> some<00:02:22.950> of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
even complex surgery now because some of

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.460 
even complex surgery now because some of
new<00:02:23.190> techniques<00:02:23.549> we<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.970> both<00:02:24.750> surgical

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
new techniques we have both surgical

new techniques we have both surgical
non-surgical<00:02:26.340> we're<00:02:26.730> trying<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.120> the

non-surgical we're trying to get the

non-surgical we're trying to get the
patient's<00:02:27.599> moving<00:02:27.900> much<00:02:28.049> faster<00:02:28.079> when

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
patient's moving much faster when

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.940 
patient's moving much faster when
finding<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> results<00:02:30.060> are<00:02:30.120> much<00:02:30.269> better

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
finding that the results are much better

finding that the results are much better
patients<00:02:31.950> return<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.400> work<00:02:32.519> much<00:02:32.760> faster<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
operating on a newborn could be a

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.890 
operating on a newborn could be a
challenging<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.940> some<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.450> bones<00:02:39.600> are

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
challenging and some of the bones are

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.349 
challenging and some of the bones are
informed<00:02:40.319> yet<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.670> structures<00:02:42.060> are<00:02:42.209> very

informed yet and the structures are very

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.990 
informed yet and the structures are very
small<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.590> obviously<00:02:44.220> before<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.730> undertake

any<00:02:45.359> you<00:02:45.690> know<00:02:45.780> surgery<00:02:46.049> in<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.319> newborn<00:02:46.650> you

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
any you know surgery in a newborn you

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.470 
any you know surgery in a newborn you
know<00:02:47.069> we<00:02:47.160> make<00:02:47.310> sure<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:48.209> know<00:02:48.299> with<00:02:48.450> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
know we make sure you know with the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.150 
know we make sure you know with the
pediatrician<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.350> they're<00:02:49.530> healthy<00:02:50.130> and

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
pediatrician that they're healthy and

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.819 
pediatrician that they're healthy and
there<00:02:50.670> no<00:02:50.790> medical<00:02:51.150> issues<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.750> then<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.650> guess

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
there no medical issues and then I guess

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.009 
there no medical issues and then I guess
the<00:02:52.950> technical<00:02:53.430> part<00:02:53.609> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.819> surgery<00:02:54.060> it's

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
the technical part of the surgery it's

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.110 
the technical part of the surgery it's
difficult<00:02:55.500> at<00:02:55.739> times<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.489> lot<00:02:56.639> of<00:02:56.790> times<00:02:56.970> use

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
difficult at times we a lot of times use

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.210 
difficult at times we a lot of times use
the<00:02:57.299> microscope<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.530> know<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.829> we<00:02:58.920> could<00:02:59.069> see

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
the microscope you know so we could see

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.780 
the microscope you know so we could see
some<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.549> these<00:02:59.639> structures<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:01.790> sometimes

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
some of these structures and sometimes

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.460 
some of these structures and sometimes
it<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.359> mean<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.810> much<00:03:03.989> different<00:03:04.350> than

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
it is I mean it is much different than

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.280 
it is I mean it is much different than
an<00:03:04.590> adult<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:05.209> but<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.389> know<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.600> goal<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:07.049> lot

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
an adult and but you know the goal a lot

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.660 
an adult and but you know the goal a lot
of<00:03:07.410> times<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.920> same<00:03:08.130> as<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.459> increase

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
of times is the same as to increase

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.640 
of times is the same as to increase
long-term<00:03:09.239> function

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.649 

I<00:03:12.739> don't<00:03:13.640> know<00:03:13.790> if<00:03:13.909> it's<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.329> know<00:03:14.450> one

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
I don't know if it's you know one

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.440 
I don't know if it's you know one
patient<00:03:15.140> but<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.560> do<00:03:16.099> enjoy<00:03:16.819> some<00:03:17.239> of<00:03:17.269> the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
patient but I do enjoy some of the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.020 
patient but I do enjoy some of the
congenital<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.379> know<00:03:18.500> surgery<00:03:19.129> on<00:03:19.430> sometimes

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
congenital you know surgery on sometimes

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.470 
congenital you know surgery on sometimes
newborns<00:03:20.750> for<00:03:21.019> congenital<00:03:21.409> deformities<00:03:22.159> and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
newborns for congenital deformities and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.030 
newborns for congenital deformities and
usually<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.629> patients<00:03:24.590> are<00:03:24.680> really<00:03:24.950> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
usually the patients are really the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.160 
usually the patients are really the
parents<00:03:25.370> come<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.579> me<00:03:25.849> for<00:03:26.090> what's<00:03:26.780> deemed<00:03:26.959> a

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
cosmetic deformity and my goal is to

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.599 
cosmetic deformity and my goal is to
give<00:03:29.840> them<00:03:29.959> long-term<00:03:30.230> function<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.129> I'll

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
give them long-term function and I'll

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.460 
give them long-term function and I'll
see<00:03:31.760> them<00:03:31.909> five<00:03:32.150> years<00:03:32.359> later<00:03:32.659> and<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
see them five years later and the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.780 
see them five years later and the
parents<00:03:33.829> are<00:03:33.859> happy<00:03:34.069> because<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.430> hand<00:03:34.609> looks

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
parents are happy because the hand looks

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.280 
parents are happy because the hand looks
normal<00:03:35.180> but<00:03:35.209> I'm<00:03:35.450> happy<00:03:35.689> because<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.109> kid

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
normal but I'm happy because the kid

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.289
