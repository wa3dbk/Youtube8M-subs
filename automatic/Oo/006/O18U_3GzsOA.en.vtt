protection let's go ahead and stick a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.760 
protection let's go ahead and stick a
battery<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.900> obviously<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
battery in here obviously this is a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.060 
battery in here obviously this is a
stainless<00:01:41.490> steel<00:01:41.670> version<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:43.650> it<00:01:43.710> gives<00:01:43.890> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
stainless steel version so it gives you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:55.490 
stainless steel version so it gives you
slightly<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.460> durability<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.869> body

batteries so is very light again has a
very<00:03:03.019> durable<00:03:05.150> attachment<00:03:06.150> point<00:03:06.360> here<00:03:06.600> to

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
very durable attachment point here to

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.990 
very durable attachment point here to
hold<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.440> keychain<00:03:07.790> which<00:03:08.790> will

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
hold it in the keychain which will

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.090 
hold it in the keychain which will
definitely<00:03:09.420> not<00:03:09.870> break<00:03:10.170> or<00:03:10.650> snap<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:13.100> so

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
definitely not break or snap on you so

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.710 
definitely not break or snap on you so
is<00:03:14.250> also<00:03:14.430> due<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.910> way<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.300> torch<00:03:15.570> has

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
is also due to the way this torch has

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.300 
is also due to the way this torch has
been<00:03:15.870> designed<00:03:16.230> it's<00:03:16.590> very<00:03:16.830> easy<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.280> operate

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
been designed it's very easy to operate

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.720 
been designed it's very easy to operate
with<00:03:17.790> one<00:03:17.820> hand<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:20.220> we'll<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:20.580> go<00:03:20.700> through

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
with one hand and we'll just go through

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.750 
with one hand and we'll just go through
the<00:03:21.030> modes<00:03:21.209> now<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.080> it's<00:03:22.230> activate<00:03:22.760> simply

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
the modes now so it's activate simply

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.150 
the modes now so it's activate simply
twist<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:25.350> comes<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.709> in<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.920> first

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
twist on and this comes on in the first

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.300 
twist on and this comes on in the first
mode<00:03:26.400> which<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.120> 26<00:03:27.720> lumens<00:03:28.110> with<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.890> runtime
