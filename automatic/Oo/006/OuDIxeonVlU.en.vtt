so<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:35.409> car<00:00:35.620> started<00:00:35.980> out<00:00:36.129> is<00:00:36.339> a<00:00:36.370> white<00:00:36.850> car

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
so this car started out is a white car

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.599 
so this car started out is a white car
correct<00:00:37.839> it<00:00:38.260> was<00:00:38.499> white<00:00:38.800> before<00:00:39.010> it<00:00:39.309> turned<00:00:39.519> to

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
correct it was white before it turned to

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.569 
correct it was white before it turned to
rust<00:00:39.909> and<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:41.739> now<00:00:41.890> it<00:00:41.980> has<00:00:42.039> what<00:00:42.339> what<00:00:42.550> I

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
rust and but now it has what what I

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.090 
rust and but now it has what what I
guess<00:00:43.030> we<00:00:43.179> would<00:00:43.329> call<00:00:43.359> a<00:00:43.569> patina<00:00:44.079> yeah<00:00:44.620> yeah

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
guess we would call a patina yeah yeah

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.660 
guess we would call a patina yeah yeah
