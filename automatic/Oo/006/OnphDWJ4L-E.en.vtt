it I think we're probably if it's fine
if<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.780> five<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.230> five<00:01:10.440> it's<00:01:10.800> a<00:01:10.890> tie<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.160> it's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
if it's five to five it's a tie if it's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.219 
if it's five to five it's a tie if it's
more<00:01:11.729> than<00:01:11.880> five<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.479> win<00:01:12.690> if<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.050> less<00:01:13.200> than

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
more than five you win if it's less than

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.430 
more than five you win if it's less than
five<00:01:16.370> we<00:01:17.370> might<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.910> cutting<00:01:18.270> out<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.660> short<00:01:19.140> on

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
five we might be cutting out so short on

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.969
