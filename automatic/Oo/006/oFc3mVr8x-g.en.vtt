this is a very speedy operating system
and<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> genuinely<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.610> enjoy<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> switch<00:01:24.299> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and I genuinely do enjoy the switch that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.260 
and I genuinely do enjoy the switch that
I<00:01:25.259> made<00:01:25.470> from<00:01:25.710> iOS<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.310> Android<00:01:26.670> simply

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
I made from iOS to Android simply

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.179 
I made from iOS to Android simply
because<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.570> how<00:01:27.900> well<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> smooth<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.979> runs

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
because of how well and smooth it runs

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.190 
because of how well and smooth it runs
to<00:01:29.549> me<00:01:29.670> Android<00:01:30.090> was<00:01:30.210> always<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> very<00:01:30.780> clunky

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
to me Android was always a very clunky

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200 
to me Android was always a very clunky
glitchy<00:01:31.619> operating<00:01:32.130> system<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.880> ever<00:01:33.000> since

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
glitchy operating system but ever since

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
glitchy operating system but ever since
I<00:01:33.659> believe<00:01:33.990> Ice<00:01:34.140> Cream<00:01:34.350> Sandwich<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.829> has<00:01:34.979> been

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189

a<00:01:35.369> lot<00:01:35.610> nicer<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:36.299> my<00:01:36.450> eyes<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> build

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
a lot nicer in my eyes now the build
