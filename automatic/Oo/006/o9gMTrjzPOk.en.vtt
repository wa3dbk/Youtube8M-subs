 hello everyone I'm my dorita de lima - and 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.880
 in this opportunity I am going to teach you 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.190
 which I call the false porous 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.890
 because it resembles 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.720
 if the camera captures it 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.810
 to this micro fire 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.680
 rubber eva that has a texture like 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.550
 cork 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.880

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.340
