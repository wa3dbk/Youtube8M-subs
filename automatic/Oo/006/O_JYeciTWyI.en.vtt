00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.019 
M&amp;M so I'm choosing blue in this
particular<00:00:16.109> case<00:00:16.529> for<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> Noah's<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.910> need

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
particular case for the Noah's you need

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.849 
particular case for the Noah's you need
to<00:00:18.090> go<00:00:18.210> all<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:19.020> make<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> nose<00:00:19.560> shape

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
to go all of it to make the nose shape

to go all of it to make the nose shape
under<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> bandages<00:00:20.699> now<00:00:21.420> I'm<00:00:21.539> using<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
under the bandages now I'm using a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.170 
under the bandages now I'm using a
basket<00:00:22.680> weave<00:00:23.130> tip<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.580> think<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.939> number

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
basket weave tip I think it's a number

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.009 
basket weave tip I think it's a number
47<00:00:25.279> with<00:00:26.279> white<00:00:26.519> icing<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.570> then

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
you're just going to pipe these

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.700 
you're just going to pipe these
wrappings<00:00:32.040> over<00:00:32.610> top<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.899> eyes<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.590> an

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
over top of the nose and you're gonna

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.310 
over top of the nose and you're gonna
leave<00:00:37.469> little<00:00:37.800> smile<00:00:38.210> shaped<00:00:39.210> gap<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
leave little smile shaped gap in at the

leave little smile shaped gap in at the
bottom<00:00:40.649> there<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.129> about<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.730> then<00:00:42.420> just

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
bottom there for about and then just

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.540

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
keep adding the wrappings until it looks

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.639 
keep adding the wrappings until it looks
good<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> show<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.200> second

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
good I'm going to show you a second

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.380 
good I'm going to show you a second
method<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.129> putting<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.730> nose<00:00:47.910> underneath

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
method of putting a nose underneath

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
method of putting a nose underneath
there<00:00:48.660> there's<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.590> noose<00:00:50.100> using<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> glob<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
there there's the noose using a glob of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.090 
there there's the noose using a glob of
icing<00:00:51.120> method<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.750> use<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> jelly<00:00:52.230> bean<00:00:52.469> for

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
icing method and I use a jelly bean for

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.619 
icing method and I use a jelly bean for
the<00:00:53.160> second<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.180> think<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> jelly

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the second one and I think the jelly

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.150 
the second one and I think the jelly
bean<00:00:54.840> actually<00:00:55.170> looks<00:00:55.320> better<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.920> gives<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
bean actually looks better it gives you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
bean actually looks better it gives you
a<00:00:56.190> more<00:00:56.399> defined<00:00:56.699> shape<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> nose<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.870> then

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
a more defined shape of a nose and then

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.319 
a more defined shape of a nose and then
just<00:00:58.350> keep<00:00:58.469> adding<00:00:58.680> wrappings<00:01:02.149> until<00:01:03.149> you're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
just keep adding wrappings until you're

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.640 
just keep adding wrappings until you're
satisfied<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.479> plastic<00:01:06.960> bag<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.500> plastic

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
satisfied the plastic bag the plastic

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.500 
satisfied the plastic bag the plastic
ziplock<00:01:08.100> bag<00:01:08.490> trick<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> normally<00:01:09.479> use

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
ziplock bag trick that I normally use

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.090 
ziplock bag trick that I normally use
it's<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.080> really<00:01:10.290> suitable<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.890> case

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
it's not really suitable in this case

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.649 
it's not really suitable in this case
because<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.549> hard<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.479> ribbon

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
because it's hard to get the ribbon

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
because it's hard to get the ribbon
shape<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> plastic<00:01:13.650> bag<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.030> need

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
shape with the plastic bag I'm you need

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.950 
shape with the plastic bag I'm you need
to<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.659> use<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> icing<00:01:16.770> bag<00:01:17.369> tip<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.850> this

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
to really use the icing bag tip for this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.660 
to really use the icing bag tip for this
so<00:01:18.960> put<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> M&amp;Ms<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> eyes<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
so put the M&amp;Ms for the eyes and the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
so put the M&amp;Ms for the eyes and the
jelly<00:01:20.909> bean<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> nose<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.500> start

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
