tentacles<00:02:22.130> maybe<00:02:22.730> not<00:02:23.420> sure<00:02:24.460> but<00:02:25.460> still<00:02:26.330> I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
tentacles maybe not sure but still I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.450 
tentacles maybe not sure but still I
really<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.410> design<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.800> this<00:02:28.040> warrior

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
really like the design of this warrior

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.370 
really like the design of this warrior
it's<00:02:28.640> nice<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:28.970> shiny<00:02:29.120> too<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:30.250> bandit<00:02:32.380> this

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
it's nice and shiny too and bandit this

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.180 
it's nice and shiny too and bandit this
is<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.650> earth<00:02:33.890> element<00:02:35.709> or<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.890> element

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
is the earth element or the element

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.560 
is the earth element or the element
wheel<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.550> can<00:02:37.670> see<00:02:37.820> there's<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.209> two

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
wheel you can see there's like two

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.370 
wheel you can see there's like two
daggers<00:02:39.560> maybe<00:02:40.810> something<00:02:41.810> abandoned<00:02:42.260> would

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
daggers maybe something abandoned would

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.670 
daggers maybe something abandoned would
probably<00:02:42.980> use<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.170> what<00:02:45.170> I'm<00:02:45.260> most<00:02:45.290> excited

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
probably use and what I'm most excited

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.310 
probably use and what I'm most excited
about<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.310> f<00:02:48.280> 234<00:02:49.280> free<00:02:49.730> 230<00:02:50.600> which<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.020> kind<00:02:51.260> of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
about is f 234 free 230 which is kind of

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.060 
about is f 234 free 230 which is kind of
like<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:52.700> bearing<00:02:53.630> Drive<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.500> from<00:02:54.739> front

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
like a bearing Drive like from front

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.060 
like a bearing Drive like from front
from<00:02:55.610> phantom<00:02:56.030> orion<00:02:56.300> like<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.200> Shogun<00:02:57.830> steel

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
from phantom orion like a Shogun steel

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.830 
from phantom orion like a Shogun steel
slash<00:02:58.459> 0g<00:02:59.150> version<00:02:59.660> of<00:03:00.400> baron<00:03:01.400> drive<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.880> as

slash 0g version of baron drive and as

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.140 
slash 0g version of baron drive and as
you<00:03:03.140> can<00:03:03.200> see<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.500> spins<00:03:03.830> very<00:03:04.160> well<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:05.000> it

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
you can see it spins very well like it

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.880 
you can see it spins very well like it
doesn't<00:03:05.330> like<00:03:05.720> hinder<00:03:06.140> or<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.560> doesn't<00:03:06.770> get

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
doesn't like hinder or it doesn't get

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.830

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
stuck or anything like that but it's

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.190 
stuck or anything like that but it's
very<00:03:09.080> smooth<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.540> suspect<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.810> this<00:03:12.020> will

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
very smooth so I suspect that this will

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.310 
very smooth so I suspect that this will
be<00:03:12.320> very<00:03:12.709> good<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.900> cyclone<00:03:14.900> beystadium

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
be very good in the cyclone beystadium

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.920 
be very good in the cyclone beystadium
or<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.860> zero-g<00:03:17.440> attack<00:03:18.440> Stadium<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:20.120> here<00:03:20.720> is

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
or the zero-g attack Stadium so here is

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.759 
or the zero-g attack Stadium so here is
the<00:03:21.500> tip<00:03:22.459> forms<00:03:23.120> tip<00:03:23.330> for<00:03:23.810> twin<00:03:24.590> ball<00:03:26.769> looks

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
the tip forms tip for twin ball looks

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.470 
the tip forms tip for twin ball looks
very<00:03:27.980> peculiar<00:03:28.430> but<00:03:29.420> anyway<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:31.130> is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
very peculiar but anyway this is

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.420 
very peculiar but anyway this is
supposed<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.540> be<00:03:32.630> really<00:03:32.900> good<00:03:33.019> in<00:03:33.620> defense

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
supposed to be really good in defense

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.210 
supposed to be really good in defense
and<00:03:34.730> stamina<00:03:35.060> kind<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:35.930> like<00:03:36.080> wide<00:03:36.380> ball<00:03:36.709> but

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
and stamina kind of like wide ball but

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.199 
and stamina kind of like wide ball but
even<00:03:38.090> rounder<00:03:38.860> alright<00:03:39.860> anyway<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.880> don't

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
even rounder alright anyway so I don't

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.680 
even rounder alright anyway so I don't
have<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.440> Takara<00:03:43.430> Tomy<00:03:43.489> version<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.299> can't

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
have the Takara Tomy version so I can't

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.640 
have the Takara Tomy version so I can't
do<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:46.180> comparison<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:47.480> I'll<00:03:47.570> just<00:03:47.750> put<00:03:47.959> this

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
do a comparison so I'll just put this

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.720 
do a comparison so I'll just put this
together<00:03:49.660> do<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:51.579> weight<00:03:52.579> test<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:55.040> spin

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
together do a weight test and a spin

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.560 
together do a weight test and a spin
test<00:03:55.940> right<00:03:56.239> after<00:04:00.459> wow<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.519> thing<00:04:02.299> doesn't

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
test right after wow the thing doesn't

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.030 
test right after wow the thing doesn't
really<00:04:02.630> fit<00:04:03.079> that<00:04:03.200> well<00:04:03.380> over<00:04:03.769> it<00:04:03.829> okay<00:04:04.070> so

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
really fit that well over it okay so

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.710 
really fit that well over it okay so
this<00:04:07.040> together<00:04:07.340> here<00:04:08.239> is<00:04:08.590> banded<00:04:09.590> Genbu

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
this together here is banded Genbu

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
bandit Genbu f 230 TV let's do a weight

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.080 
bandit Genbu f 230 TV let's do a weight
test<00:04:17.690> real<00:04:17.900> quick<00:04:19.810> sonograms<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.340> 40<00:04:22.849> grams

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
test real quick sonograms so 40 grams

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.140 
test real quick sonograms so 40 grams
all<00:04:23.479> together<00:04:24.010> for<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.310> spin<00:04:25.520> test<00:04:25.760> i'll<00:04:25.970> be

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
all together for the spin test i'll be

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.159 
all together for the spin test i'll be
using<00:04:26.300> this<00:04:26.840> like

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
using this like

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.369 
using this like
beystadium<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:29.120> zero<00:04:29.389> g<00:04:29.449> string

beystadium and the zero g string
launcher<00:04:42.759> let's<00:04:43.759> see<00:04:43.909> how<00:04:44.029> long<00:04:44.210> this<00:04:44.539> guy

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:44.779 
launcher let's see how long this guy

00:04:44.779 --> 00:05:13.829 
launcher let's see how long this guy
could<00:04:45.020> spin

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:13.839 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.209 

seems<00:05:14.839> like<00:05:14.989> he's<00:05:15.169> still<00:05:15.199> going<00:05:15.619> strong<00:05:16.189> oh

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
seems like he's still going strong oh

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:23.739 
seems like he's still going strong oh
it's<00:05:16.519> getting<00:05:16.729> a<00:05:16.789> little<00:05:16.999> wobbly<00:05:22.449> but<00:05:23.449> for<00:05:23.659> the

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:23.749 
it's getting a little wobbly but for the

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:26.069 
it's getting a little wobbly but for the
most<00:05:23.869> part<00:05:24.169> he's<00:05:24.919> spinning<00:05:25.339> pretty<00:05:25.459> smoothly

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:26.079 
most part he's spinning pretty smoothly

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:56.080 
most part he's spinning pretty smoothly
I'll<00:05:27.079> be<00:05:27.349> slowing<00:05:27.619> down<00:05:27.709> a<00:05:27.859> little<00:05:28.069> bit

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:05.110

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
I was losing a lot of spin he's going to

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:18.879 
I was losing a lot of spin he's going to
go<00:06:05.180> down<00:06:05.389> in<00:06:05.540> a<00:06:05.660> few<00:06:06.080> seconds<00:06:06.440> here<00:06:17.620> in<00:06:18.620> town
