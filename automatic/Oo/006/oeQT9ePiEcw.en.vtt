00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.819 
and it's pretty amazing for a woman to
do<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> mean<00:01:54.530> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.710> were

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829

able<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> road<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.640> teach<00:01:57.390> kids

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
able to go on the road and teach kids

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.399 
able to go on the road and teach kids
about<00:01:58.399> krumping<00:01:59.399> and<00:02:00.110> being<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.200> role<00:02:01.380> model

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
about krumping and being a role model

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.289 
about krumping and being a role model
that's<00:02:02.189> something<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.579> would<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
that's something you would like to do of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.100 
that's something you would like to do of
course<00:02:03.920> very<00:02:04.920> much<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.450> why<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:07.550> believe<00:02:08.550> that

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
course very much so why I believe that

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
course very much so why I believe that
it<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.319> take<00:02:10.470> one<00:02:10.770> person<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.550> help<00:02:11.760> any

little thing grow

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.610 
little thing grow
it<00:02:13.440> can<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:15.019> disease<00:02:16.019> that<00:02:16.049> just

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
