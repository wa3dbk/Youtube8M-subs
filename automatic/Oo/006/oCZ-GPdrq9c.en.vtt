 site gearbest here in such that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.540
 packaging came and everything why I opened 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.179
 This package is not on camera I think that this 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.400
 not from China opened and she came here in 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.300
 such a package and went to the stated 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.570
 from Ulyanovsk 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.939
 Here is such a opened or here was by 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.300
 Essentially sands the price it was open that is 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.890
 it turns out was open at customs 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.350
 that is, it is not me that has hidden it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 it was already open there lay a column 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.760
 photo gearbest as i understand something i 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.789
 opened at customs shepherd to them not 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.489
 I liked it and they stuck it in such 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.820
 here's a box and send waiting not 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.710
 Finnish they know what they think better in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.350
 comments if you had it so me 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.719
 first one to take such parcels 2 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.649
 there is something else there is the same 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.440
 let's look let's see what it is 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.820
 column we column grb 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.720
 It must be very interesting to us 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.689
 with light-music seems to be on there already 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.190
 Nothing stole this package to me either 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.170
 it seems that 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:23.370
 not from China so well, it seems but everything seems to be 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.020
 working here most accurately looks down 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.580
 broken principle here and so column 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.450
 cool should be a column 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.970
 I repeat with light music you can 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.780
 bluetooth seems to be connected by father yusbi 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.150
 here aux and flash drives will be on this whole 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:47.400
 a detailed review as we would not 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:50.340
 turn on look like here now 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.850
 in sight but I have done this detailed review 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.540
 but already understand something cool thing 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.950
 which from work let's turn off 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.979
 somehow you turned off 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.910
 Well, seemingly cool text columns 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.650
 in order to around 14 15 bucks 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.810
 so god 10 set there is nothing well 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.950
 decks on the column will be a detailed review 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.430
 so what are we waiting for now let's 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.560
 move on to this parcel I'll look for 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.040
 hide because it's impossible 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.989
 where is this honest opportunity 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.989
 video get out if it will 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.239
 package wrapped not from 6 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.880
 where is the other place so such here 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.900
 Well, I honestly have a shock when I saw 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.080
 in this parcel parcel from china there in 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.220
 honestly column I'm surprised 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.130
 let's open it in essence what is it 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.250
 it also grazes from China such an understanding 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.100
 I will not show this side here 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.550
 also written ticket and here is 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.550
 Peter 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:04.480
 yes dudes I honestly can not honestly 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.560
 understand how I understand shafts works 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:14.170
 wrapped here the same speaker a few 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:17.520
 who understand the battery in Chinese 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.110
 sometimes wise module in our direction 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.120
 I ordered one column from us 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.310
 the column was not provided free 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.130
 online gearbest store and how I 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.020
 I understand he did not accidentally put two 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.260
 speakers and both it does not work 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.330
 hiding or why they both send in 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.870
 such a box with open 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.050
 here are these honest packages i'm not 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:46.330
 know let's check this column this 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:48.310
 yes yes she also works yes what are they 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.800
 Here went up in a set but all this 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:56.110
 hardly honestly I am very much surprised 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.190
 probably will be deducted from the herbest 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.100
 color why went two columns 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.920
 well, it is interesting interesting sometimes the Chinese 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.440
 wise our way guys so 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.680
 It will probably be one of these speakers 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.970
 I already like the review because I already like it 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.070
 that when the kitchen speakers with light music with 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.830
 by all matters let us go once more 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:26.040
 he conquered tea from the world and pfp this whole 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:28.590
 beauty is there now everything is on fire 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.450
 at last 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:39.990
 but it will not catch fire or 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:42.570
 cool coloring that everything is beautiful so 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.910
 let's all understand for now 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.910
 something like this all matters all bye
