00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.230
 I'm talking about Spanish rap 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.299
 but we are 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:32.890
 we think about it 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.500
 but they do not have game as if all 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.500
 let's keep going 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.380
 of the world 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 the actions have visions 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.510
 Not me 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.280
 many of the facts tried but 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.280
 there is a lot of world 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.970
 these songs 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.390
 I'm traveling 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 ah 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.420
 they came to us 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.090
 this action 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:49.880
 others will spend doing people 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.770
 knowing about the business angels 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.200
 30 and a lot of why 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.679
 There are too many to be smiles and it is that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.679
 many times 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:09.320
 here is a music 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.320
 on the asphalt as the sack 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.230
 Carlos Casini these years 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.300
 patience of the friend 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.300
 I was mentioning 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.680
 Spain 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.680
 the things 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 yes 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.110
 ah 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.500
 with as many styles as mouths deals and 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.870
 loose pins look like rocks data that 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.390
 they focus their lives on this and thus breathe 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.120
 they write their anger and texts because where 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.890
 it hurts inspires same drinks have to 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.660
 the tier 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.970
 rather it is slower for the failure to 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.310
 that is not noticed because like then I am 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.360
 any kind if it's in solitude 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.360
 of the schools 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.380
 single 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.640
 for the community 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.620
 the most serious cities and only 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.620
 some the musical part 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.650
 boast many story 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.550
 by soil 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.900
