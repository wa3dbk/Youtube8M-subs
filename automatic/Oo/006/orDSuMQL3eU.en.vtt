00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 besides reducing 150 kilometers is the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.859
 that more people would link playing 6 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.179
 communities in its layout is a 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.759
 variable that increases its importance 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.639
 economic because those kilometers of 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.710
 asphalt would be more profitable than in 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.439
 other roads traveling great 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.840
 unpopulated distances let's do 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.609
 Pass a road through places where you do not 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.039
 nobody lives and where there is a 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.539
 lots of forests that we are going to affect and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.310
 that we will also allow as a 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.140
 tracing that goes from sabaneta to the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.380
 ramones wanted from sabaneta los ramones 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.760
 affecting some forests that are 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.920
 impressively diverse that are 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.059
 water reserves and allowing then 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.969
 that between subsistence agriculture 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 there so that also later between the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.510
 real estate speculation and donation 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.969
 three republic national parks 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.850
 Dominican way of jarabacoa vega 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.489
 it is in optimum condition equal to jarabacoa 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.980
 constanza and also the great work 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.140
 would be from constancy looking 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.809
 the peoples of the south the time of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.760
 existence that those roads have 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.850
 facilitates its reconstruction because it is not 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.189
 same as starting a new path 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.689
 best alternative to unite san juan 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.390
 of the maguana with santiago los 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.460
 gentlemen is to follow this path by 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.070
 where are we at this moment that is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.100
 leaving guayabal to connect with 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.470
 constanza at this point we are here 1350 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.810
 meters above mean sea ​​level and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.659
 we can see that the topography here is 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.210
 adequate but that geology is also 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.520
 appropriate because the rock is me 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.280
 theorized on surface which facilitates 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.259
 the cut from the heights is observed the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.039
 old way but practically in disuse 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.960
 because it is difficult to pick her up for being 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.909
 Dominican republic- part of an island 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.670
 makes this type of 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.920
 projects as the water sources more 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.600
 important in the country are born in the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 central cordillera 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.649
 taiwan has protected his system of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.360
 Mountain 50 percent of its 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.679
 territory is protected and that 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.289
 protection of a play to you not 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.170
 goes through these mountain systems of 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.750
 taiwan as the road is why that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.569
 experts insist that this is the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.480
 best option and categorically reject the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.430
 new road between san juan and santiago 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.890
 and I did not want to open that road to 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.840
 avoid environmental damage balaguer did not want 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.540
 open that highway for the same reason 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.140
 environmental don antonio guzmán tried 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.049
 do it in the period 78 82 but at 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.299
 final decided to listen to the clamor of the 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.430
 environmental community that stated that no 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.830
 the road opened up there without 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.989
 However, it is important to open new 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.269
 roads that increase the economy of 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.920
 country according to the vice president of 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.140
 the Dominican agribusiness board 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.030
 osmar benítez I agree that it 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.970
 do we also want to be 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.609
 do because that will revalue the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.799
 value of the land so that this way 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.170
 have its greatest effectiveness would it be that 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.569
 build 40 new kilometers between 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.379
 bohechío and guayabal going to the 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.430
 road that joins san juan with water are 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.709
 the same new kilometers of 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.540
 road that also going by 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.579
 sabaneta los ramones do not connect 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.060
 impoverished communities but that 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.129
 we connect we go through a forest 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.299
 unaltered and also to top it with 40 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.739
 kilometers that is exactly the same 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.240
 that we are raising from chivas 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.340
 constant then what is 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.170
 the justification we do not see or is I not 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.750
 I see the justification and I the former minister 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.520
 of environment frank moya pons affirmed 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.070
 that turning these roads into 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.260
 modern and safe roads you do not have to 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.470
 never talk about touching the mountain range 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.720
 central between san juan and santiago for
