 hello you again the portal will divorce 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.470
 2.2 and now we will understand 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.440
 simplest accompaniment 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.890
 which you can use dad when 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.650
 selection of any compositions and this 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.749
 Accompaniment in exactly simple 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.239
 it can even be used by 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.779
 Dashi child roughly speaking so let's 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.050
 we will understand first 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.019
 the easiest kind of accompaniment 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.019
 which you must have seen, and so this 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.970
 this accompaniment is based on 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.570
 three cases 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.250
 we have dealt with three cases 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.250
 lessons suffered building three cases 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.830
 this is extremely major 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.890
 his appeal 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.290
 with as you can see we take first in 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.270
 first need 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 third me too 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.340
 given if the child is very small not 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.560
 it is possible to fail 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 use just 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 the author and you squeegee on tunes 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.030
 center 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 percent 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 center 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.180
 that is, we understood that in his hand we do not have 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.180
 accompanied by 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 and in the right hand game of trivia 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.980
 Euro themes can be used different 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.470
 types but all 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.890
 that is, different types of accompaniment 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.199
 associated with the bouncy for example 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.199
 2 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.949
 that is, if he and the third news 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.949

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.139
 P 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.679
