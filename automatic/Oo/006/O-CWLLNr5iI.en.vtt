from each other I'll show you what I

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.200 
from each other I'll show you what I
mean<00:01:16.289> here<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> second<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:19.850> try<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
mean here in a second I try to get the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.850 
mean here in a second I try to get the
tips<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> them<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.909> even<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.150> also

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.950 

so<00:01:31.760> you<00:01:31.820> can<00:01:31.910> see<00:01:32.120> how<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.300> tails<00:01:32.600> have<00:01:32.930> a

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
so you can see how the tails have a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.270 
so you can see how the tails have a
slight<00:01:33.880> fork<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.180> them<00:01:35.330> they<00:01:35.570> splay<00:01:35.900> away

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
slight fork to them they splay away

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.870 
slight fork to them they splay away

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
that's what I meant by them splaying

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.420 
that's what I meant by them splaying
away<00:01:41.150> from<00:01:41.390> each<00:01:41.480> other<00:01:42.070> next<00:01:43.070> thing<00:01:43.280> we're
