it's actually an IDE drive and over here
is<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.420> 640<00:00:24.420> gigabyte<00:00:25.260> SATA<00:00:25.800> hard<00:00:26.099> drive<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.730> I

is a 640 gigabyte SATA hard drive that I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.880 
is a 640 gigabyte SATA hard drive that I
have<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:28.019> already<00:00:28.140> put<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> case

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
have and I already put it in the case

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.370 
have and I already put it in the case
here<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.670> case<00:00:29.970> itself<00:00:30.420> came<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:30.990> an<00:00:31.140> 80

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
page builders case from probably about

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.840 
page builders case from probably about
five<00:00:39.899> six<00:00:40.140> years<00:00:40.410> ago<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.670> nice

five six years ago and it's a nice
little<00:00:41.879> find<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> found<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> road<00:00:43.649> so

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
little find that I found on the road so

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.160 
little find that I found on the road so
what<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.879> gonna<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.989> move

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
what I'm gonna do here and just move

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.569 
what I'm gonna do here and just move
some<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.410> these<00:00:46.500> cords<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
some of these cords out of the way and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.600 
some of these cords out of the way and
my<00:00:48.480> power<00:00:48.870> supply<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> fit

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
my power supply here is going to fit

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
my power supply here is going to fit
into<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> back<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.379> mounts

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
into the back here and it just mounts

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.389 
into the back here and it just mounts
with<00:00:53.039> four<00:00:53.719> screws<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.160> shouldn't

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
with four screws here so that shouldn't

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
with four screws here so that shouldn't
be<00:00:56.579> too<00:00:56.760> difficult<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.530> place

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
be too difficult just put it in place

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.820 
be too difficult just put it in place
here

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.140 

and<00:01:05.830> I'm<00:01:06.070> gonna<00:01:06.159> screw<00:01:06.549> it<00:01:06.640> down<00:01:06.760> from<00:01:06.970> the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
and I'm gonna screw it down from the

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.810 
and I'm gonna screw it down from the
back<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:07.990> have<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.170> bunch<00:01:08.409> of<00:01:08.590> these

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
back and I have a bunch of these

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.300 
back and I have a bunch of these
computer<00:01:09.820> screws<00:01:10.600> on<00:01:11.440> hand<00:01:11.890> so<00:01:12.100> I'm<00:01:12.159> just

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
computer screws on hand so I'm just

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.430 
computer screws on hand so I'm just
going<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.460> use<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.640> lot<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:12.940> these<00:01:13.180> when<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.140> build

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
going to use a lot of these when I build

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.210 
going to use a lot of these when I build
this<00:01:14.619> this<00:01:15.100> pc<00:01:16.030> this<00:01:16.270> kind<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.780> Franken<00:01:17.500> PC<00:01:17.950> or

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
this this pc this kind of Franken PC or

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.020 
this this pc this kind of Franken PC or
this<00:01:18.430> salvaged<00:01:19.420> parts<00:01:19.869> PC<00:01:20.830> now<00:01:21.580> if<00:01:21.850> you're

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
this salvaged parts PC now if you're

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.149 
this salvaged parts PC now if you're
actually<00:01:22.450> interested<00:01:23.050> in<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.409> step-by-step

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
actually interested in a step-by-step

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.859 
actually interested in a step-by-step
process<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.600> how<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.229> build<00:01:26.649> a<00:01:26.920> PC<00:01:27.460> I<00:01:27.759> have<00:01:28.479> a

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
process of how to build a PC I have a

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.380 
process of how to build a PC I have a
series<00:01:29.470> of<00:01:29.500> videos<00:01:29.979> up<00:01:30.369> on<00:01:30.490> my<00:01:30.700> channel<00:01:31.180> where

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
series of videos up on my channel where

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.060 
series of videos up on my channel where
you<00:01:31.509> can<00:01:31.540> actually<00:01:31.840> see<00:01:32.380> how<00:01:32.560> I<00:01:32.590> put<00:01:32.950> together

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
you can actually see how I put together

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.310 
you can actually see how I put together
a<00:01:33.549> state-of-the-art<00:01:34.210> PC<00:01:34.750> which<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:35.110> built

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
a state-of-the-art PC which I built

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.740 
a state-of-the-art PC which I built
around<00:01:35.710> this<00:01:35.979> time<00:01:36.250> last<00:01:36.580> year<00:01:36.759> I'll<00:01:37.479> put<00:01:37.720> a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
around this time last year I'll put a

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.080 
around this time last year I'll put a
link<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.229> at<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.679> end<00:01:38.800> of<00:01:38.920> this<00:01:39.039> video<00:01:39.369> so

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
link to that at the end of this video so

00:01:40.090 --> 00:02:05.430 
link to that at the end of this video so
let's<00:01:40.240> get<00:01:40.390> started<00:02:03.899> here's<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.020> motherboard

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
let's get started here's the motherboard

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.190 
let's get started here's the motherboard
I'm<00:02:05.590> going<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:05.920> use<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:06.580> an<00:02:06.819> AMD<00:02:07.149> dual<00:02:07.810> core

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
I'm going to use it's an AMD dual core

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.400 
I'm going to use it's an AMD dual core
Athlon<00:02:08.890> processor<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:10.330> an<00:02:10.420> older<00:02:10.690> processor

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
Athlon processor it's an older processor

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.650 
Athlon processor it's an older processor
but<00:02:11.590> at<00:02:11.680> least<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.040> dual<00:02:12.370> core<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.630> think

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
but at least it is dual core and I think

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.309 
but at least it is dual core and I think
it's<00:02:14.020> clocked<00:02:14.410> at<00:02:15.540> 2.3<00:02:16.540> gigahertz<00:02:16.569> I<00:02:17.170> don't

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
it's clocked at 2.3 gigahertz I don't

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.330 
it's clocked at 2.3 gigahertz I don't
know<00:02:17.380> I'll<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.650> check<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.040> out<00:02:18.099> when<00:02:18.280> I

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
know I'll have to check it out when I

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.059 
know I'll have to check it out when I
actually<00:02:18.550> turn<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.599> machine<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:20.980> is

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
actually turn the machine on but this is

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.800 
actually turn the machine on but this is
the<00:02:21.160> motherboard<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.700> already<00:02:21.879> has<00:02:22.090> RAM<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.660> it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the motherboard it already has RAM in it

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.290 
the motherboard it already has RAM in it
and<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.230> has<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.890> heatsink<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.580> fan<00:02:24.670> on<00:02:25.120> it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
and it has the heatsink and fan on it

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.630 
and it has the heatsink and fan on it
and<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.840> actual<00:02:26.560> processor<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.340> already

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
and the actual processor is already

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.559 
and the actual processor is already
installed<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.300> it

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
installed in it

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.119 
installed in it
the<00:02:28.900> only<00:02:29.050> thing<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.290> does<00:02:29.440> not<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.099> does

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
the only thing it does not have it does

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.000 
the only thing it does not have it does
not<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.580> an<00:02:30.700> i/o<00:02:30.879> shield<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.500> I'm<00:02:32.890> just

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
not have an i/o shield on it so I'm just

00:02:33.010 --> 00:03:11.300 
not have an i/o shield on it so I'm just
going<00:02:33.129> to<00:02:33.220> have<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.459> leave<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.940> as<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.420> is

power supply cords into all the
components<00:03:19.480> here<00:03:43.740> ok<00:03:44.740> now<00:03:44.770> it's<00:03:45.130> time<00:03:45.190> to

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
components here ok now it's time to

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.800 
components here ok now it's time to
connect<00:03:45.910> some<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.210> these<00:03:46.270> things<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.690> the

that's attach the floppy drive which

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.990 
that's attach the floppy drive which
I'll<00:04:23.290> probably<00:04:23.410> never<00:04:23.680> use<00:04:23.800> but<00:04:24.580> attach<00:04:24.820> the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
I'll probably never use but attach the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.700 
I'll probably never use but attach the
floppy<00:04:25.330> drive<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.020> motherboard<00:04:26.140> and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710
