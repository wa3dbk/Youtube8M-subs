00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.090
 all 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.990
 I'm back later 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.719
 very long 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.000
 without a pardon me very thesis of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.730
 graduate family problems in the middle 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.490
 so I had a little set aside 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.169
 but here is a bit of work 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.829
 I wanted to share with you what 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.779
 I had done in this period I am then 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:35.160
 so in reality there have been so many 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.830
 attempts and then it is discarded however this is 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.449
 the one that has combined the 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:45.750
 first the first model and this 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:49.580
 very simple then it is the first time 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.640
 that embedded in the processing of 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.559
 in short, swarovski cords 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.510
 I found myself quite well 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.640
 started a simple process 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.720
 as you see to take a moment 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.010
 hand and then in the center there is a pearl in 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.220
 quartz rose quartz that has been donated 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.810
 so I don't know the precise measurement 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 but I think it's between 10 12 mm 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.189
 then, as stated, we are there 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.909
 pink kittens 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:28.200
 let's say a pink more intense pink a little 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.240
 always lighter two saucers and the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 processing because they are 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.020
 broken down to the thing can simpler and 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.929
 this swarovski cord that the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.079
 version we say on the site about that 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.390
 purchased there were two versions one 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.119
 people a little clearer than this we say 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.109
 a crystal while this is the version a 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.420
 slightly darker and then we have two 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:58.530
 quiet and very famous spring onions 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.590
 4 mm pink Chinese crystals lined 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.810
 behind with the fake Alcantara in this 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.259
 edge case and this is the earring 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.659
 nun nothing special 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.680
 this is the simplest model 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:18.890
 simple but not with time or much 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.969
 particular and this is an onyx disc 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:28.430
 as you see from the faceted light of 14 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:32.150
 mm the plates are black grease agent 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.639
 of course there are tube taxes 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.980
 that I bought at the fair 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.260
 of craftsmanship in Florence I had 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.129
 fact convinced but then if I'm wrong 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.129
 deleted 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.319
 they are irregular so they don't have one 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.450
 precise length 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.450
 frankly I don't even know I believe 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.569
 be around 5 mm to see them so ad 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:02.330
 eye and others to say are in onyx 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:06.530
 always black 4 mm of course lined 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:10.370
 as for the part that sv 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.410
 remains covered in front of the processing and 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.720
 I put the clip hooked 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.510
 however it is a nice effect 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.360
 to the ear because of this whole curve 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.670
 following the proper lines of the lobe 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.849
 of the ear therefore is particular 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:33.290
 this I really like very aggressive is 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:36.980
 this is where these super super colors 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.280
 super flamboyant summer looks the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.730
 mine wanted us because I wanted some 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.510
 indulge me with colors then for 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:52.489
 regarding the central part that is 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:57.920
 this one we have a drop in 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:04:01.010
 blue mother of pearl than a 20 x 15 mm then 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:07.810
 there are metal conteries on the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:12.459
 below which is a 60 or a mosquito ok 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.459
 continuous and metallic 60 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:24.530
 then various beads of different colors 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:27.230
 these are celestial gold and gilded are 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.940
 Synthetic beads of 4 mm do not have 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.490
 no value 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.680
 these very small beads are these 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.040
 a 15 0 that I always bought at 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.430
 craft show I am a 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.520
 very beautiful very dark turquoise 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.340
 they look almost like oil green 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:52.400
 then we have a half crystal this is 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:56.980
 in metallic bronze 4 mm color 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:05.660
 always and then in the overlying part 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:10.300
 oh my God it's like half a crystal 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:14.450
 light bronze with beads 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.570
 surrounding 11 0 metallic or you like it 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.200
 it was targeted infinta alcantara ho 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.990
 searched and now this is all I hope 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.850
 to come back maybe if I can record 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:32.720
 a tutorial also of these 22 maybe 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:35.000
 simpler earrings however they are 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.880
 still very nice very beautiful 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.500
 they have a nice effect on me though they are 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.979
 also very simple simple to 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.640
 I realize therefore I will do precisely 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.800
 a tutorial soon thank you and 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.090
 I send a kiss to everyone and I hope to 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.630
 see you soon 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.630
