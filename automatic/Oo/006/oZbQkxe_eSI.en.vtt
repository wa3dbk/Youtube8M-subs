calwa<00:03:14.700> never<00:03:15.209> does<00:03:15.620> but<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.859> seems<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.280> make

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
calwa never does but it seems to make

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.920 
calwa never does but it seems to make
sense<00:03:17.519> why<00:03:17.940> he<00:03:17.970> would<00:03:18.239> be<00:03:18.329> hanging<00:03:18.540> out<00:03:18.750> with

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
sense why he would be hanging out with

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.210 
sense why he would be hanging out with
this<00:03:19.049> girl<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.560> he<00:03:19.650> could<00:03:19.799> find<00:03:20.010> her<00:03:20.129> in

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
this girl so that he could find her in

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.640 
this girl so that he could find her in
the<00:03:20.310> game<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.790> kill<00:03:21.450> her<00:03:21.660> why<00:03:21.959> he<00:03:22.200> wants<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.530> do

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
the game and kill her why he wants to do

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.650 
the game and kill her why he wants to do
this<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:23.069> don't<00:03:23.609> know<00:03:23.819> like<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.239> said<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:24.630> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
this I don't know like I said in the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.659 
this I don't know like I said in the
last<00:03:24.870> episode<00:03:25.109> review<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.950> actual<00:03:26.190> intro

of the show when you actually see like

the imagery of her hanging out on the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.539 
the imagery of her hanging out on the
the<00:03:30.510> playground<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.380> get<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.650> see<00:03:31.680> Sheen

kawa<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.090> there<00:03:33.269> at<00:03:33.359> least<00:03:33.510> that's<00:03:33.660> who<00:03:33.750> I

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
kawa is there at least that's who I

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.780 
kawa is there at least that's who I
think<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.590> mean<00:03:35.099> it<00:03:35.190> looks<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.579> like

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
think it is I mean it looks just like

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.849 
think it is I mean it looks just like
him<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.239> see<00:03:36.780> death<00:03:37.019> gone<00:03:37.260> there<00:03:37.500> as<00:03:37.650> well

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
him and you see death gone there as well

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.259 
him and you see death gone there as well
and<00:03:38.099> I<00:03:38.160> imagine<00:03:38.340> that's<00:03:38.700> either<00:03:38.849> literally

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
and I imagine that's either literally

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.059 
and I imagine that's either literally
him<00:03:39.630> or<00:03:39.930> like<00:03:40.079> he<00:03:40.260> was<00:03:40.380> actually<00:03:40.500> killed<00:03:40.889> by

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
him or like he was actually killed by

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.920 
him or like he was actually killed by
him<00:03:41.280> or<00:03:41.430> something<00:03:41.819> I'm<00:03:42.480> not<00:03:42.660> really<00:03:42.810> sure

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
him or something I'm not really sure

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.180 
him or something I'm not really sure
what<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.230> take<00:03:43.380> from<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:43.829> really

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
what to take from this it's really

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.610 
what to take from this it's really
confusing<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:44.880> i<00:03:44.940> imagine<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.750> Sheen<00:03:46.230> kawa

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
confusing but i imagine that Sheen kawa

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.890 
confusing but i imagine that Sheen kawa
is<00:03:46.769> probably<00:03:47.310> death<00:03:47.639> gun<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.209> he's<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:48.660> sort

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
is probably death gun and he's just sort

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.890 
is probably death gun and he's just sort
of<00:03:48.959> like<00:03:49.430> bringing<00:03:50.430> shino<00:03:51.180> along<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.780> this

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
of like bringing shino along on this

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.629 
of like bringing shino along on this
like<00:03:52.079> weird<00:03:52.290> little<00:03:52.560> trip<00:03:52.829> before<00:03:52.980> he<00:03:53.280> kills

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
like weird little trip before he kills

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.580 
like weird little trip before he kills
her<00:03:53.849> which<00:03:54.060> i<00:03:54.180> think<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.480> really<00:03:55.109> messed<00:03:55.380> up

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
her which i think is really messed up

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.470 
her which i think is really messed up
and<00:03:55.859> it<00:03:56.340> certainly<00:03:56.519> adds<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:57.090> brand<00:03:57.359> new

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and it certainly adds a brand new

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.599 
and it certainly adds a brand new
dynamic<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.109> this<00:03:58.380> because<00:03:58.590> obviously<00:03:59.010> the

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
dynamic to this because obviously the

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.039 
dynamic to this because obviously the
story<00:03:59.849> in<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.090> one<00:04:00.269> is<00:04:00.419> not<00:04:00.599> that<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.840> lot<00:04:01.019> of

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
story in this one is not that a lot of

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.170 
story in this one is not that a lot of
people<00:04:01.139> are<00:04:01.470> trapped<00:04:01.739> into<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.040> game<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:02.669> that

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
people are trapped into a game it's that

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.819 
people are trapped into a game it's that
someone<00:04:03.569> just<00:04:03.720> has<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.079> ability<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.650> kill

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
someone just has this ability to kill

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.800 
someone just has this ability to kill
people<00:04:04.980> within<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:06.419> is<00:04:06.540> something

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
people within it and that is something

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.240 
people within it and that is something
that<00:04:06.930> will<00:04:07.169> differentiate<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.980> from<00:04:08.010> the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
that will differentiate it from the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.039 
that will differentiate it from the
other<00:04:08.340> seasons<00:04:08.790> what's<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.209> rundown<00:04:09.629> on<00:04:09.690> this

color<00:06:10.500> but<00:06:11.190> she<00:06:11.520> seems<00:06:11.729> obviously<00:06:12.180> much<00:06:12.390> more

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
color but she seems obviously much more

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.300 
color but she seems obviously much more
timid<00:06:12.840> in<00:06:13.080> real<00:06:13.200> life<00:06:13.410> but<00:06:13.440> that<00:06:13.800> makes<00:06:14.010> sense

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
timid in real life but that makes sense

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.950 
timid in real life but that makes sense
so<00:06:14.700> all<00:06:14.880> in<00:06:15.060> all<00:06:15.120> I<00:06:15.180> thought<00:06:15.450> this<00:06:15.600> was<00:06:15.720> another

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
so all in all I thought this was another

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.990 
so all in all I thought this was another
great<00:06:16.320> episode<00:06:16.500> of<00:06:16.979> sword<00:06:17.250> art<00:06:17.340> online<00:06:17.460> they
