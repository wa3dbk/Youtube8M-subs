this off of this in the future I can

firing<00:01:50.310> these<00:01:50.640> sutures<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.329> think<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.719> she

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
firing these sutures I think that she

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.620 
firing these sutures I think that she
had<00:01:51.929> a<00:01:51.959> terrific<00:01:52.409> repair<00:01:53.359> valve<00:01:54.359> at<00:01:54.599> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
had a terrific repair valve at the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
had a terrific repair valve at the
junction<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.319> esophagus<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.950> stomach<00:01:56.159> I

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
junction of the esophagus and stomach I

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.880 
junction of the esophagus and stomach I
believe<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.509> she's<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.929> her<00:01:58.079> way<00:01:58.110> back<00:01:58.229> they

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890

chocolate fatty fried foods because that
makes<00:03:58.569> it<00:03:58.720> worse<00:03:58.930> so<00:03:59.310> walk<00:04:00.310> us<00:04:00.340> through<00:04:00.580> this

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
makes it worse so walk us through this

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.500 
makes it worse so walk us through this
animation<00:04:01.540> or<00:04:01.989> how<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:02.500> do<00:04:02.920> this<00:04:03.390> all<00:04:04.390> right

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
animation or how you do this all right

animation or how you do this all right
so<00:04:04.720> we<00:04:05.349> use<00:04:05.739> this<00:04:05.860> device<00:04:06.040> here<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:07.030> goes

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
so we use this device here and it goes

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.320 
so we use this device here and it goes
over<00:04:07.420> an<00:04:07.660> endoscope<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:09.150> endoscope<00:04:10.150> is

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
over an endoscope and the endoscope is

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.820 
over an endoscope and the endoscope is
used<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.750> visualize<00:04:11.140> everything<00:04:11.590> we're<00:04:11.739> going

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
used to visualize everything we're going

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
horrible effects if you've taken them

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.870 
horrible effects if you've taken them
for<00:04:46.930> more<00:04:47.110> than<00:04:47.260> five<00:04:47.410> years<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:48.520> that<00:04:48.700> is<00:04:48.850> a

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
for more than five years so that is a

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.460 
for more than five years so that is a
probably<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.539> clear-cut<00:04:49.840> point<00:04:50.320> when<00:04:50.440> people

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
probably a clear-cut point when people

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.380 
probably a clear-cut point when people
should<00:04:50.830> start<00:04:51.130> thinking<00:04:51.280> about<00:04:51.550> maybe

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
should start thinking about maybe

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.210 
should start thinking about maybe
getting<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.780> procedure<00:04:53.140> an<00:04:53.680> outpatient

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
getting a procedure an outpatient

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.590 
getting a procedure an outpatient
procedure<00:04:54.310> takes<00:04:54.760> about<00:04:54.820> an<00:04:55.030> hour<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.240> a<00:04:55.360> half

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
procedure takes about an hour and a half

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.390 
procedure takes about an hour and a half
so<00:04:56.140> you're<00:04:56.260> basically<00:04:56.380> reinforcing<00:04:57.280> that

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
so you're basically reinforcing that

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.969 
so you're basically reinforcing that
valve<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:57.940> if<00:04:58.030> food<00:04:58.210> goes<00:04:58.450> down<00:04:58.780> not<00:04:59.650> back<00:04:59.950> up

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
valve so if food goes down not back up

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.500 
valve so if food goes down not back up
what's<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.640> success<00:05:00.910> rate<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.330> this

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
what's the success rate of this

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.060 
what's the success rate of this
procedure<00:05:01.900> well<00:05:02.169> ninety<00:05:02.500> one<00:05:02.620> percent<00:05:02.770> of

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
procedure well ninety one percent of

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.590 
procedure well ninety one percent of
people<00:05:03.100> can<00:05:03.460> get<00:05:03.610> off<00:05:03.760> of<00:05:03.789> their<00:05:04.000> medications

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
people can get off of their medications

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.840 
people can get off of their medications
and<00:05:04.720> stay<00:05:04.900> off<00:05:05.110> of<00:05:05.140> it<00:05:05.740> in<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:06.010> long<00:05:06.160> term<00:05:06.520> so

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
and stay off of it in the long term so

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.000 
and stay off of it in the long term so
we<00:05:06.940> could<00:05:07.090> get<00:05:07.210> most<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.289> people<00:05:08.440> cured<00:05:08.890> of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
we could get most of the people cured of

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.800 
we could get most of the people cured of
this<00:05:09.160> problem<00:05:10.000> they<00:05:10.330> don't<00:05:10.390> have<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:10.630> take<00:05:10.780> a

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
this problem they don't have to take a

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.890 
this problem they don't have to take a
pill<00:05:11.110> once<00:05:11.800> or<00:05:11.979> twice<00:05:12.160> a<00:05:12.220> day<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:12.850> a<00:05:13.720> lot<00:05:13.870> of

these<00:05:14.080> pills<00:05:14.860> pretty<00:05:15.760> much<00:05:15.880> keep<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.150> on<00:05:16.360> them
