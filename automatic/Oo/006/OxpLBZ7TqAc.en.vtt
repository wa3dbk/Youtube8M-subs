00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.240 
um and I just discovered a awesome
glitch<00:00:06.330> that's<00:00:07.049> it<00:00:07.259> over<00:00:07.770> there

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
glitch that's it over there

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.160 
glitch that's it over there
it's<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.840> piston<00:00:10.400> front<00:00:11.400> face<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:12.509> all<00:00:12.840> sides

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
it's the piston front face on all sides

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.039 
it's the piston front face on all sides
it's<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:14.370> part<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.420> thing

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
it's that part it's that thing

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.250 
it's that part it's that thing
so<00:00:18.830> yeah<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.449> gonna<00:00:21.630> show<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.900> how<00:00:22.230> to

rock off yeah takes a win rock on come
on<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.200> time<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.590> us<00:00:37.710> again<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
on for that one time to us again and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:48.340 
on for that one time to us again and
hand<00:00:38.820> you're<00:00:39.000> done<00:00:43.550> I'll<00:00:44.550> go<00:00:44.789> walk<00:00:45.420> off

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.529 

sometimes<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.530> glitches<00:00:49.770> only<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:53.539> what

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
sometimes of glitches only so what

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.479 
sometimes of glitches only so what
happens<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.940> don't<00:00:56.940> place<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.239> there

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
happens if you don't place it there

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:12.140 
happens if you don't place it there
nothing<00:00:59.600> nothing<00:01:00.600> no<00:01:01.670> so

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:23.210 

see<00:01:13.050> there<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.800> is<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:17.630> yeah<00:01:19.100> okay<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.680> I'll

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
see there it is so yeah okay so I'll

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.240 
see there it is so yeah okay so I'll
show<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.970> how<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> build<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.460> but<00:01:26.460> first<00:01:27.170> I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
show you how to build it but first I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
show you how to build it but first I
want<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.360> explain<00:01:30.360> why<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.380> works<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:36.440> wait<00:01:37.440> no

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
want to explain why it works so wait no

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.200 
want to explain why it works so wait no
that<00:01:37.860> needs<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.580> be

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
that needs to be

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.320 
that needs to be
I<00:01:40.130> need<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.160> lever<00:01:41.540> yeah<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.930> clever<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:44.330> is

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
I need a lever yeah so clever that is

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.300 
I need a lever yeah so clever that is
actually<00:01:46.080> powering<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.620> piston<00:01:47.010> but<00:01:47.160> it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
actually powering the piston but it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.290 
actually powering the piston but it
needs<00:01:47.490> an<00:01:47.640> update

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
needs an update

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.240 
needs an update
so<00:01:49.050> if<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:50.340> piston<00:01:51.090> updates<00:01:52.080> another<00:01:52.590> piston

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
so if a piston updates another piston

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.360 
so if a piston updates another piston
and<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:54.420> gets<00:01:54.660> pushed<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.410> creates<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.070> glitchy

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
and it gets pushed it creates a glitchy

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:08.000 
and it gets pushed it creates a glitchy
block<00:01:57.140> like<00:01:58.140> that<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.660> obviously<00:02:07.110> do

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
block like that so you can obviously do

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.570 
block like that so you can obviously do
that<00:02:08.250> by<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.910> having<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.510> a<00:02:09.570> button<00:02:10.050> here

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
that by just having like a button here

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.720 
that by just having like a button here
you<00:02:11.580> press<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:15.800> but<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.920> glitches<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.520> like

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
you press it but it glitches up like

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.650 
you press it but it glitches up like
this

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.870 

you<00:02:23.660> have<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.870> have<00:02:23.990> perfect<00:02:24.560> ink<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.760> when<00:02:31.760> it

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
you have to have perfect ink and when it

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.790 
you have to have perfect ink and when it
gets<00:02:31.970> up<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.210> 12<00:02:32.630> blocks<00:02:35.170> that's<00:02:36.170> what<00:02:36.410> happens

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
gets up to 12 blocks that's what happens

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.710 
gets up to 12 blocks that's what happens
you<00:02:36.920> have<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.160> have<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> piston<00:02:37.910> pushing<00:02:38.540> it

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
you have to have a piston pushing it

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.650 
you have to have a piston pushing it
another<00:02:39.140> way<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:41.440> yeah<00:02:42.850> this<00:02:43.850> is<00:02:43.910> quite<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.450> lot

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
another way so yeah this is quite a lot

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.750 
another way so yeah this is quite a lot
you<00:02:44.690> can<00:02:45.020> build<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.410> house<00:02:45.590> out<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:46.460> I'm

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
you can build a house out of it so I'm

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.260 
you can build a house out of it so I'm
gonna<00:02:46.880> show<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.090> how<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.330> build<00:02:47.480> it

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
gonna show you how to build it

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.650 
gonna show you how to build it
do-do-do-do-do-do

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
do-do-do-do-do-do

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.130 
do-do-do-do-do-do
so<00:02:51.320> yeah<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:52.010> take<00:02:52.270> like<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:56.140> you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
so yeah you take like that and that you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.870 
so yeah you take like that and that you
have<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.350> dig<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> hole<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.190> ground<00:02:58.460> or

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
have to dig a hole in the ground or

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.930 
have to dig a hole in the ground or
it'll<00:02:59.270> realize<00:02:59.720> that<00:03:00.020> it's<00:03:00.140> getting<00:03:00.380> power

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
it'll realize that it's getting power

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.020 
it'll realize that it's getting power
you<00:03:01.940> can<00:03:02.120> put<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:03.680> yeah<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.340> put<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.760> glass

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
you can put it yeah you can put a glass

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.050 
you can put it yeah you can put a glass
block<00:03:05.450> there<00:03:05.750> put<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.290> glass<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:10.130> then<00:03:10.700> you're

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
block there put a glass and then you're

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.540 
block there put a glass and then you're
going<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.390> have<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.840> have<00:03:12.070> something<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.280> power

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
going to have to have something to power

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.090 
going to have to have something to power
these<00:03:14.000> blocks<00:03:17.890> yeah

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
these blocks yeah

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.010 
these blocks yeah
powers<00:03:19.400> you'll<00:03:19.970> have<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.270> have<00:03:20.420> power<00:03:20.720> source

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
powers you'll have to have power source

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:30.780 
powers you'll have to have power source
so<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:22.450> grab<00:03:23.450> some<00:03:23.720> redstone<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:27.250> yeah
