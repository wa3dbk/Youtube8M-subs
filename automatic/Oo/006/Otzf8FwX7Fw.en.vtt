00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.170
 now yes valentina and good mirror of a 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.890
 my friend 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.120
 and I wanted to say some words to him 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.460
 abuse 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.130
 some girls who criticize violet 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.510
 grace all the cinemas and their speakers 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:35.150
 that light in two or three chapters and it 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.130
 they say there this series I do not like I'm going to 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.620
 make me from youtube because I feel like 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.080
 or I bother you in heat, I'm telling you 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.640
 a decline not centuries where yes what 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.640
 say the ones from here 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.070
 nothing bad 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.410
 but good if you want to say at least 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.960
 flirting with a hug looking at the 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.600
 another two or three weeks 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.909
 violeta assumes that thiago has not 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 liked it is good to think what you think 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.990
 but it's not just an internet day 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.710
 there are also some things that do have 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.790
 reasons 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.970
 what they all look very rosita but for a 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.950
 reason this is called violet the box 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.650
 is violet or think about it too 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.130
 they had something changed and that's very 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.430
 good 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.110
 so either think it have they have 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.729
 to think about something that does not have the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.750
 brain because that would be very useless 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.750
 it would be fourth 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.640
 so some more things also have 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.890
 I trace the girls who say that a 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.360
 girl especially does not show it a 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.550
 bunch of videos explaining any 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.750
 thing 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:02.030
 Kim says that the bad always have or 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.050
 they are blonde redheads but in free 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.050
 supposes that the bad one does not 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:14.800
 the bad is not the bad thing was before 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.090
 that was blonde crying 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.190
 No, it's not blond. Estella understands 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.780
 the black hair so this has nothing 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.090
 what to do with this so come with 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.610
 violet look at me I love tell you it's 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.170
 well to the concert in the grounds as 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.920
 my friend all that is, but I hope that 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.190
 at least for that to criticize 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.130
 violet see it the first season and not 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.590
 use insults 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.140
 that is, I am your mom to tell you 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.670
 that have to be 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.670
 all open but 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.879
 I say no 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.120
 think about it, have a reason to say 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.760

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.870

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.920
 well i mean I love violet not 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.790
 I have nothing against although I know always 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.740
 but although always 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.490
 protagonists have to be very cute 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.069
 but good 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.440
 that's how we have them 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.080
 have 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.690
 those we know also in a girl 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.690
