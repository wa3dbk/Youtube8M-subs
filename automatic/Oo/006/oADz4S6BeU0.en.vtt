because<00:01:03.059> Karim<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> carbon<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.960> freely

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
because Karim is the carbon is freely

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.950 
because Karim is the carbon is freely
available<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.220> very<00:01:05.430> cheap<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.570> metal

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
available it's very cheap but if a metal

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
available it's very cheap but if a metal
is<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.200> reduced<00:01:07.560> by<00:01:07.740> carbon<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:08.280> calcium<00:01:08.460> is

is not reduced by carbon when calcium is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.410 
is not reduced by carbon when calcium is
you<00:01:08.820> easy<00:01:09.590> now<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:10.920> calcium<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.670> barium

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you easy now so this calcium and barium

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.359 
you easy now so this calcium and barium
they<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.020> their<00:01:13.619> hurry<00:01:13.950> reacted<00:01:14.280> with

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
they have their hurry reacted with

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
they have their hurry reacted with
oxygen<00:01:14.460> nitrogen<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.780> high<00:01:15.990> temperature<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
oxygen nitrogen at high temperature so I

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460

used<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.240> remove<00:01:22.200> air<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:22.950> react

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
used to remove air because they react

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.160 
used to remove air because they react
with<00:01:23.340> oxygen<00:01:23.490> nitrogen<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.869> consume

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
with oxygen nitrogen and they consume

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.210 
with oxygen nitrogen and they consume
nitrogen<00:01:25.590> oxygen<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> radium<00:01:28.979> salt
