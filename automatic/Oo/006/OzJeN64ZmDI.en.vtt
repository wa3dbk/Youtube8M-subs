00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.540
 good afternoon, this is elena terehova 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.950
 today is August 13 our work on 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 we dig up potatoes in the garden 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.580
 we get rid of the beds and that they 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.779
 not empty need something to come up with them 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.550
 plant plant something but here i am 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.090
 this season for the first time 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.550
 I plant such a plant as a Japanese 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.120
 daikon radish 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.300
 what comes of it let's see it 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.480
 a cup under the glasses of me rosado 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.670
 Rosado literally here recently sowed 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.680
 draft in the north in August 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 here is literally in each such here 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.219
 marked the territory under each 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.000
 a small depression lay down one by one 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.230
 sunflower seed 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.280
 and now this daikon ascends like 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.729
 radish is covered with glasses because 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.880
 we were hot first week before even 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.430
 Up to 30 degrees came and now sharply 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.330
 only 15 degrees became cold 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.439
 in the morning there was also that our friends slugs 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.570
 and snails do not spoil us this thing 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.259
 everything is closed in my cups part 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.520
 Of course, but some simply sowed if necessary 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.150
 will see if it is big as 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.810
 the pictures show big big 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.810
 big 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.909
 then we produce external here at 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.720
 I have planted Beijing cabbage once 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:50.220
 Peking cabbage sprouts come to life 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.970
 f1 several different varieties too 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.009
 try 1 paradise for the first time autumn landing all 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.650
 They say that it grows well but 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.300
 let's see 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.790
 Of course, the seedlings grew very quickly 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.260
 was also planted only sown in 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.430
 August and today I have her 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.140
 sit on the place where we are 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.680
 dug up here literally today I 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.400
 dug up potatoes here specifically from these 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.270
 two rows of chick from one row here 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.860
 is taken very simply the hole 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.830
 and I do not pour water there because 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.230
 wet cheese and rain was to keep the roots not 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.680
 eroded neatly like this 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.520
 stand and she feels nothing with 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.000
 one heaven 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.090
 hit so to speak another here 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.670
 fine will settle down here for sure 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:48.730
 I also planted that row yesterday and 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:52.600
 here she stands fine here and then when 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:57.640
 All planted in the same way we take and 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:03.970
 water the soil itself compacted how much 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:09.010
 and it is necessary and the plant will grow here and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:12.580
 we will wait for Beijing cabbage to grow 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.270
 but the rest is the remnants of the tomato we clean 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.459
 here we have 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:22.270
 small chard it even went he 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.070
 seeds came up here beets and here's another 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.590
 chard crossed the glasses what I 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.250
 showed what changes we have 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.830
 there is a bed of cucumber 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.920
 so I specially opened the film 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.410
 the film of us is constantly closed as i have 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.900
 He said ridges and in this I still have 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.560
 eggplants planted 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.580
 here look our friends eggplant 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.600
 fees and how it feels 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.480
 Here's up from this garden I do not know said 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.100
 No, we have already collected about 125 kilograms 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.970
 cucumbers here they are all 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:08.390
 green pretty foliage upstairs 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.620

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.690
 we hope so of course well and here are ours 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.770
 eggplant course if it was 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.220
 single bed 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.810
 they would feel different nora 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.490
 but then crowded well not mad place 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.680
 we do not have too much so he has to 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:35.200
 tight but growing and already even tell you 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.450
 so funny different small and bigger 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.180
 their me too a bullet barking so they considered 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.610
 that started because everyone was in bloom 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.950
 the flowers were blooming and the fruit was not well and then 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:51.200

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.050
