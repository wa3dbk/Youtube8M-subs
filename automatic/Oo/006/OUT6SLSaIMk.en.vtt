trying<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> would<00:00:56.250> recommend<00:00:56.610> trying<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
trying out I would recommend trying to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.549 
trying out I would recommend trying to
say<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.239> play<00:00:57.420> advanced<00:00:57.870> warfare<00:00:58.230> now

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
say if you do play advanced warfare now

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.900 
say if you do play advanced warfare now
as<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> always<00:00:58.920> say<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> would<00:00:59.520> only<00:00:59.699> recommend

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
as I always say I would only recommend

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.369 
as I always say I would only recommend
using<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> private<00:01:01.020> match<00:01:01.170> with

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
using this in a private match with

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.139 
using this in a private match with
friends<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.219> reason<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.000> because

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
friends the reason for this is because

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.340 
friends the reason for this is because
if<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.539> pull<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.840> off<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.229> online

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
if you do pull this off in an online

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
if you do pull this off in an online
game<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.369> chance<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.729> players<00:01:06.030> will

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
game there is a chance that players will

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.670 
game there is a chance that players will
report<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.960> obviously<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
report you and obviously you know you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.960 
report you and obviously you know you
have<00:01:07.799> an<00:01:07.890> unfair<00:01:08.010> advantage<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.670> everything

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
have an unfair advantage and everything

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
have an unfair advantage and everything
so<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.360> would<00:01:09.689> only<00:01:09.810> recommend<00:01:09.990> using<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
so I would only recommend using it in

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.929 
so I would only recommend using it in
private<00:01:10.920> matches<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
private matches and that is all I you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.219 
private matches and that is all I you
know<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> recommend<00:01:12.600> doing<00:01:13.080> with

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
