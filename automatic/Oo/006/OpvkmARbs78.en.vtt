00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.600 

I<00:00:12.200> think<00:00:13.200> one<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.500> most<00:00:13.590> pressing<00:00:14.160> issues

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
I think one of the most pressing issues

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.660 
I think one of the most pressing issues
in<00:00:14.880> dub<00:00:15.450> training<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.340> are<00:00:17.490> still

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
in dub training is that we are still

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.800 
in dub training is that we are still
seriously<00:00:18.570> wasting<00:00:19.170> puppyhood<00:00:20.600> these<00:00:21.600> days

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
it is still possible for a family who

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.519 
it is still possible for a family who

even better

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.080 
even better
I<00:01:34.170> mean<00:01:34.619> basically<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.189> eight<00:01:35.340> weeks<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
I mean basically at eight weeks the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.789 
I mean basically at eight weeks the
puppy<00:01:36.450> should<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:37.020> house-trained

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
puppy should be house-trained

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
he should be chook toy trained his

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.289 
he should be chook toy trained his
favorite<00:01:40.650> friend<00:01:41.009> should<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.970> chew<00:01:42.270> toy

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
favorite friend should be a chew toy

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.600 
favorite friend should be a chew toy
which<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.869> stuffed<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.409> food<00:01:43.770> which<00:01:44.430> of

which is stuffed with food which of

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.880 
which is stuffed with food which of
course<00:01:44.880> number<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.689> programming<00:01:46.530> him<00:01:46.680> now

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
course number one is programming him now

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
course number one is programming him now
to<00:01:47.159> become<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> chew<00:01:47.970> toy<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.180> holic<00:01:48.630> so

to become like a chew toy a holic so

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.990 
to become like a chew toy a holic so
that's<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.409> he<00:01:49.500> wants<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.950> chew<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.790> now<00:01:50.939> he

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that's what he wants to chew but now he

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.670 
that's what he wants to chew but now he

doesn't want to chew other things

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.590 
doesn't want to chew other things
because<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.280> aren't<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.579> much<00:01:53.700> fun<00:01:54.119> they

because they aren't as much fun they
aren't<00:01:54.780> stuffed<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.560> food<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.939> course

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
aren't stuffed with food and of course

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.200 
aren't stuffed with food and of course
if<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.479> dog<00:01:57.719> has<00:01:58.340> developed<00:01:59.340> chewing<00:01:59.729> chew<00:01:59.939> toys
