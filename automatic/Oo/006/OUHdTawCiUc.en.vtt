00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.630

 today as they do every week 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.840
 you have to walk your dog with that one 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.660
 baby 5 months 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.619

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.109
 today 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.970
 actually i want to fill in by embroidering on 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.800
 last week that it was about bob problems 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.120
 with young dogs and I had a couple 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.680
 things about the elbow and growing pain 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.890
 I explained and wanted to have a few more 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.680
 things about a nice lawyer 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.630
 no they won the elbow they had tom 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 actually you can actually have that ex 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.690
 is people also a about yes 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.429
 slightly longer or slightly shorter or slightly 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.170
 wider or slightly narrower but they make it 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.289
 normally just tell it so month 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.579
 what do you have her about well I hope 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.289
 start this fun back them them one 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.850
 disorder that actually affects a lot 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.219
 people in the underworld are well 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.839
 Known is his condition that often affects 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.479
 the young dog is already starting 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.370
 yes and hip is a fatigue ball joint 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.289
 just imagine if the hitch of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.719
 your car and the drawbar of the trailer 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.620
 that hangs over it and that it has to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.329
 nicely guide 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.679
 well this is a picture of a hand 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.449
 made in our practice 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.949
 cisitalia uncertain on the left that 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.259
 hips yes it all depends on this 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.799
 it is almost no earth to prime mine 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.270
 mouth 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.509
 yes that does not find a so this is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.380
 maybe surgery soon to get there 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.930
 what to do about it 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.039
 give that necessary surgery 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.380
 it depends a bit on how bad it is 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.969
 if it goes when not needed you do 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.960
 not to do of course but like that 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.270
 dog there can bother you a lot 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.039
 sure what you see on the left 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.719
 yes that which is normally between one 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.939
 driver say is the towbar of your car 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.219
 and and the drawbar of your pending after 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.570
 now there is little wear on argument 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.640
 is that a kind of cauliflower can do that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.460
 see here on the model that goes blunt 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.079
 all are proliferating and you can 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.299
 imagine that instead of a one 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.820
 cup and a bowl that becomes a sort of 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.499
 cauliflower and the saucer 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.969
 yes yes well this year exactly that goes 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:53.070
 ignite that you that led not 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.409
 so easy that you can imagine 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.549
 if that's your caravan's towbar 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.770
 then thinks so well we don't go to 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.119
 south spain drive to communication and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.069
 so it applies to that dog as well 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.450
 days have to run for a long time then yes then 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.480
 is going to cause problems of course 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.880
 but how do you notice that? 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.280
 I often see slightly see 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.960
 to the dog that when they walk that they are in 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.790
 the english because the furniture is monro gate 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.380
 that she is really going to wave one 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.520
 or was that having trouble getting up 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.970
 they prefer to stay in bed 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.290
 Well if you do it once you can get them 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.320
 with some operations 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.420
 do something about it for example one 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.400
 pelvic tilt or even an artificial hip 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.860
 to be the best radical and also 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.600
 Preventing expensive operations is better 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.550
 then heal is better you can pay attention 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.200
 if you buy a purebred dog that the parents 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.720
 checked for this 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.940
 that increases the chance that the pup will later 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.800
 is going to get huge much smaller you can 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.360
 see in the studbook I assume yes then 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.220
 you just have to ask yourself or ask film 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.410
 the and then their breeder who will too 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.760
 show hearing as a good one 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.670
 breeder ati simply shows this briefly 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.990
 are the the parents who arranges where or on 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.510
 more promotions' 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.160
 and further you can move with thea in the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.270
 keep an eye on them if you know them 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.180
 you have to do that enormously 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.740
 be careful that that wear is not 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.870
 is going to be too much 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.020
 you can sometimes do something with certain medicines 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.510
 yes, more frankly, but to cover up 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.910
 the problem is not solved but 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.140
 it becomes a little livable for the dog 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.720
 anyway there are enough options 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.720
 and something can be done about this
