 Advance after two years must be 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.110
 the programs carry the revenue 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.160
 be divided fifty fifty 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.680

 on the content as on the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.840
 you have to focus on spreading 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.550
 so networks build this people 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.550
 recommend clips and redistribute 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.940

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.460
 witchwork we do not have now 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.080

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.280
 can produce cool things 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.990
 maybe we have a bit far 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.730
 figured out how to do it with less money 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.650
 nevertheless very expensive looking 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.840
 But that can already be done 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.860
 it's just fucking tough, too 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.870
 work so say we sleep little from 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.209
 hobby decorators are very successful 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.670
 bastian still far away after all 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.250
 he could give up his office job and 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.320
 lives from his clips even very well who 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.780
 says the residential prince has a big goal 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.720
 on which he is working towards and that would 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.150
 I take my audience with me, so to speak 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.440
 groundbreaking of my own house 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.950
 what am I looking for ? 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.930
 imagine 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.370
 until the last phase so that the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.290
 not completely everything on youtube 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.880

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.380
 many hundreds of thousands youtube partners 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.540
 have their hobby meanwhile to the occupation 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.430
 the platform makes sure that 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.000
 no career at technical hurdles 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.000
 fails
