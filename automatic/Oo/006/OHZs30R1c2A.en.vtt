00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.939
 we're going to teach you a level skid 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.950
 basic medium that is called for being that 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.470
 you can do it once you have mastered the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.110
 power is light or braking from what is already 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.900
 which is based almost on them 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.550
 principles is practically a power is 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.110
 the only thing we will do here will be to change 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.350
 the braking foot and we will place it 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.690
 invested it is very important that you place 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.920
 the four wheels if you put only the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.379
 tip wheel which is the most usual 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.180
 because you have to turn your ankle 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.309
 make a little bit a compass that turns you the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.530
 you have to try to make strength with the 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.239
 this will force you to put the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.340
 four wheels at the beginning starts very 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.940
 slowly and then you add a little 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.940
 of speed 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.489
 so that the foot that skids is not key 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.890
 It is very important that you place as in 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.150
 the poor slide all your weight on the leg 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.150
 that does not spill the support leg 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.830
 once it takes a little and slowly 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.620
 try to make the change as if it were a 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.570
 little forward turn and brakes alves 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.750
 shortening the times until it comes out 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.750
 directly 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.640
 as the power slide you can also do 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.590
 the inverse can rotate in 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.390
 unnatural if we usually brake 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.479
 with the right leg to be able to rotate 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.479
 clockwise or counterclockwise 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.340
 Y 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
 this guy from the thought that your skating 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.040
 be a little more fun and especially 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.040
 a little more dynamic
