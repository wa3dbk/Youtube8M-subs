00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.970 
version of being like poor I always have
is<00:00:48.610> sort<00:00:48.940> of<00:00:49.060> like<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:50.230> old<00:00:50.380> one<00:00:50.530> in<00:00:50.650> Arkham

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
origins but not that powerful

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.650 
origins but not that powerful
I<00:00:52.810> see<00:00:53.200> Bane<00:00:53.410> as<00:00:53.740> like<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:55.150> one<00:00:55.300> with<00:00:55.450> a<00:00:55.540> little

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
I see Bane as like the one with a little

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.120 
I see Bane as like the one with a little
bit<00:00:55.840> more<00:00:55.990> tubes<00:00:56.350> so<00:00:56.620> we're<00:00:56.740> like<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:56.920> one<00:00:57.010> in

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
bit more tubes so we're like the one in

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.010 
bit more tubes so we're like the one in
Arkham<00:00:57.430> Asylum<00:00:57.490> that<00:00:58.180> Bane<00:00:58.510> is<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:58.840> one<00:00:58.989> I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
Arkham Asylum that Bane is the one I

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.450

just wish they went with a more of a
powerful<00:01:10.240> Bane<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.960> could<00:01:11.110> go<00:01:11.290> up<00:01:11.320> against

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
powerful Bane that could go up against

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:30.639 
controversy on who really is the leader

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.029

Robin<00:01:30.969> tries<00:01:31.359> taking<00:01:31.719> over<00:01:32.049> but<00:01:32.289> like<00:01:32.889> you

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
Robin tries taking over but like you

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.800 
Robin tries taking over but like you
said<00:01:33.219> Robin<00:01:33.579> has<00:01:33.700> great<00:01:33.969> character<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.689> they

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
said Robin has great character and they

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.499 
said Robin has great character and they
put<00:01:35.020> Aqualad<00:01:35.590> as<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:36.340> main<00:01:36.579> you<00:01:37.030> know<00:01:37.149> leader

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.419 
put Aqualad as the main you know leader
which<00:01:38.049> I<00:01:38.289> thought<00:01:38.469> is<00:01:38.679> a<00:01:38.709> good<00:01:38.979> choice<00:01:39.189> I

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
which I thought is a good choice I

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:40.709 
which I thought is a good choice I
thought<00:01:39.579> we<00:01:39.759> thought<00:01:39.969> like<00:01:40.119> okay<00:01:40.240> he's<00:01:40.539> like

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
thought we thought like okay he's like

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.840 
thought we thought like okay he's like
the<00:01:40.810> most<00:01:41.100> respectful<00:01:42.100> he<00:01:42.369> definitely<00:01:42.729> is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
the most respectful he definitely is

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.209 
the most respectful he definitely is
like<00:01:43.029> the<00:01:43.179> leader<00:01:43.389> I<00:01:43.630> think<00:01:43.840> Robin<00:01:44.409> is<00:01:44.740> up

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
like the leader I think Robin is up

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.800 
like the leader I think Robin is up
there<00:01:45.459> he<00:01:45.670> just<00:01:45.700> needs<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.329> learn<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.569> little

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
there he just needs to learn a little

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.899 
there he just needs to learn a little
bit<00:01:46.929> more<00:01:47.200> because<00:01:47.590> like<00:01:47.770> they<00:01:48.069> say<00:01:48.279> Robin<00:01:48.759> is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
bit more because like they say Robin is

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.239 
bit more because like they say Robin is
used<00:01:49.209> to<00:01:49.389> being<00:01:49.899> alongside<00:01:50.229> Batman<00:01:50.920> where<00:01:51.130> you

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
used to being alongside Batman where you

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:52.739 
used to being alongside Batman where you

little light actually has a sample of

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.080

on<00:03:07.560> sports<00:03:07.950> master<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.550> like<00:03:09.150> sports<00:03:09.420> master<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
on sports master I like sports master a

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.340 
on sports master I like sports master a
lot<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.290> think<00:03:10.560> he<00:03:10.860> looks<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.700> lot<00:03:11.940> like

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
lot I think he looks a lot like

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.509 
lot I think he looks a lot like
Deathstroke<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.530> think<00:03:13.800> those<00:03:13.920> two<00:03:14.130> have<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.340> lot

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
Deathstroke I think those two have a lot

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.840 
Deathstroke I think those two have a lot
in<00:03:14.670> common<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:16.110> think<00:03:17.010> Jeff<00:03:17.280> stroke<00:03:17.519> appears

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
in common so I think Jeff stroke appears

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.670 
in common so I think Jeff stroke appears
later<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.300> season<00:03:18.480> too<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:19.290> uh<00:03:19.320> this

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
later in the season too but uh this

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.500 
later in the season too but uh this
episode<00:03:20.130> was<00:03:20.250> ok<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.640> give<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.000> 7<00:03:21.269> out<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.390> 10

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
episode was ok I give it a 7 out of 10

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.470 
episode was ok I give it a 7 out of 10
just<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.080> last<00:03:22.260> episode<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:24.000> was<00:03:24.180> good

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
just like the last episode it was good

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.870 
just like the last episode it was good
the<00:03:24.840> character<00:03:25.440> development<00:03:25.830> on<00:03:26.100> Robin<00:03:26.640> and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
the character development on Robin and

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.300 
the character development on Robin and
Aqualad<00:03:27.239> was<00:03:27.900> really<00:03:28.170> focused<00:03:28.560> on<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.709> lot<00:03:28.830> but

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
Aqualad was really focused on a lot but
