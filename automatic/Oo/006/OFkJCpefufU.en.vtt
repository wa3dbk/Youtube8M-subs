00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
know how much that time is critical so

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.160 
know how much that time is critical so
again<00:04:13.050> all<00:04:13.290> metal<00:04:13.830> low<00:04:14.430> profile<00:04:15.000> super<00:04:15.930> tough

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
again all metal low profile super tough

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.560 
again all metal low profile super tough
so<00:04:16.710> far<00:04:17.010> we<00:04:17.340> have<00:04:17.520> not<00:04:17.670> been<00:04:17.880> able<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.239> tear<00:04:18.480> it

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
so far we have not been able to tear it

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.630 
so far we have not been able to tear it
up<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.930> we've<00:04:19.049> tested<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.680> pretty

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
up and we've tested it pretty

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.310 
up and we've tested it pretty
extensively<00:04:21.239> here<00:04:21.510> for<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.720> last<00:04:21.900> few<00:04:22.140> months

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
extensively here for the last few months

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.710 
extensively here for the last few months
and<00:04:22.650> we'll<00:04:23.250> continue<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:24.150> put<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.479> thing

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
and we'll continue to put this thing

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.390 
and we'll continue to put this thing
through<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.169> paces<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.800> you

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
through the paces and you

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.610 
through the paces and you
and<00:04:26.520> abuse<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.090> here<00:04:27.389> in<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.900> future<00:04:28.229> I'm

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
and abuse it here in the future I'm

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.020 
and abuse it here in the future I'm
going<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:28.830> show<00:04:28.979> you<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.160> underside<00:04:29.669> of<00:04:29.729> this

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
going to show you the underside of this

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.939 
going to show you the underside of this
here<00:04:30.300> he's<00:04:30.900> got<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.139> little<00:04:31.199> spring<00:04:31.740> mechanism

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
here he's got a little spring mechanism

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.100 
here he's got a little spring mechanism
in<00:04:32.520> here<00:04:32.760> that's<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.479> again

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
in here that's it again

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.980 
in here that's it again
all<00:04:34.260> metal<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.419> definitely<00:04:36.419> something<00:04:36.690> worth

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
all metal and definitely something worth

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.439 
all metal and definitely something worth
checking<00:04:37.410> out

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
checking out

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.960 
checking out
so<00:04:39.449> again<00:04:39.930> quick<00:04:40.560> cleat<00:04:41.040> is<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.550> name<00:04:41.729> of<00:04:41.880> that

so again quick cleat is the name of that

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.610 
so again quick cleat is the name of that
product<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.840> comes<00:04:43.020> in<00:04:43.229> a<00:04:43.290> couple<00:04:43.440> different

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
sizes and finishes also based on the

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.050 
sizes and finishes also based on the
size<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:49.020> rope<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.680> you're<00:04:50.280> going<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.460> use<00:04:50.790> in
