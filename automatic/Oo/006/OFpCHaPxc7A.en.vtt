00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.330 
true hello today are we showing you how
to<00:00:05.279> use<00:00:05.400> crack<00:00:05.879> shot<00:00:06.150> weapons<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.810> model<00:00:07.140> Reena

to use crack shot weapons in model Reena

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.440 
to use crack shot weapons in model Reena
so<00:00:08.340> first<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.820> open<00:00:08.849> up<00:00:09.269> both<00:00:09.540> configs<00:00:10.200> and

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
so first you open up both configs and

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.350 
so first you open up both configs and
then<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.929> example<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.860> desert<00:00:14.280> eagle<00:00:14.460> just

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
then for example the desert eagle just

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.740 
then for example the desert eagle just
entering<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.199> item<00:00:16.619> type<00:00:17.300> into<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
entering the item type into one of the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.010 
entering the item type into one of the
slots<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.580> then<00:00:20.580> I'm<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.420> using<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
slots and then I'm going to be using the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.960 
slots and then I'm going to be using the
enchantment<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.800> check<00:00:23.070> node<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:23.730> i

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
enchantment to check node because i

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.880 
enchantment to check node because i
believe<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.510> easier<00:00:25.430> so<00:00:27.170> just<00:00:28.170> use<00:00:28.710> an

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
believe it's easier so just use an

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.389 
believe it's easier so just use an
enchantment<00:00:29.429> i'm<00:00:29.640> using<00:00:29.939> silk<00:00:30.240> touch<00:00:31.250> try<00:00:32.250> not

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
enchantment i'm using silk touch try not

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
to use a number from 1 through 5 because

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.720 
to use a number from 1 through 5 because
that's<00:00:36.120> usually<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.870> enchantment<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.890> are
