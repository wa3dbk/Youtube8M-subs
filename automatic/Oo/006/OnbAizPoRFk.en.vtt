00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
online component it just shut down

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
online component it just shut down
certain<00:01:09.000> parts<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.229> becomes

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
certain parts just because it becomes

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
certain parts just because it becomes
