00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.540 
guys will really like it I got a game a
free-for-all<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.640> run<00:00:21.359> down<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.160> I'm<00:00:23.160> going

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
free-for-all on run down and I'm going

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.890 
free-for-all on run down and I'm going
to<00:00:23.609> be<00:00:23.789> using<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.510> m4a1<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> silencer<00:00:26.310> and

to be using the m4a1 with a silencer and
I<00:00:27.900> really<00:00:28.349> hate<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> beginning<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.490> free<00:00:29.670> for

I really hate the beginning of free for

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
I really hate the beginning of free for
all<00:00:29.910> games<00:00:30.179> because<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.660> always<00:00:30.929> spawn<00:00:31.260> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
all games because you always spawn so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.170 
all games because you always spawn so
close<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.949> each<00:00:32.040> other<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.430> typically<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
close to each other and typically I

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970 
close to each other and typically I
don't<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.050> game<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.440> typically<00:00:34.770> what

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
don't do it this game but typically what

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.290 
don't do it this game but typically what
I'll<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.880> beginning<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
I'll do in the beginning of a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.610 
I'll do in the beginning of a
free-for-all<00:00:36.660> game<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> good<00:00:37.440> tip

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
free-for-all game and this is a good tip

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.430 
free-for-all game and this is a good tip
for<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.920> guys<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.940> will<00:00:39.090> lay<00:00:39.270> down<00:00:39.540> right

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
for you guys as I will lay down right

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
for you guys as I will lay down right
where<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> time<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.149> just

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
where I'm at at the time and I just

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
where I'm at at the time and I just
won't<00:00:42.480> move<00:00:42.829> because<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.329> move<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:46.190> lot<00:00:47.190> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
won't move because if you move a lot of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.830 
won't move because if you move a lot of
times<00:00:47.489> you'll<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.850> shot<00:00:47.879> right<00:00:48.420> off<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.570> bat

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
times you'll get shot right off the bat

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.970 
times you'll get shot right off the bat

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
close to it so close to each other so

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.660 
close to it so close to each other so
just<00:00:51.960> um<00:00:52.110> keep<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.129> mind<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.460> lay<00:00:53.640> down

put up with pave low I now figured out
how<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.420> get<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> pavelow<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.380> count

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
how you actually get a pavelow to count

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.540 
how you actually get a pavelow to count
towards<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:07.799> killstreaks<00:02:09.170> number<00:02:10.170> one<00:02:10.550> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
towards your killstreaks number one it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.730 
towards your killstreaks number one it
has<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> first<00:02:12.450> pave<00:02:12.690> low<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> game

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
my kills towards my tactical nuke which

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.370 
my kills towards my tactical nuke which
I<00:02:44.550> was<00:02:44.850> very<00:02:45.030> happy<00:02:45.540> with<00:02:45.810> because<00:02:45.990> this<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.350> a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
I was very happy with because this is a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.010 
I was very happy with because this is a
this<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.830> pretty<00:02:47.070> good<00:02:47.280> game<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:48.020> right

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
this is a pretty good game and right

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.290 
this is a pretty good game and right
here<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.260> pick<00:02:49.470> up<00:02:49.620> my<00:02:49.740> Harrier<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:51.000> I've<00:02:51.120> got<00:02:51.270> a

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
here I pick up my Harrier and I've got a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.150 
here I pick up my Harrier and I've got a
claymore<00:02:51.690> set<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.020> i<00:02:52.080> figure<00:02:52.380> i'm<00:02:52.500> fairly<00:02:52.770> safe

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
claymore set so i figure i'm fairly safe

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.560 
claymore set so i figure i'm fairly safe
so<00:02:53.550> i'm<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.790> call<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.300> right<00:02:54.450> away

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
so i'm going to call that in right away

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.840 
so i'm going to call that in right away
and<00:02:54.710> i'm<00:02:55.710> hoping<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.100> pick<00:02:56.310> up<00:02:56.430> my<00:02:56.490> pavelow

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and i'm hoping to pick up my pavelow

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.610 
and i'm hoping to pick up my pavelow
with<00:02:57.120> my<00:02:57.270> Harrier<00:02:57.720> right<00:02:58.260> here<00:02:58.500> because

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
with my Harrier right here because

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.770 
with my Harrier right here because
typically<00:02:59.070> that's<00:02:59.250> what<00:02:59.460> will<00:02:59.550> happen<00:02:59.910> but<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
typically that's what will happen but I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.090 
typically that's what will happen but I
think<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.200> couple<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.590> these<00:03:01.680> guys<00:03:01.920> were

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
think a couple of these guys were

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.040 
think a couple of these guys were
running<00:03:02.250> around<00:03:02.550> with<00:03:02.730> stingers<00:03:03.270> or<00:03:03.510> javelins

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
running around with stingers or javelins

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.310 
running around with stingers or javelins
and<00:03:04.350> they<00:03:04.890> shoot<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.190> down<00:03:05.310> right<00:03:05.520> away<00:03:05.550> and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
and they shoot it down right away and

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.320 
and they shoot it down right away and
right<00:03:07.320> here<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.800> hear<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.220> guy<00:03:08.400> coming<00:03:08.700> up<00:03:08.910> so

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
right here I hear this guy coming up so

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.490 
right here I hear this guy coming up so
I'm<00:03:09.450> going<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.630> jump<00:03:09.870> out<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.050> here<00:03:10.260> because

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
I'm going to jump out of here because

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.750 
I'm going to jump out of here because
typically<00:03:10.860> when<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.100> kill<00:03:11.310> someone<00:03:11.520> like

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
typically when you kill someone like

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.760 
typically when you kill someone like
that<00:03:11.790> they're<00:03:12.720> gonna<00:03:12.870> rush<00:03:13.170> back<00:03:13.380> up<00:03:13.620> there

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
that they're gonna rush back up there

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.500 
that they're gonna rush back up there
with<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> shotgun<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.670> as<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.030> see<00:03:15.180> he<00:03:15.300> runs

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
with a shotgun and as you see he runs

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.290 
with a shotgun and as you see he runs
past<00:03:15.690> my<00:03:15.900> Claymore<00:03:16.290> but<00:03:16.850> some<00:03:17.850> smart<00:03:18.120> play

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
past my Claymore but some smart play

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.640 
past my Claymore but some smart play
right<00:03:18.480> there<00:03:18.600> gets<00:03:18.840> me<00:03:18.960> that<00:03:19.140> gets<00:03:19.440> me<00:03:19.530> that

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
right there gets me that gets me that

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.530 
right there gets me that gets me that
pretty<00:03:19.800> easy<00:03:20.040> kill<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.730> saves<00:03:21.060> me<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.270> death

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
pretty easy kill and I saves me a death

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.690 
pretty easy kill and I saves me a death
because<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.140> didn't<00:03:23.070> see<00:03:23.310> from<00:03:23.460> where<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.670> was

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
because I didn't see from where I was

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.520 
because I didn't see from where I was
standing<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.390> I'm<00:03:24.420> gonna<00:03:24.600> assume<00:03:24.960> more<00:03:25.350> than

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
standing but I'm gonna assume more than

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.640 
standing but I'm gonna assume more than
likely<00:03:25.740> he<00:03:26.010> had<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.160> shotgun<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.820> he<00:03:26.910> was<00:03:27.060> gonna

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
likely he had a shotgun and he was gonna

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.690 
likely he had a shotgun and he was gonna
probably<00:03:28.650> kill<00:03:28.950> me<00:03:29.070> right<00:03:29.220> there<00:03:29.340> if<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.490> didn't

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
probably kill me right there if I didn't

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.450 
probably kill me right there if I didn't
move<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:31.110> i<00:03:31.140> got<00:03:31.590> my<00:03:31.620> pave<00:03:31.920> low<00:03:32.070> right<00:03:32.220> now<00:03:32.250> and

move so i got my pave low right now and
i'm<00:03:32.550> just<00:03:32.580> hunting<00:03:33.030> for<00:03:33.180> one<00:03:33.360> more<00:03:33.540> kill

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780
