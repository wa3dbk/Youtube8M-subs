00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 and followers join to work 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.620
 because this is going to love you we are going to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.599
 make a diet that seemed like a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.030
 rest is impressive so that you do not 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.670
 say that this program is not comprehensive 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.809
 here all our collaborators 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.690
 specialists work with each other 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.609
 to do every day because sections do not 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 only more interesting but more complete 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.930
 as is life where many factors 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.150
 they have to see so he had some 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.230
 boys no longer no longer I imagine the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.230
 two that pump masters 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.980
 and well what happens is that there are many 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.380
 questions from the public through 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.000
 twitter at javier and a low star 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.489
 and also through facebook 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.469
 women and they ask us for diets I can not 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.000
 give a diet because I am not a specialist is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.660
 that's why I'm joining in this 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.879
 moment with the specialist who 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.460
 can guide and they ask me for diets to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.649
 increase muscle mass diets to lower 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.870
 also to gain weight there are very people 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.699
 thin and what you want to gain weight and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.160
 they also ask me for a diet to lower the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.170
 today specific fat we are going to work 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.510
 with a special diet to lower the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.360
 fat that is what we are going to handle 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.730
 fried challenge with our coconut worker 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.370
 salgado she is in a process that 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.780
 you have to lose fat 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.300
 Exactly right now you already put the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.030
 exercises that we gave him yesterday his 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.160
 diet and it's going to be a diet that is low 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.620
 in fact protein was zero proteins 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:32.490
 this is meat fish chicken egg all 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.590
 dairy and it's rich in vegetables because 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.810
 aside do not worry because the vegetables 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.340
 she has a lot of protein there she goes to 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.920
 have to support much more in the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.229
 beans the chickpeas the mushrooms 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.690
 to have that protein source that is going 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.760
 to help define the muscle and let's 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.130
 remove all the fat so that also the 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.110
 body begin to tune and eliminate and 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.180
 use that reserve fat as 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.040
 energy source this exercise everything is 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.530
 It makes us turn it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.229
 completely vegetarian is going to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.060
 eat no meat and well also 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.340
 I could say maybe no carbohydrates 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.290
 but it will combine it with some 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.660
 carbohydrates as we could say to 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.730
 all the people how can you start a 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.209
 breakfast in the morning 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.900
 having a success for example having breakfast 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.930
 fruit are then eaten a salad or a 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.140
 couscous with vegetables or something like a rice 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.180
 with the green purslane green sauce what 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.700
 you want delicious the truth that 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.830
 if the bastillas a paste to the pomodoro 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.480
 it can be a pasta for dinner 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.280
 excellent for dinner and then in the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.980
 tomorrow be the cardio that the super good 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.709
 but the joke is to eliminate all these 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.510
 but if you have carbohydrates because if 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.010
 they are not going to exhaust the exercise and 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.099
 can get dizzy in this first process 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.390
 sorry so ask about this the something 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.239
 very important is cardio so that 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.569
 Start burning fat by increasing your 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.489
 heart rate in fact yesterday 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.829
 turn talking about ending the section 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.019
 with coconut I already told him that exercises can 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.150
 do now we are going to spend with her 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.040
 in these 30 days is this comprehensive plan 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.410
 it's 30 days she's going to have to do 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.329
 much much cardio for example a day 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.220
 can do spinning another day is going to 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.810
 walk I told him what is going to 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.670
 do when you 're on the treadmill by 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.190
 example the first 10 minutes is 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.270
 basic that does a warm-up have 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.880
 to walk slowly 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.910
 but after the next 10 minutes 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.340
 it will be at an accelerated pace 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.560
 It remains in the same position 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.090
 Accelerated step 10 minutes after the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.880
 next 10 minutes what will you do 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.160
 is to put the band to the top up so 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.410
 regular is up to number 15 is the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.780
 level and what you are going to do is lower the 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.190
 rhythm no longer as fast as if it's going 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.170
 be slowly 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.600
 that way he will work 10 minutes at a time 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.580
 accelerated walking and 10 minutes at a time 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.260
 slow but with the inclination to everything 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.630
 that gives that will help you a lot 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.630
 sweat to lose fat and good too 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.160
 and complementing with condors in this 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.130
 diet will help you a lot to go down too 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.990
 the fat this supplement is ideal for 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.120
 these 30 days and I can lose weight 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.310
 quickly what do we want in a 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.410
 month the measurement of the first week of 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.180
 down about two kilos two kilos and 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.860
 medium but exactly and then going to 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.890
 start to lose a pound and a half per week 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.390
 and this and this is going to keep and 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.520
 suddenly it's going to give another slump and 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.800
 suddenly he's going to stay here again 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.150
 the kilo and a half per week and this helps 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.290
 what happens is that accelerate the 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.690
 lipid metabolism 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.220
 is a question with this diet because I 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.980
 I'm seeing that we open cardio goes to 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.050
 Being quite steroid is far away 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.820
 the sugars are up to certain degrees 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.470
 allowed or not nothing diametrically 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.750
 degrees are not going to have the energy but 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.840
 again in this case we 're going to 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.700
 support in the coal to roger is spent in 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.310
 tortilla all perfect in themes of 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.990
 Integral delivery is better but nothing 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.760
 sugar not what yes no 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.370
 we spent our time very quickly 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.870
 exceeded already knows it on Monday also 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.550
 will be with me, it's already 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.950
 confirmed now let's give a diet 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.450
 to increase muscle mass so it's 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.910
 do not miss out on anything in the world 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.950

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.290

 we know today in the women's house 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.230
 strong and the advice those never
