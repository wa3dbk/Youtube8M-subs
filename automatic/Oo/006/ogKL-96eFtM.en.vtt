everybody<00:00:00.719> we're<00:00:00.930> gonna<00:00:01.020> command<00:00:01.350> modern<00:00:01.650> air

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
everybody we're gonna command modern air

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.430 
everybody we're gonna command modern air
in<00:00:02.010> Naval<00:00:02.370> Operations<00:00:02.659> this<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.959> import

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
in Naval Operations this is the import

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.579 
in Naval Operations this is the import
file<00:00:04.680> tutorial<00:00:05.899> imports<00:00:06.899> are<00:00:07.140> probably<00:00:07.440> one

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
file tutorial imports are probably one

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.020 
file tutorial imports are probably one
of<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> best<00:00:07.950> features<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.309> our<00:00:08.610> scenario

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
of the best features of our scenario

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.749 
of the best features of our scenario
editor<00:00:09.590> basically<00:00:10.590> allows<00:00:10.860> players<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.309> save

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
editor basically allows players to save

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.999 
editor basically allows players to save
units<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.300> objects<00:00:12.599> from<00:00:12.660> one<00:00:12.960> scenario<00:00:13.230> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
units and objects from one scenario and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.250 
units and objects from one scenario and
then<00:00:14.130> import<00:00:14.519> them<00:00:14.700> into<00:00:14.910> another<00:00:15.260> it's

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
then import them into another it's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.050 
then import them into another it's
probably<00:00:16.710> not<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.859> big<00:00:17.070> deal<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.490> terms<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.880> one

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
probably not a big deal in terms of one

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240 
probably not a big deal in terms of one
or<00:00:18.180> two<00:00:18.300> units<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:19.529> when<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.830> look<00:00:20.010> at<00:00:20.100> an

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
or two units but when you look at an

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.920 
or two units but when you look at an
airbase<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.910> could<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.150> hundreds<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.630> units

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
airbase that could be hundreds of units

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.950 
airbase that could be hundreds of units
large<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.500> take<00:00:23.189> hours<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.699> complete<00:00:24.090> this

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
large and take hours to complete this

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.509 
large and take hours to complete this
feature<00:00:25.170> basically<00:00:25.740> makes<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> player<00:00:26.279> go

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
feature basically makes the player go

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.640 
feature basically makes the player go
through<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.849> only<00:00:27.180> once<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:28.230> then<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.500> can

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
through that only once and then they can

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.439 
through that only once and then they can
import<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.130> again<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:29.550> any<00:00:29.789> scenario<00:00:30.269> with

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
import it again into any scenario with

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.709 
import it again into any scenario with
relatively<00:00:30.960> few<00:00:31.109> clicks<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.360> good<00:00:33.360> news<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
relatively few clicks the good news is

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.389 
relatively few clicks the good news is
that<00:00:33.750> we've<00:00:34.050> also<00:00:34.320> constructed<00:00:35.190> or

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that we've also constructed or

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.030 
that we've also constructed or
pre-constructed<00:00:36.350> thousands<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.440> air<00:00:37.620> bases

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
pre-constructed thousands of air bases

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.180 
pre-constructed thousands of air bases
in<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.660> airports<00:00:39.660> ports<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.950> players

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
in there in airports ports for players

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.760 
in there in airports ports for players
to<00:00:41.280> use<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.850> import<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.420> saving<00:00:43.260> them<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
to use and import in saving them the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.240 
to use and import in saving them the
build<00:00:43.950> time<00:00:44.219> completely<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.649> start<00:00:46.920> we'll

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
build time completely so to start we'll

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.850 
build time completely so to start we'll
look<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.610> how<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> build<00:00:48.210> buy<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.289> import<00:00:49.620> file

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
look at how to build buy an import file

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
look at how to build buy an import file
and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.370> we'll<00:00:50.520> look<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.940> import<00:00:51.480> them

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and then we'll look kind of import them

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.100 
and then we'll look kind of import them
into<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.960> scenario<00:00:53.480> all<00:00:54.480> right<00:00:54.600> let's<00:00:54.780> start<00:00:54.960> by

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
into a scenario all right let's start by

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.810 
into a scenario all right let's start by
creating<00:00:55.350> an<00:00:55.559> import<00:00:55.920> file<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.430> let's<00:00:56.610> add<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
creating an import file so let's add a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.720 
creating an import file so let's add a
couple<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.210> units<00:00:57.949> in<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.070> case<00:00:59.280> we'll<00:00:59.520> add

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
couple of units in this case we'll add

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.070 
couple of units in this case we'll add
an<00:01:00.600> Australian<00:01:01.230> perry-class<00:01:01.590> frigate<00:01:03.080> might

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
an Australian perry-class frigate might

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
an Australian perry-class frigate might
as<00:01:04.140> well<00:01:04.229> add<00:01:04.500> an<00:01:04.680> Anzac<00:01:04.830> along<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:11.060> okay

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
as well add an Anzac along with it okay

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
as well add an Anzac along with it okay
first<00:01:12.840> thing<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.619> select<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
first thing you want to do is select the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
first thing you want to do is select the
units<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.850> they're<00:01:15.000> highlighted<00:01:15.570> go<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
units so that they're highlighted go to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.499 
units so that they're highlighted go to
the<00:01:16.409> editor<00:01:16.799> drop-down<00:01:17.009> select<00:01:18.000> import

from<00:01:36.450> an<00:01:36.570> until<00:01:36.869> these<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.140> not<00:01:37.290> required

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
from an until these are not required

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.620 
from an until these are not required
will<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.250> well<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.759> we'll<00:01:38.880> say<00:01:39.140> 2012<00:01:40.340> until

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
will be well so we'll say 2012 until

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.590 
will be well so we'll say 2012 until
2014<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.130> then<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.310> add<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> note<00:01:44.700> which

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
2014 and then you can add a note which

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.359 
2014 and then you can add a note which
is<00:01:45.630> really<00:01:45.990> useful<00:01:46.350> when<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.979> share<00:01:47.220> these

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
is really useful when you share these

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.910 
is really useful when you share these
files<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.570> all<00:01:48.689> displayed<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
files and it's all displayed to the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.319 
files and it's all displayed to the
player<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.399> they<00:01:50.520> look<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.939> I'll<00:01:51.030> show<00:01:51.060> you

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
player when they look and I'll show you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.639 
player when they look and I'll show you
that<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.720> minute<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.110> add<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that in a minute when we add it to a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.160 
that in a minute when we add it to a
scenario<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.820> we'll<00:01:53.939> say<00:01:54.149> only<00:01:54.920> active<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:57.170> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
scenario so we'll say only active in the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.280 
scenario so we'll say only active in the
Indian<00:01:58.740> Ocean<00:01:59.600> okay<00:02:00.600> when<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.899> hit<00:02:01.020> save

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
Indian Ocean okay when you hit save

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I did actually have a Mike folder go

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.630 
I did actually have a Mike folder go
ahead<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.390> put<00:02:36.950> Australia<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.370> we'll<00:02:38.460> go<00:02:38.580> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
ahead and put Australia and we'll go to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.850 
ahead and put Australia and we'll go to
the<00:02:38.700> file<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.940> name<00:02:39.830> Hague<00:02:41.450> 2013<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.590> we'll

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the file a name Hague 2013 and we'll

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.790 
the file a name Hague 2013 and we'll
save<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:46.110> we'll<00:02:46.200> go<00:02:46.320> ahead<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.500> create

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
save it so we'll go ahead and create

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:58.970 
save it so we'll go ahead and create
another<00:02:46.830> scenario<00:02:49.130> like<00:02:50.130> this<00:02:50.190> one<00:02:57.800> okay<00:02:58.800> now

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
another scenario like this one okay now

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.760 
another scenario like this one okay now
to<00:02:59.570> import<00:03:00.570> them<00:03:00.750> into<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:01.050> scenario<00:03:01.350> go<00:03:01.710> to

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
to import them into a scenario go to

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.360 
to import them into a scenario go to
editor<00:03:03.110> import/export<00:03:04.110> units<00:03:04.470> load<00:03:05.010> units

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
editor import/export units load units

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.510 
editor import/export units load units
from<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.640> file<00:03:06.350> okay<00:03:07.350> when<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.710> open<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.190> up<00:03:08.340> on

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
from a file okay when I open this up on

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.860 
from a file okay when I open this up on
the<00:03:08.610> left<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.090> basically<00:03:09.420> your<00:03:09.630> file

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
the left is basically your file

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.900 
the left is basically your file
directory<00:03:10.500> okay<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.280> actually<00:03:11.700> looking

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
directory okay so it is actually looking

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.690 
directory okay so it is actually looking
at<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.150> import<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.690> export<00:03:12.840> folder<00:03:13.770> on<00:03:14.520> your

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
at that import and export folder on your

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.240 
at that import and export folder on your
command<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.180> Windows<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:16.830> expand

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
command in Windows and you can expand

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.830 
command in Windows and you can expand
these<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.640> show<00:03:17.820> what's<00:03:18.030> inside<00:03:18.210> of<00:03:18.420> them<00:03:18.690> so

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
these to show what's inside of them so

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.090 
these to show what's inside of them so
in<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.050> case<00:03:19.230> we<00:03:19.410> actually<00:03:19.530> saved<00:03:19.950> in

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
in this case we actually saved in

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.520 
in this case we actually saved in
Australia<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.630> can<00:03:21.780> see<00:03:21.900> all<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.200> folders

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
Australia you can see all the folders

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.820 
Australia you can see all the folders

updates um it'll actually using the DB

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.760 
updates um it'll actually using the DB
IDs<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.479> should<00:04:38.659> work<00:04:38.840> in<00:04:38.960> most<00:04:39.139> cases<00:04:39.409> but

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
IDs so it should work in most cases but

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.070 
IDs so it should work in most cases but
if<00:04:39.889> there's<00:04:40.069> any<00:04:40.250> massive<00:04:40.759> change<00:04:41.060> they<00:04:41.930> may

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
if there's any massive change they may

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.950 
if there's any massive change they may
want<00:04:42.319> work<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:43.520> other<00:04:43.669> thing<00:04:43.849> to<00:04:44.720> note<00:04:44.930> that
