00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.070

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:36.200

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:36.200
 it's true of myself i assure here and fudge 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:58.640
 I drew such a car abruptly 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.780
 chupa chups in general you understand this 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.780
 if you became 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.260
 it's very easy to send some 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:24.190
 I will close my lips 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:31.740

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.740
 such a ward tired go-go 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:42.870

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.930

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:18.110
 all these drawings will give one house 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:28.709
 I drew all these pictures in one hour 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:45.239
 There they correctly tell us to draw 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:46.180
 they finished skating on an intelligence card 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.329
