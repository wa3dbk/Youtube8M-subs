00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
either taken one alone so basically we

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.440 
either taken one alone so basically we
want<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:17.680> this<00:05:18.010> is<00:05:18.130> basically<00:05:18.400> called<00:05:18.670> dual

Sirois<00:05:22.840> type<00:05:23.110> drug<00:05:23.550> like<00:05:24.600> like<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.870> really

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
Sirois type drug like like a really

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.190 
Sirois type drug like like a really
common<00:05:26.560> s<00:05:26.890> erect<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.670> publix<00:05:28.120> a<00:05:28.270> triple<00:05:28.600> like

female suffering from the price of
activity<00:05:41.710> we<00:05:42.310> will<00:05:42.430> give<00:05:42.550> her<00:05:42.730> citalopram<00:05:43.060> and

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
activity we will give her citalopram and

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.380 
activity we will give her citalopram and
we<00:05:43.930> could<00:05:44.050> even<00:05:44.200> give<00:05:44.410> her<00:05:44.560> a<00:05:44.590> fish<00:05:45.400> oil<00:05:45.580> to

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
we could even give her a fish oil to

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.390 
we could even give her a fish oil to
decrease<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.260> symptoms<00:05:47.410> of<00:05:47.770> depression<00:05:48.720> um
