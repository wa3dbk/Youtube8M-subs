00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
repeat it is so easy to install this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.499 
repeat it is so easy to install this
skin<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.229> took<00:01:37.409> me<00:01:37.650> probably<00:01:38.540> I<00:01:39.540> would<00:01:40.439> say

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
skin now it took me probably I would say

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
skin now it took me probably I would say
20<00:01:42.509> minutes<00:01:42.780> to--<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.100> every<00:01:44.399> panel<00:01:44.820> so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
20 minutes to-- to do every panel so

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.499 
20 minutes to-- to do every panel so
that's<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.750> two<00:01:46.079> three<00:01:46.110> four<00:01:46.590> five<00:01:47.490> six<00:01:47.850> seven

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that's one two three four five six seven

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.080 
that's one two three four five six seven
eight<00:01:48.630> nine<00:01:49.170> ten<00:01:49.590> eleven<00:01:50.250> twelve<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.790> twelve

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
eight nine ten eleven twelve is twelve

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.510 
eight nine ten eleven twelve is twelve
so<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.689> 12<00:01:51.990> panels<00:01:52.229> took<00:01:52.890> about<00:01:53.100> 20<00:01:53.490> minutes

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so if 12 panels took about 20 minutes

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.870 
so if 12 panels took about 20 minutes
