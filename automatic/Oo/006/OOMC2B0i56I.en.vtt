00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
clan levels 22 almost 23 as you see by

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.650 
clan levels 22 almost 23 as you see by
the<00:02:38.319> screen<00:02:38.560> here<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:38.950> have<00:02:39.040> 83<00:02:39.430> members<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.060> 0

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
the screen here we have 83 members and 0

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.110 
the screen here we have 83 members and 0
days<00:02:40.840> played<00:02:41.110> KD<00:02:41.440> ratio<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.280> kills<00:02:42.520> that's

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
days played KD ratio and kills that's

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.670 
days played KD ratio and kills that's
just<00:02:43.270> 0<00:02:43.510> I'm<00:02:43.900> not<00:02:44.080> sure<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.319> think<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:44.620> a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
just 0 I'm not sure I think it's a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.010 
just 0 I'm not sure I think it's a
glitch<00:02:45.580> in<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.819> system<00:02:45.970> if<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.690> go<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
glitch in the system if I go to the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.110 
glitch in the system if I go to the
leaderboards<00:02:47.500> here<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:48.670> can<00:02:48.790> actually<00:02:48.940> see

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
leaderboards here you can actually see

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.030 
leaderboards here you can actually see
where<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.630> rank<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.170> whole<00:02:50.350> entire<00:02:50.380> clan

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
where you rank in the whole entire clan

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.759 
where you rank in the whole entire clan
so<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.910> looks<00:02:52.150> like<00:02:52.239> for<00:02:52.570> most<00:02:52.780> kills<00:02:53.110> on<00:02:53.290> 35

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
so it looks like for most kills on 35

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:54.930 
so it looks like for most kills on 35
because<00:02:54.100> I<00:02:54.190> don't<00:02:54.340> have<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.459> lot<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.640> kills

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
because I don't have a lot of kills

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.150 
because I don't have a lot of kills
because<00:02:55.450> I'm<00:02:55.780> only<00:02:56.230> second<00:02:56.620> prestige<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.100> a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
because I'm only second prestige and a

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.470 
because I'm only second prestige and a
lot<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.310> people<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.700> clan<00:02:57.880> are<00:02:58.030> really

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
lot of people in the clan are really

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.330 
lot of people in the clan are really
really<00:02:58.660> high<00:02:58.870> prestigious<00:02:59.380> but<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.220> can
