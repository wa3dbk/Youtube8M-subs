channel noise and stuff that's where I
first<00:00:26.010> learned<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:27.300> bit<00:00:27.539> about<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
first learned this bit about the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.259 
first learned this bit about the
language<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.199> I'm<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.439> show<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.619> guys

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
language so I'm going to show you guys

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.550 
language so I'm going to show you guys
but<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.570> Carly<00:00:30.869> probably<00:00:31.109> invented<00:00:31.349> obvi

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
but I think Carly probably invented obvi

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.479 
but I think Carly probably invented obvi
must<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.890> probably<00:00:32.099> learnt<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.430> from

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
must have probably learnt it from

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.920 
must have probably learnt it from
someone<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> reason<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:33.660> doing<00:00:33.780> this

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
someone but the reason I'm doing this

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.630 
someone but the reason I'm doing this

probably<00:01:41.400> cutting<00:01:41.759> straight<00:01:42.210> down<00:01:42.390> or

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
probably cutting straight down or

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.359 
probably cutting straight down or
hacking<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.140> has<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.500> say<00:01:43.710> okay<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
hacking this has to say okay about a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.200 
hacking this has to say okay about a
kukri<00:01:44.670> machete

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
kukri machete

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.940 
kukri machete
you'd<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.750> hacking<00:01:46.079> down<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.350> front<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> so

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
you'd be hacking down in front of you so

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.980 
you'd be hacking down in front of you so
if<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.100> lost<00:01:47.310> control<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.759> handle<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.810> knife

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
if you lost control the handle the knife

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.600 
if you lost control the handle the knife
would<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> line<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.950> your<00:01:49.979> body<00:01:50.100> I'm

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
would be in the line of your body I'm

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.830 
would be in the line of your body I'm
gonna<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.030> again<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.390> you'll<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:51.630> why

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
gonna have that again and you'll see why

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.710 
gonna have that again and you'll see why
so<00:01:52.770> we're<00:01:52.920> hacking<00:01:53.070> away<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.210> lose<00:01:54.390> grip<00:01:54.600> on

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so we're hacking away and I lose grip on

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.160 
so we're hacking away and I lose grip on
that<00:01:54.840> handle<00:01:54.899> what's<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:55.530> cast

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
that handle what's with my cast

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.490 
that handle what's with my cast
let's<00:01:58.170> watch<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.350> again

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.440 

if<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> was<00:02:02.160> here<00:02:02.370> I<00:02:02.760> let<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.690> go<00:02:05.060> it's<00:02:06.060> cleaned

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
if it was here I let it go it's cleaned

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.000 
if it was here I let it go it's cleaned
up<00:02:06.770> pointing<00:02:07.770> pretty<00:02:08.430> much<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.240> maybe

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
up pointing pretty much you know maybe

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.350 
up pointing pretty much you know maybe
that's<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.190> larger<00:02:11.490> plate<00:02:11.670> not<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.940> smaller

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
that's the larger plate not a smaller

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.640 
that's the larger plate not a smaller
blade<00:02:12.630> knife<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:13.050> course<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.380> can<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
blade knife of course it can have the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.900 
blade knife of course it can have the
same<00:02:13.710> effect<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> pinch<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.820> on

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
same effect it's going to pinch it on

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.320 
same effect it's going to pinch it on
back

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
back

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.450 
back
so<00:02:15.840> we'll<00:02:15.990> just<00:02:16.110> undo<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.220> I

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
so we'll just undo that not because I

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.820 
so we'll just undo that not because I
say<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.940> use<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.540> other<00:02:18.660> way<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
say do you use this the other way you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.050 
say do you use this the other way you
actually<00:02:20.280> need<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:22.620> stuff<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.070> do<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.880> it's<00:02:24.000> a

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
actually need just stuff to do it it's a

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.850 
actually need just stuff to do it it's a
little<00:02:24.240> bit<00:02:24.350> tricky<00:02:25.350> with<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.530> weight<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
little bit tricky with the weight of the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.490 
little bit tricky with the weight of the
wide-on<00:02:26.070> me<00:02:26.400> actually<00:02:27.300> need<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:28.110> do<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.350> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
wide-on me actually need to do this you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.840 
wide-on me actually need to do this you
I<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.950> lanyard<00:02:29.280> set<00:02:29.520> up<00:02:29.610> just<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.820> little

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
I have the lanyard set up just a little

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.880 
I have the lanyard set up just a little
bit<00:02:30.060> longer<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:31.020> need<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.440> when<00:02:31.770> you're

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
bit longer so you need to when you're

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.590 
bit longer so you need to when you're
setting<00:02:32.190> your<00:02:32.220> leg<00:02:32.430> needs<00:02:32.550> up<00:02:32.730> obviously<00:02:33.270> to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
setting your leg needs up obviously to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.140 
setting your leg needs up obviously to
figure<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.900> out<00:02:34.280> I'll<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.520> demonstrate

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
figure that out I'll just demonstrate

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.290 
figure that out I'll just demonstrate
that<00:02:36.720> same<00:02:37.020> thing<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.500> Straight<00:02:37.800> by<00:02:38.300> our

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
that same thing of the Straight by our

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.290 
that same thing of the Straight by our
tech<00:02:39.600> -<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.490> set<00:02:41.640> up<00:02:41.730> long<00:02:41.910> I'm<00:02:42.060> not<00:02:42.180> going

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
tech - this is set up long I'm not going

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.540 
tech - this is set up long I'm not going
to<00:02:42.420> adjust<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:42.900> one<00:02:43.110> because<00:02:43.350> obviously

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
to adjust this one because obviously

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.530 
to adjust this one because obviously
it's<00:02:44.550> going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> take<00:02:44.910> too<00:02:45.090> long<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.240> just

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
it's going to take too long to just

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.710 
it's going to take too long to just
demonstrate<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.380> same<00:02:46.590> principles<00:02:47.220> involved

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:59.240 

so<00:02:53.150> go<00:02:56.120> see<00:02:57.120> there<00:02:57.770> it's<00:02:58.770> probably<00:02:58.980> not

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
so go see there it's probably not

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.520 
so go see there it's probably not
particularly<00:02:59.640> healthy

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
particularly healthy

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.600 
particularly healthy
it<00:03:01.530> means<00:03:01.740> tense<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.190> are<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.580> know

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
it means tense if you are in a you know

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.280 
it means tense if you are in a you know
it's<00:03:02.820> rough<00:03:03.180> terrain<00:03:03.360> also<00:03:03.810> touching<00:03:04.140> you

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
it's rough terrain also touching you

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.890 
it's rough terrain also touching you
fill<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.160> falling<00:03:05.520> you<00:03:06.120> let<00:03:06.300> your<00:03:06.480> life<00:03:06.720> as

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
fill and in falling you let your life as

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.020 
fill and in falling you let your life as
you<00:03:07.050> -<00:03:07.230> need<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.770> due<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.220> rest<00:03:08.910> your<00:03:09.090> fall<00:03:09.360> I

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
you - need to be due to rest your fall I

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.920 
you - need to be due to rest your fall I
don't<00:03:12.030> think<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.420> would<00:03:12.510> be<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.600> particularly

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
don't think that would be a particularly

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.720 
don't think that would be a particularly
good<00:03:13.170> thing<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.709> form<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:15.630> what<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.470> do<00:03:16.680> okay<00:03:17.550> as

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
good thing to form so what to do okay as

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.100 
good thing to form so what to do okay as
mentioned<00:03:18.120> these<00:03:18.330> are<00:03:18.390> set<00:03:18.660> up<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.080> little

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
mentioned these are set up just a little

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.260 
mentioned these are set up just a little
bit<00:03:19.380> longer<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> reason<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.730> here's<00:03:21.150> how

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
bit longer and the reason is here's how

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.600 
bit longer and the reason is here's how
you<00:03:21.330> meant<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.630> use<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:22.130> fun<00:03:23.130> goes<00:03:23.340> through

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
you meant to use it fun goes through

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.300 
you meant to use it fun goes through
like<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:25.380> wrap<00:03:25.560> them<00:03:25.709> in<00:03:25.860> your<00:03:25.950> over<00:03:26.280> the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
like so you wrap them in your over the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.340 
like so you wrap them in your over the
top<00:03:26.550> of<00:03:26.670> your<00:03:26.730> hand<00:03:26.940> bringing<00:03:27.690> in<00:03:27.840> back<00:03:28.020> over

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
top of your hand bringing in back over

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.680 
top of your hand bringing in back over
and<00:03:29.100> you're<00:03:29.220> gripping<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.520> blade<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:30.510> is

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
and you're gripping the blade this is

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.870 
and you're gripping the blade this is
set<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:31.050> just<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.290> little<00:03:31.320> bit<00:03:31.620> looser<00:03:32.040> I've<00:03:32.130> got
