00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.629 
out the arma 3 alpha on the gtx 660ti i
had<00:00:06.720> no<00:00:06.930> idea<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.440> game<00:00:07.680> was<00:00:07.859> coming<00:00:08.189> out<00:00:08.340> or

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
had no idea this game was coming out or

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.860 
had no idea this game was coming out or
even<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> alpha<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.620> honest<00:00:10.860> holy<00:00:11.070> shit

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
are really good let me lower the audio a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.760 
are really good let me lower the audio a
little<00:00:16.800> bit<00:00:16.980> since<00:00:17.310> some<00:00:17.779> kind<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.869> impressed

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
little bit since some kind of impressed

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.840 
little bit since some kind of impressed
right<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.070> cuz<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.520> first<00:00:20.730> time

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
right here cuz this is the first time

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.099 
right here cuz this is the first time
I'm<00:00:21.029> starting<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.449> off<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:23.900> frame<00:00:24.900> rates

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
I'm starting it off so frame rates

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.929 
I'm starting it off so frame rates
pretty<00:00:25.320> low<00:00:25.560> at<00:00:25.740> 20<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.310> keep<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.670> mind<00:00:26.699> that

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
pretty low at 20 but keep in mind that

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.810 
pretty low at 20 but keep in mind that
this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.180> an<00:00:27.449> alpha<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.340> expect

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
this is an alpha so you got expect

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.759 
this is an alpha so you got expect
things<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.480> I'm<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.199> really<00:00:31.260> too

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
things like this so I'm not really too

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.619 
things like this so I'm not really too
shocked<00:00:37.520> calling<00:00:38.520> up<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:39.090> game<00:00:39.270> looks<00:00:39.390> way

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
shocked calling up this game looks way

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.330 
shocked calling up this game looks way
better<00:00:39.780> than<00:00:39.989> ARMA<00:00:40.350> 2<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> read<00:00:41.100> somewhere

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
better than ARMA 2 so I read somewhere

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.830 
better than ARMA 2 so I read somewhere
that<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.730> game<00:00:41.910> was<00:00:42.000> supposed<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> look<00:00:42.600> as

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
that this game was supposed to look as

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.790 
that this game was supposed to look as
good<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.170> ARMA<00:00:43.469> 2<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.010> blows<00:00:44.399> away<00:00:44.610> ARMA<00:00:45.090> 2

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
good as ARMA 2 this blows away ARMA 2

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.380 
good as ARMA 2 this blows away ARMA 2
hopefully<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> optimization

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
hopefully they get the optimization

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
hopefully they get the optimization
right<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.930> uh<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.620> optimize<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.219> well

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
right and uh they can optimize it well

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.130 
right and uh they can optimize it well
for<00:00:50.550> PC<00:00:50.789> when<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> final<00:00:51.390> build<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.930> cuz

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
for PC when the final build is out cuz

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
for PC when the final build is out cuz
did<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.800> outlet<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.399> came<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.730> today<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
did the outlet just came out today I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
did the outlet just came out today I
knew<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.840> gonna<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.050> optimization

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
knew there was gonna be optimization

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
knew there was gonna be optimization
bunks<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.550> whatnot<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.629> can't

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
bunks and whatnot it's like you can't

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.049 
bunks and whatnot it's like you can't
expect<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.559> gave<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> perfect<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.850> these

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
expect I gave to the perfect and these

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.969 
expect I gave to the perfect and these
are<00:01:03.120> these<00:01:03.660> showcases<00:01:03.960> aren't<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> be

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
are these showcases aren't going to be

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
are these showcases aren't going to be
in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> final<00:01:05.549> game<00:01:05.729> they're<00:01:06.000> basically<00:01:06.390> like

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
in the final game they're basically like

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.020 
in the final game they're basically like
what<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.260> say<00:01:07.470> they're<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.860> showcases

right<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.310> too<00:01:50.520> bad<00:01:50.729> i<00:01:50.759> was<00:01:51.030> expecting

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
right now not too bad i was expecting

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.690 
right now not too bad i was expecting
worse<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.080> was<00:01:52.770> expecting<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.520> like

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
worse I was expecting this to be like

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
worse I was expecting this to be like
Daisy<00:01:54.030> where<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.539> you<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.080> got<00:01:55.350> like

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
Daisy where do you get what you got like

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.359 
Daisy where do you get what you got like
nine<00:01:55.830> frames<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.490> second<00:01:57.050> isn't<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.110> better

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.100 

but<00:02:05.369> again<00:02:05.490> ARMA<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.360> pretty<00:02:06.659> intensive

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
but again ARMA was a pretty intensive

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.270 
but again ARMA was a pretty intensive
game<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.600> but<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:10.080> intensiveness<00:02:10.860> might

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
game so but that intensiveness might

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.070 
game so but that intensiveness might
have<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.580> came<00:02:11.730> from<00:02:11.970> bad<00:02:12.239> optimization

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
have just came from bad optimization

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.770 
have just came from bad optimization
it's<00:02:13.230> really<00:02:13.470> kind<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.830> gray<00:02:14.250> area<00:02:17.780> because

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
it's really kind of a gray area because

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.620 
it's really kind of a gray area because
ARMA<00:02:19.110> 2<00:02:19.290> was<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.950> horrible<00:02:20.370> pull<00:02:20.850> off<00:02:21.060> then

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
ARMA 2 was like a horrible pull off then

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.240 
ARMA 2 was like a horrible pull off then
wasn't<00:02:21.900> even<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> port<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.709> was<00:02:22.799> built<00:02:23.160> ground

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
wasn't even a port it was built ground
