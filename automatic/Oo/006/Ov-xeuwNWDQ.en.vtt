00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.240
 hello to all and all these courses you 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.520
 found for a new video on 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.570
 breaks all clash so in this video 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.300
 I'm going to talk a little about 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.660
 news that we have announced in the 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.150
 game 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.920
 So I already seem to 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.760
 first novelty so it would be to by 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.970
 report to the waves 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.610
 so I'll tell you exactly what 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.060
 so the tacc of the monsters is written by 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.640
 teams 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.079
 prepare your crashers heroes it will be 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.550
 soon time to team up and 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.649
 defend together in the attack of 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.090
 monsters attack him monsters 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.430
 multiplayer is in the preparation phase 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.859
 and will be very posh very soon 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.969
 available for more information 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.550
 tomorrow on facebook 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.039
 so here they are advancing a 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.570
 team monster attack we will 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:01.269
 defend I think the waves with your 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.649
 team so your guild so I know 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.660
 not sure how this is gonna work 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.430
 that they are going to merge them finally is this 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.720
 we will be able to put several 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.730
 many bases at ba that's enough 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.980
 weird enough because we want we can 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.690
 to see a picture you there I would put it 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.310
 maybe, but hey, we do not see big 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.790
 things on we just see that there are 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.930
 a lot of tricks and a lot of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.640
 a lot of archers' tricks and a lot 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.220
 of magic tricks so that means he 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.600
 there are necessarily several bases but 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.440
 good in my opinion the picture was taken 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.820
 like that so that's so I have it 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.620
 do not know anymore but it seems to be 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.440
 really not bad so already it's okay 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.500
 improve being a team this the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.610
 favor so that was really good 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.240
 then there is a second ad did 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.850
 been made 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.290
 so it's better attention crashers a 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.120
 boss is approaching in search of 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.150
 new lands and compel the 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.440
 control of the lost kingdom so the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.180
 lost kingdom you know everything 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.340
 simple it's here will you be up to 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.010
 upon his arrival to defend your lands 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.900
 new treasures join forces 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.600
 with the help of your epr guild members 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.360
 to prepare tactics and courage for 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.470
 new epic battles 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.300
 then it's written punchy novelties 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.010
 do not forget to expand your lands 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.840
 wanting decor is maybe a shop 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.940
 secret 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.349
 this one will contain objects of 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.530
 secret objects for the moment 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.400
 so here it is not yet too much to 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.190
 what to keep 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.870
 but it will happen in the lost realm 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.340
 we could still team with 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.680
 further developed being 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.319
 a guild so that's it's really not 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.670
 wrong 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.230
 otherwise I wanted to make you a little 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.590
 second draw as you can 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.250
 see I have 2216 so I like that 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.260
 close 14 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.610
 yes it will make fourteen prints I 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.739
 believe then I want to open my card 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.500
 special hero I do not know if she can 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.620
 contain the dracula that one where one 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.060
 will see well so that's how you 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.769
 know i hope the dracula 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.930
 after if it's Santa Claus it's not 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.269
 bad either because I have a lot of 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:09.390
 books I believe - 827 blue book already I 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.459
 am soon to the limit and 287 raped 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.629
 so here I really have something to do if 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.269
 I have a new hero a plus and 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.340
 a lot of an honor sign so that's it 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.760
 I hope I will have a new 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.680
 hero otherwise on the j dresses currently 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.750
 so you see it's the first six 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.400
 so with those there I get to do the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.530
 bad at now no longer need the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.840
 succubus the wave is also done 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.730
 so you do not need succulents anymore 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.310
 really not bad but I find that my 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.599
 blog where I do not know if it's me or 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.430
 you will tell me if you knew you 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.859
 will enjoy the same but the wave where I 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.470
 often mana and then and and gold 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.319
 so frankly it annoys me a little so 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.530
 I do it but frankly it's not 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.530
 top for that good here it is my pity has 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.180
 a little evolved 154 7 of 9 should 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.599
 soon make a video on pie xi because 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.099
 that a lot of people do not take it and 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.470
 in fact I find it really very 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.260
 although when you see her in battle 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.769
 of torches or 1 1 against 1 is really 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.079
 strong 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.030
 she is not really fast but with 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.160
 level 5 dispersion the other he even 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.380
 no time to activate his power 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.280
 no no 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.140
 I find it not bad so here you are 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.120
 dracula of course i would replace mini 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.320
 deadly 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 and if not actually in the process of 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.490
 to ride my son is a guide on nine 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.820
 So here we go for the 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.820
 print 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:41.720
 so I make them a bar one always to 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:43.640
 do nothing we will be at free bon bah 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.630
 this is my already it's going to feed my ass 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.390
 ass of a so three draws of actually nothing 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.520
 at all I really hope to have dracula 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.380
 it would be top 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.000
 more for it goes up fast enough I have not 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.710
 badly more fragments to follow to the clan 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:07.720
 9,000 young people and even be 10400 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.720
 really a lot to motivate them 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.510
 pandora shaman already begins to a 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.840
 boat 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:23.540
 but as you know how to use schirm 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.920
 elite hero what am I doing what is it 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.680
 really practical in the east in the 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.840
 magic tricks 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:34.610
 so I do like that after everyone 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:40.040
 see noon at his door as they say here 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.420
 and the rest for my pid we will talk 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.670
 of a tactical hand I will show you 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.560
 what to do but I believe in it 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.730
 not at all 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.500
 for example told me about this but I'm going 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.160
 show you a big c click several 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.500
 times out of the 150 just do not see this 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.810
 that you shoot after you look at 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.430
 times you have one of a legendary but 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:04.689
 I do not think so at all 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:07.659
 do it again I see that blue 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:09.189
 so it's not great but to go more 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:13.509
 quickly I'll put them there a foot 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:17.159
 high but elite go no I have left 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:23.679
 how much their rim role remains minus nine 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:31.659
 legendary voice this is not possible 

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:35.259
 that leaves only two kroll at the end 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:38.199
 it's not possible I always have my 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:43.659
 legendary hero card even I believe 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:45.939
 not many dream to the champions 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:47.439
 gelatinous but no but why they 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:50.979
 have it violated am here too that gives 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:53.589
 false hopes to the law can come out 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.449
 well that's good prints really 

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:58.119
 no 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:05.349
 not to make laugh my card of heroes 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:07.149
 legendary not bad yes I do not even know 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:12.149
 if we can have it dracula of good way 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:12.149

 nothing very very beautiful for this video 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.450
 never mind 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.550
