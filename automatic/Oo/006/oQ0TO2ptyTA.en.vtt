00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.029
 it is quite heavy weighty 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.310
 we got this device 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.230
 small camera with this huge 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:37.640
 flash pretty cool 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:40.370
 it looks now we turn it on flash 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.820
 ready to work passed with you 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.550
 set up 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.930
 camera for flash photography 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.519
 I will not go into details 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.720
 technical who cares 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.320
 then you can additionally see 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.409
 information on the Internet 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.979
 tab we see flash control 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:08.920
 flash allowed on e t it 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.030
 auto flash tower 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.000
 automatically contact the camera 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.250
 the camera assesses the situation and gives 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.040
 flash signal which impulse to give 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.759
 when with what frequency with what force and 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.549
 so on I have an estimate you can 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.310
 put the weighted average but I tell you 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.149
 I advise when you shoot a person is 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.359
 better stop 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:36.259
 estimated when you shoot where 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:39.789
 a lot of things a lot of things a lot of people 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.079
 let's say the crowd then expose the rays 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.020
 weighted on the next item 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.659
 very important sync speed 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:52.820
 a flash vp aries with us and our mode 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:56.119
 in the aperture priority mode open 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.170
 this item here is three auto items 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:05.200
 excerpt one 200 one sixtieth auto 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.460
 and 1,200 seconds fixed i 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.890
 advised you to choose this item 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.979
 when shooting 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.340
 let's put a person 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.879
 and the camera fix exposes 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.709
 excerpt 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:21.030
 1,200 and based on this excerpt 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.629
 flash is configured that is, we have 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.440
 there will always be an excerpt of one 200 on this 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:32.129
 prevent smas jitter 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.620
 camera and it will always be normal frame 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.950
 external flash settings go 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.730
 here in this camera pretty 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.940
 poor menu 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.870
 it's worth it 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.239
 auto sync here we are 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.379
 we can set 1 curtain for the second 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.709
 blind but i would say that firstly 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.540
 curtains still leave and compensation 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.780
 flash exposure here we can 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.220
 adjust pulse power do 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.049
 him 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:09.150
 darker ie weaker and brighter stronger then 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.660
 There is if you set + 2 to this full 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.690
 power our flashes here are head and 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.690
 extends when we push the head 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.980
 flash power increases as u 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.410
 I am standing now 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.840
 40 millimeter lens is desirable 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.700
 surely this zoom expose the flash light 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:39.090
 will be more powerful and make up while on the car 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.630
 aperture 2 and 8 shutter speed we will have 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.480
 two hundred 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.319
 here we have an estimated measurement but 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.609
 raw format with these settings we are with you 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.120
 we can already take pictures with 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.120
 external flash 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.220
 the only minus of this camera is that 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.310
 she does not allow to use 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.910
 at the same time several flashes on 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.670
 distance other models such 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.050
 opportunity give that is if we have 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.270
 was this function mountable 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.000
 camera then we could have this flash 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.400
 not to wear on hot shoe to put 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.910
 somewhere in the room one second 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.980
 third flash and when taking pictures 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.160
 they would light themselves 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.200
 at a distance well this model is where 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.650
 Three functions do not support, but I think 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.010
 that we don't need this function either 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.320
 pretty single flash and with the help and and 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.890
 we will do wonderful with you 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.170
 photos in the next lesson I tell you 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.680
 I will talk about the use of external 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.730
 flashes 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.220
 how to photograph with the help of 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.430
 external flashes and how to get good 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.690
 photos next lesson 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.690
 will be out soon 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.900
 but
