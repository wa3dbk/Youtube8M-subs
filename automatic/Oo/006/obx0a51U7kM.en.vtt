00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.419

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:35.320

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:38.430
 sms dotcom dotcom and server 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.470
 it's called charge grass 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.390
 Well, I like that man a lot because 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.840
 has several things I think that here I go 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.440
 to be playing from now on 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.390
 has what is being good this does not 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.090
 survival in sky block hunger games' 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.330
 stewards has you game or is the elbows 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.940
 of TNT as have terror and says that egg 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.820
 Explain 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:10.020
 hayden without mediating not the server 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:14.130
 bryant teta words is very good 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.170
 this does not marry this either not what 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.320
 I know in his games neither pixel moon 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.289
 but you see creative flight I do not know about 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.140
 conquest of feet in the bedroom of this 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.020
 I like it a lot because they give you more 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.600
 can of stone a bow and an arrow if 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.310
 you hit the enemy with an arrow with the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.929
 arrow that you got you kill it 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.620
 instantly and they give you another arrow 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.710
 to kill the second enemy 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.810
 but if you spend the arrow you will have 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.610
 to go kill him with the sword of a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.840
 body to be very dangerous because if he 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:53.300
 He has the arrow because he kills you and good to 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.660
 see let's continue in this skyworks thing that is 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.610
 very good also at the moment because to me 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.860
 I really like the server and crown 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.900
 by that of towers and also the games of 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:09.550
 labors but that's initial good if it's 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.190
 everything this server has 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.070
 practically using in the box what 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.819
 which it is all you have to do see 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.999
 in has more things but 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.700
 you have more things besides this has 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:28.780
 many little things and was more makes than 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.780
 that are invisible 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.910
 invisible 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.540
 as it appears to see them and good here 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.630
 this I do not know what it is but well you 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.470
 deactivated that this so they give you the 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.480
 two taxes to jump 2 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.150
 tennis to modify your character 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.150
 customized with armors 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.850
 random says I do not have permission for this 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.860

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.780

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.450
 this server good I think it's 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.600
 recording I do not know the truth this will be a 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.940

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.710

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.010
