00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:06.740
 super trees you can laugh that my mother what 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.790
 I say all the videos of cars that do not 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.039
 I know they have that I do not get tired of 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.959
 driving the boys then in this video 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.309
 I bring you a new mystery you heard like 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.599
 than the 100 bis standard but this has 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.370
 little bit dyster expressed a mystery 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.890
 pretty funny me when I saw it 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.900
 true that quite funny and good 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.310
 the location as I always do in case 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.410
 you want to come see it with you 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.940
 own eyes well just here it's worth 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.290
 right here on the beach side of 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.240
 the saints to whom rightly in this 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.039
 area next to the hairdresser and good 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.620
 Well, what can we find in this area? 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.120
 so look carefully we got out of the car 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.650
 and as you can see here there is a kind of 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.300
 view the road obviously and here 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.250
 as a kind of place where there is a 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.050
 store bat not because there is a store that 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.230
 It has a rather peculiar name 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.730
 which is this as you see 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.700
 germinator and many maybe I saw it 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.290
 deducted but I will thor 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.970
 I have sincerely seen it automatically 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.410
 thought about terminator that is the movie 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.220
 this one 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.320
 the protagonist is york suaste black 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.180
 called a rather weird and good name 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.489
 Well, germinated, I do not know, I think 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.080
 comes from terminator and it's really good 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.120
 this could make a variation a 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.760
 assumption but there is something that confirms 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.470
 that germinator a great post there by 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.020
 terminator and what is it that confirms 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.310
 Well, there you see the guy with the glasses 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.080
 because of terminator he always used 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.640
 wear glasses and apart has a kind 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.280
 of sandwich that you put on and will be back 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.170
 which means going back and coming back was what 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.850
 he said to that arnold schwarzenegger he 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.800
 called by not claiming that it was the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.420
 character that was terminator and in 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.710
 a scene from the movie one of the most 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.320
 famous I would say the movie says 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.910
 back is and then that's what 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.860
 confirms that terminator has put it 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.509
 there for by terminator no and well then 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.539
 as you can see is I do not know is that a PC 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.580
 replica in which is kind of like 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.110
 of store plants and the bet and 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.550
 when I know how to make it graceful and 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.259
 you see it is not pretty when 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.310
 I saw it I was quite surprised and I 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.450
 it did quite pretty grace so 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.950
 well here you have it as I say in the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.360
 location that has been taught before then 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.690
 you can look at it here here 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.979
 of germinated something that good more 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.330
 Terminator does not put the one before but 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.040
 well here that puts terminator 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.050
 but as I say what confirms it full 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.500
 it is here that he puts there will be back and what 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.240
 of the glasses to wear terminator and if 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.460
 you have not seen the movie you can see it 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.170
 because really impressive the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.460

 he still remembers made a video of 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.420
 mask surveys and I said that the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.100
 mask that will win because it will be the one with 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.450
