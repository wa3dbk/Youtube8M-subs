00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.670
 10 automatic coolant liquid filtration system for machine tools in Japan 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.970
 Nax 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.600
 Pipe cp is a powder soya milk machine 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:18.630
 Spring ー ー ー ー ー さ い る precoat system 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:23.220
 It is a filtration system combined with a dehydrator 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.440
 This system supplies np powder with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.160
 Do filtered pre-coated in spring Filter 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:35.630
 Repeat precoat filtration backwashing 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 Dehydrate the powder which has lost its ability by dehydrator later 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:46.350
 Make a cake and drain 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:49.379
 It is the feature of the sounding cp to perform all of these series of operations fully automatically 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.570
 This system is a core filter 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:58.150
 I use a spring filter 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:03.400
 Spring filter has become a strong build in stainless steel 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:06.580
 And Shi open Accordingly eyes that spring is extended, on the other hand the war 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.930
 It is characterized by not clogging 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.550
 Prefiltered paper with its spring filter 2 np powder 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:20.040
 Create a filter 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:26.570
 This np powder is automatically supplied by the feeder. 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:32.170
 When precoating is complete, the filter is completed and filtration is performed 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:35.850
 High precision filtration is performed by our special mp powder 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:43.670
 It becomes like this when it expands 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:47.210
 The sludge in the dirty liquid is adsorbed on the surface of np powder and the old part is discharged 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:53.980
 Little precipitation due to precoat filtration 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:59.430
 It is also characterized by its ability to recover 1 micron level ultra-small sludge inexpensively 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:03.240
 If a filter clogged is detected, it will take a counter battle 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:09.429
 It opened a gap of defeat sometimes spring 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:14.819
 Drop the powder and sludge completely by flushing the station 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:21.130
 Stir approximately 1000 powders and sludge in a stirring tank 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:24.460
 Use the stirred powder again for other precoated paper 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.840
 Sludge that was dense on the surface of the filter 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:34.340
 By dispersing in np powder 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.340
 A new station passage will be secured and you will be able to age further 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.880
 I will do the cruise ship again 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.450
 By using powder repeatedly 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.450
 You can minimize the consumption of powder 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:59.159
 Np powder filtration capacity is no longer will be sent dehydrator 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:02.359
 Dehydrator np powder becomes a cake place 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.359
 Will be discharged into the tray 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:15.260
 The discharged mp powder can be depreciated and the cost of industrial waste can be reduced 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:20.890
 Discharge of cake also cleans the inside of the dehydrator 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.890
 This battlefield prevents clogging of the dehydrator 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.900
 The feature of this filtration system is the powder supply 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.580
 Whether vitiligo precoat 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.600
 Backwashing dehydration 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:41.220
 It is that you have done all of the steps of dewatering machine washed with automatic 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.750
 Also every time a clogged filter is detected 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.190
 About 1000 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.780
 Repeat stirring precoat filtration 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:57.650
 This is called cycle precoat 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:59.900
 Cycle precoat for maximum utilization of np powder and stable filtration 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:07.870
 Provides accuracy 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.870
 And all of them are automatically determined and executed by Nux cp 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:19.000
 backs cp had a such a feature 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.000
 Fully automatic coolant liquid filtration system for machine tools
