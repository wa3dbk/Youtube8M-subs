the 2001 this little transfer here is a
bit<00:02:22.650> more<00:02:22.800> fancy<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.610> got<00:02:23.760> bits<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.090> black<00:02:24.239> in

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.840 
model as I said before loads of changes
massive<00:02:31.739> amount<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.070> changes<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.580> eye<00:02:32.610> one

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
massive amount of changes to the eye one

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.420 
massive amount of changes to the eye one
since<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.239> first<00:02:33.480> came<00:02:33.690> out<00:02:33.840> back<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.110> 98<00:02:34.620> I've

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
since it first came out back in 98 I've

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.830 
since it first came out back in 98 I've
already<00:02:35.790> mentioned<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.209> gearbox<00:02:36.660> that's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
already mentioned the gearbox that's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.809 
already mentioned the gearbox that's
different<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.470> bit<00:02:37.800> more<00:02:37.980> rideable<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:38.730> there

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
different a bit more rideable but there

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.729 
different a bit more rideable but there
are<00:02:38.910> some<00:02:39.030> obvious<00:02:39.239> changes<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.260> shape<00:02:40.500> is

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
are some obvious changes the shape is

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.590 
are some obvious changes the shape is
slightly<00:02:41.310> different<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:41.970> kind<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.329> still

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
slightly different it's kind of still

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.930 
slightly different it's kind of still
the<00:02:43.200> same<00:02:43.410> sort<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.739> thing<00:02:43.920> really<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.790> is

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the same sort of thing really but it is

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.460 
the same sort of thing really but it is
slightly<00:02:45.299> different<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.840> fairing<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.260> has

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
slightly different the fairing that has

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.350 
slightly different the fairing that has
been<00:02:46.650> revised<00:02:47.430> that's<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.940> word<00:02:48.060> they<00:02:48.209> like

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
been revised that's the word they like

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.960 
been revised that's the word they like
to<00:02:48.510> use<00:02:48.630> these<00:02:48.810> days<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.320> Yamaha<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.790> say

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
to use these days and Yamaha like to say

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.229 
to use these days and Yamaha like to say
that<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.329> fairing<00:02:52.140> now<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.590> slippier<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:54.060> a

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
that the fairing now is slippier it's a

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.850 
that the fairing now is slippier it's a
slippy<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> bike<00:02:54.900> what<00:02:55.170> knows<00:02:55.350> does<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.680> mean

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
slippy a bike what knows does that mean

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.229 
slippy a bike what knows does that mean
more<00:02:56.010> what<00:02:56.489> that's<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.790> mean<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.090> it's

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
more what that's the mean is it's

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.870 
more what that's the mean is it's
actually<00:02:57.420> more<00:02:58.130> aerodynamic<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.310> got<00:02:59.489> a

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
actually more aerodynamic it's got a

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.580 
actually more aerodynamic it's got a
better<00:03:00.269> drag<00:03:00.570> coefficient<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.440> all

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
better drag coefficient and all

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.780 
better drag coefficient and all
technical<00:03:02.040> things<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.579> don't

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
technical things like that don't

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.520 
technical things like that don't
understand<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.329> myself<00:03:03.420> but<00:03:03.810> slightly

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
understand it myself but slightly

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.840 
understand it myself but slightly
different<00:03:04.650> shape<00:03:05.070> but<00:03:05.220> still<00:03:05.430> looks<00:03:05.640> dead

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850

we've<00:03:23.940> also<00:03:24.090> got<00:03:24.420> magnesium<00:03:25.079> engine<00:03:25.829> covers

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
we've also got magnesium engine covers

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.150 
we've also got magnesium engine covers
now<00:03:26.280> which<00:03:26.820> helps<00:03:27.660> us<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.900> weight<00:03:28.170> down<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.709> just

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
now which helps us a weight down to just

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.729 
now which helps us a weight down to just
over<00:03:29.340> 170<00:03:30.209> kilos<00:03:30.570> with<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.930> which<00:03:31.410> puts<00:03:31.650> it

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
over 170 kilos with this which puts it

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.830 
over 170 kilos with this which puts it
in<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.920> same<00:03:32.100> ballpark<00:03:32.340> as<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> 600<00:03:33.299> CC<00:03:33.480> bike
