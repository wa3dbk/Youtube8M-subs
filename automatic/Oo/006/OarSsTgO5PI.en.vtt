straight back and redo that drawing
and<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.750> practice<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.530> rehearse<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
and just practice and rehearse the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.820 
and just practice and rehearse the
things<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:16.060> went<00:02:16.240> wrong<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.810> just<00:02:17.320> see<00:02:17.800> if

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
things that went wrong and just see if

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.890 
things that went wrong and just see if
you<00:02:18.010> got<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.280> wrong<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.060> next<00:02:19.360> time<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.630> sit

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
you got it wrong and next time you sit

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.190 
you got it wrong and next time you sit
down<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:21.100> same<00:02:21.340> kind<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.670> thing

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
down to do that same kind of thing

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.010 
down to do that same kind of thing
remember<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:24.250> get<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.550> right<00:02:24.760> because<00:02:25.570> that's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
remember to get it right because that's

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.320 
remember to get it right because that's
what<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.230> determined<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.920> do<00:02:27.040> before<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:28.270> you

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
what you determined to do before so you

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.950 
what you determined to do before so you
need<00:02:28.630> never<00:02:28.900> ever<00:02:29.260> fail<00:02:30.220> again<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.780> need

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
need never ever fail again you just need

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.280 
need never ever fail again you just need
to<00:02:32.080> redefine<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:33.130> word<00:02:33.340> failure<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.290> every

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
to redefine that word failure and every

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.320 
to redefine that word failure and every
time<00:02:35.500> anything<00:02:36.040> goes<00:02:36.400> wrong<00:02:36.520> if<00:02:36.940> it's<00:02:37.060> your

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
time anything goes wrong if it's your

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.820 
time anything goes wrong if it's your
fault<00:02:37.570> if<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:37.810> someone<00:02:38.080> else's<00:02:38.440> fault<00:02:38.620> don't

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
fault if it's someone else's fault don't

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.280 
fault if it's someone else's fault don't
worry<00:02:38.980> about<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:40.090> don't<00:02:40.630> care<00:02:40.990> whose<00:02:41.260> fault

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
worry about that don't care whose fault

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.410 
worry about that don't care whose fault
it<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:42.010> that's<00:02:42.340> another<00:02:42.790> problem<00:02:43.120> all

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
it is that's another problem all

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.230 
it is that's another problem all
together<00:02:44.520> think<00:02:45.520> of<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.730> as<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.910> learning

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
together think of it as a learning

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.090 
together think of it as a learning
experience<00:02:47.640> learn<00:02:48.640> from<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.420> move<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.620> and

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
experience learn from it and move on and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.150 
experience learn from it and move on and
