00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.420 
standard skittles which didn't strike me
as<00:02:13.300> being<00:02:13.630> sour<00:02:14.020> almost<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.980> little<00:02:15.250> on<00:02:15.310> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
as being sour almost a little on the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.839 
as being sour almost a little on the
sour<00:02:15.610> side<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:17.160> don't<00:02:18.160> really<00:02:18.370> care<00:02:18.610> too<00:02:18.819> much

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
sour side I don't really care too much

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.970 
sour side I don't really care too much
for<00:02:19.209> these<00:02:19.299> skittles<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.900> think<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.799> one

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
for these skittles I think this is one

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.510 
for these skittles I think this is one
of<00:02:21.010> those

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
of those

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.150 
of those
that<00:02:21.820> they<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.800> wanted<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.860> get<00:02:23.980> out<00:02:24.130> there

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
that they just wanted to get out there

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.650 
that they just wanted to get out there
so<00:02:24.430> they<00:02:24.520> had<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> new<00:02:24.790> product<00:02:25.030> in<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.300> market

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
so they had a new product in the market

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.480 
so they had a new product in the market
that<00:02:25.750> catch<00:02:25.960> people's<00:02:26.350> eyes<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:27.070> other<00:02:27.310> than

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
that catch people's eyes but other than

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.180 
that catch people's eyes but other than
that<00:02:27.550> I'm<00:02:28.090> I'm<00:02:28.540> not<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.990> fan<00:02:29.290> not<00:02:29.500> thrilled<00:02:29.980> and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
that I'm I'm not a fan not thrilled and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.890 
that I'm I'm not a fan not thrilled and
I<00:02:30.250> have<00:02:30.400> no<00:02:30.580> intention<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.210> buying<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.750> one

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
I have no intention on buying this one

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.380 
I have no intention on buying this one
again<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:33.280> gonna<00:02:33.490> hold<00:02:33.700> go<00:02:33.880> ahead<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.270> give

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
again I'm gonna hold go ahead and give

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.800 
again I'm gonna hold go ahead and give
it<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.630> c-minus<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:36.070> think<00:02:37.060> it's<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.330> nice<00:02:37.480> try

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it a c-minus I I think it's a nice try

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.780 
it a c-minus I I think it's a nice try
but<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.470> don't<00:02:38.650> think<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.100> works<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.670> don't

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
but I just don't think it works I don't

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.240 
but I just don't think it works I don't
think<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.420> there<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.830> there's<00:02:42.040> any

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
think that there is that there's any

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.160 
think that there is that there's any
particular<00:02:42.790> new<00:02:43.540> thing<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.050> was

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
particular new thing that was

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.170 
particular new thing that was
established<00:02:44.740> by<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.950> skittles<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.790> mean

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
established by the skittles I mean

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.670 
established by the skittles I mean
unlike<00:02:46.420> some<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.840> other<00:02:46.960> skittles<00:02:47.440> packs

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
unlike some of the other skittles packs

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.190 
unlike some of the other skittles packs
which<00:02:48.210> kind<00:02:49.210> of<00:02:49.240> clearly<00:02:49.570> stand<00:02:49.840> on<00:02:49.930> their<00:02:50.020> own

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
which kind of clearly stand on their own

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.850 
which kind of clearly stand on their own
