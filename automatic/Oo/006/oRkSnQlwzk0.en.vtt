00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.860
 hello cutout friends see us 

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:05.720
 we found here at home club lion and 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.089
 we are here with matías britos forward 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.349
 of the lion matías because as they are 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:12.440
 already facing this important game 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.480
 against saints a semifinal that then 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.580
 pinta also affirmed the forward I do not know 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.800
 well with the truth with much desire 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.300
 team has worked very well be 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.619
 recovered very well because mostly 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.660
 these days was to recover I was going to 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.760
 work a little thinking what is the 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.740
 new rival and and with much desire much 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.720
 expectation the truth that we have a 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.920
 it wins impressive to keep going and 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.509
 we know we have a very strong rival 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.159
 complicated as the saint who has done it 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.870
 very well not only this tournament already comes 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.609
 doing well ago long ago 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.079
 but we trust a lot in our 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.030
 potential and what we can do to 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.489
 to bring out a follow 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.589
 semifinal that promises not many goals 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.120
 two of the offensives because more good than 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.579
 he knows Mexican football like you see 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.469
 this offensive fight that will have this 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.149
 party no doubt as show me 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.129
 I think it's going to be the nicest thing to see 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.859
 there are two teams that propose that 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.170
 try to go forward attack to make goals and 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.729
 well as spectacularly in doubt that 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.409
 we are not going to give 100% 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.269
 Obviously, after we want 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.950
 win we want to make our party more 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.689
 beyond what I can do that 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.130
 make our party win and continue 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.140
 forward that for us is 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.530
 important today the hospital at home 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.119
 it will be to keep the score in zeros 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.710
 not against not receiving goals for 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.479
 get with that although that advantage 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.939
 tower yes for me the most important thing 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.460
 win without doubt that there is a difference 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.170
 which is fundamental after obviously 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.390
 with a second aspect with keeping the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.619
 zero would be very important because 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.299
 theme of the visitor goal and good 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.490
 third if you can make a difference 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.409
 welcome, but I think the most 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.479
 important now is to win and with a 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.890
 result please if you look like a final 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.659
 advanced this game because many 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.049
 the many speak it like that, nothing, I do not know 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.610
 the truth is that 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.770
 each one to your liking and your opinion that 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.450
 can you say for whom is a final 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.760
 advanced or not but for me it is a 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.159
 very complicated game where we play 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.750
 very much where it will not be for nothing 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.950
 easy but if we create our potential 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.720
 and what can we do within the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.520
 shared court forward a year ago 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.369
 The lion was also in semifinals 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.659
 it was with an advantage to tijuana and in the end 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.000
 they were eliminated that has learned 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.720
 lion in this year is for this semifinal 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.790
 that I believe that from that and the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.800
 past tournament that we were good at 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.959
 mature team and learned to play in 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.950
 different circumstances until you know 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.330
 take the games sometimes you can not 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.830
 but you have to win sometimes do not know 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.300
 can close a match but you have to 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.000
 try to do it in different ways 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.340
 so let's wait now learned and if 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.959
 a similar situation occurs 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.940
 take advantage of it you can talk about some 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.860
 favorite in this Matías game I do not think 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.590
 that the series is not very even 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.440
 have proven to be two teams with a lot 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.180
 goal that also defend well and I think 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.560
 that will be very even but but good 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.450
 let's try to probable us by 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.100
 last matías what will be the key against 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.630
 saints all where is the key to 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.630
 defeat 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.460
 do not have a lot of concentration 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.810
 but they are two fundamental aspects and 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.100
 then do not lose our essence 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.540
 leave in no time to be the lion 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.610
 of all the championship that attacks that goes 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.560
 forward trying to be vertical 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.510
 and look to make goals so I think that 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.300
 those aspects are the most important 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.530
 for us and let's hope that the day at 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.210
 Tomorrow's day, come out all right 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.710
 good mate then thank you very much and 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.810
 good luck tomorrow senators this is 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.810
 friends cutouts matías britos
