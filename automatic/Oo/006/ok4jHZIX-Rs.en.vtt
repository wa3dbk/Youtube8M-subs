00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.830
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.650
 mobile dictate this exit tv me 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.189
 just sit in the new opel carl and 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.259
 I would like to briefly mention the infotainment system 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.180
 short and sweet imagine so right 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.420
 There is not much to see 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.769
 So first you think I have it here 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.769
 a 7 inch display a touch display 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.540
 and that is the home state now 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.390
 Principle and view audio gallery 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.250
 I can do phone and apple care play 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.309
 I have one here 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.309
 iphone 5 he connected apple body 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.840
 works with iphone 5 or iphone 6 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.350
 I'll go charming, anyway 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.660
 into the audio and now you have here 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.539
 that looks pretty good that dab radio 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.780
 activated and can now in principle here 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.550
 through the different transmitters 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.050
 if I'm not in the parco 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.449
 I would think so 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.680
 I can not source that 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.840
 know or here fm speak take car 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.759
 and listen to music accordingly 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.849
 But I can also do that 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.910
 iPhone is connected to the iPod 

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:23.229
 drive and have now here with body 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:28.750
 appropriately controlled via usb 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:31.119
 music from the iphone is also available 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.610
 different in the submenu points go 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.330
 but now again on high and climb 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.160
 directly once but not by phone 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.720
 is connected accordingly 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.459
 but here he speaks already 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.209
 I can do that directly into the apple tablet 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.470
 Activate here once 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.130
 the front is always the home button 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.840
 So I can listen to music on the phone 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:59.170
 write or post navigation news 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.649
 The series also hears something like this 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.649
 weather today 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.950
 then he asked me somebody you can 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.090
 new memories and personal 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:26.110
 create new here with apple kp 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.110
 Reminder tomorrow 13 o'clock to buy flowers 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:45.910
 well, please, it's nice, too, I 've got it 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.780
 really still a commercial one 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.780
 volume control I accordingly 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.640
 I can do it on or off 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.930
 now again once he ask 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.300
 another one I do not know if that's me 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:05.500
 Everything has new memories 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.500
 call the dentist tomorrow at 5pm 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.000
 call his doctor 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:33.230
 So that's what it is 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.070
 works new easily 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.640
 try out 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.620
 i can also talk about the above siri 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.450
 switch with the telephone receiver on the 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.040
 I have to activate the steering wheel now 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.320
 not fingering around here anymore 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.209
 can also directly over the thumb on 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.800
 Steering wheel make that report now 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.989
 but here I do not want that at all 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.620
 I wanted to get in the map again 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.100
 go 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.410
 We are here in Amsterdam now 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.180
 Airport can now as soon as I am 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.560
 click on it once on it 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.170
 I choose the goals 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.269
 Can you have my last goals but can 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.310
 also in the address book quasi or the 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.910
 jump in favorites that had us 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.880
 opel prepared here accordingly and 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.160
 what to choose 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.030
 then he expects quasi three routes 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.280
 also the 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.200
 Can I have a look at what is 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:29.810
 the fastest that is the shortest and 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:30.860
 say then start and then the starts 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.810
 navigation 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.090
 that also has us here in holland very much 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.220
 Decently, the only thing I manage 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.570
 to complain about there is no 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.550
 no tempolimits they will not 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.169
 displayed is a bit too bad because 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.790
 the card material should actually 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.580
 also be available 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.889
 well I jump again back now 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.640
 again directly into the music purely here 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.560
 i only have one ups a playlist and 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.669
 Here I can serve myself the same way 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.980
 I think a bit sad 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.790
 applecare play that we cover here 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.520
 not displayed but good too 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.270
 Anyhow, that's what it's all about 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.440
 easy now I can again 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.300
 go back to the menu but in principle 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.820
 was that too i have here yet 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.919
 various settings I make 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.220
 could i if i want the display 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.930
 turn off 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.160
 I find this approach very charming 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.020
 that one really says I give you 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.210
 dear customers really only one 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.400
 display and a radio unit or he 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.169
 his unit holds with me also via usb 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.479
 or bluetooth accordingly 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.440
 can drive 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.090
 navigation system you need similar 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.600
 you have your smartphone and it 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.270
 it should go too 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.680
 yes it was from my side 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.930
 a bit short a bit crisp, though 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.250
 The cup is also short and crisp 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.620
 maybe the review looks like you too 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.600
 yet if you ask has more 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.160
