racing<00:00:17.100> as<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.460> said<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> figured<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.390> needed<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
racing as I said so I figured I needed a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.439 
racing as I said so I figured I needed a
longer<00:00:19.550> warm-up<00:00:20.550> which<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.210> i<00:00:21.240> got<00:00:21.420> in

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
longer warm-up which is what i got in

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.070 
longer warm-up which is what i got in
spent<00:00:22.199> some<00:00:22.320> time<00:00:22.350> stretching<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> quads

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
spent some time stretching out the quads

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.929 
spent some time stretching out the quads
stretching<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.619> stretching<00:00:26.099> out<00:00:26.340> my

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
stretching out so as stretching out my

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.429 
stretching out so as stretching out my
arms<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.390> whatnot<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:27.689> making<00:00:28.109> sure<00:00:28.260> your

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
arms and whatnot just making sure your

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.790 
arms and whatnot just making sure your
bodies<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.160> limber<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.519> possible<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.800> for

bodies as limber as possible for for

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.860 
bodies as limber as possible for for
what<00:00:32.219> you're<00:00:32.369> about<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:32.910> longer

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
harder warm up essentially right up

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
harder warm up essentially right up
until<00:00:36.570> about<00:00:36.750> ten<00:00:37.020> minutes<00:00:37.140> before<00:00:37.530> i<00:00:37.770> start

until about ten minutes before i start

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.290 
until about ten minutes before i start
get<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> course<00:00:40.850> you<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.180> have

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
get out on the course you kind of have

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.090 
get out on the course you kind of have
to<00:00:42.329> start<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.410> easy<00:00:43.620> i<00:00:43.739> think

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
to start it out a little easy i think

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.889 
to start it out a little easy i think
because<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.700> initial<00:00:45.420> hill<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.719> don't

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
because of that initial hill you don't

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.209 
because of that initial hill you don't
want<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.469> blasting<00:00:46.920> through<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
want to just go blasting through the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.950 
want to just go blasting through the
gates<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.879> once<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
gates but once you really get out on the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.860 
gates but once you really get out on the
course<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.980> long<00:00:50.219> false<00:00:50.640> flat<00:00:51.000> country

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
course it's a long false flat country

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.110 
course it's a long false flat country
farm<00:00:52.230> road<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.710> immediately<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.699> realized

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
farm road and immediately I realized

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.720 
farm road and immediately I realized
there's<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> headwind<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.399> lot<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.640> I'm

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
there's a headwind so a lot of what I'm

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.799 
there's a headwind so a lot of what I'm
just<00:00:56.879> repeating<00:00:57.090> through<00:00:57.360> my<00:00:57.480> head<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.750> just

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
just repeating through my head and just

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
just repeating through my head and just
you're<00:00:58.109> thinking<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.350> all<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> time<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
you're thinking about all the time is

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.959 
you're thinking about all the time is
you<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.399> your<00:00:59.489> head<00:00:59.640> down<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.940> your

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
you know get your head down get your

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
you know get your head down get your
head<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> wind<00:01:00.770> keep<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:01.890> cadence

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
head out of the wind keep your cadence

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.219 
head out of the wind keep your cadence
up<00:01:02.340> well<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:02.940> kind<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.120> maybe<00:01:03.809> trying<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
up well it's kind of maybe trying to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.840 
up well it's kind of maybe trying to
figure<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.799> put<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.129> down<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> gear<00:01:05.610> went

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
figure out how put your down a gear went

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
figure out how put your down a gear went
on<00:01:05.970> seeing<00:01:06.210> what's<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.080> fastest<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
on seeing what's going to be fastest and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520 
on seeing what's going to be fastest and
for<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:08.340> perceived<00:01:08.970> effort<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:10.380> try

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
for your perceived effort and just try

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.020 
for your perceived effort and just try
to<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.830> know<00:01:10.860> keep<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.250> breathing<00:01:11.430> calm<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
to you know keep your breathing calm and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.690 
to you know keep your breathing calm and
start<00:01:12.420> really<00:01:13.070> cranking<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> keep

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
start really cranking it out and keep

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030 
start really cranking it out and keep
keeping<00:01:15.150> your<00:01:15.240> speed<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.590> come<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
keeping your speed up and you come to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
keeping your speed up and you come to
you<00:01:17.640> know<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> tight<00:01:18.270> turns<00:01:18.509> but

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
you know some of the tight turns but

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.820 
you know some of the tight turns but
they're<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:18.960> pretty<00:01:19.170> well<00:01:19.380> swept<00:01:19.680> out

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
they're all pretty well swept out

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
they're all pretty well swept out
they're<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.159> pretty<00:01:20.280> wide<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.000> rail

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
they're all pretty wide so you can rail

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.070 
they're all pretty wide so you can rail
most<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.939> to<00:01:23.939> there's<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.509> small<00:01:24.720> kind

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
most of them to there's one small kind

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.420 
most of them to there's one small kind
of<00:01:25.170> stair<00:01:25.350> step<00:01:25.530> climb<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.979> course<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
of stair step climb on the course and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.820 
of stair step climb on the course and
the<00:01:26.520> main<00:01:26.729> climb

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
the main climb

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.340 
the main climb
for<00:01:28.670> me<00:01:28.820> I<00:01:28.850> didn't<00:01:29.540> really<00:01:29.690> slow<00:01:29.960> down<00:01:29.990> much

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
for me I didn't really slow down much

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.600 
for me I didn't really slow down much
going<00:01:30.620> into<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.860> clients<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:31.250> then<00:01:31.370> on<00:01:31.490> the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
going into the clients and then on the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.640 
going into the clients and then on the
climbs<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:31.970> just<00:01:32.150> try<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.300> keep<00:01:32.540> keep<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.500> gas

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
climbs I just try to keep keep the gas

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.380 
climbs I just try to keep keep the gas
on<00:01:33.890> probably<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.580> know<00:01:34.610> ninety<00:01:35.090> ninety-five

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
on probably you know ninety ninety-five

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.860 
on probably you know ninety ninety-five
percent<00:01:35.750> or<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:36.550> not<00:01:37.550> so<00:01:37.790> much<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.210> I'm<00:01:38.660> going

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870
