 This is the Max Spectra and is for the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.239
 iphone 4 and iphone 4s have something very 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.190
 peculiar that is this one has as a 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.740
 strap so that we do not get 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.350
 slide do not fall off we're just going to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.299
 go to unpack what is this 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.720
 funda gentlemen are the cousins ​​of 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.760
 installed case for iphone 4 4 s 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.340
 it's something different I 've never seen 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.170
 a similar cover like this 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.759
 I was looking at their website and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.979
 supposedly it is made to avoid 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.609
 falls and everything else are look at let's 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.189
 proceed to draw here and already is a 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.560
 plastic case brings an iphone 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.000
 lies let's get it out how it will be like 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:41.710
 can be taken out here we take it out 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.200
 and this brings a very installation manual 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.400
 easy very simple and this iphone from 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.890
 lie that the truth that seems a 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.960
 real white iphone that looks at the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.640
 plastic cover is fully brings 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.200
 what are these rubber-like rails 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.160
 so that we can not be scratched 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.470
 iphone at the time we have it 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.250
 installed and bring these parts from here 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.140
 I do not know why and this here 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.479
 they are good look it is very rare the case 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.000
 but let's try it if it's a case 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.160
 as is already inserted look easy 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.050
 that's all we have to do and 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.370
 supposedly this is like a belt 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.060
 to be able to grab it at the time that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.620
 We are watching or we are chatting or 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.590
 checking the internet this piece to 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.970
 Loose machine is stretched and 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.560
 you just put it in what is the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.140
 bottom of your phone in the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.520
 part of here and the sleeve is no longer 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.739
 has a screen design on the table 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.450
 which I think is a little bit bad already 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.070
 that we always want you to have something of 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.260
 screen design to be able to put it 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.060
 upside down 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.819
 the rhythm cuts a full cut 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.349
 like all kinds of inserted cases and 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.780
 at the bottom also the only 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.180
 difference is that after this happens to 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.189
 put here we can see the buttons of 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.739
 this side this does not bring anything I think 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.659
 I hope to give you a different design or 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.610
 some styles bumpers or protection in 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.319
 If nothing falls, it can help 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.230
 on the part of the side buttons 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.420
 volume is totally discovered and the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.730
 hollow of the camera in the back 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.129
 well accurate just does not have much space 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.200
 but it has what is inside 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.379
 black color to avoid giving us 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.760
 problem when using the flash this 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.829
 we will explain what it is for 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.019
 what is this belt and the truth that this 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.580
 I'm really struck by this 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.760
 sense 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.800
 It seems interesting interesting 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.970
 it works in this way gentlemen look 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.520
 we raise in what is the part of here 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.390
 this is an elastic strip and we put it 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.550
 in this way supposedly this is 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.920
 case for this is that it is the max 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.950
 Spectra is to prevent us from falling 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.590
 what is our iphone and it seems very 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.780
 good idea if we will give a little more 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.910
 protection does not slip the iphone and 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.800
 everything else we have a good grip and 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.790
 everything but at the time of being able to use it is 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.470
 very difficult 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.110
 look if I put my hand in this way 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.550
 did not reach the home button then what 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.790
 what do I have to do to get a minimum of 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.770
 12 fingers and we can use what is that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.220
 option 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.230
 if it's good I think it has to be from 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.940
 this way to be able to use it right now 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.070
 that if we do not otherwise reach what 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.680
 which is the power button or the home 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.080
 button just the truth that very good the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.580
 price lords 2999 in the description 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.549
 let's put what is the website of 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.200
 this company if it's worth 29 99 I think 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.660
 that maybe the only bad thing that would have 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.340
 this cover would be that they have not included a 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.650
 screen saver I think that 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.889
 if they include a screen saver already 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.750
 with that this is very good and I think the 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.669
 people will be a little happier to 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.949
 buy this kind of frond very good 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.620
 idea this in regards to 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.020
 protection and what is it they say if 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.580
 does not bring much protection does not bring 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.320
 screen design on the table but not 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.360
 is so necessary because this gives us 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.729
 good protection to be able to avoid 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.000
 what are fallen on the lords this 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:55.460
 with this we went to say goodbye 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.730
