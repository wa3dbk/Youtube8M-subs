00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.260 
the Airstream now a little explanation
on<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.200> cord<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:41.860> our<00:02:42.370> basic<00:02:42.640> chord<00:02:42.970> would<00:02:43.150> be

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
on this cord so our basic chord would be

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.930 
on this cord so our basic chord would be
a<00:02:43.300> B<00:02:43.570> we<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:44.380> make<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.680> B<00:02:44.920> 7th<00:02:45.430> by<00:02:45.640> getting

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
a B we can make this a B 7th by getting

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.940 
a B we can make this a B 7th by getting
rid<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.180> our<00:02:46.300> little<00:02:46.510> finger<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.620> playing

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
rid of our little finger and playing

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.280 
rid of our little finger and playing
this<00:02:48.130> note<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.520> here<00:02:48.760> it's<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.270> b7<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.020> doesn't

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
this note in here it's a b7 but doesn't

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.320 
this note in here it's a b7 but doesn't
sound<00:02:50.470> very<00:02:50.530> spicy<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.370> I'm<00:02:51.970> going<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.180> raise

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
sound very spicy so I'm going to raise

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.130 
sound very spicy so I'm going to raise
the<00:02:52.570> fifth<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.950> create<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.250> b7<00:02:55.120> sharp<00:02:55.570> 5<00:02:55.840> or

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
the fifth and create a b7 sharp 5 or

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.470 
the fifth and create a b7 sharp 5 or
flat<00:02:56.380> 13<00:02:56.860> whichever<00:02:57.700> way<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:57.880> think<00:02:58.060> about<00:02:58.300> it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
flat 13 whichever way you think about it

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.150 
flat 13 whichever way you think about it
and<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.470> here's<00:02:59.710> our<00:02:59.860> chord<00:03:01.890> then<00:03:02.890> we<00:03:03.010> have<00:03:03.130> a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
and so here's our chord then we have a

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.540 
and so here's our chord then we have a
diminished<00:03:03.910> 7th<00:03:04.570> chord<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.020> looks<00:03:05.230> like<00:03:05.290> this

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.740 

this<00:03:09.550> is<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.760> seventh<00:03:10.210> fret<00:03:10.390> we've<00:03:10.600> got<00:03:10.720> a

eighth<00:03:21.520> fret<00:03:21.850> as<00:03:22.000> well<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.970> chord<00:03:25.240> here

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
eighth fret as well in this chord here

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.840 
eighth fret as well in this chord here
and<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.770> can<00:03:26.920> actually<00:03:27.010> move<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.430> up<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.790> down

and you can actually move it up and down

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.730 
and you can actually move it up and down
three<00:03:28.300> frets<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:28.870> it's<00:03:29.080> kind<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.350> awesome<00:03:31.740> and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
three frets so it's kind of awesome and

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.800 
three frets so it's kind of awesome and
it's<00:03:32.950> going<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.160> invert<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:34.420> leads<00:03:34.600> to

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
it's going to invert it so that leads to

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.080 
it's going to invert it so that leads to
our<00:03:34.840> next<00:03:35.140> chord<00:03:35.320> which<00:03:35.470> is<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.710> E<00:03:35.920> minor<00:03:36.460> 7th

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
our next chord which is that E minor 7th

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.040 
our next chord which is that E minor 7th
looks<00:03:37.540> like<00:03:37.720> this

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
looks like this

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.040 
looks like this
you<00:03:39.920> probably<00:03:40.100> know<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.490> minor<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:41.210> get<00:03:41.900> rid<00:03:42.020> of

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
you probably know a minor and get rid of

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.630 
you probably know a minor and get rid of
your<00:03:42.170> little<00:03:42.350> finger<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.770> our<00:03:42.890> two<00:03:43.190> E<00:03:43.220> minor

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.460 
your little finger and our two E minor
seven<00:03:44.060> making<00:03:44.420> sure<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:44.720> keep<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.930> bar<00:03:45.170> here

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
seven making sure you keep a bar here

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.060 
seven making sure you keep a bar here
you<00:03:45.620> could<00:03:45.740> even<00:03:45.860> play<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.220> low<00:03:46.370> E<00:03:46.580> string

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
you could even play the low E string

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.450 
you could even play the low E string
next<00:03:49.070> chord<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.340> an<00:03:49.460> E<00:03:49.670> minor<00:03:50.030> nine

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.550 

and<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.880> can<00:03:53.000> substitute<00:03:53.270> this<00:03:53.720> for<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.080> normal

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
and you can substitute this for a normal

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.040 
and you can substitute this for a normal
minor<00:03:54.770> seventh<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:56.180> I've<00:03:56.300> got<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.690> second

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
minor seventh so I've got the second

fret<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.750> then<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:04.010> next<00:04:04.280> two<00:04:04.370> fingers<00:04:04.760> are

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
fret and then the next two fingers are

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.270 
fret and then the next two fingers are
you<00:04:05.300> can<00:04:05.960> place<00:04:06.170> them<00:04:06.320> like<00:04:06.380> that<00:04:06.680> or<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:07.130> can

new<00:05:09.909> chords<00:05:10.360> and<00:05:10.539> this<00:05:11.080> is<00:05:11.199> a<00:05:11.229> two<00:05:11.709> very<00:05:12.069> simple

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
new chords and this is a two very simple

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.549 
new chords and this is a two very simple
steps<00:05:13.029> first<00:05:13.419> of<00:05:13.629> all<00:05:13.749> you're<00:05:14.199> going<00:05:14.319> to<00:05:14.409> make

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:14.559 
steps first of all you're going to make

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:18.359 
steps first of all you're going to make
sure<00:05:14.589> each<00:05:15.069> chord<00:05:16.139> has<00:05:17.139> clear<00:05:17.679> and<00:05:17.979> crisp

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:18.369 
sure each chord has clear and crisp

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.909 
sure each chord has clear and crisp
notes<00:05:18.759> so<00:05:19.149> for<00:05:19.569> example<00:05:19.899> the<00:05:19.959> G<00:05:20.110> major<00:05:20.349> 7<00:05:20.589> I'll

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
notes so for example the G major 7 I'll

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.129 
notes so for example the G major 7 I'll
go<00:05:21.099> through<00:05:21.309> each<00:05:21.459> note<00:05:21.759> individually<00:05:22.419> make

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
go through each note individually make

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.449 
go through each note individually make
sure<00:05:23.319> you're<00:05:23.499> on<00:05:23.529> the<00:05:23.739> points<00:05:24.189> of<00:05:24.309> your

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:24.459 
sure you're on the points of your

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:27.899 
sure you're on the points of your
fingers<00:05:25.289> which<00:05:26.289> on<00:05:26.499> each<00:05:26.709> note<00:05:27.009> is<00:05:27.279> good<00:05:27.519> and

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
fingers which on each note is good and

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.149 
fingers which on each note is good and
then<00:05:28.029> secondly<00:05:28.629> the<00:05:29.619> way<00:05:29.649> to<00:05:29.799> learn<00:05:30.009> these

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
then secondly the way to learn these

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.359 
then secondly the way to learn these
chords<00:05:30.489> is<00:05:30.549> to<00:05:30.699> pick<00:05:30.879> two<00:05:31.119> any<00:05:31.449> two<00:05:31.599> and

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:32.369 
chords is to pick two any two and

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:35.249 
chords is to pick two any two and
practice<00:05:33.369> going<00:05:33.610> in<00:05:33.819> between<00:05:34.029> those<00:05:35.019> good

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
practice going in between those good

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.839 
practice going in between those good
chords<00:05:35.589> so<00:05:35.739> I<00:05:35.799> might<00:05:35.979> take<00:05:36.129> it<00:05:36.189> if<00:05:36.459> shut<00:05:36.699> man
