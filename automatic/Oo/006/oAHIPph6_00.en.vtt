00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
sometimes when we play against the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.060 
sometimes when we play against the
biggest<00:03:27.430> teams<00:03:27.720> we<00:03:28.720> are<00:03:28.840> more<00:03:29.020> focused<00:03:29.260> we

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
we go to a first group because I think

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.369 
we go to a first group because I think
if<00:03:35.680> we<00:03:35.920> pass<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:37.269> group<00:03:37.569> we<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:38.079> a<00:03:38.109> big

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
if we pass this group we have a big

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:45.000 
if we pass this group we have a big
chance<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:38.709> go<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.640> file

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.550 

if<00:03:46.010> Portugal<00:03:46.730> did<00:03:47.090> get<00:03:47.360> that<00:03:47.570> far<00:03:47.930> then<00:03:48.380> they

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
if Portugal did get that far then they

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.110 
if Portugal did get that far then they
would<00:03:48.710> have<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:48.890> chance<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.520> redeem<00:03:49.670> themselves

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
would have a chance to redeem themselves

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.170 
would have a chance to redeem themselves
