00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
make bikes with that on there so I've

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.000 
make bikes with that on there so I've
built<00:03:31.200> frame-up

it's the pinnacle of cycling endurance
and<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.710> pros<00:04:48.340> do<00:04:48.610> it<00:04:48.640> every<00:04:49.180> single<00:04:49.360> year<00:04:49.720> and

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
and the pros do it every single year and

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.770 
and the pros do it every single year and
a<00:04:50.440> lot<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.220> them<00:04:51.340> would<00:04:51.670> say<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.180> it's<00:04:52.360> one<00:04:52.750> of

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
a lot of them would say that it's one of

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.030 
a lot of them would say that it's one of
the<00:04:52.900> hardest<00:04:53.080> things<00:04:53.410> they've<00:04:53.620> ever<00:04:53.740> done

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
the hardest things they've ever done

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.910 
the hardest things they've ever done
so<00:04:54.400> as<00:04:55.120> an<00:04:55.300> amateur<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.900> try<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.260> attempt<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.740> I

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
so as an amateur to try and attempt it I

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.210 
so as an amateur to try and attempt it I
think<00:04:57.310> is<00:04:57.520> is<00:04:58.270> something<00:04:58.570> else<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.220> there

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
think is is something else and there

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.820 
think is is something else and there
will<00:05:00.340> definitely<00:05:00.580> be<00:05:00.910> times<00:05:01.300> when<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.990> will

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
will definitely be times when I will

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.250 
will definitely be times when I will
wish<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.190> never<00:05:03.460> I<00:05:03.910> never<00:05:04.060> swung<00:05:04.780> my<00:05:04.900> leg<00:05:05.110> over
