it's addicting its addicting I mean when
you<00:01:39.910> have<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.210> machine<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.690> front<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:40.990> you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
you have this machine in front of you

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.360 
you have this machine in front of you
and<00:01:41.290> those<00:01:41.440> throwing<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.830> targets<00:01:42.190> in<00:01:42.280> the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
and those throwing the targets in the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.800 
and those throwing the targets in the
air<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.670> only<00:01:42.850> thing<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.240> want<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.510> scream

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
air is the only thing you want to scream

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.380 
air is the only thing you want to scream
is<00:01:44.050> bring<00:01:44.800> me<00:01:45.040> some<00:01:45.340> more<00:01:45.520> arrows<00:01:45.970> so<00:01:46.180> that<00:01:46.210> I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
is bring me some more arrows so that I

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.690 
is bring me some more arrows so that I
can<00:01:46.660> do<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:46.990> again<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.740> again<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.430> again

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
can do this again and again and again

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.850 
can do this again and again and again
it's<00:01:49.240> one<00:01:49.540> of<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.750> most<00:01:49.840> challenging<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.620> fun
