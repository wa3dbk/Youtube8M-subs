okay followers I know what you're

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.430 
okay followers I know what you're
thinking<00:00:02.460> at<00:00:02.580> this<00:00:02.669> point<00:00:03.020> before<00:00:04.020> when<00:00:04.410> we

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
thinking at this point before when we

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.930 
thinking at this point before when we
were<00:00:04.529> just<00:00:04.650> doing<00:00:04.859> inside<00:00:05.279> hand<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.640> hand<00:00:05.790> it

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
were just doing inside hand to hand it

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.430 
were just doing inside hand to hand it
was<00:00:06.029> very<00:00:06.180> clear<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.839> leader<00:00:07.020> created<00:00:07.379> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
was very clear the leader created the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.020 
was very clear the leader created the
space<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.890> we<00:00:07.980> just<00:00:08.160> went<00:00:08.309> into<00:00:08.490> our<00:00:08.700> inside

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
space and we just went into our inside

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.120 
space and we just went into our inside
hand<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.360> hand<00:00:09.540> now<00:00:10.349> we've<00:00:10.500> added<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.889> kick

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
hand to hand now we've added this kick

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.740 
hand to hand now we've added this kick
around<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.700> all<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.030> sudden<00:00:12.059> as<00:00:12.420> followers

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
around and all of a sudden as followers

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.480 
around and all of a sudden as followers
we're<00:00:12.960> thinking<00:00:13.290> how<00:00:13.710> do<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.889> know<00:00:13.950> which<00:00:14.219> one

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
we're thinking how do I know which one

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.250 
we're thinking how do I know which one
it<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.940> he's<00:00:15.059> trying<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
it is that he's trying to do and the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.740 
it is that he's trying to do and the
answer<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:17.400> don't<00:00:17.430> there<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.359> no<00:00:18.570> way<00:00:18.720> of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
answer is you don't there is no way of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.210 
answer is you don't there is no way of
knowing<00:00:18.869> which<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.410> he's<00:00:19.560> trying<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.010> so

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
knowing which one he's trying to do so

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.429 
knowing which one he's trying to do so
the<00:00:20.340> whole<00:00:20.580> idea<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:21.090> I'm<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:22.170> trying<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
the whole idea is I'm just trying to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.920 
the whole idea is I'm just trying to
continue<00:00:22.830> my<00:00:23.130> motion<00:00:23.519> until<00:00:24.210> he<00:00:24.420> leads<00:00:24.630> me<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
continue my motion until he leads me to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.960 
continue my motion until he leads me to
do<00:00:25.050> something<00:00:25.289> else<00:00:25.500> which<00:00:25.769> means<00:00:26.070> I'm<00:00:26.369> always

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
do something else which means I'm always

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.150 
do something else which means I'm always
trying<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> kick<00:00:28.109> around<00:00:28.230> because<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
trying to do a kick around because the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.830 
trying to do a kick around because the
kick<00:00:29.340> around<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> continuation<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
kick around is a continuation of the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.420 
kick around is a continuation of the
motion<00:00:30.990> I'm<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
motion I'm just going and going and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.400 
motion I'm just going and going and
going<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:33.450> ends<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.719> happening<00:00:33.780> though<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
going what ends up happening though is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
going what ends up happening though is
Jason<00:00:34.770> doesn't<00:00:34.950> let<00:00:35.280> me<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> kick<00:00:35.880> around<00:00:36.000> in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
Jason doesn't let me do a kick around in

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.299 
Jason doesn't let me do a kick around in
every<00:00:36.510> time<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.870> every<00:00:37.260> single<00:00:37.440> case<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.010> he's

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
every time in every single case and he's

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
every time in every single case and he's
going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:38.670> stop<00:00:39.090> me<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.840> watch<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
going to actually stop me so watch the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.780 
going to actually stop me so watch the
amount<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.649> rotation<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.340> actually<00:00:41.550> get

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
amount of rotation that I actually get

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
amount of rotation that I actually get
in<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> normal<00:00:42.300> inside<00:00:42.930> hand-to-hand<00:00:43.469> traulsen

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
in a normal inside hand-to-hand traulsen

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.819 
in a normal inside hand-to-hand traulsen
it<00:00:44.640> would<00:00:44.760> look<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.289> normal<00:00:46.289> inside

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it would look like this normal inside

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.389 
it would look like this normal inside
hand<00:00:47.250> hand<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> even<00:00:52.829> though<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:52.949> talked<00:00:53.250> about

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
hand hand so even though we talked about

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.420 
hand hand so even though we talked about
going<00:00:53.670> 180<00:00:54.180> degrees<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.399> we're<00:00:56.399> both

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
going 180 degrees you can see we're both

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.729 
going 180 degrees you can see we're both
actually<00:00:57.030> rotating<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> lot<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:57.989> than<00:00:58.199> 180

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
actually rotating a lot more than 180

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.110 
actually rotating a lot more than 180
degrees<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.280> I'm<00:00:59.460> trying<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.820> get<00:00:59.969> all

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
degrees because I'm trying to get all

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.389 
degrees because I'm trying to get all
the<00:01:00.239> way<00:01:00.329> around<00:01:00.530> but<00:01:01.530> he's<00:01:01.680> preventing<00:01:02.070> me

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the way around but he's preventing me

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.770 
the way around but he's preventing me
once<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> certain<00:01:03.149> amount<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.420> stretch

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
once we get a certain amount of stretch

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
once we get a certain amount of stretch
so<00:01:04.500> focus<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> hands<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.820> come<00:01:06.030> around

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
so focus on the hands as we come around

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.380 
so focus on the hands as we come around
here<00:01:06.689> she<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:07.830> normally<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
here she would normally be going and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
here she would normally be going and
going<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:09.930> except<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.950> stop<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.610> here

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
going and going except I stop it here

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.030 
going and going except I stop it here
this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> connection<00:01:13.049> point<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.619> really

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
this is the connection point that really

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.859 
this is the connection point that really
tells<00:01:14.250> her<00:01:14.490> we're<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.150> doing<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.570> kick<00:01:15.750> around

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
tells her we're not doing a kick around

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
tells her we're not doing a kick around
we're<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.380> doing<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> inside<00:01:17.009> hand<00:01:17.250> hand

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
we're just doing the inside hand hand

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
we're just doing the inside hand hand
and<00:01:17.610> come<00:01:17.729> back<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> little<00:01:18.930> bit<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and come back so it's a little bit of a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.660 
and come back so it's a little bit of a
break<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:22.040> there<00:01:23.040> again<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:25.009> okay<00:01:26.009> yeah

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
break it's go there again go okay yeah

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.219 
break it's go there again go okay yeah
so<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.150> get<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> nice<00:01:27.540> kind<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.900> stretchy

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
so we get a nice kind of stretchy

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.800 
so we get a nice kind of stretchy
gooshie<00:01:28.590> feeling<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.159> opposed<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
gooshie feeling as opposed to if I

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
gooshie feeling as opposed to if I
didn't<00:01:31.140> wait<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.590> break<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.189> what

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
didn't wait for that break this is what

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.230 
didn't wait for that break this is what
it<00:01:32.430> would<00:01:32.460> look<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.060> lot<00:01:33.210> more

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it would look like it's a lot more

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.060 
it would look like it's a lot more
static<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.290> harder<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.710> see<00:01:34.860> but

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
static it's a little harder to see but

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.380

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
correctly or the kick around because

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.730

there's<00:01:54.240> no<00:01:54.420> connection<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.259> need<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.619> be

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
there's no connection we need to be

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.530 
there's no connection we need to be
engaged<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.270> juice<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.110> hands

engaged and have this juice in the hands

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.959 
engaged and have this juice in the hands
so<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.990> don't<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.799> if<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
so if we don't do that if we have the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.209 
so if we don't do that if we have the
connection<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.659> need<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.500> let<00:02:04.740> go<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
connection that we need and I let go and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.910 
connection that we need and I let go and
don't<00:02:05.549> do<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.630> put<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> brake<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.770> it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
don't do and put on the brake then it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
don't do and put on the brake then it
would<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.190> nice<00:02:08.459> smooth<00:02:09.330> kick<00:02:09.509> around<00:02:09.629> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
would be a nice smooth kick around and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.110 
would be a nice smooth kick around and
it<00:02:09.989> would<00:02:10.080> look<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.319> this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.660 

12345678<00:02:14.120> relief<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.980> then<00:02:15.980> swoop<00:02:16.250> back<00:02:16.460> in
