you<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:43.649> driving<00:00:44.010> lights<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you have your driving lights on the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.779 
you have your driving lights on the
lights<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.600> running<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.930> tail<00:00:46.170> mode<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:47.430> if

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
lights are running in tail mode that if

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.819 
lights are running in tail mode that if
you<00:00:47.910> turn<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.570> blanking<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.469> happens

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you turn on the blanking what happens

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.220 
you turn on the blanking what happens
it'll<00:00:49.950> turn<00:00:50.250> off<00:00:50.309> these<00:00:50.789> lights<00:00:50.960> as<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
it'll turn off these lights as the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.750 
it'll turn off these lights as the
sequence<00:00:52.710> starts<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.340> gives<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> little

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
sequence starts so it gives you a little

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.369 
sequence starts so it gives you a little
bit<00:00:53.910> higher<00:00:54.120> contrast<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.960> I'll<00:00:55.020> show<00:00:55.199> how

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
bit higher contrast and I'll show how

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.099 
bit higher contrast and I'll show how
that<00:00:55.440> works<00:00:56.090> just<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.180> simple<00:00:57.510> circuit<00:00:57.870> board

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109

sweep rate turn it back clockwise it
speeds<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.860> up<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:56.660> can<00:01:56.840> speed<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:57.650> up<00:01:57.710> fast

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
speeds it up you can speed this up fast

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.990 
speeds it up you can speed this up fast
enough<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.820> where<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.979> almost<00:02:01.280> becomes<00:02:01.640> one

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.200 

I'll<00:02:16.890> show<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.130> how<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.370> tail<00:02:17.700> blinking

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
I'll show you how the tail blinking

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.580 
I'll show you how the tail blinking
works<00:02:20.390> right<00:02:21.390> now<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.600> can<00:02:21.900> see<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.440> with

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
works right now you can see this is with

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.730 
works right now you can see this is with
your<00:02:22.710> tail<00:02:22.950> lights<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.960> just<00:02:25.170> does<00:02:25.710> a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
your tail lights on and it just does a

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.120 
your tail lights on and it just does a
ratio<00:02:26.040> sweeps<00:02:26.940> across<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:28.650> flip<00:02:28.920> this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
ratio sweeps across there you flip this

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.130 
ratio sweeps across there you flip this
on<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:32.670> tails<00:02:32.940> will<00:02:33.150> actually<00:02:33.450> turn<00:02:33.660> off<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
on the tails will actually turn off the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.480 
on the tails will actually turn off the
beginnings<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.500> sequence<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.100> see<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> higher

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
beginnings of sequence in see a higher

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.130

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.670 

see<00:02:45.739> how<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.010> whole<00:02:46.189> thing<00:02:46.219> goes<00:02:46.549> together

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.199 

your<00:02:51.680> gasket

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.910 

goes<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.870> top<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.349> here

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.170 

then<00:03:00.459> your<00:03:00.610> lens<00:03:02.340> if<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.459> notice<00:03:03.760> here<00:03:03.970> all

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
then your lens if you notice here all

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.229 
then your lens if you notice here all
the<00:03:04.300> electronics<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:06.060> resistors<00:03:07.060> and

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
the electronics the resistors and

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.930 
the electronics the resistors and
electronics<00:03:07.900> there<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:09.010> area<00:03:09.400> not<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
electronics there in the area not in the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.490 
electronics there in the area not in the
viewing<00:03:10.150> area<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.660> lens<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.230> see

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
viewing area of the lens so you see

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.860 
viewing area of the lens so you see
there's<00:03:11.709> resistors<00:03:12.280> here<00:03:12.459> in<00:03:12.580> electronics<00:03:13.209> so

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
there's resistors here in electronics so

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.740 
there's resistors here in electronics so
when<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.050> put<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.380> lens<00:03:14.590> on<00:03:14.890> in<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.160> bezel

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
when you put the lens on in the bezel

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.750 
when you put the lens on in the bezel
you<00:03:16.750> don't<00:03:16.989> see<00:03:17.290> any<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:18.550> all

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
you don't see any of that it's all

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.850 
you don't see any of that it's all
hitting<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.209> whole<00:03:19.360> idea<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.870> have<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.230> not

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
hitting the whole idea is to have it not

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.030 
hitting the whole idea is to have it not
really<00:03:21.280> stand<00:03:21.610> out<00:03:21.880> as<00:03:22.209> an<00:03:22.600> LED<00:03:22.989> light<00:03:23.260> when

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
really stand out as an LED light when

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:59.610 
really stand out as an LED light when
you<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.459> off

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.380 

yet<00:04:00.620> if<00:04:00.710> you<00:04:00.770> look<00:04:00.980> through<00:04:01.190> here<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:02.150> can't

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
yet if you look through here you can't

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.730 
yet if you look through here you can't
see<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.660> electronics<00:04:03.260> anymore<00:04:03.590> they're

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
see the electronics anymore they're

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.620 
see the electronics anymore they're
hidden<00:04:03.920> under<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.280> reflux<00:04:04.700> under<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.120> gasket

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
hidden under the reflux under the gasket

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.690 
hidden under the reflux under the gasket
and<00:04:05.960> then<00:04:06.380> are<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.620> dividers<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.340> bezel

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
and then are the dividers in the bezel

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.230 
and then are the dividers in the bezel
we<00:04:08.600> didn't<00:04:08.750> turn<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.050> back<00:04:09.200> on<00:04:09.380> for<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:09.740> so

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.199 

there's<00:04:14.240> what<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.510> finish<00:04:14.780> light<00:04:14.990> looks<00:04:15.260> like

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
there's what the finish light looks like

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.490 
there's what the finish light looks like
turn<00:04:17.209> on<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.480> tail

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.700 

thanks<00:04:24.460> for<00:04:24.610> watching
