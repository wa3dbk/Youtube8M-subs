it<00:03:07.420> in<00:03:07.510> which<00:03:07.750> i<00:03:07.870> think<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.109> really<00:03:08.349> good

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
it in which i think is really good

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.839 
it in which i think is really good
considering<00:03:09.040> some<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.340> them<00:03:09.430> i've<00:03:09.579> seen<00:03:09.790> a

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
considering some of them i've seen a

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.550 
considering some of them i've seen a
plastic<00:03:10.889> i<00:03:12.120> think<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.269> is<00:03:13.329> probably<00:03:13.629> one<00:03:14.500> of

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
plastic i think this is probably one of

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.319 
plastic i think this is probably one of
the<00:03:14.680> best<00:03:15.099> ones<00:03:15.549> I've<00:03:15.730> seen<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.120> know<00:03:16.209> I've

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.619 
such high quality so you know the
battery<00:03:27.280> clip<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.699> exactly<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.329> same<00:03:28.449> as<00:03:28.569> all

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
battery clip is exactly the same as all

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.020 
battery clip is exactly the same as all
the<00:03:28.690> others<00:03:28.959> just<00:03:29.370> goes<00:03:30.370> into<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.730> bottom<00:03:30.970> of
