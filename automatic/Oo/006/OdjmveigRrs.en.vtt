00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.440
 welcome to ricky guides this week 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.570
 we continue with the rules of the game of 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.060
 management of high electric companies 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.919
 tension in this video we will see 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.560
 carefully the composition of the 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.480
 different phases of the turns watching 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.880
 especially the auction rules of 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.890
 central purchasing resources and 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.390
 construction of the electrical network according to 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.100
 in the passage of the game that we 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.100
 let's find let's go to it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.370
 the first phase of shifts is always 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.340
 determine the order of play of the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.320
 players in the initial turn the order 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.300
 is determined randomly but from 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.920
 that moment the order is determined 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.780
 for the number of cities that each 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 player has in his electric network 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.449
 the one that has more cities goes the first 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.239
 the next one that has more cities 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.430
 second etcetera in case there are two 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.530
 or more players tied in number of 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.270
 cities the one with the central 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.720
 highest number electric goes in first 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.720
 place 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.950
 the second phase of the shifts is the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.990
 auction of power stations the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.789
 first player of the turn can choose 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.579
 bid for one of the central 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.280
 current market offering at least the 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.020
 number of electrodes that comes the letter 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.329
 if the rest of the players do it 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.149
 turn order can offer a bid 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.189
 higher or pass in the moment that 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.340
 someone passes and can not bid more for 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.049
 that central when someone offers the 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.350
 highest price and the rest of fuck 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.239
 espasa buys that central and steals a 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.939
 letter from the top of the deck of 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.939
 central organizing the market 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.490
 if the player who has to start 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.009
 bid comes from offering money 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.709
 initially by a central will no longer be able 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.869
 bid the rest of the turn if that player 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.209
 started bidding but I can not buy the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.099
 central bank after the purchase of that letter by 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.980
 another player may bid again 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.080
 another central if the market wishes it 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.489
 future serves to forecast the central 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.370
 that they can buy the 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.680
 next bids 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.569
 the last player can usually 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.810
 buy a plant for the minimum bid 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.760
 since nobody will be able to bid against him 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.940
 in the first round it is mandatory 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.970
 buy a central the maximum number of 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.790
 central is 3 except in a game of 2 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.860
 players where the limit is 4 so 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.140
 that you buy a plant more than that 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.019
 number should discard one of the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.360
 you have but one shift 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.209
 nothing and central purchases the central 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.530
 lowest number is discarded and will be stolen 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.530
 to a new deck card 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.680
 the number of each central plus 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.130
 identify it is also the minimum bid 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.620
 acceptable by the central symbols in 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.090
 its lower part and the color identifies 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.520
 in the resource they need to 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.590
 produce electricity and the number of 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.190
 cities that you can supply by spending 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.650
 that resource a central can store 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.240
 twice as many resources as you need 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.600
 to produce energy 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.220
 hybrid plants can use 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.010
 any of the two resources that 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.320
 show the renewable power stations of 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.570
 Green color does not waste any resources 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.570
 to provide energy to cities 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.500
 The third phase is to acquire 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.930
 resources in this phase the turn is going 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.300
 invested and start buying resources 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.090
 the last player finishing acquiring 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.650
 the first player players 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.710
 they buy the resources they want and 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.760
 can store in their central 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.370
 starting with those who have the courage 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.900
 cheaper and paying to the bank for the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.900
 total of spent electros 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.180
 Obviously, as the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.030
 These resources are more expensive for 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.070
 buy them players can 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.930
 distribute the resources purchased from a 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.090
 central to another as long as they have 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.400
 space in those plants and these 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.400
 can store the allocated resources 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.590
 The fourth phase is construction in 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.090
 this phase the turn will also invest 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.000
 starting by building the last player 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.889
 and finishing the first player the 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.540
 players must build in the zones 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.510
 that they have selected to play from 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.840
 map the first city can be built 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.730
 where you want it and it's worth 10 electros but 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.160
 from there you should build on 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.250
 cities connected to the home network and 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.930
 in addition to the 10 electros the cost of 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.630
 the line of communication between two 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.120
 cities do not need to be 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.740
 cities are adjacent but always 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.150
 you have to pay the full cost of 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.930
 connection for example this player could 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.210
 connect stuttgart and bisbal in 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.789
 paying 27 electrodes 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.449
 although mannheim belongs to the network of 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.449
 another player 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.270
 Players do not have to 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.129
 open its mains in 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.680
 first round of play so 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:41.199
 they could choose not to build on that or 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.449
 in any shift whenever it is added 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.509
 a city to the network should be updated 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.759
 the city marker if in some 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.219
 moment there was in the market some 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.349
 central with its equal or lower number 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.719
 to the total of cities that has some 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.180
 of the players this must be 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:01.160
 immediately discarded and rob 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.530
 a new card from the central deck 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.500
 at the beginning of the game you can only 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:10.240
 have a player in each city but 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.240
 this changes in step 2 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.990
 the game starts in step 1 where 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.600
 cities can only be controlled 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.790
 by a player who will pay 10 electros 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.760
 plus the cost of the connection to expand 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.770
 your network up to that place step 2 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.050
 start in a two- player game 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.690
 when one of them gets to have his 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.640
 network 10 cities from three to five 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.300
 players the number of cities for 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.450
 go to step 2 is 7 and in a game of 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.060
 6 players you will reach this step with 6 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.580
 cities 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.320
 in step 2 the players can 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.280
 expand their networks to cities that are 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:55.650
 occupied in areas of value 15 but 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.650
 they will not be able to occupy the 20 zones 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.480
 Step 3 is reached when said 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.700
 card in the center stack already in that 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.260
 step can be built in the areas of 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.260
 the cost cities 20 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.960
 whatever the step no player 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.560
 can occupy two of the areas of the 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.560
 same city 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.650
 and with this the second video of the 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.510
 tutorial of this game in the next 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.700
 video we will see the other rules that are 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.620
 apply in the steps of the game the 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.870
 bureaucracy phase and the conditions of 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.280
 victory if you liked the video not 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.810

 until next time
