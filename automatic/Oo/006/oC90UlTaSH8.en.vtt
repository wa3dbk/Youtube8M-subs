unfortunately our seasons brought down
to<00:00:50.829> this<00:00:50.949> I<00:00:51.929> thought<00:00:52.929> we<00:00:53.109> were<00:00:53.579> admirable<00:00:54.579> in<00:00:54.850> a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
to this I thought we were admirable in a

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.059 
to this I thought we were admirable in a
way<00:00:55.030> we<00:00:55.179> performed<00:00:55.649> especially<00:00:56.649> when<00:00:56.800> we<00:00:56.890> went

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.069 
way we performed especially when we went

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:02.009

down<00:00:57.249> to<00:00:57.280> 10<00:00:57.609> men<00:00:57.640> I<00:00:57.999> thought<00:00:58.989> we<00:01:00.719> matched<00:01:01.719> them

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
down to 10 men I thought we matched them

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.930 
down to 10 men I thought we matched them
tactically<00:01:02.649> even<00:01:03.280> though<00:01:03.399> they<00:01:03.550> pass<00:01:03.760> the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
tactically even though they pass the

tactically even though they pass the
ball<00:01:04.140> fantastic<00:01:05.140> fantastic<00:01:05.979> Lee<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:06.909> they've

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
ball fantastic fantastic Lee and they've

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.539 
ball fantastic fantastic Lee and they've
got<00:01:07.210> good<00:01:07.390> very<00:01:07.689> very<00:01:07.780> good<00:01:08.049> players<00:01:08.439> that<00:01:09.250> can

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
got good very very good players that can

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.389 
got good very very good players that can
that<00:01:10.329> can<00:01:10.390> hurt<00:01:10.689> you<00:01:10.899> at<00:01:11.020> any<00:01:11.170> stage<00:01:11.530> I<00:01:11.829> didn't

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
that can hurt you at any stage I didn't

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.230 
that can hurt you at any stage I didn't
think<00:01:12.549> any<00:01:12.759> of<00:01:12.850> their<00:01:13.119> real<00:01:13.390> match<00:01:13.689> winners

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
think any of their real match winners

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.719 
think any of their real match winners
showed<00:01:16.240> showed<00:01:16.719> what<00:01:16.990> they've<00:01:17.140> done<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.380> our

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
showed showed what they've done to our

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.440 
showed showed what they've done to our
teams<00:01:18.729> in<00:01:18.939> far<00:01:19.180> better<00:01:19.680> positions<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:21.159> us

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
teams in far better positions that us

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.719 
teams in far better positions that us
but<00:01:22.450> when<00:01:23.259> you're<00:01:23.380> playing<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.740> know<00:01:24.430> teams

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
but when you're playing you know teams

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.499 
but when you're playing you know teams
like<00:01:24.909> Liverpool<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:28.030> little<00:01:28.360> bit<00:01:28.479> of

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
like Liverpool that little bit of

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.990 
like Liverpool that little bit of
quality<00:01:29.159> always<00:01:30.159> counts<00:01:30.520> right<00:01:30.670> at<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:30.880> end

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
quality always counts right at the end

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.090 
quality always counts right at the end
and<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:32.590> be<00:01:33.310> fair<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.500> players<00:01:35.770> are

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
and to be fair the players are

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.539 
and to be fair the players are
absolutely<00:01:36.880> devastated<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:39.369> didn't

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
absolutely devastated that we didn't

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.080 
absolutely devastated that we didn't
come<00:01:39.670> away<00:01:39.850> with<00:01:39.880> something

two<00:01:44.090> years<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:45.250> think<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.310> first<00:01:46.460> one<00:01:46.640> was<00:01:46.850> a

come away of nothing again and obviously
the<00:03:42.269> events<00:03:42.659> that<00:03:43.159> earlier<00:03:44.159> and<00:03:44.370> i've<00:03:45.359> put

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
the events that earlier and i've put

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.170 
the events that earlier and i've put
things<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.069> in<00:03:47.069> there<00:03:47.280> right<00:03:47.669> place<00:03:48.000> in

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
things in in there right place in

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.629 
things in in there right place in
context<00:03:48.829> difficult<00:03:49.829> in<00:03:49.980> terms<00:03:50.129> of<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.430> build

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
context difficult in terms of you build

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.539 
context difficult in terms of you build
up<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.939> the<00:03:51.030> game<00:03:51.180> i<00:03:52.040> think<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.129> players<00:03:53.310> use

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
up to the game i think the players use

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.979 
up to the game i think the players use
it<00:03:53.699> as<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.819> strength<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.389> be<00:03:54.510> honest<00:03:54.750> review

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
it as a strength to be honest review

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.209 
it as a strength to be honest review
because<00:03:55.079> i<00:03:55.260> think<00:03:55.319> rio<00:03:55.650> would<00:03:55.889> have<00:03:55.949> wanted

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:56.219 
because i think rio would have wanted

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.020 
because i think rio would have wanted
that<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.639> in<00:03:57.209> any<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.930> he<00:03:57.959> requested<00:03:58.709> that

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
that and in any and he requested that

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.300 
that and in any and he requested that
and<00:04:00.030> i<00:04:00.120> think<00:04:00.389> the<00:04:01.290> players<00:04:01.500> use<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.129> think

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
and i think the players use it I think

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.069 
and i think the players use it I think
we<00:04:02.400> started<00:04:02.699> the<00:04:02.760> game<00:04:02.849> very<00:04:03.060> well<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.959> we

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
we started the game very well and we

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.250 
we started the game very well and we
started<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.439> game<00:04:04.859> very<00:04:05.099> very<00:04:05.430> well<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:06.260> I

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
started the game very very well and I

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.589 
started the game very very well and I
think<00:04:07.730> Liverpool<00:04:08.730> took<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> bit<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.299> time<00:04:09.359> to

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
think Liverpool took a bit of time to

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.449 
think Liverpool took a bit of time to
get<00:04:09.689> into<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.019> game<00:04:10.139> but<00:04:11.329> I<00:04:13.220> wouldn't<00:04:14.220> I

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
get into the game but I wouldn't I

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.740 
get into the game but I wouldn't I
wouldn't<00:04:14.579> say<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.389> would<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.659> a

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
wouldn't say that that would have a

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.449 
wouldn't say that that would have a
bearing<00:04:16.229> on<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.590> fact<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:16.829> we<00:04:17.009> didn't<00:04:17.310> we

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
bearing on the fact that we didn't we

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.240 
bearing on the fact that we didn't we
didn't<00:04:17.699> come<00:04:17.880> away<00:04:18.150> with<00:04:18.389> a<00:04:18.900> with<00:04:19.500> least<00:04:20.130> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
didn't come away with a with least the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.080 
didn't come away with a with least the
