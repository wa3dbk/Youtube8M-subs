in there

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.490 
in there
first<00:00:20.700> one<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.390> jumping<00:00:22.320> exercises<00:00:22.860> jumps<00:00:23.850> are

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
first one is jumping exercises jumps are

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.900 
first one is jumping exercises jumps are
pretty<00:00:25.500> much<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.800> highest<00:00:26.430> rate<00:00:26.610> of<00:00:26.640> horse

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
pretty much the highest rate of horse

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.670 
pretty much the highest rate of horse
development<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.600> being<00:00:28.230> able<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> develop

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
development that being able to develop

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.460 
development that being able to develop
outside<00:00:29.610> a<00:00:29.640> sprint<00:00:30.000> team<00:00:30.120> but<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.320> don't

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
outside a sprint team but I don't

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.229 
outside a sprint team but I don't
suggest<00:00:31.620> that<00:00:31.980> if<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.250> main<00:00:32.369> goal<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> big

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
suggest that if your main goal is a big

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.600 
suggest that if your main goal is a big
squat<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.719> might<00:00:33.870> do<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> lot<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.200> sprinting

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
squat you might do a lot of sprinting

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.979 
squat you might do a lot of sprinting
just<00:00:35.610> too<00:00:35.730> likely<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.149> lead<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.570> hamstring

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
just too likely to lead to a hamstring

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.069 
just too likely to lead to a hamstring
injury<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:38.879> three<00:00:39.120> jumping

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
injury so there are three jumping

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.169 
injury so there are three jumping
variations<00:00:40.589> I've<00:00:40.739> discussed<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.249> there<00:00:41.399> first

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
variations I've discussed in there first

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.009 
variations I've discussed in there first
one<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.539> weighted<00:00:42.870> box<00:00:43.079> jump<00:00:44.749> so<00:00:45.749> I'll<00:00:45.839> wait

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
one is weighted box jump so I'll wait

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.479 
one is weighted box jump so I'll wait
watch<00:00:46.260> them<00:00:46.499> I'm<00:00:46.859> just<00:00:46.949> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> hold

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
watch them I'm just going to hold

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.340 
watch them I'm just going to hold
dumbbells<00:00:47.699> for<00:00:48.089> it<00:00:50.179> fifteen<00:00:51.179> to<00:00:51.659> thirty<00:00:51.870> fives

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
dumbbells for it fifteen to thirty fives

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:06.429 
dumbbells for it fifteen to thirty fives
depending<00:00:52.859> on<00:00:52.949> your<00:00:53.039> jumping<00:00:53.399> ability<00:00:54.319> and

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.380 

so<00:01:07.009> when<00:01:07.100> you're<00:01:07.189> doing<00:01:07.310> jumps<00:01:08.149> holding

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
so when you're doing jumps holding

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.789 
so when you're doing jumps holding
weights<00:01:08.539> in<00:01:08.659> your<00:01:08.780> hand<00:01:08.960> don't<00:01:09.200> try<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.439> swing

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
weights in your hand don't try and swing

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.529

the<00:01:09.979> weights<00:01:10.189> up<00:01:10.399> that's<00:01:11.119> going<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.329> kind<00:01:11.509> of

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
the weights up that's going to kind of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.779 
the weights up that's going to kind of
defeat<00:01:11.899> the<00:01:11.929> purpose<00:01:12.280> when<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:13.340> just<00:01:13.460> let<00:01:13.670> your

ears and it's no longer an exercise of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.900 
ears and it's no longer an exercise of
how<00:02:27.540> well<00:02:27.930> they<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.319> jump<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:29.430> rather<00:02:29.610> an

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
how well they can jump but rather an

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.910 
how well they can jump but rather an
exercise<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.569> how<00:02:30.750> flexible<00:02:31.230> their<00:02:31.470> hips<00:02:31.709> are

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
exercise of how flexible their hips are

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.280 
exercise of how flexible their hips are
and<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.090> don't<00:02:33.209> want<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.810> don't<00:02:33.900> want<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.200> let
