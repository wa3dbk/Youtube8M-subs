going to show you the basic beginner
stuff<00:00:24.089> from<00:00:24.330> isolation<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.500> if<00:00:25.589> you're<00:00:25.710> just

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
stuff from isolation so if you're just

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.009 
stuff from isolation so if you're just
getting<00:00:26.039> started<00:00:26.339> contact<00:00:26.939> up<00:00:27.089> on<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.810> should

getting started contact up on it should

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.339 
getting started contact up on it should
be<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> perfect<00:00:28.650> move<00:00:29.089> perfect<00:00:30.089> video<00:00:30.749> here<00:00:31.109> for

be a perfect move perfect video here for

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.180 
be a perfect move perfect video here for
you<00:00:31.439> because<00:00:32.750> isolations<00:00:33.750> look<00:00:34.650> very

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
you because isolations look very

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.130 
you because isolations look very
difficult<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.880> they<00:00:36.360> don't<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.720> how<00:00:36.930> it's

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
difficult and they don't know how it's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410 
difficult and they don't know how it's
done<00:00:37.350> look<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.860> amazing<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.550> eye<00:00:38.580> but<00:00:39.000> it

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
done look so amazing to the eye but it

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.070 
done look so amazing to the eye but it
is<00:00:39.630> so<00:00:39.990> very<00:00:40.140> easy<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.800> once<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
is so very easy to do once you know the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.320 
is so very easy to do once you know the
technique<00:00:43.130> so<00:00:44.130> these<00:00:44.790> are<00:00:44.970> some<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.150> the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
technique so these are some of the

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:53.480 
technique so these are some of the
isolations<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:47.100> i'll<00:00:47.220> be<00:00:47.310> teaching<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:53.340> it

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
isolations that i'll be teaching and it

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.260 
isolations that i'll be teaching and it
takes<00:00:53.870> some<00:00:54.870> practice<00:00:55.190> like<00:00:56.190> anything<00:00:57.150> else

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
takes some practice like anything else

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.820 
takes some practice like anything else
yeah<00:00:57.750> but<00:01:00.650> that's<00:01:01.650> another<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.320> now<00:01:04.320> what

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
yeah but that's another one and now what

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.230 
yeah but that's another one and now what
I'm<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> teach<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.600> basics

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
I'm going to teach you is the basics

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.780 
I'm going to teach you is the basics
first<00:01:09.320> isolation<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.800> don't<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.670> it's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
first isolation I don't know what it's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
first isolation I don't know what it's
called<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.410> here's<00:01:13.410> how<00:01:13.620> to<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.930> now<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
called but here's how to do it now to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.450 
called but here's how to do it now to
perform<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.460> actual<00:01:18.110> isolation<00:01:19.110> move<00:01:19.460> this

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
perform the actual isolation move this

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.180 
perform the actual isolation move this
is<00:01:20.640> basically<00:01:22.820> removed<00:01:23.820> without<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.300> ball<00:01:25.190> so

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
is basically removed without the ball so

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.930 
is basically removed without the ball so
basically<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:29.900> with<00:01:30.900> both<00:01:31.200> of

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
basically going like this with both of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.740 
basically going like this with both of
your<00:01:32.940> hands<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.690> then<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:36.180> take<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> ball

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
your hands and then just take the ball

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.440 
your hands and then just take the ball
as<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.440> practice<00:01:38.070> put<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.760> hands<00:01:38.970> around<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
as a practice put your hands around it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.070 
as a practice put your hands around it
just<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:42.680> slowly<00:01:44.690> put<00:01:45.690> pressure

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
just like this and slowly put pressure

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.240 
just like this and slowly put pressure
in<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:47.130> thumb<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:48.229> this<00:01:49.229> finger<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.010> middle

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
in this thumb and this finger the middle

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.330 
in this thumb and this finger the middle
finger<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.830> let<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:52.860> go<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.370> that<00:01:53.990> okay<00:01:55.340> so

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
finger and let it go like that okay so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.210 
finger and let it go like that okay so
bring<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:59.240> in<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:01.200> basically<00:02:01.860> this

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
bring it out and in so basically this

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.350 
bring it out and in so basically this
finger<00:02:02.760> and<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.510> finger<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:05.100> thumb<00:02:05.369> my<00:02:06.000> left

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
finger and this finger the thumb my left

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.469 
finger and this finger the thumb my left
thumb<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:07.500> right<00:02:07.830> middle<00:02:08.220> finger<00:02:08.479> aren't

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
thumb and my right middle finger aren't

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
thumb and my right middle finger aren't
doing<00:02:09.629> anything<00:02:10.049> they're<00:02:10.409> just<00:02:10.440> guiding<00:02:11.189> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
doing anything they're just guiding the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.349 
doing anything they're just guiding the
ball<00:02:11.609> as<00:02:11.909> a<00:02:11.939> support<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.950> my<00:02:14.430> right<00:02:14.969> thumb

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
ball as a support but the my right thumb

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.100 
ball as a support but the my right thumb
in<00:02:15.629> my

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
in my

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.650 
in my
the<00:02:16.260> middle<00:02:16.500> finger<00:02:16.890> or<00:02:17.180> doing<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> work

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
the middle finger or doing all the work

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.150 
the middle finger or doing all the work
so<00:02:18.960> this<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.440> what<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:19.710> like<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.680> all<00:02:23.010> it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
so this is what it's like this is all it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.520 
so this is what it's like this is all it
is<00:02:23.810> now<00:02:24.810> once<00:02:25.080> you've<00:02:25.290> got<00:02:25.530> up<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.070> hear<00:02:27.530> you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
is now once you've got up to hear you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.820 
is now once you've got up to hear you
switch<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:30.000> now<00:02:30.240> you're<00:02:30.480> let<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.350> your

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
switch so now you're let them and your

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.470 
switch so now you're let them and your
right<00:02:32.040> middle<00:02:32.220> fingers<00:02:32.670> doing<00:02:33.060> all<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.330> work

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
right middle fingers doing all the work

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.530 
right middle fingers doing all the work
and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.320> once<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.590> come<00:02:34.770> up<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.950> their<00:02:35.540> it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
and then once you come up to their it

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.320 
and then once you come up to their it
switches<00:02:37.200> when<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.190> get<00:02:38.340> up<00:02:38.460> there<00:02:38.790> it

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
switches when you get up there it

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.740 
switches when you get up there it
switches<00:02:40.310> like<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:42.140> but<00:02:43.140> if<00:02:43.230> you're<00:02:43.410> saying

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
switches like that but if you're saying

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.090 
switches like that but if you're saying
you<00:02:45.750> put<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.080> pressure<00:02:46.320> on<00:02:46.530> your<00:02:46.800> middle

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
you put the pressure on your middle

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.220 
you put the pressure on your middle
fingers<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.670> your<00:02:47.730> thumbs<00:02:48.260> but<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.080> do

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
fingers and your thumbs but you just do

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
enough that it won't release and you

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.430 
enough that it won't release and you
just<00:04:21.950> do<00:04:22.160> whatever<00:04:23.120> moves<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.080> want<00:04:24.260> to

just do whatever moves that you want to
but<00:04:24.919> try<00:04:25.160> keeping<00:04:25.789> it<00:04:25.910> isolated<00:04:26.780> lose<00:04:26.960> one

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
but try keeping it isolated lose one

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.500 
but try keeping it isolated lose one
spot<00:04:27.680> that's<00:04:27.710> obviously<00:04:28.370> why<00:04:29.000> it's<00:04:29.180> called<00:04:29.330> an

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
spot that's obviously why it's called an

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.750 
spot that's obviously why it's called an
isolation<00:04:30.729> but<00:04:31.729> this<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.330> all<00:04:32.570> it<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.229> and<00:04:34.190> just

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
isolation but this is all it is and just

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.240 
isolation but this is all it is and just
grasping<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.800> then<00:04:36.979> you<00:04:37.100> can

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
grasping it that's it then you can

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.570 
grasping it that's it then you can
obviously<00:04:37.370> switch<00:04:38.030> hands<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:39.220> take<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.400> even

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
obviously switch hands and take it even

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.060 
obviously switch hands and take it even
two<00:04:40.910> fingers<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.600> think<00:04:42.260> that's<00:04:42.470> just<00:04:42.680> pushing

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
two fingers I think that's just pushing

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.310 
two fingers I think that's just pushing
it<00:04:43.190> just<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.669> little<00:04:43.700> bit<00:04:44.150> now<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.110> next
