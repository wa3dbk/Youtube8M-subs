00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.720
 Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.200
 in this section we will share a very easy pie recipe 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.680
 "Letter Pastry" 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.440
 but if you want to learn the materials first 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.440
 3 pieces of yufka 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.440
 1 glass of water Milk 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.360
 half a cup of sunflower oil 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.640
 half mold white cheese 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
 10-15 branches of parsley 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 1 egg white 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.000
 For the above; 1 egg yolk 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.400
 As you can see our materials are quite short 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.400
 now let's go into construction quickly 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.480
 First of all, let's prepare, we said that we have half mold and white cheese ... 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.120
 cut out a few pieces, then crush them with a fork 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.200
 yes, let's eat parsley now 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.880
 as we always say, with the stems 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.280
 add the parsley over the cheese 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.080
 we add egg whites on it to bind us 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.240
 and mixing 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.360
 now let's prepare the sauce of our pie 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.240
 Our milk ... 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.800
 and mix our oil in a bowl 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 Of course the oil does not actually interfere 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.160
 let's turn a few rounds 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.960
 let's put our sauce aside 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.280
 let us open our yufkalar覺n覺 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.280
 Let's take the first floor 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.960
 now we are putting oil on the surface of our yufkamam覺z覺n 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.440
 now folding our rounded faceplate ... 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.200
 square shape 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.680
 in this way 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.640
 it would be better if we used a little more fat and milk 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.640
 now we are cutting our yufk plus 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.280
 and 4 pieces of square-shaped yufka 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.800
 we leave each other in the middle of 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.000
 and see the edges in this way, so as not to appear complete ... 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 bend into 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.920
 is already taking its name from this shape 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.000
 in the same way after forming other yufkara ... 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.440
 tray 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.920
 the last one I want to show once again 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.360
 after placing the first triangle before 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.680
 and fold the triangle again 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.680
 we also complete four corners 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.240
 as the last operation; increased milky oily mixture ... 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.160
 add egg yolks and mix 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.640
 we are driving on our pies 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.440
 including cheese 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.000
 now we're preheating our 180-degree oven 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 and bake until golden brown 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.200
 Yes, our letter donuts, we can serve after a little light 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.920
 the view is different in this section, the taste is quite ... 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.320
 we shared a recipe for a nice burrito "Letter Pastry" 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.640
 I hope you will try as soon as possible and you will remember us 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.920
 Enjoy your meal now!
