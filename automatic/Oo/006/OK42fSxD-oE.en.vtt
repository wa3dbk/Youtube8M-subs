Jordan<00:06:48.730> we've<00:06:48.940> been<00:06:49.090> taking<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.480> Jordan<00:06:49.840> path

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050

for<00:06:50.350> the<00:06:50.410> past<00:06:50.650> two<00:06:50.950> years<00:06:50.980> and<00:06:51.550> I<00:06:51.580> think<00:06:51.820> it's

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
for the past two years and I think it's

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.840 
for the past two years and I think it's
just<00:06:52.030> trying<00:06:52.420> to<00:06:52.540> move<00:06:52.690> on<00:06:52.840> to<00:06:52.990> something<00:06:53.230> else

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
just trying to move on to something else

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.270 
just trying to move on to something else

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
so plus Mikey you get them vertical

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.520 
so plus Mikey you get them vertical
replays<00:06:57.820> and<00:06:58.090> that's<00:06:58.240> what<00:06:58.450> I<00:06:58.480> want<00:06:58.750> more<00:06:59.470> than

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
replays and that's what I want more than

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.900 
replays and that's what I want more than
anything<00:06:59.680> I<00:07:00.220> think<00:07:00.250> that<00:07:00.640> would<00:07:00.760> be<00:07:00.880> really

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910
