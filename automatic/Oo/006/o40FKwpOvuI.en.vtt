00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 many think that to take some suspenders 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.130
 it's just to place them and click and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.259
 it ended well because you can not even 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.269
 imagine what it means to carry 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.260
 some suspenders with elegant hugo painted 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.199

 my dear jose fernando g from 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.059
 guatemala sent us a message 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.820
 asking us for information on how to use 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.430
 braces in an elegant way for 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 all of you a very sincere greeting 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.600
 from Granada and this video is dedicated to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.129
 that we all know how to use braces 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.129
 a perfect shape 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.020
 Violet 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.410
 something new 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.350
 from granada I want to send you a greeting 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.800
 sincere I am vélez squares and in this 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.440
 video we will learn how to use 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.990
 braces in a correct way and to 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.840
 the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.260
 place ourselves as far as the tie we have 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.990
 two types of suspenders completely 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 different that we call them 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.930
 X- shaped braces that are the ones 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.990
 they are completely crossed and the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.420
 shaped braces and are the ones that 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.300
 They have two front terminals and one 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.210
 only terminal a single terminal in the 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.810
 back because he thematized these 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.140
 details because it's not the same to wear 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.270
 with X- shaped straps and dress 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.780
 with braces in the shape of and although 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.479
 apparently they seem to be the same 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.910
 and also I'm going to clarify another detail 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.300
 also very important 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.630
 the width of the retainer strap 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.840
 elastic strap also influences 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.620
 how to use it normally 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.110
 we have 30 mm braces 3 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.460
 centimeters wide and then we move on to 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.150
 what we call the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.560
 strapless dress that become 35 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.050
 or 38 and we also have two types 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.920
 different braces within those that 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.530
 we are cataloging of and in 35 and 38 the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.690
 we can have with elastic just like me 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.000
 I carry it at this moment simply a 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.920
 elastic band and then we can have the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.840
 made of other material that can be in 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.360
 silk in tweet 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.610
 and these types of suspenders are not 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.459
 elastic because the fabric with which 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.489
 They are manufactured are rigid fabrics not 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.580
 They are not wearing elastics are suspenders 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.280
 very special and tight that 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.590
 we always allocate to very 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.349
 specials if you think well we're going to 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.150
 develop how each of them is used 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.430
 the suspenders and how they wear if you 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.230
 it seems fine before entering into matter 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.750
 let me explain the two ways 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.420
 fundamentals that we have to hold the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.290
 strap to the pants on the one hand we have 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.140
 the clamp mechanisms or how he taught me 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.260
 my dear or vlady meco of how you 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.239
 also call American alligator that is 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.829
 instead of using the word clamp 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.069
 use the word crocodile because it is 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:48.420
 true when we see the profile of the 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.470
 a tweezers with the ones with the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.180
 anti-skid that rubber has yes 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.690
 It is true that looks like a crocodile well 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.150
 Well, we have, as you said, tweezers or 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.620
 with the crocodile system and then 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.430
 we have the possibility to use 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.700
 Loops that can be good 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.909
 just as I carry it or can also 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.859
 be braided from a braided fabric 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.629
 they can be in addition, that is, within this 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.530
 classification that I'm doing 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:18.780
 clamp or gaza va can be fixed or 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.970
 they can be interchangeable 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.240
 we have of the two models in clamp 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.820
 we can have a clamp and they can be fixed or 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.500
 they can be exchanged with lace 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.509
 it can be fixed that it can not 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.580
 interchange and in each of the two 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.979
 versions we have the possibility of 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.860
 put clamp linked at the same time because the 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.210
 mechanism is a versatile mechanism of 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.259
 the previous models that I commented to you 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.810
 of suspenders which is considered as 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:49.110
 less elegant are the straps in shape 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.860
 of x we're basically going to 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.289
 find 30 centimeters and also with 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.749
 clamp mechanisms 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.240
 I'm going to make a point 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:01.800
 important because as the first 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.559
 development that I'm going to do with the with 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.430
 the X- shaped brace with clamp 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:11.039
 I will also tell you that this tie is 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.680
 usually considered as the least elegant 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.229
 and when we enter the suspenders in 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.229
 shape of yy with lazada you will observe 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:22.559
 why that difference but before 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.899
 nothing will make a point you 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:27.389
 I'm going to leave an image for you to buy 

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:30.479
 so check this this image that 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.029
 you're seeing is a mechanism that does not 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.459
 is the fixed one, so we can not 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:37.949
 exchange them and yet this other 

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:41.639
 photo that I put you is the typical example 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:44.039
 of tight that we can put both 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.270
 clamp as laced in principle a 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.060
 very easy mechanism 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.800
 it's very quick to put on but you have to 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.960
 take into account also a detail 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.110
 interesting when a pair of trousers is 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.910
 ready to wear suspenders 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.930
 you understand because it is considered much more 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:05.640
 smart to use loops to use 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.640
 tweezers see the difference
