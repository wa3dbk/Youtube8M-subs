00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello good my name is Pablo and I 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.060
 like to open a channel on YouTube 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.680
 videorectas my first recipe that I 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.780
 would like to go up would be a jam of 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.490
 piquillo pepper and ideal onion 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.580
 to accompany patÃ©s I hope that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.940
 enjoy it as much as I do of how 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.710
 do it for you 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.020
 to start with our jam of 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.670
 red pepper and onion a 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.250
 quantities of a small can of 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.530
 piquillo pepper and half an onion 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.580
 we must do the following preparation 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.990
 we cut the onion into pieces 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.300
 normal 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.300
 and we add it in a glass any 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.910
 the piquillo pepper without draining 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.410
 everything in here and now 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.920
 It is important 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.920
 and 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.120
 and make a good puree 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.670
 we have such a mixture that a little 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.170
 how a puree that depends can be made 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.120
 as you want for example I like 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.180
 do not notice the pieces of onion 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.340
 that the flavor is there and everything but that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.370
 it is just a memory each onion not 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.020
 pieces that the main protagonist is 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.490
 the piquillo pepper we're going to 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.390
 flavored with a little red wine 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.280
 that gives a very very very good touch 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.500
 with the puree that we have to me 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.380
 personally what I like and how 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.380
 it comes out better is to say it so a kulish 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.520
 strain it 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.180
 of green cojedes 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:46.530
 I do not need spatulas coolies leave 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 that the pulp releases everything and this 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.670
 reducing the fear that is releasing 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.260
 which is very good to make like crumbs 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.900
 but I'm going to make it in jam 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.299
 chocolates so you can see it too 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.590
 As you can do, I saw her 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.350
 add 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.390
 sugar 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.080
 a normal little story that inch or 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.030
 may be 150 grams and a piece of 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.470
 honey 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.620
 hello good we're still here with the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.620
 glitter jam me the truth I 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.569
 like to add sugar to the broth 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.890
 because it's easier to assimilate but 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.890
 then mix the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.829
 if they knew 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.470
 I'm in the palm 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.180
 the sugar that can be one 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.930
 50 or 100 little more 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.930
 Honey 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.410
 already 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.850
 because we want to aromatize the no charge and 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.360
 the wine is removed from the fire 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.170
 we dissolve it and we'll see with money 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.790
 light weights I think it takes to start 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.799
 more or less 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.730
 here feed good is already a little 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.940
 more made candy 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.100
 when it's bubbling and all that 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.650
 add 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.480
 add the puree as we see this already 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.480
 its myth is being 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.560
 we are here 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.560
 as concentrates well well concentrated 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.590
 pulp violence 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.020
 at the moment that begins already 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.940
 caramelize we have to be careful 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.650
 that we do not hit the bottom that is 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.380
 European and all this we have done to 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.620
 strong fire and now we lower the fire what 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.230
 we put 3 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.230
 and now we move from time to time 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.340
 but the best thing is to let solve this 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.000
 it means that it is good 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.640
 good signal 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.350
 and now we have arrived is left 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.609
 reduce what we want to me I like 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.880
 reduced that is compact well reduce 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.340
 a little bit more and that's to taste 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.810
 your 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.090
 and I here finally we have the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.669
 jam of piquillo peppers 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.669
 in a bowl has already reinforced a little 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.950
 and has already gained a little more weight and 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.500
 I'm in a cake with 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:44.180
 simply 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.100
 like with cheese goat cheese a club 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.870
 goat cheeses put a little bit of 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.110
 this above that you put it in a pan 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.070
 and you put it a little in the oven to 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.140
 that melts the one that remains 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.450
 great I hope you liked it and 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.450
 I have served you thank you
