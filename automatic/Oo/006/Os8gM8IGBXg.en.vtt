00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.559
 we go 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.850
 hello I am salt and neiman for cinema in 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.920
 Spanish and this is a first look at the 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.250
 newer version of computers 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.710
 Apple desktop iMac 27 2013 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.420
 inches this computer may be 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.490
 see exactly the same outside the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.830
 last year's version but inside 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.869
 has great changes we started with the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.750
 body when we see it for the first time 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.820
 we all said wow look how thin it is and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.880
 of first instance if it might seem 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.950
 as thin as an ipad but while 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.710
 you're going to flip 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.110
 thin and suddenly you see the depth 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.810
 in the center since that's where he keeps 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.730
 all the components still so to do 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.580
 such a powerful computer with a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.770
 27- inch screen does not really 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.930
 the screen is too bulky 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.180
 it has a little flexibility you can 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.530
 move up and down but 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.380
 that's practically the whole movement 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.420
 that you have since this one is not the type of 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.400
 computers of new generations that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.559
 they include touch screen or of those that 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.630
 They have an internal spring that allows you 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.790
 lift the screen and use it as a 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.270
 mega tablet this is a new field that 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.759
 it is growing but 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.009
 and still does not go that way in what 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.229
 yes it has focused is on the new 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.479
 generation Intel core to 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.850
 once also known as web hash 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.009
 this gives you a great update and 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.770
 improves the execution of the machine as 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.060
 for example better battery life 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.780
 although in reality we do not have that 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.569
 to worry here also has 80 2.11 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.880
 wireless ace what gives more speed in 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.429
 clear wireless networks if you have a 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.619
 router with the indicated support for this 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.380
 It also includes the new generation of 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.959
 700 series graphics cards 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.970
 nvidia geforce this is wonderful if 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.849
 you are one of those who play on their macs and 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.380
 although this area is still growing 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:56.049
 is much better than just a few 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.079
 years in terms of internal storage 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:03.069
 your options for this style or hard drive 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.110
 now they connect via and if there is to which 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.179
 the company says it increases the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.340
 performance of the unit whether 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.560
 you choose only the hard drive or the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.660
 fusion that includes the hard drive and the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.490
 steding components 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.590
 when our editors if you have the 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.750
 last year's version there's no reason to 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.790
 update that to this experience is 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.460
 pretty similar but if you're thinking 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.900
 in buying a new computer 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.610
 because yours already has a few 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.560
 years now you can get a 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.290
 computer that includes the latest in 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.940
 components and it's going to last like this at least 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.160
 until the new versions of 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.630
 processors and graphics cards in 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.280
 the 2014 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.310
 I am a saline magnet and this was a first 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.310
 look at the 27-inch imac 2013
