aim slightly left now lie down and then

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.040 
aim slightly left now lie down and then
go<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> options<00:00:34.710> stick<00:00:35.460> layout<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.270> legacy

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
go to options stick layout and legacy

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.240 
go to options stick layout and legacy
southpaw<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.329> now<00:00:39.329> basically<00:00:40.200> when<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.950> move

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
southpaw and now basically when you move

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.760 
southpaw and now basically when you move
across<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.510> won't<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.899> able<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.200> stand<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.620> if

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
across you won't be able to stand up if

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410 
across you won't be able to stand up if
you<00:00:43.890> move<00:00:44.040> across<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> right<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.239> you've

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
you move across the right and if you've

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
you move across the right and if you've
crossed<00:00:45.809> i<00:00:45.960> left<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.379> will<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.710> able<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.039> stand

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
crossed i left you will be able to stand

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
crossed i left you will be able to stand
up<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.420> need<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> find<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.079> point<00:00:49.350> right

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
up and so you need to find a point right

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.979 
up and so you need to find a point right
in<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> middle<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.489> ok<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.390> i<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.600> stand

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
in the middle of that ok so i can stand

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.279 
in the middle of that ok so i can stand
up<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:53.660> can't<00:00:54.660> stand<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.780> need<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> do

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
up there can't stand up you need to do

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.340 
up there can't stand up you need to do
some<00:00:58.590> tiny<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.399> like<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.989> small

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
some tiny little like really small

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.429 
some tiny little like really small
Eddie's<00:01:01.710> across<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> go<00:01:03.539> too<00:01:03.809> far<00:01:04.080> then

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
Eddie's across as if you go too far then

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:13.020 
Eddie's across as if you go too far then
it<00:01:05.250> won't<00:01:05.430> work<00:01:05.580> properly

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:26.140 

a<00:01:13.090> bargain

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.140 

and<00:01:26.660> there<00:01:26.870> we<00:01:26.960> go<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:27.830> now<00:01:28.130> once<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:28.640> get<00:01:28.850> up

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
pets massage ins you might want to set

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.070 
pets massage ins you might want to set
one<00:01:38.840> down<00:01:40.030> when<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.150> said<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.480> it<00:01:41.630> will<00:01:41.900> go

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
one down when you said it it will go

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
just go straight back to up head because

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.350 
just go straight back to up head because
it's<00:01:47.630> just<00:01:47.780> with<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.320> I'll<00:01:49.070> prove<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.400> you<00:01:49.640> by

it's just with and I'll prove to you by

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.900 
it's just with and I'll prove to you by
ship<00:01:50.720> by<00:01:50.960> exploding<00:01:51.620> that<00:01:51.950> down<00:01:52.190> there<00:01:52.430> that

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
ship by exploding that down there that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.690 
ship by exploding that down there that
you<00:01:53.060> can<00:01:53.360> shoot<00:01:53.660> through<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.700> invisible

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
you can shoot through the invisible

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.850 
you can shoot through the invisible
group<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.480> takes<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:56.900> up<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.170> around<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
group it takes it up to around the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.620 
group it takes it up to around the
Cyclones

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.359 

and<00:02:03.170> then<00:02:03.259> they<00:02:03.320> have<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.649> that's<00:02:03.799> proof<00:02:04.100> and

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
and then they have it that's proof and

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.490 
and then they have it that's proof and
now<00:02:04.520> i'm<00:02:05.060> going<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.299> show<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.930> way<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.259> get

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
now i'm going to show you a way to get

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.100 
now i'm going to show you a way to get
out<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.979> map<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.520> can<00:02:08.060> climb<00:02:08.360> up<00:02:08.810> all

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
out of the map and you can climb up all

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.040 
out of the map and you can climb up all
those<00:02:09.289> mountains<00:02:09.950> over<00:02:10.160> there<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:11.390> you'll

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
those mountains over there so you'll

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.830 
those mountains over there so you'll
just<00:02:12.170> need<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.590> sprint<00:02:13.220> off<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.390> edge<00:02:14.510> and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
just need to sprint off the edge and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.839 
just need to sprint off the edge and
then<00:02:15.319> land<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:15.860> building<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.670> need

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
then land on this building you need

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.030 
then land on this building you need
commando<00:02:17.390> pro<00:02:17.569> on<00:02:17.840> because<00:02:18.500> otherwise<00:02:18.709> one

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
commando pro on because otherwise one

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.320 
commando pro on because otherwise one
you<00:02:19.160> fool<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.430> will<00:02:19.790> die<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.340> now<00:02:22.340> jump

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
you fool you will die and so now jump

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.900 
you fool you will die and so now jump
off<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.569> building<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.470> then<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.580> can<00:02:25.730> just

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
off that building and then you can just

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.080 
off that building and then you can just
