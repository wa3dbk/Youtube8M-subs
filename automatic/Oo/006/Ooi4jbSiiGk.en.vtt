00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.080
 hello tell us today I bring you a video 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.850
 tutorial to learn how to do 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.559
 Squats is a basic exercise that 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.480
 It should be in all your routines 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.760
 but it is also dangerous if it is executed 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.940
 I'm going to teach you step by step how 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.390
 do it to avoid injuries we're going to 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.060
 start 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.800
 placing them with the legs to the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.470
 width of the hips even a 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 little more and if you are not more with the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.230
 feet will be looking slightly 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 outwards the chest will be elevated 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.579
 and hands we have two options 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.860
 place them here or between 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.350
 all behind the neck if we choose this 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.290
 option we should never pull worth 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.360
 just be here leaning well 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.050
 the idea is that the back has to 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.710
 be all the straight exercise for it 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.050
 let's find our act 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 the weight has to be on the heels 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.949
 because if we take it to the tip of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.080
 the feet is when we make the typical 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.080
 mistake of bringing the knees ahead 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.110
 from the tips of the feet well do not we 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.759
 we place and we will take the ass as 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.759
 if we were to sit in a chair 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.890
 until the thighs are parallel to the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.960
 floor and when climbing we press the glutes 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.960
 another very common mistake is 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.180
 center your knees let's take them to 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.830
 your position while we go down if not 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.810
 we can go down so much nothing happens 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.520
 we are here but we are never going to 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.690
 sacrifice the technique because we can 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.979
 hurt us 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.159
 then I tie moderate so that what 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.159
 see 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:55.040
 and we see that a back goes straight 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.040
 and when we go up we find the crops 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.450
 good for those who initiate in this of 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.150
 the squats I 'm going to give you two 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.100
 tips one can use a football that 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.190
 you are going to use as a chair is to place 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.310
 in the position that we have said and you are going to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.160
 go down to support the ass in football 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.800
 and keep remembering that you have to contract 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.010
 well the glutes can also be used in 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.250
 time of a football a chair and in the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.319
 moment in which the ass touch the chair 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.730
 raised when you dare to do it without 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.519
 football and without a chair another trick is to do it 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.930
 side a mirror and look good when 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.820
 are your knees is where 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.680
 you lower your ass and then the position of 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.870
 our back is not advisable 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.750
 do it always looking at a mirror because 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.980
 let's have the habit of turning the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.100
 neck and I can must always be 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.380
 looking forward the report good 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.580

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.110
 liked and want more tutorial videos

 exercises I like and in the
