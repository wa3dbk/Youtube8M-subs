00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
they're different gear ratios so to give

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.930 
they're different gear ratios so to give
you<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.650> little<00:02:06.800> bit<00:02:06.979> better<00:02:07.130> acceleration

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
you a little bit better acceleration

you a little bit better acceleration
over<00:02:08.629> speed<00:02:09.200> but<00:02:09.409> you<00:02:09.439> can<00:02:09.590> always<00:02:09.709> gear<00:02:10.009> down

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:10.189 
over speed but you can always gear down

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:10.930 
over speed but you can always gear down
your<00:02:10.459> spur
