napkins some wires green colour soluti a
pair<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.990> scissors<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.430> thread<00:00:18.949> first

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
pair of scissors and a thread first

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.029 
pair of scissors and a thread first
we'll<00:00:20.340> take<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:21.240> fourth<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.230> tissue<00:00:22.470> paper

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
we'll take one fourth of a tissue paper

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:32.440 
we'll take one fourth of a tissue paper
and<00:00:29.599> that<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:31.140> fold<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> paper<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.189> half

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
and that will fold the paper in half

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.920 
and that will fold the paper in half
four<00:00:33.450> times<00:00:37.280> after<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.309> all<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.149> paper<00:00:39.480> as

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
four times after that all the paper as

00:00:39.930 --> 00:01:07.680 
four times after that all the paper as
shown

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.100 

and<00:01:08.860> cut<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:10.010> carefully<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:10.940> that<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.360> get<00:01:11.630> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
and cut it carefully so that you get the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:30.990 
and cut it carefully so that you get the
shape<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.130> petals

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.820 

similarly<00:01:32.000> repeat<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.509> process<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.409> make

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
similarly repeat the process and make

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.450 
similarly repeat the process and make
some<00:01:34.190> more<00:01:34.399> letters<00:01:37.630> after<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:39.399> tie<00:01:40.399> these

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
some more letters after that tie these

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:52.240 
some more letters after that tie these
petals<00:01:41.000> one<00:01:41.750> by<00:01:41.810> one<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.619> wire<00:01:51.220> with<00:01:52.220> the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
petals one by one to the wire with the

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:19.090 
petals one by one to the wire with the
help<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.789> a<00:01:53.090> trend

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.970 

so<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.520> looks<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> few<00:02:21.510> are<00:02:24.980> after

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
so that it looks like a few are after

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.400 
so that it looks like a few are after
you<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.220> done<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.840> how<00:02:28.080> your

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
you have done that this is how your

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.600 
you have done that this is how your
flower<00:02:28.740> will<00:02:29.250> look<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:33.140> then<00:02:34.140> we<00:02:34.980> will<00:02:35.100> take<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
flower will look and then we will take a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.810 
flower will look and then we will take a
green<00:02:36.000> sellotape<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.080> wrap<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.280> around<00:02:38.460> the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
green sellotape and wrap it around the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:50.930 
green sellotape and wrap it around the
wire<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.650> looks<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.190> green<00:02:41.670> stem

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:08.930 

likewise<00:02:51.940> repeat<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.600> steps

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.200 

and<00:03:09.470> make<00:03:10.470> more<00:03:10.830> number<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.280> flowers<00:03:11.670> for<00:03:12.120> you

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
and make more number of flowers for you

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.770 
and make more number of flowers for you
was<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:14.120> uriah<00:03:15.120> beautiful<00:03:15.660> flowers<00:03:15.930> ready<00:03:16.560> we
