 Hi guys, how are you? Welcome. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.000
 the show program and in today's video I 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.860
 I'm going to teach the river Douro the handlebars for 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.170
 who does not know is one of the most 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.960
 common as in japan is a super dish 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.490
 popular so much that a Japanese restaurant 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.380
 In Brazil, a little while ago. 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.320
 say the two years almost 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.449
 you call their kia and their flagship is 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.390
 just the kindle is one of the most 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 popular because the affection in Japan is 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.989
 absurdly expensive and the handlebar is made 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.739
 precisely with beef and a dish 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.360
 super cheap there costs around 400 and 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.210
 enes which gives about a dozen real 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.280
 That's the price of HUC around here. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.059

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.219
 easy you will first put a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.610
 pot to water 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.520

 cover the pot and expect to boil and when 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.920
 I went to see you leave 15 minutes cooking 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.950
 until she starts to get mean 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:58.319

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.200

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.340
 begins to become more transparent and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.690
 then put the sugar in 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.349
 hopes to see a little more to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.870

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.389
 thin you are faster she cooks 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.250
 I left a little bit thicker to 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:23.730
 Do you feel the taste of the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.239
 beef was really tasty cover again and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.079
 let it cook until boiling and for about 10 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.380
 minutes 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.000
 in this part are you going to put a little 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.030
 take some of the foam out of the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.519
 top before putting the ginger and then 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.980
 you will expect to reduce and boil until 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.060
 stay that darker brown middle color 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.010
 caramelized is ready it's time you 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.970

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.650
 warm and put the meat on top goes 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:02.379
 get very very tasty 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:05.739
 and that's just eating the recipe pretty easy 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.750
 People are sorry for the dish because in 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.220
 The time I put together he was not 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.250

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.709

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.590

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:22.180

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.790
