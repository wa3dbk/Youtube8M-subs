are<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:23.740> for<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.730> advantages<00:03:25.270> were<00:03:25.510> used<00:03:25.780> in

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
are like for the advantages were used in

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.890 
are like for the advantages were used in
advanced<00:03:26.440> photo<00:03:26.709> system<00:03:26.800> cameras<00:03:30.600> c-47s<00:03:31.600> and

advanced photo system cameras c-47s and

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.360 
advanced photo system cameras c-47s and
of<00:03:32.019> course<00:03:32.260> it's<00:03:32.440> energy-dense<00:03:32.920> supplies

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
of course it's energy-dense supplies

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:46.740 
of course it's energy-dense supplies
like<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:43.239> would<00:03:43.390> use<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.989> cr2<00:03:44.560> battery<00:03:45.750> old

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
like that would use the cr2 battery old

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.190 
like that would use the cr2 battery old
Canon<00:03:47.650> ELPH<00:03:47.920> first<00:03:48.670> generation<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:49.570> this<00:03:49.900> was
