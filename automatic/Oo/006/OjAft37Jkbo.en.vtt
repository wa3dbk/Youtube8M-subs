listen all in all this is a it seems a
solid<00:01:46.460> improvement<00:01:46.670> over<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.090> said<00:01:47.330> one<00:01:47.540> but

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
solid improvement over that said one but

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.510 
solid improvement over that said one but
