00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
from and you know how does this work and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.920 
from and you know how does this work and
I<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.290> well<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.159> comes<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.930> negativity

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
I think well it comes from negativity

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.780 
I think well it comes from negativity
right<00:01:25.229> obviously<00:01:25.530> comes<00:01:26.280> from<00:01:26.610> being<00:01:27.259> hurtful

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
right obviously comes from being hurtful

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.030 
right obviously comes from being hurtful
but<00:01:29.790> how<00:01:30.299> how<00:01:30.900> does<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.350> work<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.979> think

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
but how how does that work and I think

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.719 
but how how does that work and I think
it<00:01:32.820> kind<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.570> spreads<00:01:34.110> from<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:35.189> person<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
it kind of spreads from one person to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.109 
it kind of spreads from one person to
another<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.840> very<00:01:37.110> negative<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:39.000> you

going to really enjoy it so you you can
kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.840> see<00:02:07.250> how<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.640> affects<00:02:09.000> each<00:02:09.330> each

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
kind of see how that affects each each

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.230 
kind of see how that affects each each
individual<00:02:10.649> person

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
individual person

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.670 
individual person
and<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.570> feel<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.080> kind<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.380> like<00:02:12.440> this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
and I feel like it's kind of like this

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.530 
and I feel like it's kind of like this
domino<00:02:13.190> effect<00:02:13.460> right<00:02:13.730> if<00:02:14.180> you're<00:02:14.360> negative

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
domino effect right if you're negative

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.540 
domino effect right if you're negative
and<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.350> hurt<00:02:15.590> someone<00:02:15.860> else<00:02:15.950> well<00:02:16.400> then

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
and you hurt someone else well then

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.770 
and you hurt someone else well then
they're<00:02:16.730> gonna<00:02:16.850> be<00:02:17.000> negative<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.510> then<00:02:17.660> they

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
they're gonna be negative and then they

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.120 
they're gonna be negative and then they
might<00:02:17.930> hurt<00:02:18.080> someone<00:02:18.320> else<00:02:18.440> kind<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.800> like<00:02:18.950> a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
might hurt someone else kind of like a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.540 
might hurt someone else kind of like a
zombie<00:02:19.940> apocalypse<00:02:20.750> right<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.310> works

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
zombie apocalypse right and it works

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.650 
zombie apocalypse right and it works
both<00:02:22.820> ways<00:02:22.880> um<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:24.710> how<00:02:25.520> how<00:02:25.940> do<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.240> deal<00:02:26.630> with

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
both ways um and how how do we deal with

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.200 
both ways um and how how do we deal with
that<00:02:26.990> when<00:02:27.560> when<00:02:27.920> someone<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.340> being<00:02:28.610> negative

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
that when when someone is being negative

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.580 
that when when someone is being negative
right<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.370> really<00:02:31.910> good<00:02:32.180> way<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.590> counter

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
right and a really good way to counter

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.870 
right and a really good way to counter
that<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:34.220> would<00:02:34.880> say<00:02:35.120> would<00:02:35.300> be<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:35.990> positive

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
that I would say would be in positive

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.610 
that I would say would be in positive
I'd<00:02:37.880> watched<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.650> documentary<00:02:40.030> about<00:02:41.030> like

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
I'd watched this documentary about like

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.410 
I'd watched this documentary about like
Buddhism<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.310> can't<00:02:43.580> remember<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.210> name

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
Buddhism and I can't remember the name

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.710 
Buddhism and I can't remember the name
but<00:02:44.930> there<00:02:45.140> was<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:45.560> one<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:46.700> lady<00:02:47.060> monk<00:02:47.360> or

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
whatever and she was so positive and so

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.340 
whatever and she was so positive and so
happy<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:52.130> outgoing<00:02:52.490> that<00:02:53.390> people<00:02:54.140> would

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
happy and so outgoing that people would

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.690 
happy and so outgoing that people would
line<00:02:54.770> up<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:56.030> massive<00:02:56.810> line<00:02:57.110> for<00:02:57.950> miles<00:02:58.310> you

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
line up this massive line for miles you

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.790 
line up this massive line for miles you
could<00:02:58.850> just<00:02:59.090> see<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.270> data<00:02:59.870> shot<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:00.560> was<00:03:00.650> just

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
could just see the data shot it was just

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.060 
could just see the data shot it was just
huge<00:03:01.490> crowd<00:03:02.300> of<00:03:02.330> people<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:03.140> they<00:03:03.620> would<00:03:03.770> line

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
huge crowd of people and they would line

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.880 
huge crowd of people and they would line
up<00:03:04.370> simply<00:03:05.210> to<00:03:06.020> get<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.170> hug<00:03:06.500> right<00:03:07.060> hug<00:03:08.060> and

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
up simply to get a hug right hug and

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.130 
up simply to get a hug right hug and
apparently<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.400> positive<00:03:11.210> energy<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.630> she

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
apparently the positive energy that she

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.970 
apparently the positive energy that she
has<00:03:13.360> transfers<00:03:14.360> over<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.140> in<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.530> hug

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
has transfers over to you in that hug

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.790 
has transfers over to you in that hug
and<00:03:16.250> for<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.210> most<00:03:17.420> part<00:03:17.570> people<00:03:17.960> I<00:03:18.350> guess

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
and for the most part people I guess

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.550 
and for the most part people I guess
would<00:03:19.040> break<00:03:19.460> down<00:03:19.490> and<00:03:19.790> cry<00:03:20.210> right<00:03:20.930> that's

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
would break down and cry right that's

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.220 
would break down and cry right that's
crazy<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.520> was<00:03:22.670> she<00:03:23.180> was<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.390> positive<00:03:23.840> that

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
crazy it was she was so positive that

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.640 
crazy it was she was so positive that
they<00:03:25.070> couldn't<00:03:25.790> handle<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.930> know<00:03:27.050> how<00:03:27.260> nice

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
they couldn't handle you know how nice

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.180 
they couldn't handle you know how nice
or<00:03:28.010> whatever<00:03:28.330> she<00:03:29.330> was<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.770> they<00:03:30.770> would<00:03:30.920> just

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
or whatever she was and they would just

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.730 
or whatever she was and they would just
start<00:03:31.370> crying<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.230> feel<00:03:33.410> like<00:03:33.530> that's

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
start crying and I feel like that's

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.250 
start crying and I feel like that's
that's<00:03:34.070> very<00:03:34.160> very<00:03:34.880> interesting<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.900> you
