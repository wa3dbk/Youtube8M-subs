00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 marsÃ© what is the technique that I'm going to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.690
 use tour would you have 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.389
 raised to the raised we can 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.840
 show a little bit like in a group 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.880
 simple ok I say what I did was 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.930
 adapt the technique of the four 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.510
 movements from the down pull up and tap 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.300
 to the pedal is not true keeping 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.289
 provided that the raised then 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.730
 I have the down I have two options always 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.210
 going down on the leg connect to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.040
 lifted if I leave the sledgehammer crushed or what 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.350
 let loose I have different sounds not 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.100
 it's true then I'm going to the down with the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.100
 more crushed 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.039
 Now the down with the lazy mallet that I do 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:57.329
 with the lazy mallet I'm working the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:58.739
 sole of the foot controlling the rebound that 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.180
 It is very important to play double pedal 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.219
 because if you're touching the other 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.409
 they are flipping with one pedal the other 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.289
 classes is like it 's super necessary 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.960
 for this great technique, we're good 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:13.890
 with the full that is taking advantage of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.640
 spring patch mallet bounce 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.710
 where can I gain all the power 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.710
 always 40 has not raised not then 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.600
 I do not have all the power and I'm 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.060
 taking advantage of the bounce is not this not 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.759
 I have problems if I leave it tight 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.209
 the deck not because this bounce is not true 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.009
 perfect well then we have the up that 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:47.720
 always comes after a tap no 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.720
 blame the double blow 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:57.810
 who executed it by going down and the heel is not 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:03.600
 true that I never support the same, I keep it 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.330
 in the air well and then the tap that is 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.500
 the movement basically with the foot that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.500
 it helps me to touch it but 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.799
 this yes I adapted it to both feet not 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.019
 I can show from slow start with 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.950
 down then it went full and then it happened 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.950
 to top then 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.980
 on the feet to maintain stability 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.709
 in certain then 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:00.519
 or suppose I play there and he did not throw me 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:04.080
 back true I'm going to look for the 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.230
 weight on the foot I'm always supporting 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.569
 then the wave takes advantage of the bounce 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.660
 of the spring take advantage of the bounce 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.150
 patch not and I through that start at 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.970
 put the strength of the leg great a 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.560
 simple as that is great to start 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.829
 coordinate that what this newly 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.500
 start to put some bit in the radial 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.030
 around like to start after 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.430
 coordinate what can already be touched between a 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.730
 rhythm a band whatever it was not then 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.730
 for example 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.890
 stop 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.239
 perfect and the last advice for the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.220
 guys that time or calculate per day 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.040
 to achieve this speed and this 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.720
 good weight in practice that you can 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.180
 put in the day is not so important 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.890
 maybe we're going to stop an hour a day to 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 put him is barbarous but the most 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.579
 important is that I can keep it to 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.560
 Over time do not say good to see 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.430
 I locked myself a month to play and not this 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.800
 Give it time for years and touch and play a lot 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.870
 then it is appearing on the 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.870
 speed and the development of technique
