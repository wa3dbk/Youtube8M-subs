00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.470
 this film is about the topic 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.190
 color correction more accurately said 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.170
 it's about the topic of color manipulation 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.190
 That's why we open the picture dakota 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.679
 and that shows this new yorker central 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.679
 park or a part of the central parks in 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:27.050
 beautiful summer weather and 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.670
 my concern is now the whole 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.230
 story not special but 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.029
 make you look warm 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.680
 Of course you can get these green tones 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.530
 Simply recolour the whole 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.920
 we need one to recolor a picture 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.370
 adjustment level hue saturation there 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.440
 is he 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.000
 and now I could start and could 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.430
 change the hue for this image 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.210
 could make something out of it that would 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.699
 but also this tarnished 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.660
 copper here in the roofs change that 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.129
 Above all, it would also be heaven 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.410
 Of course I do not want to change that 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.629
 So I stay open 0 and 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.390
 do not grab me the standard but 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.810
 i only take the greens and once 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.600
 I have selected the green tones 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.580
 This little one will appear down here below 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.439
 Section of green tones 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.060
 Of course you can say good 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.330
 problem me so that we can 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.100
 also do it and I'll leave it at 0 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.700
 mhz a saturation just changed 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.409
 my shade and although I am here 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.270
 diligently am changing is almost happening 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.670
 nothing always a winner 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.079
 and you could say well then 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.240
 I probably messed up there and somehow 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.829
 Thank you, I'll go home but no 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.899
 that's not these shades of green are 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.060
 Of course, changeable again and that 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.670
 as soon as i have these four regulators here 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.790
 for example, move the outer one 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.259
 first continue in the direction of the yellow 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.490
 orange area here 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.290
 well then I have one now 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.290
 transition created between this 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.079
 area and this first of the two 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.310
 inner judge is there now 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.750
 continuous course of mine 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.409
 original to current color 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.450
 manufactured 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.969
 Of course, I can also mean that 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.710
 Green area is still fanning out 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.909
 That's why I have to get my other one back 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.740
 withdraw something and now you can see 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.320
 Now a little more is happening 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.240
 now he will be happy 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.790
 because now I just have that 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.710
 specialized area of â€‹â€‹these fathers and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.120
 change should be changed 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.190
 increases 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.409
 So on I'll go in here 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.940
 bit more pure in this herzlichkeit 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.670
 that's too much 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.409
 but this should be relative 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.230
 look so we have these 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:33.739
 have faded parched reported 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.220
 already quite relative 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.810
 strongly colored foliage and I can even 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.670
 here on the other side one more 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.180
 go a little further and here too 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.220
 my green we enlarge you a bit 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.099
 so that's about it I really do 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.049
 get all the green tones and the 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.079
 entire green tones of this shade 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.000
 change now affected are the 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.680
 Of course, green tones are not just this 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.019
 Narrow aisles area in here but 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.109
 they are almost enough of this 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.819
 years to orange every one of these 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.220
 colors in this inner area 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.230
 lie has also already a share 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.790
 to green 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.170
 that 's the first thing I do anyway 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.450
 it is not really doll yet 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.579
 convincing autumn for that is now 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.049
 again a purely substantive question if 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.090
 I look at it when I see you 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.889
 such a leafy park with so 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.380
 many leaves on trees then 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.970
 must not look this fall foliage 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.069
 as if it was just before the end of november 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.989
 but then it should look like him 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.639
 was dry at the end of september 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.590
 summer and then that would be much more 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.389
 That's why I'm going back now 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.750
 out on my greens back to 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.430
 standard because I still can 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.480
 naturally affect the whole picture 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.639
 by now, for example, the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.900
 pull saturation up and now 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.940
 this is exactly what lights up in the trees 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.010
 get what i want to have and 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.919
 because I just used the standard 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.389
 have and not only get the green tones 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.829
 I also have a stronger color saturation 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.599
 up here in the sky 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.699
 Of course I need one for you 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.319
 to present bright day and me 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.569
 would say now we have all the nuances 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.109
 which one needs for the autumn in this 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.109
 picture in it
