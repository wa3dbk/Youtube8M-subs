the normal constraints of time and can

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.970 
the normal constraints of time and can

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.319 
instant in fact that's a good question
could<00:00:40.050> God<00:00:40.379> theoretically<00:00:41.340> draw<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> pop

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
could God theoretically draw on the pop

hits of the future to create the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.610 
hits of the future to create the
universe<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> past<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.510> that's<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.559> a

universe of the past and that's not a

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.380 
universe of the past and that's not a
great<00:00:46.800> question<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> ask<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.879> an<00:00:48.030> interview
