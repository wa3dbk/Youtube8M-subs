control<00:03:13.959> sure<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:15.160> know<00:03:15.280> one<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.610> things

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
control sure you know one of the things

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.780 
control sure you know one of the things
about<00:03:15.910> dcs<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.130> different<00:03:18.489> form

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
about dcs is that it's a different form

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.580 
about dcs is that it's a different form
of<00:03:18.910> command<00:03:19.270> control

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
of command control

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.729 
of command control
most<00:03:21.280> people<00:03:21.580> in<00:03:21.700> h<00:03:21.849> over<00:03:22.150> used<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.510> DCC<00:03:22.930> and

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
most people in h over used to DCC and

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.530 
most people in h over used to DCC and
dcs<00:03:24.190> takes<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> different<00:03:24.790> level<00:03:25.120> with<00:03:25.510> a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
dcs takes it to a different level with a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.780 
dcs takes it to a different level with a
very<00:03:25.810> intuitive<00:03:26.319> interface<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.640> tell

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
very intuitive interface I like to tell

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.430 
very intuitive interface I like to tell
people<00:03:27.849> that<00:03:28.239> if<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.569> can<00:03:28.720> program<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.170> name

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
people that if you can program a name

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.900 
people that if you can program a name
and<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> number<00:03:29.830> into<00:03:30.099> a<00:03:30.220> cell<00:03:30.430> phone<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:30.670> can

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
and a number into a cell phone you can

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.910 
and a number into a cell phone you can
run<00:03:31.060> dcs<00:03:31.599> really<00:03:32.050> everything<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.560> right<00:03:32.769> there

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
run dcs really everything is right there

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.589 
run dcs really everything is right there
on<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.040> screen<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.700> interfaces<00:03:34.269> are<00:03:34.420> very

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
on the screen the interfaces are very

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.210 
on the screen the interfaces are very
similar<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:35.170> what<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.379> find<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:35.739> cell<00:03:35.950> phones
