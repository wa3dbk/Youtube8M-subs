the<00:00:11.430> charging<00:00:11.880> system<00:00:12.060> is<00:00:12.450> another<00:00:12.750> system

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the charging system is another system

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.730 
the charging system is another system
that<00:00:13.230> has<00:00:13.680> gone<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.360> computerized<00:00:15.360> way<00:00:15.840> in<00:00:16.110> in

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
that has gone the computerized way in in

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.429 
that has gone the computerized way in in
late-model<00:00:17.220> systems<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:19.050> has<00:00:19.260> been

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
late-model systems and this has been

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.109 
late-model systems and this has been
happening<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:20.010> quite<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.460> long<00:00:20.640> time<00:00:20.849> whenever

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
happening for quite a long time whenever

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.810 
happening for quite a long time whenever
we<00:00:21.330> refer<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.170> Chrysler<00:00:22.500> systems<00:00:23.220> which

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
we refer to the Chrysler systems which

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.409 
we refer to the Chrysler systems which
are<00:00:24.000> all<00:00:24.210> computer<00:00:24.840> control<00:00:25.369> alternators

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
are all computer control alternators

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.390 
are all computer control alternators
again<00:00:27.419> in<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.960> particular<00:00:28.259> case<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.829> see<00:00:29.160> how

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
again in this particular case we see how

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.080 
again in this particular case we see how
the<00:00:29.810> actual<00:00:30.810> alternator<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:32.060> connected<00:00:33.060> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the actual alternator is connected to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.780 
the actual alternator is connected to
the<00:00:33.360> actual<00:00:35.600> motronic<00:00:36.600> or<00:00:36.960> ECM<00:00:37.380> unit<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.190> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the actual motronic or ECM unit and it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
the actual motronic or ECM unit and it
is<00:00:39.480> also<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.899> same<00:00:40.110> time<00:00:40.170> connected

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
is also at the same time connected

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.490 
is also at the same time connected
through<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> 150<00:00:42.210> amp<00:00:42.420> fuse<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.050> actual

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
through a 150 amp fuse to the actual

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.130 
through a 150 amp fuse to the actual
battery<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.130> this<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> charge<00:00:45.120> wire<00:00:45.420> be

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
battery and this is the charge wire be

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.050 
battery and this is the charge wire be
careful<00:00:46.650> with<00:00:46.770> these<00:00:46.860> systems<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
careful with these systems because the

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.900 
careful with these systems because the
actual<00:00:48.540> fuse<00:00:48.870> develops<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.890> corrosive<00:00:50.370> or

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
actual fuse develops are corrosive or

high resistance spots in the different
ways<00:00:54.620> this<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.190> fuse<00:00:56.970> was<00:00:57.150> not<00:00:57.330> implemented<00:00:57.810> in

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
ways this a fuse was not implemented in

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.260 
ways this a fuse was not implemented in
older<00:00:58.410> system<00:00:58.830> systems<00:00:59.700> but<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.120> this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
older system systems but in this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.050 
older system systems but in this
particular<00:01:00.510> system<00:01:01.200> and<00:01:01.430> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.610> this

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
particular system and this is this

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.640 
particular system and this is this
system<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:03.870> employed<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.530> many

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
system is actually employed in many

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.210 
vehicles and a high resistance part
created<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.409> context<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.009> this

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
created in the context of this

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.850 
created in the context of this
particular<00:01:11.549> fuse<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.350> render

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
particular fuse and will actually render

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.429 
particular fuse and will actually render
the<00:01:14.310> alternator<00:01:14.869> inoperative<00:01:15.869> even<00:01:16.319> though

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the alternator inoperative even though

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.389 
the alternator inoperative even though
there<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.679> nothing<00:01:16.799> wrong<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
there is nothing wrong with the

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.999 
there is nothing wrong with the
alternator<00:01:17.719> so<00:01:18.719> again<00:01:19.049> we're<00:01:19.409> voltage<00:01:19.770> drop

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
alternator so again we're voltage drop

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.789 
alternator so again we're voltage drop
test<00:01:20.310> across<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.270> fuse<00:01:21.539> if<00:01:21.840> necessary<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
test across the fuse if necessary and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.190 
test across the fuse if necessary and
this<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.819> immediately<00:01:24.030> point<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:25.049> an

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
this would immediately point to an

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.069 
this would immediately point to an
actual<00:01:25.590> problem<00:01:26.210> with<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.329> actual<00:01:27.600> fuse<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
actual problem with the actual fuse and

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.349 
actual problem with the actual fuse and
this<00:01:28.560> system<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.130> tied<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> actual

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
this system is tied to the actual

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.730 
this system is tied to the actual
instrument<00:01:30.990> cluster<00:01:31.590> through<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> signal<00:01:33.740> Y

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
instrument cluster through a signal Y

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.199

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
seen here in blue and as soon as the

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.819 
seen here in blue and as soon as the
actual<00:01:39.209> alternator<00:01:39.719> starts<00:01:40.229> charging<00:01:40.469> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
actual alternator starts charging it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.580 
actual alternator starts charging it
sends<00:01:41.219> a<00:01:41.399> an<00:01:41.909> input<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.139> instrument

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
sends a an input to the instrument

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.379 
sends a an input to the instrument
cluster<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.219> instrument<00:01:44.729> cluster<00:01:44.819> makes

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:45.389 
cluster and the instrument cluster makes

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:48.770 
cluster and the instrument cluster makes
a<00:01:45.539> determination<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.209> by

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
a determination and you can see that by

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.749 
a determination and you can see that by

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the actual trans instrument cluster

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.649 
the actual trans instrument cluster
computer<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.999> the<00:01:57.179> one<00:01:57.359> that<00:01:57.509> actually

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
computer is the one that actually

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.959 
computer is the one that actually
determines<00:01:58.109> whether<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.340> instrument

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
determines whether this instrument
