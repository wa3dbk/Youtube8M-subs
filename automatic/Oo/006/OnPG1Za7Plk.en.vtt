nice<00:00:07.290> these<00:00:07.529> planes<00:00:08.250> fly<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:08.790> let's<00:00:09.630> take<00:00:09.750> it

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
nice these planes fly so let's take it

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.480 
nice these planes fly so let's take it
up<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.050> air<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.740> show<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:10.889> guys<00:00:11.040> how<00:00:11.250> well

up in the air and show you guys how well

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:55.069 
up in the air and show you guys how well
they<00:00:11.639> fly<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.420> let's<00:00:12.599> go

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079

all righty guys you just solved my

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.000 
all righty guys you just solved my
flight<00:03:37.970> demonstration<00:03:38.569> of<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.720> f-117<00:03:39.170> Amanda

flight demonstration of the f-117 Amanda
they<00:03:40.130> fly<00:03:40.370> nice<00:03:40.610> it's<00:03:41.239> really<00:03:41.360> stable<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.200> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
they fly nice it's really stable in the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.690 
they fly nice it's really stable in the
air<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:42.530> guys<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.860> flies<00:03:43.069> just<00:03:43.099> like<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.430> giant

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
air you guys it flies just like a giant

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.880 
air you guys it flies just like a giant
wing<00:03:44.170> except<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.290> does<00:03:45.410> have<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.590> little<00:03:45.739> bit

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
wing except it does have a little bit

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.410 
wing except it does have a little bit
more<00:03:45.980> drag<00:03:46.280> than<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.550> wing<00:03:46.730> but<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:47.209> flies

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
more drag than a wing but it flies

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.530 
more drag than a wing but it flies
really<00:03:47.750> stable<00:03:48.230> high<00:03:49.160> speed<00:03:49.520> handling<00:03:50.180> on

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
really stable high speed handling on

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.229 
really stable high speed handling on
this<00:03:50.660> one<00:03:50.780> was<00:03:50.959> just<00:03:50.989> playing<00:03:51.680> awesome<00:03:52.239> slopes

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
this one was just playing awesome slopes

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.660 
this one was just playing awesome slopes
though<00:03:53.569> speed<00:03:53.870> wise<00:03:54.050> yeah<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:55.130> wasn't<00:03:55.310> kind<00:03:55.580> of

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
though speed wise yeah it wasn't kind of

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.699 
though speed wise yeah it wasn't kind of
there<00:03:55.819> but<00:03:56.090> if<00:03:56.569> you<00:03:56.750> don't<00:03:56.930> fly<00:03:57.140> below<00:03:57.440> 50%

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
there but if you don't fly below 50%

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.890 
there but if you don't fly below 50%
throttle<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:59.000> should<00:03:59.180> be<00:03:59.270> fine<00:03:59.480> because<00:03:59.690> if

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
throttle you should be fine because if

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.229 
throttle you should be fine because if
you<00:03:59.959> go<00:04:00.050> any<00:04:00.230> lower<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:01.010> f-117<00:04:01.430> tends<00:04:02.000> to

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
you go any lower the f-117 tends to

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.960 
you go any lower the f-117 tends to
stall<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:03.230> tend<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.860> just<00:04:03.950> want<00:04:04.099> to<00:04:04.310> float<00:04:04.610> and

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
stall I tend to just want to float and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.339 
stall I tend to just want to float and
when<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.150> punch<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.599> kind<00:04:06.019> of<00:04:06.110> once<00:04:06.260> the

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
when you punch it kind of once the

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.740 
when you punch it kind of once the
nosedive<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.880> with<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.060> EDF<00:04:08.330> that's<00:04:08.630> not

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
nosedive so and with the EDF that's not

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.800 
nosedive so and with the EDF that's not
a<00:04:08.780> good<00:04:09.019> thing<00:04:09.880> also<00:04:10.880> with<00:04:11.150> this<00:04:11.269> black<00:04:11.569> one

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
a good thing also with this black one

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.780 
a good thing also with this black one
yeah<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:12.890> guys<00:04:13.010> can<00:04:13.160> see<00:04:13.280> in<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.400> video<00:04:13.519> that

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
yeah you guys can see in the video that

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.729 
yeah you guys can see in the video that
it<00:04:13.970> was<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.180> little<00:04:14.450> bit<00:04:14.569> more<00:04:14.900> powerful<00:04:15.500> than

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
it was a little bit more powerful than

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.680 
it was a little bit more powerful than
this<00:04:15.860> camel<00:04:16.310> one<00:04:16.400> reason<00:04:17.120> why<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.299> because<00:04:17.450> I

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
this camel one reason why is because I

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.949 
this camel one reason why is because I
used<00:04:17.989> my<00:04:18.280> exceed<00:04:19.280> RC<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.729> brushless<00:04:20.299> motor<00:04:20.720> it

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
used my exceed RC a brushless motor it

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.110 
used my exceed RC a brushless motor it
was<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.350> special<00:04:21.620> EDF<00:04:22.040> Optimus<00:04:22.700> series<00:04:22.970> motor

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
was a special EDF Optimus series motor

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.719 
was a special EDF Optimus series motor
and<00:04:23.720> it's<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.930> 4,800<00:04:24.680> kv<00:04:25.010> motor<00:04:25.220> so<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.580> had<00:04:25.700> a

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
and it's a 4,800 kv motor so it had a

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.520 
and it's a 4,800 kv motor so it had a
little<00:04:25.850> bit<00:04:26.000> more<00:04:26.120> off<00:04:26.300> than<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.050> stock<00:04:27.290> motor

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
little bit more off than the stock motor

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.780 
little bit more off than the stock motor
that<00:04:27.680> comes<00:04:27.860> with<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.010> AR<00:04:28.220> F<00:04:28.340> kit<00:04:28.580> for<00:04:28.729> this

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
that comes with the AR F kit for this

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.990 
that comes with the AR F kit for this
camel<00:04:29.150> color<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.600> also<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:30.440> realized<00:04:30.889> that<00:04:31.070> in

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
camel color and also I realized that in

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.240 
camel color and also I realized that in
my<00:04:32.120> previous<00:04:32.389> video<00:04:32.600> I<00:04:32.990> said<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.350> used<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.680> 1,300

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
my previous video I said I used a 1,300

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.250 
my previous video I said I used a 1,300
milliamp<00:04:34.550> pack<00:04:34.729> well<00:04:35.300> somebody<00:04:35.870> told<00:04:36.080> me<00:04:36.200> that

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
milliamp pack well somebody told me that

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.840 
milliamp pack well somebody told me that
that<00:04:36.800> battery<00:04:37.040> might<00:04:37.190> not<00:04:37.310> be<00:04:37.430> powerful

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
that battery might not be powerful

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.090 
that battery might not be powerful
enough<00:04:37.910> so<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.570> listened<00:04:39.320> to<00:04:39.410> his<00:04:39.560> advice<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:39.860> I

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
enough so I listened to his advice and I

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.560 
enough so I listened to his advice and I
used<00:04:40.280> eighteen<00:04:40.700> hundred<00:04:40.970> million<00:04:41.240> battery

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
used eighteen hundred million battery

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.659 
used eighteen hundred million battery
which<00:04:42.229> should<00:04:42.560> provide<00:04:42.800> up<00:04:43.039> plenty<00:04:43.400> more

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
which should provide up plenty more

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.130 
which should provide up plenty more
power<00:04:43.880> than<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.180> 13<00:04:44.419> hundred<00:04:44.539> million<00:04:44.900> pack

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
power than that 13 hundred million pack

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.920 
power than that 13 hundred million pack
and<00:04:45.350> in<00:04:46.010> order<00:04:46.310> for<00:04:46.340> me<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.550> fit<00:04:46.880> this<00:04:47.090> 1800

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
and in order for me to fit this 1800

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.860 
and in order for me to fit this 1800
milliamp<00:04:48.200> battery<00:04:48.260> in<00:04:49.070> this<00:04:49.250> f-117<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.270> had<00:04:50.750> to

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
milliamp battery in this f-117 I had to

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.440 
milliamp battery in this f-117 I had to
modify<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.289> battery<00:04:52.160> tray<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.460> little<00:04:52.820> bit<00:04:52.970> it

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
modify the battery tray a little bit it

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.029 
modify the battery tray a little bit it
wasn't<00:04:53.720> too<00:04:53.840> hard<00:04:54.110> all<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:54.260> did<00:04:54.440> was<00:04:54.560> just<00:04:54.590> bust

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
wasn't too hard all I did was just bust

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.060 
wasn't too hard all I did was just bust
out<00:04:55.160> my<00:04:55.190> dremel<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.880> I<00:04:56.450> cut<00:04:56.690> out<00:04:56.720> this<00:04:57.070> the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
out my dremel and I cut out this the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.800 
out my dremel and I cut out this the
compartment<00:04:58.760> inside<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.510> will<00:04:59.660> allow

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
compartment inside and that will allow

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.960 
compartment inside and that will allow
me<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.020> slide<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:00.620> battery<00:05:01.010> right<00:05:01.700> up<00:05:01.850> in

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
me to slide this battery right up in

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.270 
me to slide this battery right up in
here<00:05:02.180> because<00:05:02.720> before<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.830> battery<00:05:04.130> wouldn't

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
here because before the battery wouldn't

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.529 
here because before the battery wouldn't
want<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.520> fit<00:05:04.700> in<00:05:04.760> there<00:05:04.850> cuz<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.150> was<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.419> know

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
want to fit in there cuz it was you know

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.480 
want to fit in there cuz it was you know
it's<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.720> little<00:05:05.930> long<00:05:06.050> so<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.620> thought<00:05:07.190> cut<00:05:07.400> that

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
it's a little long so I thought cut that

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.610 
it's a little long so I thought cut that
out<00:05:07.550> it<00:05:07.910> slips<00:05:08.210> right<00:05:08.300> in<00:05:08.600> there<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:09.440> fly

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
out it slips right in there and a fly

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.050 
out it slips right in there and a fly
she's<00:05:09.860> just<00:05:10.010> perfect<00:05:10.250> with<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.700> battery

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
she's just perfect with the battery

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.090 
she's just perfect with the battery
mounted<00:05:11.330> on<00:05:11.450> there<00:05:11.660> and<00:05:11.860> depending<00:05:12.860> on<00:05:12.919> what

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
mounted on there and depending on what

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.790 
mounted on there and depending on what
better<00:05:13.310> you<00:05:13.490> use<00:05:13.700> you<00:05:13.910> might<00:05:14.120> have<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.800> check

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
better you use you might have to check

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.540 
better you use you might have to check
your<00:05:15.890> center<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.130> gravity

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
your center of gravity

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.029 
your center of gravity
I<00:05:17.120> found<00:05:17.690> out<00:05:17.780> of<00:05:17.870> mines<00:05:18.050> was<00:05:18.289> a<00:05:18.320> pretty

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
I found out of mines was a pretty

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.969 
I found out of mines was a pretty
dead-on<00:05:19.490> which<00:05:19.880> is<00:05:20.000> 1800<00:05:20.570> milliamp<00:05:20.870> act<00:05:21.110> so<00:05:21.710> I

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
dead-on which is 1800 milliamp act so I

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.230 
dead-on which is 1800 milliamp act so I
didn't<00:05:22.370> have<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.520> add<00:05:22.640> any<00:05:22.789> weights<00:05:22.970> to

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
didn't have to add any weights to

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.130 
didn't have to add any weights to
there's<00:05:23.390> a<00:05:23.450> black<00:05:23.870> one<00:05:23.900> over<00:05:24.260> here<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:26.140> see

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
there's a black one over here and see

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.390 
there's a black one over here and see
that's<00:05:27.350> a<00:05:27.410> tip<00:05:27.590> for<00:05:27.710> you<00:05:27.770> guys<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:28.190> when<00:05:28.340> you

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400

that's a tip for you guys to when you
coming<00:05:28.610> in<00:05:28.700> for<00:05:28.850> a<00:05:28.880> landing<00:05:28.940> with<00:05:29.450> this<00:05:29.620> f-117

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
coming in for a landing with this f-117

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.969 
coming in for a landing with this f-117
I'm<00:05:32.720> so<00:05:32.930> used<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.200> landing<00:05:33.560> me<00:05:33.650> just<00:05:33.889> like

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
I'm so used to landing me just like

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.290 
I'm so used to landing me just like
regular<00:05:34.160> planes<00:05:34.580> like<00:05:34.760> going<00:05:35.030> straight<00:05:35.270> down

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
regular planes like going straight down

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.210 
regular planes like going straight down
and<00:05:35.570> landing<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:35.930> like<00:05:36.050> this<00:05:36.229> well<00:05:36.979> I<00:05:37.039> found

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
and landing it like this well I found

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.190 
and landing it like this well I found
out<00:05:37.430> that<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.669> f-117<00:05:38.150> doesn't<00:05:38.750> like<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:39.050> land

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
out that the f-117 doesn't like to land

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.110 
out that the f-117 doesn't like to land
that<00:05:39.350> way<00:05:39.530> you<00:05:39.979> have<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.160> come<00:05:40.760> down<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:40.940> little

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
that way you have to come down a little

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.300 
that way you have to come down a little
bit<00:05:41.389> and<00:05:41.539> flare<00:05:41.840> up<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.080> last<00:05:42.229> minute<00:05:42.620> just<00:05:42.800> to

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
bit and flare up the last minute just to

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.700 
bit and flare up the last minute just to
slow<00:05:43.520> it<00:05:43.669> down<00:05:43.700> for<00:05:43.820> denotes

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
slow it down for denotes

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.520 
slow it down for denotes
down<00:05:44.860> because<00:05:45.160> if<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.960> try<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.020> do<00:05:47.170> your<00:05:47.290> basic

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
down because if you try to do your basic

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.470 
down because if you try to do your basic
airplane<00:05:48.010> maneuver<00:05:48.310> landing<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.850> just<00:05:49.060> go

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
airplane maneuver landing it just go

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.660 
airplane maneuver landing it just go
bounce<00:05:49.810> and<00:05:50.470> it<00:05:50.620> was<00:05:50.740> stall<00:05:51.010> like<00:05:51.190> this<00:05:51.370> an<00:05:51.490> air

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
bounce and it was stall like this an air

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.940 
bounce and it was stall like this an air
so<00:05:52.450> I<00:05:52.570> found<00:05:52.900> out<00:05:53.110> I'm<00:05:53.320> still<00:05:53.530> learning<00:05:53.680> guys

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
so I found out I'm still learning guys

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.100 
so I found out I'm still learning guys
but<00:05:54.580> I<00:05:54.820> know<00:05:55.060> that's<00:05:55.240> what<00:05:55.450> I<00:05:55.480> found<00:05:55.840> out<00:05:55.990> about

but I know that's what I found out about

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.190 
but I know that's what I found out about
this<00:05:56.320> characteristics<00:05:57.040> of<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.520> f-117<00:05:58.200> so

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
this characteristics of the f-117 so

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.190 
this characteristics of the f-117 so
that's<00:05:59.560> my<00:05:59.830> short<00:06:00.700> review<00:06:00.820> up<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.360> f-117<00:06:01.750> so

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
that's my short review up the f-117 so

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.850 
that's my short review up the f-117 so
stay<00:06:02.410> tuned<00:06:02.620> guys<00:06:02.650> for<00:06:03.130> my<00:06:03.280> future<00:06:03.520> reviews
