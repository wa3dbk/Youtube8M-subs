roll<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.659> think<00:01:18.659> humor<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.409> thing

but<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.060> comes<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.390> point<00:01:21.600> where<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
but I think there comes a point where we

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.940 
but I think there comes a point where we
cross<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> line

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
cross a line

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
cross a line
