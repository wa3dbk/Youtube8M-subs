 video telling me yes not everything is 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.240
 not all a good idea to put a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.740
 video before the game's release it's up to 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.560
 say today but I do not know 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.640
 yesterday I saw on youtube 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.170
 I do not know if you too have seen 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.200
 on gaps on the homepage one in 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.750
 did there were eight launches 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.460
 official of the modern farthouat so me 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.280
 I said to myself that it's nickel years 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.090
 have now we can we can iron 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.400
 videos nickel or not there I do not leave 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.590
 rising series is so I'm delighted to 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.090
 tell you that the scop well is from 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.740
 back so I think to make little ones 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.010
 little story she for all 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.050
 people starting to if I want to 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.860
 that as soon as they started playing 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.440
 call of duty on this game or why not 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.680
 old players who have a little bit 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.900
 to hurt her breasts who struggles to play with 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:06.560
 sniper listen to me this is basically I like 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.420
 well especially ol 118 and here I want to be 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.390
 to a level 73 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.489
 I tested the mystery and frankly 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.030
 I was a little disappointed to have a small 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.760
 preference for me of course for the ls 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.819
 118 but hey I'm waiting to see for 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.760
 the moment I just started the game 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.140
 I'm not really 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.960
 I have not yet tested all 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.840
 assets and where the fall especially was 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.240
 especially to quickly rise to the level 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.280
 to quickly reach level 80 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.140
 but I do not know yet if I have not 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.530
 past prestige because at the time 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:51.720
 current where I speak to you I am level 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:55.020
 74 here and I do not know yet for 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.480
 to do but hey we'll see then 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.650
 especially my impressions on moder of war 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.470
 3 honestly it's just the day of the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.040
 heavy this game is really very good 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.150
 successful I am really satisfied 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.610
 Honestly I'm really happy to 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.380
 to have bought it and to have read it at 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.340
 the advanced figure you I had him 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:22.530
 Friday, November 4th thanks to my friend 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.020
 armand who was able to send him the vouchers 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.510
 so I was able to try the game a little bit 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:33.570
 to the advanced seemed weird in fact that 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.820
 usually the sellers in the magazine 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.090
 video game does not let go of the game too 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.140
 easily and then they dropped a 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.420
 practically everyone on saturday 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.510
 I even received the message remains 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.280
 booking on Saturday while sees 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.150
 so the nice little sniper series 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.850
 frankly a beautiful sequence of men 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.190
 successful as I told you I 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.489
 found it really weird that the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.870
 sellers sell the game as quickly 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.340
 when i insulted kstovo i got 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.540
 improved it's not possible at a 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.390
 last one absolutely did not want to let go 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.549
 even the day before it was I had trouble 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.799
 have it block make the voice black ops that 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.450
 honestly legendary really wanted 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.070
 not let go and there this year it's 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.410
 them who just sends you a text message 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.180
 to say go ahead get the game 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.810
 so I think it's a little bit 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.850
 weird I do not know why but hey 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.840
 so when I tell you how I tell you 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.419
 say there I think I'm going to lose a 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.289
 maximum on modern warfare 3 so 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.560
 I hope the game finally that this 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.169
 gameplay will please you 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.850
 as I told you I'm going I 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.540
 gives a lot on a map me so I 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:51.490
 think because of montage episodes and that he 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.900
 agreed to tutorial ground resignations 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.600
 with you because I have not even yet 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.430
 tested the solo is so a field 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.669
 on a little player trying things 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:06.730
 to increase the want it and where so 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.230
 here I am really happy so for 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:13.090
 what's new is there really 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:15.419
 a lot of things especially something that 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.280
 I really enjoyed it 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.210
 the experience for weapons actually 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.320
 it's a kind of bar 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:29.169
 experience for weapons that has for 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.570
 maximum level 30 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:36.610
 finally 31 still a good little series 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.720
 I managed well 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:45.690
 when I told him what did I 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.690
 I forgot a memory hole 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.610
 sacred 17 time there if I'm already starting 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.440
 forgot what i'm going to say to wef by 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.840
 these sacred rules makes it a good step 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.700
 need to point to comment 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.500
 maybe it will come back to me by the 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.240
