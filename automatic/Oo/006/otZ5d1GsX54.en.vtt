00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
going to bring this up to about between

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.330 
going to bring this up to about between
105<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.989> 107<00:03:07.989> degrees<00:03:08.110> we<00:03:08.890> might<00:03:09.070> just<00:03:09.220> want

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
105 and 107 degrees we might just want

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.330 
105 and 107 degrees we might just want
to<00:03:09.519> maybe<00:03:10.080> cut<00:03:11.080> this<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.940> do<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> couple

to maybe cut this and do a couple
slivers<00:03:15.340> here<00:03:15.640> just<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.299> lip<00:03:16.480> some<00:03:17.110> of<00:03:17.260> this

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
slivers here just to lip some of this

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.000 
slivers here just to lip some of this
way<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:17.980> curd<00:03:19.440> separate<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.470> little<00:03:20.739> bit<00:03:23.010> like

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
way and curd separate a little bit like

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.910 
way and curd separate a little bit like
that<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.900> we'll<00:03:26.049> just<00:03:26.079> keep<00:03:26.380> checking<00:03:26.680> this

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
that and we'll just keep checking this

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.490 
that and we'll just keep checking this
so<00:03:27.100> don't<00:03:27.280> really<00:03:27.400> want<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.730> stir<00:03:27.970> this<00:03:28.500> may

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
so don't really want to stir this may

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.699 
so don't really want to stir this may
Swizzle<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:30.519> around<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.940> little<00:03:30.970> bit<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:32.620> to

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
Swizzle this around a little bit just to

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.310 
Swizzle this around a little bit just to
kind<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.070> keep<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.640> heat<00:03:33.989> distributed<00:03:34.989> until

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
kind of keep the heat distributed until

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.979 
kind of keep the heat distributed until
we<00:03:35.440> get<00:03:35.560> up<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.250> 105<00:03:37.150> degree<00:03:37.510> mark<00:03:37.780> and

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
we get up to that 105 degree mark and

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.229 
we get up to that 105 degree mark and
when<00:03:38.079> we<00:03:38.200> do<00:03:38.380> we'll<00:03:38.950> come<00:03:39.010> back<00:03:39.459> alright<00:03:39.880> we've

gonna<00:04:05.159> do<00:04:05.459> is<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:06.090> let<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.920> sit<00:04:07.920> for<00:04:08.000> thirty

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
gonna do is just let this sit for thirty

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.970 
gonna do is just let this sit for thirty
minutes<00:04:09.209> maybe<00:04:09.840> twenty<00:04:10.200> five<00:04:10.379> minutes<00:04:10.709> and

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
minutes maybe twenty five minutes and

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.259

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
pressed all the water out of the curd

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.229 
pressed all the water out of the curd
and<00:04:16.560> I've<00:04:17.010> got<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.400> into<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.940> stainless

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
and I've got that into the stainless

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.659 
and I've got that into the stainless
steel<00:04:18.660> stockpot<00:04:19.290> which<00:04:20.160> I'm<00:04:20.310> going<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.549> now

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
steel stockpot which I'm going to now

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.370 
steel stockpot which I'm going to now
take<00:04:20.729> up<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.449> a<00:04:21.479> bowl<00:04:21.989> boil<00:04:22.669> so<00:04:24.080> we'll<00:04:25.080> let<00:04:25.199> this

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
take up to a bowl boil so we'll let this

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.740 
take up to a bowl boil so we'll let this
come<00:04:25.680> up<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.889> a<00:04:25.979> boil<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.850> then<00:04:27.270> I<00:04:27.389> will<00:04:27.570> show

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
come up to a boil and then I will show

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.490 
come up to a boil and then I will show
you<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.050> next<00:04:28.229> step

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
you the next step

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.920 
you the next step
all<00:04:29.039> right<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.430> we've<00:04:29.550> got<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:30.360> number<00:04:30.720> of<00:04:30.810> these

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
all right so we've got a number of these
