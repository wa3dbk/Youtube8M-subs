corrosive<00:00:18.570> ammunition<00:00:18.780> the<00:00:19.680> simple<00:00:20.010> answer

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
corrosive ammunition the simple answer

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.679 
corrosive ammunition the simple answer
is<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.670> don't<00:00:20.760> need<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.029> remove<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> gas<00:00:21.480> see

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
is you don't need to remove the gas see

is you don't need to remove the gas see
from<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.929> a<00:00:21.960> Cade<00:00:22.230> clean<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.849> now<00:00:23.849> I've

from the a Cade clean it now I've

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
from the a Cade clean it now I've
disassembled<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.900> Kay<00:00:25.140> I'm<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.769> to

rifle after I fired corrosive ammunition
now<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> lot<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.869> people<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.289> pet<00:00:31.529> chemicals

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
now a lot of people have pet chemicals

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.940 
now a lot of people have pet chemicals
that<00:00:32.040> they<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.310> to<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.460> things<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.950> Windex

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
that they like to use things like Windex

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.459 
that they like to use things like Windex
with<00:00:35.160> ammonia<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:36.360> all<00:00:36.539> Windex<00:00:36.930> has<00:00:37.079> ammonia

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
with ammonia not all Windex has ammonia

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.080 
with ammonia not all Windex has ammonia
in<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.860> some<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.309> does<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.489> ammonia<00:00:38.850> d

if you buy the right stuff now ninety

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.170 
if you buy the right stuff now ninety

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
over 90 percent of them of Windex is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.729 
over 90 percent of them of Windex is
actually<00:00:45.180> nothing<00:00:45.480> more<00:00:45.660> than<00:00:46.530> good

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
actually nothing more than good

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.450 
actually nothing more than good

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.900 

that's<00:00:53.460> right

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that's right

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.060 
that's right
ammonia<00:00:54.780> doesn't<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.199> anything<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.800> corrosive

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
ammonia doesn't do anything to corrosive

this pump spray bottle and it works

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
this pump spray bottle and it works
great<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.939> putting<00:01:09.360> water<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:09.930> where<00:01:10.080> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
great for putting water right where I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.850 
great for putting water right where I
need<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> gun<00:01:10.880> now<00:01:12.350> that's<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
need it on the gun now that's just it

some people that seem to think for

whatever reason the military rifle will

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
whatever reason the military rifle will
dissolve<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.820> water<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:19.080> will<00:01:19.200> cause

dissolve in water that it will cause
rust<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:20.250> something<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.030> not

have to clean the rifle completely just

have to clean the rifle completely just
spraying<00:01:25.110> water<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> does<00:01:25.829> it<00:01:25.950> clean<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
spraying water on it does it clean the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
spraying water on it does it clean the
gun<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.210> go<00:01:27.450> through<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> follow<00:01:28.110> a

gun you have to go through and follow a
simple<00:01:28.530> process

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
simple process

simple process
now<00:01:29.490> ammonia<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> good<00:01:30.390> idea<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.810> use<00:01:30.960> on

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
now ammonia is not a good idea to use on

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.139 
now ammonia is not a good idea to use on
a<00:01:31.140> firearm<00:01:31.560> because<00:01:31.710> ammonia<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.640> actually<00:01:33.090> an

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
a firearm because ammonia is actually an

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.389 
a firearm because ammonia is actually an
acid<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.049> itself<00:01:34.320> ammonia<00:01:35.310> can

acid in and of itself ammonia can
actually<00:01:35.700> damage<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:35.970> finish<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.450> firearm

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
actually damage the finish of a firearm

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.389 
actually damage the finish of a firearm
it<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:37.350> damage<00:01:37.590> steel<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.250> it's

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
it can actually damage steel if it's

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.219 
it can actually damage steel if it's
left<00:01:38.640> sitting<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.060> steel<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.110> also

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
left sitting on steel and it can also

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
left sitting on steel and it can also
take<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> finish<00:01:40.860> off<00:01:40.979> wood<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:42.090> there's

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
take the finish off wood but there's

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.929 
take the finish off wood but there's
such<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.320> amounts<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.979> ammonia<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.549> Windex

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
such little amounts of ammonia in Windex

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.370 
such little amounts of ammonia in Windex
that<00:01:45.149> has<00:01:45.270> ammonia<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.350> really

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that has ammonia in it that really

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.899 
that has ammonia in it that really
effectively<00:01:47.040> does<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.219> whole<00:01:47.399> lot<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> nothing

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
effectively does a whole lot of nothing

ammonia<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.890> said<00:01:56.100> will<00:01:56.399> actually<00:01:56.729> damage

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
the rifle and what I've done is just

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.780 
the rifle and what I've done is just
sprayed<00:02:12.810> water<00:02:13.020> down<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.830> gas<00:02:13.980> tube<00:02:14.310> now

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
sprayed water down the gas tube now

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
to use quite a bit of it actually and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.210 
to use quite a bit of it actually and
flush<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.520> all<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:22.140> salts<00:02:22.440> off<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.860> rifle

flush it all the salts off the rifle
you'll<00:02:23.820> notice<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.270> I'm<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.540> spraying

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
you'll notice that I'm not just spraying

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.020 
you'll notice that I'm not just spraying
a<00:02:25.110> little<00:02:25.350> bit<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:26.400> calling<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.880> day

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
a little bit and then calling it a day

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.260 
a little bit and then calling it a day
you<00:02:27.960> have<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.380> wash<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.860> salts<00:02:29.220> away<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
you have to wash the salts away the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.760 
you have to wash the salts away the
water<00:02:30.510> will<00:02:30.690> break<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.990> salts<00:02:31.260> down<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:31.680> if

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
water will break the salts down but if

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.230 
water will break the salts down but if
you<00:02:31.860> don't<00:02:32.220> spray<00:02:32.490> enough<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.030> there

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
you don't spray enough of it in there

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.060 
you don't spray enough of it in there
it's<00:02:33.750> not<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.170> flush<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.560> salts<00:02:34.860> out<00:02:34.920> of

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
it's not going to flush the salts out of

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.010 
it's not going to flush the salts out of
the<00:02:35.130> rifle<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:36.120> will<00:02:36.210> just<00:02:36.330> relocate

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the rifle and it will just relocate

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.660 
the rifle and it will just relocate
those<00:02:37.170> salts<00:02:37.560> they'll<00:02:37.740> redeposit<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
those salts they'll redeposit and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.850 
those salts they'll redeposit and
continue<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.330> cause<00:02:39.480> corrosive<00:02:39.990> action<00:02:40.500> on

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
continue to cause corrosive action on

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.370 
continue to cause corrosive action on
the<00:02:40.950> metal<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.820> flush<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.240> good<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.600> also<00:02:42.870> like

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
the metal so flush it good I also like

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.040 
the metal so flush it good I also like
to<00:02:43.410> use<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.980> garden<00:02:44.730> hose<00:02:44.880> but<00:02:45.750> I'm<00:02:45.840> not<00:02:45.900> going

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
to use a garden hose but I'm not going

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.900 
to use a garden hose but I'm not going
to<00:02:46.110> do<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.290> right<00:02:46.470> now

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
to do that right now

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.880 
to do that right now
so<00:02:47.910> once<00:02:48.120> you've<00:02:48.270> sprayed<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.810> rifle<00:02:49.200> down

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
so once you've sprayed the rifle down

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.140 
so once you've sprayed the rifle down
and<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.310> get<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.580> gas<00:02:50.880> too<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.920> use<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.190> 12

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
and to get to that gas too I use a 12

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.220 
and to get to that gas too I use a 12
gauge<00:02:54.390> or<00:02:55.230> swab<00:02:56.600> just<00:02:57.600> get<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.780> nice<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:57.960> wet

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
gauge or swab just get it nice and wet

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.170 
gauge or swab just get it nice and wet
and<00:03:02.270> run<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.390> down<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:04.560> gas<00:03:04.800> tube<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.370> that

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and run it down that gas tube and that

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.430 
and run it down that gas tube and that
will<00:03:06.330> wipe<00:03:06.480> out<00:03:06.690> all<00:03:06.930> those<00:03:07.590> salts<00:03:09.200> get<00:03:10.200> nice

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
will wipe out all those salts get nice

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.240 
will wipe out all those salts get nice
and<00:03:10.470> clean<00:03:10.890> okay<00:03:12.980> flush<00:03:13.980> again<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.100> same

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
and clean okay flush again and the same

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.830 
and clean okay flush again and the same
thing<00:03:17.490> with<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.700> boar<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.630> standard

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
thing with the boar is just a standard

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.949 
thing with the boar is just a standard
jag<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.530> cleaning<00:03:22.980> patch<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:24.000> run<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:24.840> down

now the next step I like to use is an
air<00:03:47.189> compressor<00:03:47.390> in<00:03:48.390> others<00:03:48.629> glass<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.750> water

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
air compressor in others glass the water

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.110 
air compressor in others glass the water
away<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.890> dry<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.189> cut<00:03:53.430> off

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.900 

okay<00:03:59.590> but<00:04:00.590> that<00:04:00.980> isn't<00:04:01.250> enough<00:04:01.310> alone

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
okay but that isn't enough alone

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.750 
okay but that isn't enough alone
now<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.090> use<00:04:02.540> gun<00:04:03.170> scrubber<00:04:03.530> or<00:04:03.800> wd-40<00:04:04.459> both

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
now I use gun scrubber or wd-40 both

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.790 
now I use gun scrubber or wd-40 both
displace<00:04:05.390> water<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.260> it's<00:04:06.410> important<00:04:06.770> that

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
displace water and it's important that

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.650 
displace water and it's important that
you<00:04:06.950> do<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.220> it'll<00:04:07.700> completely<00:04:08.090> dry<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.450> gun

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
you do this it'll completely dry the gun

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.890 
you do this it'll completely dry the gun
off<00:04:10.450> I'm<00:04:11.450> spraying<00:04:11.900> this<00:04:12.110> with<00:04:12.350> degreaser<00:04:13.310> and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
off I'm spraying this with degreaser and

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.120 
off I'm spraying this with degreaser and
that's<00:04:14.900> just<00:04:15.170> going<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.410> strip<00:04:15.709> all<00:04:15.920> that

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
that's just going to strip all that

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.690 
that's just going to strip all that
water<00:04:16.280> away<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.669> completely<00:04:17.030> displace<00:04:17.510> it

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
water away and completely displace it

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.699 
water away and completely displace it
then<00:04:19.700> again<00:04:19.940> use<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.630> air<00:04:20.720> compressor<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.530> dry

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
then again use the air compressor to dry

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:36.040 
then again use the air compressor to dry
the<00:04:21.769> degreaser<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:34.419> you're<00:04:35.419> almost<00:04:35.510> there

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
the degreaser and you're almost there

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.460 
the degreaser and you're almost there
next<00:04:36.950> you'll<00:04:37.820> notice<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.390> gun<00:04:38.570> is

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
next you'll notice that the gun is

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.060 
next you'll notice that the gun is
completely<00:04:39.680> bone<00:04:40.250> dry<00:04:41.650> after<00:04:42.650> you<00:04:42.740> do<00:04:42.860> that

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
completely bone dry after you do that

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.450 
completely bone dry after you do that
you'll<00:04:43.400> see<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.760> white<00:04:44.300> striping<00:04:45.370> from<00:04:46.370> the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
you'll see the white striping from the

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.770 
you'll see the white striping from the
degreaser<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.970> is<00:04:47.060> completely<00:04:47.540> stripping

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
degreaser it is completely stripping

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.870 
degreaser it is completely stripping
both<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.590> water<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.040> oil<00:04:49.190> away<00:04:49.640> from<00:04:49.820> the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
both the water and oil away from the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.500 
both the water and oil away from the
firearm<00:04:50.120> use<00:04:51.110> something<00:04:51.440> like<00:04:51.470> CLP<00:04:52.070> or<00:04:52.510> even

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
firearm use something like CLP or even

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.360 
firearm use something like CLP or even
like<00:04:53.930> rim<00:04:54.169> oil<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.560> spray<00:04:54.800> can<00:04:55.040> something

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
like rim oil and a spray can something

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.540 
like rim oil and a spray can something
in<00:04:55.460> an<00:04:55.550> aerosol<00:04:55.910> can<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.389> I<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:57.160> soaked<00:04:58.160> the

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
in an aerosol can and I just soaked the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:06.370 
in an aerosol can and I just soaked the
firearm<00:05:01.660> with<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:03.080> lube<00:05:04.540> and<00:05:05.540> get<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:05.780> nice

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380

and<00:05:06.440> moist<00:05:07.280> right<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.350> then<00:05:09.350> again<00:05:10.390> take<00:05:11.390> the

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
and moist right and then again take the

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:24.140 
and moist right and then again take the
air<00:05:11.630> compressor<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.850> blow<00:05:13.850> away

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150
