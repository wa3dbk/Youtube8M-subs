00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 and 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.760
 hello I'm delighted to meet you for 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.070
 our fourth and last episode 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.960
 devoted to mechanical weeding or 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.189
 alternative of the potato before 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.660
 to talk about our fourth 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.130
 intervention I propose you to 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.529
 find stone to make a balance sheet 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.939
 following the last stone passage 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.490
 what do you think of your last 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.200
 intervention last time I'm 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.200
 intervened with the harrow 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.370
 I 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.070
 two days later I passed the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 bumper to cover so again the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.640
 mound 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.290
 here we are going to spend a new 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.809
 going through bumpers good because the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.270
 harrow we can pass 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:03.820
 we see that we still have some 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.560
 mercurial swirls and bindweed is 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.830
 also so here again a 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.460
 mercuriale that is lifted quite recently 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.290
 and so we will try to cover them 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.380
 one last time 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.000
 after good vegetation will allow to 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 cover to prevent weeds 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.900
 to actually push that's it 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.689
 stone what do you think of this passage of 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.840
 bumper this time we targeted two 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.360
 goals first was to redo 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.200
 the hillock and that's why we have here 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.579
 equipped the bumper of strong sheet metal for 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.399
 to maintain a little better view of 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.840
 better shape and is thus avoided by 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.319
 following the green ones in the good ones 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.599
 last setbacks and of course the new 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.110
 passage also serves as weeding 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:17.920
 yeah big we'll be able to see that we 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.349
 has been effective on small 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.400
 bad souls who are raised again 1 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.630
 on the other hand, it is of course for the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.730
 herbs that had passed through the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.170
 fraud the previous tracks 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.880
 it's not a solution of 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.500
 catching up so that means he 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.020
 should have 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.040
 bumper equipped with harrow weeder 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.230
 work order to flank the top 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.010
 passage what we also find 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.010
 from other manufacturers 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.209
 this last intervention is 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.260
 positioned before closing 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.360
 ramparts vegetation 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.519
 this will be the last intervention 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.040
 because the vegetation will cover quickly 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.640
 the weeds will not be able 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.500
 develop 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.150
 for this last passage I you 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.610
 advise to remove both teeth 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.290
 outside of the dial so as not to 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.290
 damage the root system 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.000
 tale 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.800
 as you can see 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.450
 mechanical weeding is possible without 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.550
 use herbicides or 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.110
 limiting their use this method of 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.080
 weeding will be all the more effective 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.520
 that spring will be dry again - 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.680
 soon in a documentary 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.880
 complete dedicated to mechanical weeding and 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.770
 alternatives of the potato 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.930
 you will learn how to drive 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.460
 technically and precisely your 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.530
 weeding route 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.150
 do not hesitate to introduce weeding 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.560
 mechanics to the alternatives in your 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.330
 weeding strategy 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.280
 We're here to accompany you 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.280
 thank you for having followed us and see you soon
