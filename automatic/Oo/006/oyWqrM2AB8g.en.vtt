few<00:03:36.180> time<00:03:36.329> throughout<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.720> fight<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:38.209> you

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
few time throughout the fight but you

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.849 
few time throughout the fight but you
know<00:03:39.329> Shane<00:03:39.780> definitely<00:03:40.200> didn't<00:03:40.440> look<00:03:40.709> as

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
know Shane definitely didn't look as

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.170 
know Shane definitely didn't look as
impressive<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.430> play<00:03:41.639> as<00:03:41.819> I<00:03:41.910> thought<00:03:42.090> he

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
impressive in that play as I thought he

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.449 
impressive in that play as I thought he
would<00:03:42.349> but<00:03:43.349> he<00:03:43.380> did<00:03:43.590> get<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.829> last<00:03:43.980> second<00:03:44.310> win

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
would but he did get the last second win

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.970 
would but he did get the last second win
awesome<00:03:45.030> ending<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.840> fight<00:03:46.139> definitely<00:03:46.919> a

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
awesome ending to a fight definitely a

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.770 
awesome ending to a fight definitely a
raised<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.549> level<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.060> fight<00:03:48.299> because

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
raised the level of that fight because

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.059 
raised the level of that fight because
it<00:03:49.019> wasn't<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.260> most<00:03:49.410> exciting<00:03:49.799> throughout

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
it wasn't the most exciting throughout

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.580 
it wasn't the most exciting throughout
but<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.310> end<00:03:50.459> he<00:03:50.549> made<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:52.260> he<00:03:52.380> did<00:03:52.560> it

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
but the end he made it and he did it

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.629 
but the end he made it and he did it
pretty<00:03:52.799> good<00:03:52.950> nough<00:03:53.040> cotto<00:03:53.220> fight<00:03:53.310> though

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639

definitely a close one almost could have

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.610 
definitely a close one almost could have
gone<00:03:58.859> either<00:03:58.889> way<00:03:59.160> but<00:03:59.340> uh<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.790> guess<00:04:00.090> Kota

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
gone either way but uh I guess Kota

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.129

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
previous videos I think Shane's a little

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.719 
previous videos I think Shane's a little
bit<00:04:15.540> past<00:04:15.720> his<00:04:15.900> prime<00:04:16.070> not<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.220> say<00:04:17.340> still<00:04:17.579> not

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
a good fighter but doesn't have the same

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.399 
a good fighter but doesn't have the same
speed<00:04:20.640> used<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:21.000> have<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.049> doesn't<00:04:22.289> throw

Shane<00:07:17.320> I<00:07:17.350> think<00:07:17.590> he<00:07:17.650> could<00:07:17.770> have<00:07:17.860> outboxed

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840

Shane I think he could have outboxed
margarito<00:07:19.840> could<00:07:20.050> he<00:07:20.110> used<00:07:20.230> effective

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
footwork like I said he goes faster few

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.890 
footwork like I said he goes faster few
years<00:07:24.070> back<00:07:24.250> cuz<00:07:25.180> you<00:07:25.360> know<00:07:25.480> just<00:07:25.660> stayed<00:07:25.810> on
