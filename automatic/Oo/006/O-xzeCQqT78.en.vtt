sounds like an easier nonstick way to
make<00:03:56.930> them<00:03:57.140> because<00:03:57.500> since<00:03:57.710> you<00:03:57.770> can't<00:03:57.980> use

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
make them because since you can't use

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.710 
make them because since you can't use
butter<00:03:58.400> or<00:03:58.670> oil<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.960> grease<00:04:00.770> up<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:01.300> tins<00:04:02.300> I

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
butter or oil to grease up the tins I

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.870 
butter or oil to grease up the tins I
found<00:04:03.350> that's<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.620> little<00:04:03.860> cupcake<00:04:04.100> papers<00:04:04.700> or

sheets<00:04:05.320> look<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.440> lot<00:04:06.590> better<00:04:06.710> they<00:04:06.920> don't

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
sheets look a lot better they don't

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.400 
sheets look a lot better they don't
stick<00:04:07.460> because<00:04:07.880> if<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.090> don't<00:04:08.270> use<00:04:08.840> these<00:04:09.110> it

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
stick because if you don't use these it

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:17.680 
stick because if you don't use these it
won't<00:04:09.680> stick<00:04:14.740> and<00:04:15.740> then<00:04:16.180> I'm<00:04:17.180> gonna<00:04:17.270> take<00:04:17.480> your

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
won't stick and then I'm gonna take your

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.800 
won't stick and then I'm gonna take your
mix<00:04:18.370> just<00:04:19.370> take<00:04:19.640> a<00:04:19.670> little<00:04:20.060> bit<00:04:20.210> and<00:04:20.330> fill<00:04:20.600> it

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
mix just take a little bit and fill it

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
mix just take a little bit and fill it
3/4<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.680> way<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:23.930> just<00:04:24.140> take<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:24.560> and

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
3/4 of the way so I just take this and

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:34.220 
3/4 of the way so I just take this and
another<00:04:25.010> spoon<00:04:26.020> just<00:04:27.020> scoop<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.470> in<00:04:27.650> gently

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.730 

so<00:04:35.230> it<00:04:35.500> should<00:04:35.680> look<00:04:35.710> something<00:04:35.830> like<00:04:36.550> that

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
so it should look something like that

00:04:37.740 --> 00:05:03.460 
so it should look something like that
like<00:04:38.740> this

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.560 

and<00:05:04.400> when<00:05:04.520> you're<00:05:04.640> finished<00:05:04.820> it<00:05:05.240> looks<00:05:05.420> to

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
and when you're finished it looks to

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.130 
and when you're finished it looks to
look<00:05:05.690> something<00:05:05.990> like<00:05:06.020> this

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
look something like this

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.410
