of<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.770> gimbal<00:01:12.100> down<00:01:12.340> meaning<00:01:12.820> all<00:01:13.060> the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
of the gimbal down meaning all the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.780 
of the gimbal down meaning all the

contacts are actually inside of the
central<00:01:16.180> ring<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:17.020> you<00:01:17.049> can<00:01:17.200> rotate<00:01:17.590> the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
central ring so you can rotate the

this<00:03:57.850> guy<00:03:58.090> has<00:03:58.570> foldable<00:03:59.410> arms<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:01.060> you

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
this guy has foldable arms and so you

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.580 
this guy has foldable arms and so you
can<00:04:01.330> throw<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.540> in<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.810> hard<00:04:01.990> case<00:04:02.230> pretty

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
can throw it in a hard case pretty

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.150 
can throw it in a hard case pretty
easily<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.430> propellers<00:04:03.880> fold<00:04:04.180> up<00:04:04.390> so<00:04:05.160> my

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
easily the propellers fold up so my

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.650

look like hamburger because of
multicopter<00:04:10.090> problems<00:04:10.480> in<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.690> past<00:04:11.010> this

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
multicopter problems in the past this

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.770 
multicopter problems in the past this
should<00:04:12.340> actually<00:04:12.520> help<00:04:13.000> with<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.510> little

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.650 

yeah<00:04:43.310> that's<00:04:43.640> pretty<00:04:43.820> stupid<00:04:44.120> when<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:44.450> do

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
yeah that's pretty stupid when you do

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.700 
yeah that's pretty stupid when you do
stuff<00:04:44.870> like<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.290> or<00:04:46.390> and<00:04:47.390> but<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:48.410> should

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
stuff like that or and but it should

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.320 
stuff like that or and but it should
actually<00:04:48.920> help<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.550> little<00:04:49.880> bit<00:04:50.060> with<00:04:50.210> the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
actually help a little bit with the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.030 
actually help a little bit with the
injuries<00:04:50.720> but<00:04:50.750> it's<00:04:51.140> great<00:04:51.560> for<00:04:51.740> portability

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
injuries but it's great for portability

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.280 
injuries but it's great for portability
also<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:52.970> believes<00:04:53.180> are<00:04:53.330> really<00:04:53.570> flexible<00:04:53.840> so

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
also the believes are really flexible so

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.540 
also the believes are really flexible so
I<00:04:54.320> would<00:04:54.470> probably<00:04:55.070> think<00:04:55.250> they<00:04:55.400> would

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
I would probably think they would

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.850 
I would probably think they would
shatter<00:04:55.820> if<00:04:56.150> they<00:04:56.510> actually<00:04:56.660> hit<00:04:56.990> you<00:04:57.170> which

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
shatter if they actually hit you which

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.550 
shatter if they actually hit you which
may<00:04:58.310> be<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.460> good<00:04:58.550> thing<00:04:58.940> maybe<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.240> bad<00:04:59.450> thing<00:04:59.690> at

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
may be a good thing maybe a bad thing at

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.900 
may be a good thing maybe a bad thing at
any<00:05:00.980> rate<00:05:01.160> let's<00:05:01.190> go<00:05:01.490> ahead<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:01.730> get<00:05:01.790> the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
any rate let's go ahead and get the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.560 
any rate let's go ahead and get the
sucker<00:05:02.150> in<00:05:02.240> here<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:02.660> see<00:05:03.020> what<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.170> can<00:05:03.410> do
