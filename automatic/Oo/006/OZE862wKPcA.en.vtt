 the second thing is this afternoon 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.979

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.079
 usual these courses the report so a 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.770
 technical eye a little bit different 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.959
 make them proposals 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.599
 a little bit different training and 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.580
 then especially to create a collective 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.440
 that is to say that we will create teams 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.150
 from Brittany to go in various 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
 collective who know each other 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.260
 encourage each other and that 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.379
