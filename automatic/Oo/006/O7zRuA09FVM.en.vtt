00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Well, Javier is already with us 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.190
 ortega of the defense foundation the nation 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.080
 spanish javier very good night very 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.519
 Good night, Carlos, how sad it is 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.570
 that defend the Spanishness of those 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.550
 waters when it is evident that they are 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.870
 Spanish but hey hey posts to the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.560
 situation that we have at least that 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.060
 it is done you are one of the divers apart 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.710
 to see if we other times 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.449
 in the program etcetera etcetera you are 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.949
 one of those that you directly got 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.529
 in the water to do the whole maneuver 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.539
 to hold him with the inflatables take out the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.160
 block and take what happens there as 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.029
 has been history because history is 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.040
 a story that is being prepared 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.440
 for many months the first 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.270
 tests and tests we already did in the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.250
 November and since then 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.500
 a team of divers with the support of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.329
 local people with fishermen there 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.370
 which are really why we have 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.530
 done all this because we designed a 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.700
 operation certainly complicated because 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 you had to enter waters that have 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 been watched and especially in these 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 days for the minister's visit for the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.190
 British European relations and a high 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.859
 command of the royal navy in were 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.260
 specially protected with patrol boats 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.790
 British with a walk from the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.440
 first moment you were going there 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.850
 if they come to know we would not have 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.680
 no possibility what happens is that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.630
 well we did reasonably well 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.860
 we have managed to get that block out there 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.510
 to explain how you already have 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.520
 ahead that is a block of 2500 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.990
 kilos there are more than 70 blocks but what 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.970
 important of this is because they are there 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.890
 they are for to prevent some 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 fishermen who have been holding all the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.790
 life in those waters in small families 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 of modest economies can not work 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.910
 because by pulling their nets they get hooked and 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.910
 they break then it's really 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.530
 unfortunate the intervention that we did 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.360
 it's a symbolic act is to demonstrate 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.310
 also to the Spanish government that if 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.430
 wants can we be a foundation 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.560
 civilian with very limited means but 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.850
 with obvious goodwill and with 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.619
 effort and work along 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.600
 many people because we have achieved 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.190
 we managed to do this so sad 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 some way is that the government 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.270
 avoided at the last moment when the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.570
 block was already next to a boardwalk 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.430
 quite 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.590
 separated from these conflicting waters 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.030
 we wanted to use it we wanted to ride it in 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.560
 a truck that we had there prepared 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.790
 so that it can be displayed by Spain and the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.619
 people knew the reality of what 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.360
 is happening to the fishermen we 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.130
 prevented a truly device 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.650
 surprising more than 50 agents of the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.090
 Civil guard of the port police 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.539
 came even the sea-light ship that 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.159
 it sounded 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.930
 the greatest there is of society 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.450
 of marine salvage came the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.010
 geas came to a canine unit of 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.780
 dogs city that really was a 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.549
 movie display that we 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.349
 we asked why they do not devote everything 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.239
 this deployment and all this cost by 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.430
 true of we climbed 12 hours there 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.650
 retained because they do not dedicate all those 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.030
 stops entities analyze in the block 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.040
 asleep and hours since the guard 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.859
 civilian who works far better than 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.720
 gibraltar surveillance services 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:40.590
 located that we had already reached the 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.000
 let's say safe and they located us and 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.720
 at the time we were about to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.159
 Hoist it to the truck they kept us but 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.079
 really sad is this what the 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.489
 finalist that because there was that 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.959
 instruction that for six of you not 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.879
 I could take the block that I did not 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.139
 you ride and if you show it there has to be 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.340
 let's go I say it's about I understand that 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.720
 there may have been a call from 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.639
 British government a call from 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.290
 gibraltar well sure you are not interested 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.730
 the British government is interested in 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.879
 Government of Gibraltar is not interested in 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.139
 government because some like as 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.879
 British government and the government of 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.799
 Gibraltar because it is obvious to the 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.870
 take out those back irons in the water 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.099
 that you were mentioning that block 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.560
 that impressive piece remains in 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.790
 evidence 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.500
 we have only been able to remove it without 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.209
 find out second that I remember that the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.620
 first version is how they are going to move 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.780
 those blocks and I remind you that we 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.920
 we had divers in the program who 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.050
 they said to see that it is not a question of 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.550
 drag it or raise it to weight that 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.530
 it's not a question of what can be 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.270
 it's precisely holding with a few 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.560
 inflatables the inflatables go up already 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.390
 from that moment you drag them 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.220
 good but it has its complexity because 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.680
 all this is done at night for three 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.090
 days moved from lotion was at night the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.739
 operation was totally at night 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.989
 for three days moving a price a 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.940
 weight of 2500 kilos which is a very heavy 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.830
 dangerous to move in the water and everything 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.680
 this was done in addition with patrol boats of 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.360
 the British police hovering over those 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.160
 waters I say especially for the visit 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.180
 that they had these days and that's why we have 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.130
 made even though it came 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.410
 Preparing since November but of course 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.519
 All this, if I can, is a car 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.870
 What I do not want is for us to stay 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.250
 in the anecdote of what it is to withdraw a 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.019
 ship in block here what you have to 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.030
 to make clear is what Gibraltar is and 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.040
 We also wanted to somehow 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.170
 draw attention to society 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.640
 Spanish that the government is doing 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.290
 a neglect of functions a neglect 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.959
 forgiveness of functions because in waters 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.359
 Spanish judiciary was seen to see so 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.130
 of 70 concrete blocks is prive to 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.449
 some Spanish fishermen the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.639
 to be able to fish and has not done 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.250
 absolutely nothing when they are being 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.539
 subsequently harassed in addition to pulling 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.099
 those blocks when they try to get closer 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.289
 with their boats are harassed by the 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.240
 Gibraltarian patrol boats have even 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.009
 beaten boats of the civil guard 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.110
 these are acting an illegal way 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.699
 of what a colony is that is 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.949
 beginning to end illegal because it is a 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.800
 colony that should be sovereign 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.169
 Spanish where impunity is allowed 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.610
 in drug trafficking where 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.500
 allows impunity in trafficking 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.810
 tobacco where there is money laundering 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.310
 where there are more than three companies per 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.930
 money laundering companies by 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.699
 each one of the Gibraltarians is saying 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.229
 that is not allowed is fishing because with 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.849
 those waters in that situation full of 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.080
 blocks right now about I understand 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.460
 that there is no fishing capacity for 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.020
 Spanish boats no no no 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.880
 no possibility and if a 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.490
 ship immediately the 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.870
 patrol cars surround them even to 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.639
 you did it at night 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.289
 precisely to obviously avoid the 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.150
 visual contact that you can approach the 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.979
 eye contact whoever they saw 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.050
 type of boat above and the one 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.210
 could avoid this 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.759
 this action repeated protest action 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.199
 action that has called me a lot 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.539
 attention and dig a lot of pity that the 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.430
 mayor of algeciras mayor of the party 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.590
 popular has gone out immediately to do 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.080
 statements saying that Spain is a 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.030
 serious country says and that these acts of 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.580
 bravado do not have to accept 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.650
 because they are also acts says where 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.120
 puts navigation and navigation at serious risk 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.770
 this man you have to tell him first the 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.030
 bravado is that of the government of 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.440
 gibraltar pulling a few blocks of 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.690
 concrete in jurisdictional waters 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.639
 Spanish bravado is threatening 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.530
 with a boat from the royal navy a boat 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.610
 armed with war to small fishermen 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.190
 who make their living as well 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.840
 but that's bravado and insults 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.310
 and the constant statements about a 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.400
 supposed sovereignty of those waters and of the 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.229
 rock and he does not know absolutely how 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.759
 the operation was done because what yes 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.469
 caused a real risk to the 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.960
 navigation was when they put a boat 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.280
 throwing concrete blocks when 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.210
 I was fishing in those waters and a 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.979
 lightly touched 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.710
 any boat if there 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.909
 produced an accident it is clear that 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.860
 what we did that was made of 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.569
 underwater way that was made below 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.279
 even if a boat had passed through 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.150
 up there would have been no risk
