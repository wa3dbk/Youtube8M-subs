simply grab the laser and slide it
forward<00:00:40.149> it's<00:00:40.899> going<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.230> make<00:00:41.379> a<00:00:41.410> clicking

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739

sound but it's not breaking it's going
to<00:00:45.610> begin<00:00:45.850> spinning<00:00:47.219> its<00:00:48.219> gonna<00:00:48.430> read<00:00:48.670> the

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
to begin spinning its gonna read the

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:59.870 
to begin spinning its gonna read the
disk

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:10.330 

never<00:01:00.880> besides<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.540> read<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.750> disk

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.469 

there<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.490> go

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.640 

all<00:01:17.479> right<00:01:17.680> it's<00:01:18.680> good<00:01:18.950> all<00:01:19.280> said<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.640> done

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
eventually if you have your legs are too

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.359 
eventually if you have your legs are too
far<00:01:29.210> back<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.720> will<00:01:29.840> always<00:01:30.110> move<00:01:30.650> backwards<00:01:31.250> a

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
far back it will always move backwards a

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.219 
far back it will always move backwards a
little<00:01:31.400> more<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:32.300> it's<00:01:32.510> already<00:01:32.780> here

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
little more and if it's already here

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.840 
little more and if it's already here
it's<00:01:33.890> just<00:01:34.130> going<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.310> move<00:01:34.369> back<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.729> it's

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
it's just going to move back and it's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.350 
it's just going to move back and it's
not<00:01:35.030> going<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.270> read<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.570> disc<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:37.360> what

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
not going to read the disc so what

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.609 
not going to read the disc so what
you're<00:01:38.540> going<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.810> do<00:01:39.050> is<00:01:39.229> you're<00:01:39.320> going<00:01:39.500> to

this metal piece that these nylon
washers<00:03:02.860> are<00:03:03.010> next<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.599> your<00:03:04.599> going<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:05.019> want

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
washers are next to your going to want

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.970 
washers are next to your going to want
to<00:03:05.230> take<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.709> twist<00:03:06.670> tie<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:08.709> wrap<00:03:08.950> it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
to take this twist tie and just wrap it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.430 
to take this twist tie and just wrap it
around<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.790> then<00:03:10.180> twist<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.959> together<00:03:11.110> to

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
around and then twist it together to

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.440 
around and then twist it together to
hold<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.769> in<00:03:11.860> place<00:03:12.010> because<00:03:12.849> when<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.269> disc

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
hold it in place because when the disc

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.570 
hold it in place because when the disc
is<00:03:13.630> spinning<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.950> going<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.430> make<00:03:15.550> a

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
is spinning it's going to make a

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.479 
is spinning it's going to make a
vibration<00:03:16.269> that's<00:03:16.540> going<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.069> slide<00:03:18.069> the

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
vibration that's going to slide the

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.400 
vibration that's going to slide the
nylon<00:03:19.000> washers<00:03:19.450> down<00:03:20.350> along<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.280> rail<00:03:21.489> and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
nylon washers down along the rail and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.900 
nylon washers down along the rail and
we're<00:03:23.410> not<00:03:23.560> exactly<00:03:23.739> sure<00:03:24.069> what<00:03:24.430> that'll<00:03:24.760> do

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
we're not exactly sure what that'll do

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.710 
we're not exactly sure what that'll do
but<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:26.019> may<00:03:26.200> make<00:03:26.380> some<00:03:26.500> clingy<00:03:26.860> noises<00:03:27.720> you

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
but it may make some clingy noises you

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.470 
but it may make some clingy noises you
probably<00:03:28.989> want<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:32.790> all<00:03:33.790> right<00:03:33.940> now<00:03:34.450> that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
probably want that all right now that

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.720 
probably want that all right now that
you<00:03:34.810> have<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.200> twist<00:03:35.500> tie<00:03:35.769> twist<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.489> around

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
you have the twist tie twist it around

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.820 
you have the twist tie twist it around
this<00:03:37.060> little<00:03:37.599> metal<00:03:37.810> bracket<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.500> hold<00:03:38.530> the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
this little metal bracket to hold the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.880 
this little metal bracket to hold the
washers<00:03:39.360> what's<00:03:40.360> going<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.690> happen<00:03:41.170> is<00:03:41.590> that

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
washers what's going to happen is that

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.160 
washers what's going to happen is that
notice<00:03:42.790> how<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.000> laser<00:03:43.299> is<00:03:43.450> all<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.810> way<00:03:43.900> back

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
notice how the laser is all the way back

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.039 
notice how the laser is all the way back
it's<00:03:45.040> still<00:03:45.489> going<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:46.209> not<00:03:46.360> read<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.750> disc

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
it's still going to not read the disc

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.960 
it's still going to not read the disc
but<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.530> will<00:03:47.650> reset<00:03:48.099> itself<00:03:48.160> because<00:03:48.790> it's

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
but it will reset itself because it's

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.500 
but it will reset itself because it's
noticing<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.599> it's<00:03:49.810> there<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:54.510> once

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
noticing that it's there like this once

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.640 
noticing that it's there like this once
again<00:03:55.690> don't<00:03:56.049> look<00:03:56.170> at<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.380> laser<00:03:56.590> directly

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
again don't look at the laser directly

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.840 
again don't look at the laser directly
see<00:03:59.650> how<00:03:59.799> it<00:03:59.920> reset<00:04:00.250> itself

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.240 

now<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.720> may<00:04:06.900> for<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.290> actually<00:04:07.920> read<00:04:08.100> the
