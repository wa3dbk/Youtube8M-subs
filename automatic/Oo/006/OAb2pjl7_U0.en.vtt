hey<00:00:13.590> guys<00:00:13.830> what<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.549> seemed<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.849> right

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
hey guys what is up it seemed is right

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.310 
hey guys what is up it seemed is right
here<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.420> today<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.780> video<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.080> you

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
here and today have a video for you

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.340 
here and today have a video for you
reviewing<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.340> carbon<00:00:17.670> fiber<00:00:17.880> Omni<00:00:18.510> case<00:00:18.840> /

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350

cover<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> ipad<00:00:20.310> 2<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.449> new<00:00:21.570> iPad

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
cover for the ipad 2 and the new iPad

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.500 
cover for the ipad 2 and the new iPad
now<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.859> carbon<00:00:23.340> fiber<00:00:23.609> look<00:00:24.210> this

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
now this is the carbon fiber look this

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.790 
now this is the carbon fiber look this
is<00:00:24.689> not<00:00:24.720> actually<00:00:25.019> made<00:00:25.289> out<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.500> carbon<00:00:25.650> fiber

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
is not actually made out of carbon fiber

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.620 
is not actually made out of carbon fiber
it's<00:00:26.430> made<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.880> durable<00:00:26.939> polycarbonate

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it's made out of a durable polycarbonate

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.439 
it's made out of a durable polycarbonate
material<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.949> made<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.429> resemble<00:00:29.640> carbon

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
material that is made to resemble carbon

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.420 
material that is made to resemble carbon
fiber<00:00:30.660> now<00:00:30.869> carbon<00:00:31.230> fiber<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.769> extremely<00:00:32.279> hard

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
fiber now carbon fiber is extremely hard

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.549 
fiber now carbon fiber is extremely hard
to<00:00:32.610> get<00:00:32.790> into<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.059> case<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:34.230> would<00:00:34.380> probably

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
to get into a case that would probably

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.799 
to get into a case that would probably
take<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> lot<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.130> work<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:36.210> probably

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
take a lot of work and it's probably

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
take a lot of work and it's probably
very<00:00:36.989> expensive<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.100> they<00:00:38.399> did<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.670> actually

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
very expensive so they did not actually

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.639 
very expensive so they did not actually
put<00:00:39.270> real<00:00:39.480> carbon<00:00:39.719> fiber<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.260> made<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.500> look

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
put real carbon fiber it's made to look

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.319 
put real carbon fiber it's made to look
like<00:00:40.800> carbon<00:00:41.190> fiber<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.090> still<00:00:42.270> very

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
like carbon fiber but it is still very

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.799 
like carbon fiber but it is still very
durable<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.020> lightweight<00:00:43.350> now<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.820> also<00:00:45.420> have

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
durable and lightweight now I also have

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
durable and lightweight now I also have
the<00:00:46.110> black<00:00:46.260> version<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.980> comes<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.309> two

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the black version this comes in two

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420 
the black version this comes in two
versions<00:00:47.610> currently<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.870> black<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.430> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
versions currently the black and the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.819 
versions currently the black and the
carbon<00:00:50.640> fiber<00:00:50.969> black<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.199> only<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.590> this

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
carbon fiber black now I only have this

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
carbon fiber black now I only have this
because<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> friend<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> mine<00:00:53.489> had<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.059> he

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
because a friend of mine had it and he

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
because a friend of mine had it and he
happened<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.539> let<00:00:54.780> me<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.860> have

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
happened to let me use it I just have

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.500 
happened to let me use it I just have
this<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.489> purposes<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.210> review

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
this for the purposes of this review

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.000 
this for the purposes of this review
just<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> show<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.230> guys<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.469> little<00:00:58.649> bit<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
just to show you guys a little bit of

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
just to show you guys a little bit of
what<00:00:59.460> i<00:00:59.489> think<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.789> both<00:00:59.940> of<00:00:59.969> them<00:01:00.149> they're

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
what i think of both of them they're

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.090 
what i think of both of them they're
both<00:01:00.570> identical<00:01:00.719> cases<00:01:01.440> except<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> look

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
both identical cases except for the look

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.369 
both identical cases except for the look
and<00:01:02.309> slightly<00:01:03.059> feel<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.600> mainly<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.199> look

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and slightly feel but mainly the look

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.010 
and slightly feel but mainly the look
now<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:05.880> notice<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.840> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
now this one you will notice that it is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.359 
now this one you will notice that it is
slightly<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.350> raising<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.310> is

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
slightly more raising this one this is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
slightly more raising this one this is
more<00:01:08.610> flat<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.150> one's<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.810> bit<00:01:09.990> more

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
more flat this one's a little bit more

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.719 
more flat this one's a little bit more
raised<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> Rays<00:01:11.100> more<00:01:11.430> because

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
raised and I like the Rays more because

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
raised and I like the Rays more because
you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> easily<00:01:12.450> grip<00:01:12.750> onto<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.350> lot

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you can easily grip onto this a lot

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.200 
you can easily grip onto this a lot
easier<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.549> open<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
easier when you have to open it up so I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.920 
easier when you have to open it up so I
personally<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.290> lot<00:01:16.740> more<00:01:17.240> now<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
personally like that a lot more now so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.280 
personally like that a lot more now so
far<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.439> doesn't<00:01:19.650> seem<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.430> much

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
far it doesn't seem like there's much

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.100 
far it doesn't seem like there's much
force<00:01:22.290> required<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.460> open<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.810> takes

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
force required to open this up it takes

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.289 
force required to open this up it takes
a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.320> bit<00:01:25.470> more<00:01:25.650> force<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.159> open<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
a little bit more force to open up the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.969 
a little bit more force to open up the
carbon<00:01:27.600> fiber<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.439> tiny<00:01:28.770> bit

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
carbon fiber one because it's a tiny bit

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.710 
carbon fiber one because it's a tiny bit
heavier<00:01:29.280> I've<00:01:29.759> noticed<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> carbon<00:01:30.540> fiber

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
heavier I've noticed the carbon fiber

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.120 
heavier I've noticed the carbon fiber
one<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.320> bit<00:01:31.439> heavier<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> cover

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
one is a little bit heavier in the cover

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890 
one is a little bit heavier in the cover
but<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:32.729> too<00:01:33.030> noticeable<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.750> it's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
but that's not too noticeable and it's

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.230 
but that's not too noticeable and it's
fine<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.770> my<00:01:34.890> opinion<00:01:35.130> now<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> back

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
fine in my opinion now on the back

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
fine in my opinion now on the back
they're<00:01:36.630> actually<00:01:37.079> having<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> same<00:01:37.680> matte

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
they're actually having the same matte

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.030 
they're actually having the same matte
finish<00:01:39.049> almost<00:01:40.049> an<00:01:40.140> identical<00:01:40.200> matte<00:01:40.710> finish

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
finish almost an identical matte finish

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.310 
finish almost an identical matte finish
and<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.880> cutouts<00:01:42.119> are<00:01:42.509> almost<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> identical

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
and the cutouts are almost the identical

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.219 
and the cutouts are almost the identical
size<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:45.210> there's<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:45.990> no<00:01:46.200> difference

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
size so there's really no difference

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.770 
size so there's really no difference
there<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.579> feels<00:01:47.909> almost<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.360> same<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
there it feels almost the same on the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780 
there it feels almost the same on the
back<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.110> one's<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.500> more<00:01:50.009> smooth<00:01:50.399> matte

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
back this one's a more smooth matte

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.819 
back this one's a more smooth matte
finish<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.500> feel<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> little

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
finish and this one you feel a little

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.679 
finish and this one you feel a little
bit<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.430> stick<00:01:53.880> kind<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.299> similar<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
bit of a stick kind of similar to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.870 
bit of a stick kind of similar to
silicon<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.530> identical<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
silicon but not identical to it it's a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.060 
silicon but not identical to it it's a
little<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.299> sticky<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.049> use<00:01:58.770> more

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
little bit more sticky and use more

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.889 
little bit more sticky and use more
friction<00:01:59.430> than<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
friction than this one this one you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.350 
friction than this one this one you
slide<00:02:01.290> across<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:02.009> not<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.759> much<00:02:03.000> so

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
slide across this one not that much so

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.929 
slide across this one not that much so
and<00:02:03.770> that's<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.100> for<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> back<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and that's really it for the back and

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.910 
and that's really it for the back and
they're<00:02:06.509> almost<00:02:06.719> identical<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.680> tell

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
they're almost identical as you can tell

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.140 
they're almost identical as you can tell
and<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.830> cover<00:02:11.069> itself<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:11.910> stays

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and on the cover itself this one stays

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.250 
and on the cover itself this one stays
flat<00:02:12.450> now

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
flat now

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.369

this<00:02:13.709> one's<00:02:13.920> been<00:02:14.189> in<00:02:14.489> use<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:14.790> over<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.750> couple

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
this one's been in use for over a couple

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.420 
this one's been in use for over a couple

of months and this one the carbon fiber
one<00:02:20.610> was<00:02:20.819> given<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.269> me<00:02:21.420> about<00:02:21.659> a<00:02:21.810> week<00:02:22.019> go<00:02:22.260> from

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
crafts for sending this out now it's a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.399 
crafts for sending this out now it's a
little<00:02:27.000> bit<00:02:27.150> raised<00:02:27.480> above<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.810> surface<00:02:28.049> now

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
little bit raised above the surface now

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.600 
little bit raised above the surface now
that's<00:02:28.590> probably<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.069> go<00:02:29.189> away<00:02:29.280> over

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
that's probably going to go away over

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.520 
that's probably going to go away over
time<00:02:29.819> but<00:02:30.510> that's<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:30.810> something<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.319> note

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
time but that's just something to note

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.470 
time but that's just something to note
in<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.950> first<00:02:32.190> couple<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.579> weeks<00:02:32.640> you're

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
in the first couple of weeks you're

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.699 
in the first couple of weeks you're
going<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.659> notice<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.019> it's<00:02:34.140> sticking<00:02:34.409> up<00:02:34.590> a

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
going to notice that it's sticking up a

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.990 
going to notice that it's sticking up a
little<00:02:34.920> bit<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.489> might<00:02:35.640> have<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.819> press

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
little bit and you might have to press

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.240 
little bit and you might have to press
down<00:02:36.030> maybe<00:02:37.019> overnight<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.890> could<00:02:38.069> leave

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
down maybe overnight you could leave

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.920 
down maybe overnight you could leave
something<00:02:38.549> heavy<00:02:38.879> on<00:02:38.940> top<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.629> a<00:02:39.659> book

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
something heavy on top of it like a book

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.099 
something heavy on top of it like a book
and<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.950> could<00:02:41.159> take<00:02:41.400> care<00:02:41.849> of<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.840> I

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
and that could take care of it but I

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.750 
and that could take care of it but I
didn't<00:02:43.470> do<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.159> just<00:02:44.310> wanting<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.640> see

didn't do that I was just wanting to see
how<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.209> would<00:02:45.299> last<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.840> as<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.560> tell<00:02:46.620> us

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
how it would last so as you can tell us

coming out with it I don't know if

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.900 
coming out with it I don't know if
they're<00:03:16.349> planning<00:03:16.680> about<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.069> but<00:03:17.489> blue<00:03:17.760> would

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
they're planning about it but blue would

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.189 
they're planning about it but blue would
look<00:03:17.940> nice<00:03:18.239> in<00:03:18.389> this<00:03:18.510> case<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.049> my

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
look nice in this case just in my

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.150 
look nice in this case just in my
opinion<00:03:19.500> now<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.209> corner<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:22.160> smart

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
opinion now on the corner of this smart

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.039 
opinion now on the corner of this smart
cover<00:03:23.370> replacement<00:03:23.579> there<00:03:24.239> are<00:03:24.359> some<00:03:24.510> magnets

cover replacement there are some magnets
laid<00:03:25.319> down<00:03:25.530> there's<00:03:26.250> some<00:03:26.430> tension<00:03:26.639> when<00:03:26.940> you

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
laid down there's some tension when you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.000 
laid down there's some tension when you
try<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.209> lift<00:03:27.449> it<00:03:27.569> up<00:03:27.660> as<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.139> can<00:03:28.230> hear<00:03:28.290> its

try to lift it up as you can hear its
opening<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.609> closing<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.209> hear<00:03:30.329> that

clicking<00:03:30.690> sound<00:03:30.840> from<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.290> ipad<00:03:31.709> speakers

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
clicking sound from the ipad speakers

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.210 
clicking sound from the ipad speakers
but<00:03:32.940> there's<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.269> little<00:03:33.419> bit<00:03:33.569> of<00:03:33.629> a<00:03:34.230> tension

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
but there's a little bit of a tension

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.800 
but there's a little bit of a tension
when<00:03:35.669> you<00:03:35.790> try<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.000> separate<00:03:36.419> this<00:03:36.569> because

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
when you try to separate this because

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.300 
when you try to separate this because
there<00:03:36.959> are<00:03:37.019> some<00:03:37.169> magnets<00:03:37.919> and<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:38.160> will

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
there are some magnets and that will

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.949 
there are some magnets and that will
help<00:03:38.459> keep<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.879> smart<00:03:39.150> cover<00:03:39.359> or<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
help keep the smart cover or the

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.839 
help keep the smart cover or the
replacements<00:03:40.620> mark<00:03:40.799> over<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.220> place<00:03:41.519> when<00:03:41.760> you

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
replacements mark over in place when you

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.729 
replacements mark over in place when you
place<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.180> down<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.840> doesn't<00:03:42.870> wiggle

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
place it down so it doesn't wiggle

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.319 
place it down so it doesn't wiggle
around<00:03:44.010> when<00:03:44.459> you're<00:03:44.579> using<00:03:44.819> this<00:03:45.060> or

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
around when you're using this or

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.210 
around when you're using this or
carrying<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.810> around<00:03:45.870> because<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.829> magnets

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
carrying it around because the magnets

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.470 
carrying it around because the magnets
are<00:03:47.280> going<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.459> help<00:03:47.669> to<00:03:47.790> hold<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.120> down<00:03:48.239> which

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
are going to help to hold it down which

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.360 
are going to help to hold it down which
is<00:03:48.599> a<00:03:48.629> really<00:03:48.989> nice<00:03:49.109> feature<00:03:49.349> I'm<00:03:49.829> glad<00:03:50.099> they

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
is a really nice feature I'm glad they

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.490 
is a really nice feature I'm glad they
included<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.879> now<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.780> case<00:03:51.959> itself<00:03:52.260> is

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
included that now the case itself is

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.559 
included that now the case itself is
really<00:03:52.709> protective<00:03:53.280> even<00:03:53.849> if<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.209> decide<00:03:54.540> not

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
really protective even if you decide not

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.069 
really protective even if you decide not
to<00:03:55.079> have<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.829> cover<00:03:56.459> over<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.389> screen<00:03:57.510> and

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
to have the cover over the screen and

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.539 
to have the cover over the screen and
you're<00:03:58.440> using<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.799> like<00:03:58.919> this<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.310> does

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
you're using it like this it does

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.430 
you're using it like this it does
feature<00:03:59.819> lay<00:04:00.060> on<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.269> table<00:04:00.299> design<00:04:00.780> very

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
feature lay on the table design very

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.039 
feature lay on the table design very
slight<00:04:01.829> but<00:04:02.099> is<00:04:02.220> still<00:04:02.639> there<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.480> lay<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:03.959> the

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
slight but is still there so lay on the

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.720 
slight but is still there so lay on the
table<00:04:04.079> design<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.709> there<00:04:04.949> it's<00:04:05.400> not<00:04:05.669> that

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
table design is there it's not that

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.970 
table design is there it's not that
noticeable<00:04:06.329> but<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.959> can<00:04:07.139> kind<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.530> tell<00:04:07.739> and

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
noticeable but you can kind of tell and

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.089 
noticeable but you can kind of tell and
so<00:04:08.819> if<00:04:08.909> I<00:04:08.970> place<00:04:09.180> my<00:04:09.329> iPad<00:04:09.750> down<00:04:09.959> like<00:04:10.199> this<00:04:10.319> the

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
so if I place my iPad down like this the

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.649 
so if I place my iPad down like this the
ipad<00:04:11.459> screen<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.879> never<00:04:12.120> going<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.299> touch<00:04:12.479> the

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
ipad screen is never going to touch the

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.300 
ipad screen is never going to touch the
table<00:04:12.780> which<00:04:13.079> is<00:04:13.199> a<00:04:13.290> nice<00:04:13.500> thing<00:04:13.709> some

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
table which is a nice thing some

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.550 
table which is a nice thing some
companies<00:04:14.729> just<00:04:14.849> decide<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.329> go<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:15.930> avoid

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
companies just decide to go and avoid

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.319 
companies just decide to go and avoid
that<00:04:16.799> because<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.400> smart<00:04:17.699> cover<00:04:17.880> itself

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
that because the smart cover itself

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.120 
that because the smart cover itself
they're<00:04:19.139> thinking<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.709> smart<00:04:19.949> cover

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
they're thinking that the smart cover

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.159 
they're thinking that the smart cover
might<00:04:20.340> protect<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.789> but<00:04:21.269> i<00:04:21.510> like<00:04:21.810> how<00:04:21.959> case

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
might protect it but i like how case

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.420 
might protect it but i like how case
crowned<00:04:22.440> things<00:04:22.680> what<00:04:23.010> if<00:04:23.099> someone's<00:04:23.370> not

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
crowned things what if someone's not

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.490 
crowned things what if someone's not
holding<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.389> smart<00:04:24.690> cover<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:25.080> top<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.440> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
holding the smart cover on top of the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.780 
holding the smart cover on top of the
ipad<00:04:25.770> screen<00:04:26.099> water

ipad screen water

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.400 
ipad screen water
holding<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.120> back<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.450> that's<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.780> nice<00:04:28.230> thing

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
holding it back so that's a nice thing

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.550 
holding it back so that's a nice thing
that<00:04:28.560> they<00:04:28.650> include<00:04:28.920> now<00:04:29.670> using<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> case

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
that they include now using the case

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.230 
that they include now using the case
with<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.740> ipad<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:32.250> fairly<00:04:32.490> easy<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:33.090> have

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
with the ipad is fairly easy you have

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.090 
with the ipad is fairly easy you have
access<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.630> all<00:04:33.750> your<00:04:33.870> ports<00:04:34.230> actually<00:04:34.950> let's

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
access to all your ports actually let's

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.500 
access to all your ports actually let's
go<00:04:35.250> ahead<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.550> do<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.000> little<00:04:36.150> photo<00:04:36.420> booth

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
go ahead and do a little photo booth

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.960 
go ahead and do a little photo booth
test<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.230> we'll<00:04:37.860> see<00:04:38.070> how<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.340> back<00:04:38.700> camera

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
test and we'll see how the back camera

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.740 
test and we'll see how the back camera
works<00:04:40.190> first<00:04:41.190> let's<00:04:41.400> do<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.910> front-facing

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
works first let's do the front-facing

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.720 
works first let's do the front-facing
camera<00:04:43.260> as<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:43.950> can<00:04:44.040> tell<00:04:44.100> that's<00:04:44.400> completely

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
camera as you can tell that's completely

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.280 
camera as you can tell that's completely
exposed<00:04:45.120> let's<00:04:45.420> flip<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.780> around<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:48.290> it's

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
exposed let's flip it around and it's

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.930 
exposed let's flip it around and it's
kind<00:04:49.440> of<00:04:49.500> hard<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:49.860> use<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.340> camera<00:04:50.580> with<00:04:50.910> the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
kind of hard to use the camera with the

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.540 
kind of hard to use the camera with the
smart<00:04:51.540> cover<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:52.710> this<00:04:53.010> one<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.280> cannot

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
smart cover because this one you cannot

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.030 
smart cover because this one you cannot
take<00:04:53.760> off<00:04:53.970> so<00:04:54.780> you<00:04:54.840> can't<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.680> have<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.890> hold

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
take off so you can't you have to hold

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.730 
take off so you can't you have to hold
it<00:04:56.220> like<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.400> because<00:04:56.900> otherwise<00:04:57.900> if<00:04:58.410> you

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
it like this because otherwise if you

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.370 
it like this because otherwise if you
put<00:04:58.980> in<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.190> back<00:04:59.340> camera<00:05:00.120> is<00:05:00.330> blocked<00:05:00.630> but

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
put in the back camera is blocked but

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.200 
put in the back camera is blocked but
you<00:05:01.530> put<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:01.860> in<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.010> front<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.880> can't<00:05:03.090> see

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
you put it in the front you can't see

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.430 
you put it in the front you can't see
the<00:05:03.300> screen<00:05:03.480> so<00:05:03.720> it's<00:05:03.840> kind<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.080> hard<00:05:04.140> to<00:05:04.320> use

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
the screen so it's kind of hard to use

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.740 
the screen so it's kind of hard to use
the<00:05:04.590> camera<00:05:04.830> with<00:05:05.610> this<00:05:05.940> replacement<00:05:06.390> smart

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
using the camera with a smart cover is

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.380 
using the camera with a smart cover is
hard<00:05:10.950> in<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.130> first<00:05:11.340> place<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.730> personally

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
hard in the first place I personally

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.820 
hard in the first place I personally
would<00:05:12.510> not<00:05:12.600> use<00:05:12.810> a<00:05:12.840> smart<00:05:13.170> cover<00:05:13.320> with<00:05:13.590> a

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
would not use a smart cover with a

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.130 
would not use a smart cover with a
camera<00:05:14.640> I<00:05:14.910> don't<00:05:15.150> even<00:05:15.210> use<00:05:15.480> the<00:05:15.660> camera<00:05:15.870> my

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
iPad because then it's pretty useless

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.690

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
any position and it works exactly like

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.940 
any position and it works exactly like
another<00:06:30.660> smart<00:06:30.990> cover<00:06:31.200> that<00:06:31.410> Apple<00:06:31.800> makes

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
another smart cover that Apple makes

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.250 
another smart cover that Apple makes
except<00:06:32.730> it's<00:06:32.940> not<00:06:33.210> that<00:06:33.480> expensive<00:06:33.750> and

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
except it's not that expensive and

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.110 
except it's not that expensive and
that's<00:06:34.919> what<00:06:35.100> I<00:06:35.160> really<00:06:35.430> like<00:06:35.550> about<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.940> and

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
that's what I really like about it and

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.840 
that's what I really like about it and
it's<00:06:36.900> pretty<00:06:37.380> good<00:06:37.620> for<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:37.950> price<00:06:37.980> I'd<00:06:38.550> say

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
it's pretty good for the price I'd say

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.190 
it's pretty good for the price I'd say
this<00:06:39.060> is<00:06:39.180> one<00:06:39.419> of<00:06:39.450> them

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
this is one of them

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.170
