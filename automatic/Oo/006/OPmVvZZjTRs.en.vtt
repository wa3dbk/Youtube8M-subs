00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.130
 in the charter of this mission 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.750
 popular evangelical of France that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.849
 I quote some extracts because that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:27.419
 seems important to me there is this sentence 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:30.670
 there is neither fatality nor injustice 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.610
 neither in improvisation nor in oppression nor 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.540
 in checks and so we are 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.100
 called each one where we are 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.640
 fight for more justice 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.400
 for my part I find the source of 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.199
 this fight for justice in 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.680
 the gospel especially in this 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.390
 word of the michÃ© prophet who finally 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.719
 calls us to decenter ourselves 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.410
 same while so often our ego 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.239
 we invade to the point that we leave 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.250
 not enough room to another there 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.070
 is there a requirement that is posed that 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.740
 I believe revolutionary because she 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.610
 revolution in both our life our 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.060
 inner life but also a relationship 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.440
 with others the function here is to 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.170
 coordinate all activities of the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.020
 focus that are quite numerous and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.599
 all turned on the reception of the other 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.700
 on welcoming people who come 

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:30.039
 here whatever it is in respect 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.050
 of their history of their conditions of 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.500
 what are their difficulties 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.729
 of course also so I am 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.670
 very grateful that there are 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.929
 Catholics that there are Orthodox 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.920
 that there are evangelicals that there is 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.670
 other confessions of others 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.360
 spirituality represent because he 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.220
 there is nothing worse for a community of 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.289
 belief that the closing up on 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.369
 herself 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.440
 there is a mindset that is 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.539
 important here is to be available to 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.250
 the other and therefore also available to 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.509
 receive from each other because it's at 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.250
 background also in hospitality that 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.580
 learns a lot 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.980
 we are not alone in owning 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.250
 the gospel but I would say that the gospel 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.750
 rather springs from sharing an exchange 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.000
 with different people 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.709
 often we tend to think that 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.350
 to have conditions or to be animated 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.490
 by 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.420
 by faith that's it we can 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.700
 cut off the others me I believe that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.700
 otherwise it should open us to others
