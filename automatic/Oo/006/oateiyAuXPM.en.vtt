00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 among them how is he so good at this 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.379
 new video to say hello to all 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.690
 again I will teach you how to take 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.460
 screenshots in our 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
 Android device in this case 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.170
 use the samsung at 6 but it serves 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.500
 for any android device but 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.020
 which of course depends on the type of and the type 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.210
 of android that we have is gingerbread 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.210
 divine skin sandwich is a way 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.250
 different also serves for the method of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.750
 right in roms good starting too 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.520
 this video because I also dedicate it to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.550
 people who do not know or who are 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.730
 they ask many times 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.980
 some as they are thrown I am without a sandwich 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.570
 finally good starting first I 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.000
 here I have a stock rom that is a 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.190
 round stock of run stock for those who do not 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.129
 you know it 's just how you can see the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.519
 touchwiz interface and here with him the 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.100
 battery and that's the rom like when 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.839
 unpacked on our phone and comes 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.670
 the factory rom as well the 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.870
 device here is still what 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.059
 gingerbread 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.379
 then for those phones the only thing 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.770
 what we are going to do is press the button 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.229
 home forgive the button power button home to 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.190
 the time we will press a couple of 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.190
 Seconds let's see local 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.479
 we jump there and they put screenshot of 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.609
 screen made about 23 seconds to 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.439
 the time and we're going to our folder 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.590
 here and here we have our capture of 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590
 screen 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.180
 good androids and to take what is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.670
 a screenshot 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.220
 we choose 10 and in 10.1 a hegemon 9 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.030
 skin sandwich and the and well all that 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.130
 be from android 4.0 forwards we are going to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.530
 do in the following way 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.420
 simpler in which a 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.040
 button forgiveness vol 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.870
 - + power we left it pressed and it 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.280
 take the catch simply without doing 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.350
 nothing else 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.979
 she keeps the catch in her 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.369
 respective respective folder and good 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.900
 for example this method serves I say 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.090
 because for example in 100 is a world of 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.780
 We are 10 if we press the button 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.360
 of power passes as if we deny 7 that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.970
 the option appears here then for 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.090
 activate it we will not go here adjustments of the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.090
 system 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.080
 system often off and here capture 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.630
 then it will also serve us 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.300
 here we go to screenshot but 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.940
 Of course this would only work for roms 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.730
 of living skin sandwich but based on 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.760
 what is the basis of cyanogenmod 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.760
 then the bowl - and the power to 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.770
 any android phone with a 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.110
 original factory operating system 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.680
 that does not have this option because you already know 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.240
 bold - and power and the capture is taken and 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.330
 a tradition for all I hope that you 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.240
 has been helpful for those who do not know 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.580
 and the beginners and those who 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.270
 they hear and well we go in a video and a 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.270
 greeting for all
