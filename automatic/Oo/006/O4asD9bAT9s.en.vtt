00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.240
 speaks youtube beauty galley is 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.610
 welcome the vjs three games here who 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.220
 talk is jrs with more video and today I am 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.860
 giving you part 38 and series 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.150
 soon to leave to realize weak 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.400
 Today's game is a game of 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.920
 Survival this there 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.770
 good this game here is the weird read or 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.620
 in Portuguese stranded how it works 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.809
 this story game is basic as soon as 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.840
 It's crap really just to make sense. 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.989
 to the game is so you are a guy who 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.519
 bought a new boat and you went sailing 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.260
 with a boat in the middle of the sea 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.850
 so you were happy enjoying your 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.190
 new neighborhood suddenly fell a 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.199
 Storm you were very good and 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.729
 did not even notice the storm coming 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.920
 It turned out that the storm caught you in the 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.589
 half the sea and I like you fell down 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.589
 The boat was already exploded and you 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.489
 wake up in the middle of a desert island in a 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.500
 desert so there's a guy in it 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.420
 supposedly desert then you will have 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.130
 to turn around and then the part of 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.680
 survival of the game right? 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.170
 Are you seeing an island and have to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.930
 put resources wood build 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.360
 tents have animals is also for you 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.640
 to spend on a nice house that I 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.320
 I played it like it's customary to stay the game. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.270
 it works so you can walk around 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.280
 forward and backward you can 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.549
 nothing nothing does not have a fire boat 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.990
 also has the basic hunger need 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.780
 get tired 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.100
 It's sick, I think it has it too. 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.020
 There's that battle as you can see. 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.430
 up there at the beginning you will start 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.259
 with some you can see some 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.130
 boxes do not recommend that you already break 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:53.140
 she will have an empty one juice bandage 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.840
 orange does not forget and will have a new 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.030
 business and this may also mark some 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.520
 animals in the beginning they may be 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.470
 doing it to welcome meat because it will 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.960
 to be very useful is not to leave your city 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.250
 of kabacan otherwise you die 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.860
 there are other ways to die 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.940
 You Roman spoiled water can not 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.200
 Take water from the sea you have to find 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.489
 drinking water and also can not oblige 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.310
 the animals per lion 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.049
 the game graph is very cool, but it is 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.660
 better than minecraft anything 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.100
 3d that has improved is already better than the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.080
 hole in the tank 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.600
 there I know he puts the face down 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.130
 sea ​​water but the pt does not want the game 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.650
 I did not say it is not complete but who has 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.380
 alcohol soon something like that and he 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.450
 was developed by real software and 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.220
 he still with developing the good game 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.460
 If you play here, you have Portuguese. 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.410
 That's it! 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.510
 can find download search on 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.270
 youtube will have a good game in the description 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.610
 Just copy the name and stay there. 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.780
 be making video how to download and I 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.190
 I'm sure you do not think 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.530
 I can not put the download link 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.990
 the description because your partner 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.330
 youtube does not have this renan right 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.760
 and I think a game is it's not paid 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.010
 I think it's free, but I do not know 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.950
 how can you find it the case 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.630
 I can do a test here in that 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.150
 version found it on the internet but not 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.760
 I have authority, I 'm giving it to you. 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.920
 I went back to talking about the game going on the bench and 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.340
 background I'll make some some craft 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.750
 you 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.570
 the game also has a crepe system 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.690
 for example you take a stone some 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.230
 twigs you ride a hammer with that 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.750
 hammer you can make tent and 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.500
 and how do you say that this baggage I forgot 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.720
 name kind refuge there to respond to 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.580
 rain also rains in total 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.230
 I do not know if you can plant in this 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.000
 part the name because the last game I played 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.930
 very little even just to take the test 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.940
 basic 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.099
 it looks like a game of tian tian he does not 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.080
 seems to have a very big enemy like that. 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.640
 thus the story mode and also 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.620
 a way you wanted your property 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.720
 how ivete there when you put to 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.579
 create a new world and it generates the world 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.170
 automatically the game are the same 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.269
 way when you put yourself to the new bed 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.920
 there you can include some features 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.700
 as you can see that you focus on the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.099
 stuff like that 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.799
 I think a rock started with her going 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:12.879
 worry or a stone that is essential 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.260
 in the beginning it is pieces of stones and the 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.840
 feelings are twigs and stones in the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.440
 beginning and already make an ax plate in the 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.570
 a hammer and then turns around and will have the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.479
 decrepitude has a guy on the island that he 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.830
 there for you if you can have something 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.199
 for he will give you other things in 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.340
 exchange then lauro for bargain between 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.400
 you two 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.050
 the mpc beauty then practically this 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.729
 game concept is a survival game 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.770
 where you are in the middle of the desert and you 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.020
 have to reap the appeal of living 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.970
 I find it impossible as I did not play until the 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.539
 end I believe they still do not have the end 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.970
 of the game even because I know but he 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.800
 It's already like this game promises things is the 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.520
 graphic is not very cool, I do not 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.949
 I liked the car that has half a way but the 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.110
 interesting gameplay a few problems 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.729
 game is that the guy is elected more 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.699
 will never engage in a rage 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.190
 each one runs you tighten the west goes 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.870
 open a command there that is open that 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.569
 you can run faster than using 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.090
 straight it just that he is not running ever 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.159
 more will be faster then stay 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.979
 practically this is the basics of the game 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.409
 You can also make eggs a meat 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.030
 more there is in principle just get the 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:27.280
 and it will be very useful for those who 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.560
 likes games so make a fire extinguisher 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.330
 I see what I have written here, he asked me 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.849
 I gave a wanted one we want to offer 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.819
 very weak is not easy to find games 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.169
 thus survival with one more and 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.990
 When we find the game, we do not have much 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.599
 quality is the case of this plus a vehicle 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.660
 will be champion in this game he seems 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.310
 That promises a lot was 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.350
 and we hope that the government 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.440
 I still know the company there. 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.930
 software also owns the 72 see that in 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.330
 Time was playing and it's funny that game. 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.580
 but that's practically all folks I'm going to 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.910

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.530
