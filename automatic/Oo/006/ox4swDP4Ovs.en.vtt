tiny eyebrow brush and I've tried to use

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300 
tiny eyebrow brush and I've tried to use
this<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:22.229> actually<00:01:22.530> okay<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.189> will

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this it's actually okay but it will

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
this it's actually okay but it will
really<00:01:23.640> take<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.970> long<00:01:24.330> time<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> finish<00:01:24.869> doing

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
really take a long time to finish doing

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
really take a long time to finish doing
your<00:01:25.320> brows<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:25.979> very<00:01:26.189> tiny<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
your brows because it's very tiny so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.700 
your brows because it's very tiny so
let's<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.780> rid<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> while

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
let's just get rid of that for a while

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.649 
let's just get rid of that for a while
so<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.820> how<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> eyebrow<00:01:30.420> powder

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
so this is how the eyebrow powder

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.539 
so this is how the eyebrow powder
basically<00:01:31.200> looks<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.920> you'll<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.310> two

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
basically looks like so you'll have two

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.730 
basically looks like so you'll have two
shapes<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.509> taupe<00:01:34.110> shade<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.590> this

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
shapes this is a taupe shade and this

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.550 
shapes this is a taupe shade and this
one<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> dark<00:01:35.460> brown<00:01:35.729> shade<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.560> essence

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
one is a dark brown shade so essence

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
one is a dark brown shade so essence
only<00:01:37.799> has<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.220> variant<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.600> their

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
only has one variant for this for their

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.050 
only has one variant for this for their
eye<00:01:39.930> brow<00:01:40.170> stylist<00:01:40.560> set<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.040> these<00:01:41.579> two<00:01:41.880> are

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
eye brow stylist set so these two are

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.819 
eye brow stylist set so these two are
basically<00:01:42.240> they're<00:01:42.780> only<00:01:43.049> shades<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
basically they're only shades for the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
basically they're only shades for the
brows<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> brow<00:01:45.180> powder<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:45.869> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
brows for the brow powder so when I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.990 
brows for the brow powder so when I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
visited essence for the first time as a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.179 
visited essence for the first time as a
Megamall<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.630> wasn't<00:01:49.290> really<00:01:49.409> planning<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.920> buy

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
Megamall I wasn't really planning to buy

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.800 
Megamall I wasn't really planning to buy
this<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.850> thought<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.329> doesn't<00:01:51.659> look

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
this because I thought it doesn't look

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.710 
this because I thought it doesn't look
um<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.470> looks<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:52.920> ordinary<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.939> when
