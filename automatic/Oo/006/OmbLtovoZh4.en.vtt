hello I'm Matt Guf from the house comm

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.230 
hello I'm Matt Guf from the house comm
and<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> Burton<00:00:07.620> diode<00:00:08.040> est<00:00:08.760> snowboard

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
and this is a Burton diode est snowboard

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.610 
and this is a Burton diode est snowboard
binding<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.719> high-performance

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
binding it's a high-performance

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.700 
binding it's a high-performance
super<00:00:11.429> responsive<00:00:12.290> snowboard<00:00:13.290> binding<00:00:13.559> for

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
super responsive snowboard binding for

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.070 
super responsive snowboard binding for
that<00:00:13.740> advanced<00:00:14.250> level<00:00:14.610> rider<00:00:14.849> out<00:00:15.089> there<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
that advanced level rider out there the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.680 
that advanced level rider out there the
diode<00:00:16.590> est<00:00:17.279> has<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> response<00:00:17.940> rating<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.480> 8

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
diode est has a response rating of an 8

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.290 
diode est has a response rating of an 8
it's<00:00:18.930> really<00:00:19.470> stiff<00:00:20.340> that's<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
it's really stiff that's because it's a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.929 
it's really stiff that's because it's a
high<00:00:21.420> back<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.560> dual<00:00:22.769> component<00:00:23.369> carbon

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
high back and the dual component carbon

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.130 
high back and the dual component carbon
nylon<00:00:25.160> baseplate<00:00:26.480> yeah<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.599> has<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> hinge

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
nylon baseplate yeah it has a hinge

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.810 
nylon baseplate yeah it has a hinge
system<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.650> well<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.340> there's<00:00:29.519> two<00:00:29.699> different

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
system as well so there's two different

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460 
system as well so there's two different
parts<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.539> baseplate<00:00:31.170> there's<00:00:31.349> our

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
parts to this baseplate there's our

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.139 
parts to this baseplate there's our
there's<00:00:31.679> upper<00:00:31.920> part<00:00:32.130> where<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> heel<00:00:32.790> cup<00:00:33.000> is

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
there's upper part where the heel cup is

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.120 
there's upper part where the heel cup is
and<00:00:33.390> then<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.110> lower<00:00:34.290> part<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.710> where<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> mean

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
and then the lower part is where I mean

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.740 
and then the lower part is where I mean
it's<00:00:35.280> actually<00:00:35.399> attached<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.030> your<00:00:36.210> snowboard

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it's actually attached to your snowboard

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.020 
it's actually attached to your snowboard
and<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.320> features<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> hinge<00:00:38.129> system<00:00:38.399> which

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and it features the hinge system which

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150 
and it features the hinge system which
gives<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.200> binding<00:00:40.590> rebound

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
gives you this binding rebound
