00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 in the previous video we saw how 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.110
 create openings inside 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.700
 walls and roofs and floors and we say this 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.370
 in the previous case we have seen 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.080
 precisely also how to insert doors e 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.420
 windows that these too 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.029
 generate openings in our walls 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.720
 which we saw in particular with 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.080
 the opening with this volume of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.480
 opening on the wall that we got 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.149
 from this part of our interface 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.360
 then wall opening architecture 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.820
 we have created a rectangular opening 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.940
 this is the only possibility of opening 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.640
 that you have in revit if you use it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.559
 actually point opening wall tool 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.079
 you can create much more openings 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.899
 complex on the walls but going 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.059
 directly to select the wall in 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.570
 issue so let's take for example a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.050
 select this type of wall there 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.049
 we put on with the view cube we click on 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.570
 left and we put ourselves in this view e 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.299
 we can do precisely to create gods 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.049
 profiles much more interesting than a 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.780
 wall then the wall openings 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.820
 much more interesting on we can 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.549
 click on edit profile then one 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.170
 once selected we go to edit 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.229
 profile that we close this message 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.780
 ok then note entered into edit 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.579
 profile we find ourselves here with the usual 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.200
 pink line that is what we saw 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.420
 even when we went to create the attic 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.590
 and also when we created for 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.030
 example the roof by extrusion and or by 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.159
 perimeter therefore we always find again 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.920
 this pink line let's say this 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.439
 pink line then shows us that at the end 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.060
 profile that we are going to exclude in 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.509
 in this case the profile was one of the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.710
 then roads is that of the wall then 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.820
 changing this profile we will modify 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.799
 also the wall 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.350
 so let's create effects 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.149
 more details of openings more 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.030
 details in our wall for example 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.870
 we can create non-circular openings 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.080
 more than just rectangular 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:22.030
 circular rectangular openings openings 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.560
 to polygon and openings we see 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.720
 then customized for example 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:32.530
 we can create some arches no 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.430
 we can therefore also help ourselves with the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.370
 temporary quotas create arcs 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.620
 so for example let's put here some 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.750
 openings of two meters by one meter e 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.230
 half 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.650
 we delete with delete on the but on the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.630
 keyboard this line and at this point 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.010
 so let's start creating an arc and this 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.580
 will be the beginning of a series of 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.580
 practically arcade
