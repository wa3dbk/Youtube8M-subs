00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.019
 Hi folks autumn starts now day 20 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 March at 7:30 p.m. 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.080
 Brasilia time and the new station is 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.180
 marked precisely by the transition or 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.800
 either it still brings some 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.750
 characteristics of summer but with 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.630
 time goes by every time 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.029
 more similar to winter and is 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.330
 just this first weekend 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.820
 autumn we will have a straw from the 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.629
 which may be autumn in the southern region of the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.559
 Brazil 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.019
 comes the first big wave of cold in the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.600
 South region of Brazil has done much 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.519
 in the interior of the state of Rio Grande do Sul 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.710
 week ends with the thermometers near 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.479
 40 degrees 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 I did not leave because of the arrival of a 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.689
 cold front as well as inventing much in this 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.970
 weekend the temperature goes 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:02.339
 plummeting this morning on Sunday 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.840
 the thermometers may be around 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:09.420
 10 degrees just imagine that 40 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.689
 degrees on Friday and 10 degrees on 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.179
 Sunday, the other highlight is the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.929
 rain that will fall on the state of 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:18.600
 Paulo 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.869
 the same cold front along the end of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.939
 week will leave the weather overcast 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.350
 with rain and the temperature goes up 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.840
 decrease because of it looks only 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.030
 first rain that will fall and she is 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 scheduled mainly for Sunday and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.249
 there because of that more closed time 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.530
 rainy and the temperature drops borocoxô 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:41.700
 also especially on Sunday looks only 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.609
 the maximum evil should exceed 23 degrees 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.579
 but attention in the fall starts with rain 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.039
 in Sao Paulo but she should not continue 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.920
 we have to remember that throughout the autumn 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.899
 rain usually decreases in the state of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.249
 São Paulo, we still have to 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.619
 save water 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.630
 Now who is in the south of Brazil is with 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.709
 I miss that cold little then 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.709
 enjoy the weekend
