athletic standpoint the significance of

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.230 
athletic standpoint the significance of
23<00:02:49.500> while<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.250> high<00:02:50.430> school<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.180> played

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
23 while in high school and I played

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.750 
23 while in high school and I played
with<00:02:51.540> my<00:02:51.630> brother<00:02:52.040> my<00:02:53.040> favorite<00:02:53.400> number<00:02:53.610> was

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
with my brother my favorite number was

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.960 
with my brother my favorite number was
45<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.390> his<00:02:55.170> favorite<00:02:55.500> number<00:02:55.590> 45<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:56.880> we

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
45 and his favorite number 45 but we

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.300 
45 and his favorite number 45 but we
were<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.240> same<00:02:57.420> teams<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.590> he<00:02:59.160> had

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
were on the same teams so he had

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.550 
were on the same teams so he had
seniority<00:02:59.520> he<00:03:00.000> had<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.870> option<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.380> we're

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
seniority he had the option that we're

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.210 
seniority he had the option that we're
45<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.780> figured<00:03:03.780> 23<00:03:04.350> was<00:03:04.500> half<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.830> 45

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
45 so I just figured 23 was half of 45

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.660 
45 so I just figured 23 was half of 45
22<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> half<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.090> got<00:03:06.420> grabbed<00:03:06.750> 23<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.670> 23

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
22 and a half so I got grabbed 23 and 23

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
22 and a half so I got grabbed 23 and 23
it's<00:03:08.880> kind<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.090> stuck<00:03:09.270> with<00:03:09.300> me<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.630> whole

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.410 
it's kind of stuck with me the whole
time<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.170> went<00:03:10.830> back<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.070> 25<00:03:11.430> obviously<00:03:12.000> uh<00:03:12.030> I

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
