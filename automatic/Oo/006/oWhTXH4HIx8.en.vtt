00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.510
 good to me at least my part 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.550
 favorite after is not in the ends of 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.349
 week is that we can wake up with 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.109
 the light of day and that you do not have to get up early 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.820
 there's no alarm clock and there's nothing like that 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.250
 one thing that I do a lot although it's not 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.800
 logical is that many times I 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.170
 especially wake up thinking that there 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.760
 go to class or anything else but what 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.670
 it's good that we can go back to sleep 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.520
 so after a while I go back and I 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.309
 I teach my routine in the mornings so 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.040
 well, just wake up what I do 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.260
 it's down below and I make myself a tea 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.940
 I usually do it with milk and 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.100
 that gets hot I put the TV a while 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.370
 and I get the most grain 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.110
 possible in the mouth and good always climb 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.270
 to my computer and I'm doing things 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.410
 because I find it much more useful for 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.590
 save time and once you have 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.300
 finished my next shower sites 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.480
 I always take off all the rings 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.890
 earrings necklaces everything and I get to the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.800
 shower and good in the mornings 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.320
 loose and nothing else out of the shower 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.700
 music on my record player you know that I 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.189
 love 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.810
 and well now what I do is make up 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.860
 You have already seen that I do not wash my hair 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.090
 in the mornings because it takes away 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.640
 too long so good I take my 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.760
 base and good I do not like to cream 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.610
 with 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.520
 with the base so take a base that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.800
 be like a little hydrating a baby 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.600
 cream or whatever it depends on how you have 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.760
 the skin and if it's winter summer that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.500
 have feet or whatever I'm going now 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.120
 take a clear shadow and I'm going to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.590
 illuminate the animal because as much as 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.360
 we do not like it in the mornings we're 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.070
 tired and with brown I've done the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.430
 eyeliner only that later he has not recorded it 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.080
 boyfriend james and with black I'm going to do 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.490
 the water line above only and this 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.600
 is going to intensify a lot 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.740
 look so it seems that you have 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.680
 made up a lot the truth that I 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.600
 love it and my next step is a lot 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.100
 a lot of mascara and with that I would be finished 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.870
 it depends what they put me paint me the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.430
 lips or not but always the eyes say 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.510
 the same thing so now I'm going to choose the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.850
 clothing 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.680
 and good I show you I wear a shirt 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.300
 black is from zara and good leads to 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.570
 back open but like a long time ago 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.570
 cold you can see that I'm wearing the jacket and not 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.820
 I do not take it off do not worry and well 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.440
 that is then he took my zara neck that 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.910
 the truth is that not put the most 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.680
 warm and as you can see I paint the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.180
 lips of red because yes I wanted 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.820
 and I think it was good to give him a 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.000
 little color and my infinity necklace 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.580
 I never take it off and my bracelets 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.960
 that good nothing is none is special and 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.250
 then I put on some striped leggings 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.260
 that many of you have already seen in my 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.890
 instagram you like some others the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.420

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.640
 martens by who can not be 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.470
 comfortable and good if I'm going out 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.150
 I just take the bag and I'm 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.560
 prepared is that good of dress by the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.700
 tomorrow here you are ready to 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.700

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.450
