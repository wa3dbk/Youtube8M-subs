through<00:00:07.109> finger<00:00:07.560> knitting<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.069> technique<00:00:08.849> that

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
through finger knitting a technique that

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.810 
through finger knitting a technique that
we<00:00:09.120> use<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.480> waxed<00:00:09.870> Irish<00:00:10.110> linen<00:00:10.550> in<00:00:11.550> order

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.499 
we use with waxed Irish linen in order
to<00:00:11.940> start<00:00:12.269> we're<00:00:12.750> right<00:00:13.259> now<00:00:13.440> using<00:00:13.860> two<00:00:14.130> ply

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
to start we're right now using two ply

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.390 
to start we're right now using two ply
waxed<00:00:15.509> Irish<00:00:15.780> linen<00:00:16.049> however<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.890> does<00:00:17.100> come

waxed Irish linen however it does come

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.140 
waxed Irish linen however it does come
in<00:00:17.670> four<00:00:18.060> ply<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.630> thicker<00:00:19.820> we're<00:00:20.820> gonna<00:00:20.910> go

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
in four ply and thicker we're gonna go

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.519 
in four ply and thicker we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.390> take<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> end<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.650> cross<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.490> over

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
ahead and take the end and cross it over

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.689 
ahead and take the end and cross it over
you're<00:00:25.529> gonna<00:00:25.650> put<00:00:25.920> your<00:00:26.070> two<00:00:26.279> fingers

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
you're gonna put your two fingers

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.179 
you're gonna put your two fingers
through<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.359> pull<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.470> longer<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> two

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
through and pull the longer of the two

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.720 
through and pull the longer of the two
threads<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.320> that<00:00:31.320> will<00:00:31.500> form<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.920> slipknot<00:00:32.250> so

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
threads and that will form a slipknot so

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.360 
threads and that will form a slipknot so
you<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:33.090> make<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.300> knot<00:00:34.040> larger<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.340> smaller

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you can make that knot larger or smaller

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.650 
you can make that knot larger or smaller
depending<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.510> how<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.750> pull<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:38.270> then<00:00:39.270> you're

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
depending on how you pull it then you're

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.920 
depending on how you pull it then you're
gonna<00:00:39.780> go<00:00:40.020> ahead<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.800> short<00:00:41.629> stem<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
gonna go ahead you have a short stem and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.190 
gonna go ahead you have a short stem and
a<00:00:43.140> long<00:00:43.379> stem<00:00:44.030> you're<00:00:45.030> gonna<00:00:45.149> pull<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.989> two

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
a long stem you're gonna pull with two

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.799 
a long stem you're gonna pull with two
fingers<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> long<00:00:47.039> stem<00:00:47.520> through<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.570> loop

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
fingers the long stem through the loop

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.229 
fingers the long stem through the loop
that<00:00:49.320> you've<00:00:49.500> created<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.910> will<00:00:51.030> make<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that you've created and it will make a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.869 
that you've created and it will make a
knot<00:00:51.510> below<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:53.280> continue<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
knot below you you just continue that

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.110 
knot below you you just continue that
motion<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:55.710> how<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.430> this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
motion and that's how you get this

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.930 
motion and that's how you get this
finger<00:00:57.690> knitted<00:00:57.989> look<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.100> cord<00:00:59.430> like

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
finger knitted look on the cord like

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
finger knitted look on the cord like
this<00:01:02.300> if<00:01:03.300> you'd<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> add<00:01:03.989> beads<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.559> your

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this if you'd like to add beads to your

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.679 
this if you'd like to add beads to your
design<00:01:05.510> you<00:01:06.510> add<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.290> bead<00:01:07.700> at<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> bottom<00:01:09.479> of

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
design you add the bead at the bottom of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:22.180 
design you add the bead at the bottom of
the<00:01:09.990> long<00:01:10.229> cord

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.610 

you<00:01:23.190> pull<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.520> through<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.120> loop<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:25.320> first

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
you pull that through the loop the first

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.580 
you pull that through the loop the first
time<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.010> going<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.340> loose<00:01:26.640> inside<00:01:26.940> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
time it's going to be loose inside the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.650 
time it's going to be loose inside the
second<00:01:28.590> time<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.280> another<00:01:29.640> knot<00:01:29.880> it's

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
second time you make another knot it's

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.780 
second time you make another knot it's
going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> become<00:01:31.500> part<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> your<00:01:32.040> design<00:01:32.460> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
going to become part of your design and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.440 
going to become part of your design and
then<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.479> continue<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.910> way<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.119> are<00:01:36.330> doing

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
then you continue the way you are doing

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.010 
then you continue the way you are doing
before<00:01:38.240> pulling<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.420> through<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:42.540> tell<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
before pulling it through and tell you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.320 
before pulling it through and tell you
how<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.680> count<00:01:43.979> each<00:01:44.250> time<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.970> make<00:01:45.119> sure

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
how you count each time to make sure

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.880 
how you count each time to make sure
that<00:01:45.570> each<00:01:45.810> time<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.170> add<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> bead<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.860> have

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that each time you add a bead you have

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.060 
that each time you add a bead you have
the<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:47.400> number<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:48.380> knots<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.680> bottom

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the right number of knots at the bottom

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.490 
the right number of knots at the bottom
of<00:01:50.190> your<00:01:50.220> cord<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.540> continue<00:01:52.080> this<00:01:52.259> until

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
of your cord you continue this until

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.340 
of your cord you continue this until
you've<00:01:52.770> created<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.369> length<00:01:53.580> that<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.880> want

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
you've created the length that you want

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.290 
you've created the length that you want
when<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:55.530> finished<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.670> pull<00:01:57.000> the
