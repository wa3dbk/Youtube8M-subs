always starting on the battery side so
all<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> TPU

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
material on the sides all you do is put

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
material on the sides all you do is put
one<00:01:15.930> side<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.130> push<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
one side in and then you just push the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.149 
one side in and then you just push the
other<00:01:17.759> side<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
other side in just like that

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.760 
other side in just like that
and<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> case<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.170> tempered

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and the case is on now I have a tempered

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
and the case is on now I have a tempered
glass<00:01:22.860> screen<00:01:23.220> protector<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.670> mine<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:23.880> you'll

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
glass screen protector on mine so you'll

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.700 
glass screen protector on mine so you'll
see<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> glass<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.500> bit

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
see that the glass is a little bit

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
see that the glass is a little bit
raised<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.759> we'll<00:01:26.939> take<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> look<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.689> all<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
raised but we'll take a look at all the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.010 
raised but we'll take a look at all the
cutouts<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.909> screen<00:01:30.150> actually<00:01:30.360> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
cutouts and how the screen actually is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.870 
cutouts and how the screen actually is
protected<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.680> case<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.490> looking<00:01:32.790> at

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
protected with this case so looking at

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.490 
protected with this case so looking at
the<00:01:32.970> back<00:01:33.150> first<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.720> you'll<00:01:34.049> notice<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the back first of all you'll notice that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.670 
the back first of all you'll notice that
you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.210> logo<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:37.229> Galaxy

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
you can see that your logo your Galaxy

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
you can see that your logo your Galaxy
Note<00:01:37.860> 4<00:01:38.280> zoom<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.659> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
Note 4 zoom in to this you can see that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.679 
Note 4 zoom in to this you can see that
nicely<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.590> note<00:01:40.710> 4<00:01:41.009> right<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.689> then

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
nicely so you do note 4 right there then

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.200 
nicely so you do note 4 right there then
you<00:01:42.810> also<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.920> met<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.369> telephone

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you also have your met your telephone

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.499 
you also have your met your telephone
carrier<00:01:46.020> logo<00:01:46.200> shows<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.610> back<00:01:47.820> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
carrier logo shows up on the back you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.630 
carrier logo shows up on the back you
see<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.530> speaker<00:01:49.890> grille<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.189> exposed

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
see that your speaker grille is exposed

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.850 
see that your speaker grille is exposed
and<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.390> also<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.899> flush<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.710> nice

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and it's also not flush so that's a nice

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.639 
and it's also not flush so that's a nice
feature<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.329> back<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:54.899> let's<00:01:55.380> put

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
feature there on the back here let's put

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.260 
feature there on the back here let's put
that<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:55.890> an<00:01:55.979> angle<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that at an angle or you can see the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420 
that at an angle or you can see the
because<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> kind<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> slimline<00:01:58.979> case

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
because this is kind of a slimline case

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.560 
because this is kind of a slimline case
I'd<00:02:00.000> say<00:02:01.100> this<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.850> close<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> lens

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
I'd say this is really close to the lens

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
I'd say this is really close to the lens
let's<00:02:03.719> put<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.960> right<00:02:04.049> there<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.380> corner<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
let's put it right there in a corner you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.459 
let's put it right there in a corner you
can<00:02:05.040> see<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.610> almost<00:02:06.000> flush<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.380> is

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
can see it's almost flush so this is

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.809 
can see it's almost flush so this is
probably<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.099> those<00:02:08.190> cases<00:02:08.399> I'd<00:02:08.640> say

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
probably not one of those cases I'd say

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.369 
probably not one of those cases I'd say
that<00:02:09.030> are<00:02:09.119> gonna<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.420> counter<00:02:09.780> friendly<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
that are gonna be counter friendly that

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.110 
that are gonna be counter friendly that
you<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.560> put<00:02:10.709> down<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:10.979> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
you can put down like this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.750 
you can put down like this
you<00:02:12.480> still<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:12.930> access<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.890> sensors

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
you still have access to the sensors

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.070 
you still have access to the sensors
where<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.090> place<00:02:15.299> your<00:02:15.330> finger<00:02:15.810> that's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
where you can place your finger that's

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.930 
where you can place your finger that's
not<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> problem<00:02:16.620> there<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.370> I'm<00:02:17.580> not<00:02:17.730> too

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
not a problem there but I'm not too

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.259 
not a problem there but I'm not too
happy<00:02:18.090> about<00:02:18.269> how<00:02:18.599> close<00:02:19.049> you<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
happy about how close you have that the

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.449 
happy about how close you have that the
camera<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.140> corner<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.680> again<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
camera to the corner but again this

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.780 
camera to the corner but again this
seems<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> be<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.209> slimline<00:02:24.629> case<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.489> do<00:02:26.489> like

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
seems to be a slimline case I do like

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.850 
seems to be a slimline case I do like

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
again this is a slimline case and if I

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.640 
again this is a slimline case and if I
were<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.209> put<00:03:09.359> this<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.569> an<00:03:09.659> angle<00:03:09.900> here<00:03:10.200> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
were to put this in an angle here and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.559 
were to put this in an angle here and
load<00:03:10.859> us<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.159> there<00:03:11.519> is<00:03:11.609> some<00:03:11.790> depth<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:12.359> I

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
load us that there is some depth there I

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.360 
load us that there is some depth there I
have<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:12.989> glass<00:03:13.319> screen<00:03:13.500> protector<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.220> that

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
have a glass screen protector on so that

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.190 
have a glass screen protector on so that
adds<00:03:14.609> a<00:03:14.970> raise<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.720> screen<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.959> little<00:03:16.079> bit

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
adds a raise to the screen a little bit

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.599 
adds a raise to the screen a little bit
but<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.769> have<00:03:16.919> some<00:03:17.099> decent<00:03:17.459> protection

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
but you have some decent protection

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.629 
but you have some decent protection
there<00:03:18.090> once<00:03:18.599> again<00:03:18.780> not<00:03:19.290> super<00:03:19.680> deep<00:03:20.069> because

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
there once again not super deep because

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.270 
there once again not super deep because
this<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> slimline<00:03:21.900> case<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:23.160> still

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
this is a slimline case but still
