00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 some months ago we presented the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.160
 history of the night crawler these strange 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.160
 beings that appear during the nights in 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.410
 the area of ​​san jose jose mari 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.170
 there in california and they have been 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.900
 captured at least twice by 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.930
 security cameras the images are 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.939
 fantastic but the most interesting thing is 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.609
 that there is a legend behind these 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.119
 beings a legend that has more than 100 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.640
 years that you can say beings that looks 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.399
 be that they do not have arms that do not have 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.360
 practically body that have head and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.180
 that have legs 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.170
 go case go images no one has 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.960
 really discredited distorted is 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.430
 a case that is alive is current and is 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.270
 real 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.380
 I represent the investigation with the 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.080
 dian moscoso 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.790
 in the forests of california there is a 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.400
 very ingrained legend that has achieved 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.290
 survive for generations a legend 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.660
 what seems to be has come to life 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.150
 thanks to a couple of video evidence 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.310
 that allow you to see a strange and grotesque 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.500
 figure wandering through the forests of 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.840
 state of california an awesome 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.820
 figure to which the locals have 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.610
 called the night crawler this is the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.590
 story to this creature named 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.270
 night crawler or the night prowler 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.130
 has been the main character of a 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.970
 legend that runs through the forests of 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.619
 California 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.869
 the locals tell that at night 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.390
 a huge being has walked by these 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.850
 forests for decades described with 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.740
 a creature without a torso without arms 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.460
 a small head and a huge 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.930
 legs a stranger figure 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.420
 but reports say that the night 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.670
 crawler usually appears only by 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.740
 the nights even comment that it is very 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.350
 weird to be able to see him just mentioning his 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.330
 name instills respect for the forest 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.340
 the locals say they have learned to 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.100
 live with this creature that according to 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.080
 count these forests came long before 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.220
 that the first human beings even 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.320
 They have woken up 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.030
 allusive to merchants as a 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.430
 offering to demonstrate well a 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.590
 peaceful coexistence observe these 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.509
 figures carved in wood that break 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.520
 with the everyday landscape of the forests 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.770
 there in california are representations 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.570
 of these strange night marauders 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.780
 look at these huge carved figures 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.670
 by the inhabitants of the forest 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.010
 this video that had already been analyzed 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.930
 for the third millennium is perhaps the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.000
 more compelling evidence that you are 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.340
 creatures are more than a simple 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.130
 legend look at these images captured on 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.500
 March 28, 2011 in the park 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.060
 yosemite national in california a 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.400
 Security cameras Park 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.950
 recorded just when two of these beings 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.290
 called mule night growlers go 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.930
 through yosemite park observe with 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.090
 careful these images these beings are 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.010
 practically identical to the carvings 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.310
 by the locals described in the 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.310
 legends 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.760
 on 28 March 2011 it was able to 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.769
 asked to record this pair of beings that 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.720
 break at night to show that 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.519
 this legend can be real these beings 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.400
 they were caught just at 2 o'clock 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.530
 early morning with 17 minutes as the brand 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.239
 internal camcorder clock we can 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.280
 appreciate with clarity the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.069
 called night crawler observe his 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.080
 strange physiognomy without arms without thorax 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.080
 only huge legs that seem to move 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.970
 awkwardly gives at the moment the impression of 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.340
 that have a hard time walking around this 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.130
 type of terrain observe the structures 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.440
 of his huge legs seem to be very 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.810
 fragile both the large figure and the 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.000
 small have exactly the same 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.220
 structure will be that these images we 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.040
 they show two different ages of these 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.379
 creatures this being had already been 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.420
 reported earlier in November of 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.489
 year 2007 was recorded also in 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.920
 california very close to the park 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.959
 joseba in the ash town in this 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.579
 occasion was seen wandering in the yard 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.069
 of a house a surveillance camera 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.079
 nocturnal caught the presence of two 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.430
 trailers that cross this space 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.430
 I observed the material 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.250
 even this video was investigated by 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.080
 the american program fec factor el 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.840
 which is dedicated to deny or confirm 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.910
 strange paranormal cases in the subject 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.100
 UFO the ash video was analyzed 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.470
 for this television team trying to 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.630
 recreate this being to prove well if 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.790
 it may be false and apparently not 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.710
 achieved here we see fragments of these 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.750
 attempts to match the appearance of 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.150
 these strange beings and especially their 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.610
 movements first tried it with a 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.740
 boy then with a mechanical puppet 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.250
 you want that you managed to recreate this 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.250
 I miss being 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.550
 There is a curious fact about these 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.530
 strange creatures in 1931 an archaeologist 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.960
 discovered in the desert of blade in 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.850
 california a few strange painted glyphs 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.980
 on the ground that could only be seen 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.440
 from the air and they also described 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.600
 a strange being with huge legs only 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.790
 that he had extended arms and 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.550
 a very small head the huge 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.350
 figures measured more than 50 meters of feet 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.330
 to head and if we look carefully 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.450
 It seems to be similar to strangers 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.520
 beings recorded between 2007 and 2011 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.530
 archaeologists have not determined the 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.090
 date of creation of these figures but 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.280
 they are present in the oral legends 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.230
 of the ancient North American natives 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.000
 it will be possible that the night legend 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.580
 crawler is older than it is 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.410
 think is why the night crawler 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.410
 it's still a mystery 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.990
 these strange beings that seem to inhabit 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.030
 the forests of california it seems that 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.220
 they have challenged time and space already 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.440
 that has adapted its appearance from the 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.970
 decade of the 30s us 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.160
 We will keep track of any 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.850
 evidence that these strangers throw ' 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.850
 nightcrawler
