00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
just for fun you know the game as it is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.060 
just for fun you know the game as it is
right<00:00:26.130> now<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.420> pre-alpha<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.769> lot<00:00:29.039> of

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
right now is in pre-alpha so a lot of

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.269 
right now is in pre-alpha so a lot of
the<00:00:29.369> changes<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.539> suggested<00:00:31.279> haven't

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the changes that we suggested haven't

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.760 
the changes that we suggested haven't
been<00:00:32.369> implemented<00:00:32.790> yet<00:00:33.140> which<00:00:34.140> means<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
been implemented yet which means that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.770 
been implemented yet which means that
there's<00:00:34.980> almost<00:00:35.130> no<00:00:35.430> truly<00:00:36.120> accurate<00:00:36.270> gun<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
there's almost no truly accurate gun the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.540 
there's almost no truly accurate gun the
game<00:00:36.960> yet<00:00:37.170> besides<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.800> auto<00:00:37.980> sniper<00:00:38.280> which

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
game yet besides the auto sniper which

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.119 
game yet besides the auto sniper which
seemed<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:39.030> amazing<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.260> think<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.950> game

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
seemed to be amazing so I think the game

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.280 
seemed to be amazing so I think the game
kind<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.700> evolved<00:00:42.239> into<00:00:42.510> an<00:00:42.660> auto<00:00:42.989> sniper

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
kind of just evolved into an auto sniper

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.920 
kind of just evolved into an auto sniper

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.380 
things that we have been able to focus
on<00:03:17.650> because<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.129> recoil<00:03:18.609> is<00:03:18.670> are<00:03:18.790> so

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
on because the recoil is are so

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.330 
on because the recoil is are so
different<00:03:19.629> than<00:03:19.840> what<00:03:19.930> we're<00:03:20.079> used<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.349> like

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
different than what we're used to like

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
everyone thinks about that we're doing

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.910 
everyone thinks about that we're doing
x-rays<00:05:20.210> for<00:05:20.750> one<00:05:20.870> of<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.020> changes<00:05:21.380> that<00:05:21.410> we've

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
x-rays for one of the changes that we've

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.970 
x-rays for one of the changes that we've
kind<00:05:22.070> of<00:05:22.190> been<00:05:23.200> suggesting<00:05:24.200> but<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:24.560> don't<00:05:24.860> know

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
kind of been suggesting but I don't know

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.490 
kind of been suggesting but I don't know
how<00:05:25.130> much<00:05:25.250> leeway<00:05:25.600> they<00:05:26.600> have<00:05:26.750> on<00:05:26.930> valve's<00:05:27.320> end

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
how much leeway they have on valve's end

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.830 
how much leeway they have on valve's end
is<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:28.160> fog<00:05:28.400> as<00:05:28.700> you<00:05:29.210> can<00:05:29.330> see<00:05:29.450> in<00:05:29.540> the<00:05:29.600> source

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
is the fog as you can see in the source

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.450 
is the fog as you can see in the source
as<00:05:29.990> well<00:05:30.020> it's<00:05:30.680> actually<00:05:30.980> even<00:05:31.070> more

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
as well it's actually even more

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.550 
as well it's actually even more
prominent<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.210> go<00:05:32.390> they<00:05:33.140> might<00:05:33.320> be<00:05:33.380> able<00:05:33.440> to

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
prominent and go they might be able to

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.890 
prominent and go they might be able to
tweak<00:05:33.800> it<00:05:33.890> a<00:05:33.950> little<00:05:34.070> bit<00:05:34.280> but<00:05:34.750> probably<00:05:35.750> not

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
tweak it a little bit but probably not

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.890 
tweak it a little bit but probably not
going<00:05:36.110> to<00:05:36.170> remove

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
going to remove

question<00:06:03.310> because<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:03.789> really<00:06:04.030> haven't<00:06:04.180> seen

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
question because I really haven't seen

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.050 
question because I really haven't seen
like<00:06:04.660> another<00:06:05.470> game<00:06:05.740> arrival<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.669> like<00:06:06.759> any

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
like another game arrival and like any

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.240 
like another game arrival and like any
texts<00:06:07.539> or<00:06:07.630> even<00:06:07.840> source<00:06:08.050> like<00:06:08.440> 1.6<00:06:09.009> do<00:06:09.190> you

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
texts or even source like 1.6 do you

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.950 
texts or even source like 1.6 do you
think<00:06:09.430> that<00:06:09.550> I<00:06:09.580> haven't<00:06:09.820> seen<00:06:10.000> a<00:06:10.060> first<00:06:10.810> person

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
think that I haven't seen a first person

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.320 
think that I haven't seen a first person
shooter<00:06:11.169> really<00:06:11.770> rival<00:06:12.250> that<00:06:12.430> like<00:06:12.729> on<00:06:12.850> PC<00:06:13.300> and

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
shooter really rival that like on PC and

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.270 
shooter really rival that like on PC and
I<00:06:13.900> think<00:06:14.139> that<00:06:14.229> this<00:06:14.320> game<00:06:14.440> really<00:06:14.860> kind<00:06:15.250> of

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
I think that this game really kind of

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.800 
I think that this game really kind of
falls<00:06:15.490> in<00:06:15.639> those<00:06:15.729> footsteps<00:06:15.910> so<00:06:16.389> like<00:06:16.600> off

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
falls in those footsteps so like off

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.409 
falls in those footsteps so like off
like<00:06:17.260> out<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.530> gate<00:06:17.710> it's<00:06:18.010> liable<00:06:18.430> oh<00:06:18.820> and

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
like out the gate it's liable oh and

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.090 
like out the gate it's liable oh and
especially<00:06:19.840> when<00:06:20.260> we<00:06:20.350> have<00:06:20.380> valve<00:06:20.710> who's

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
especially when we have valve who's

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.490 
especially when we have valve who's
literally<00:06:21.789> here<00:06:22.060> with<00:06:22.180> us<00:06:22.330> like<00:06:22.600> showing<00:06:23.380> us

commands like giving us inside

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.990 
commands like giving us inside
information<00:06:26.560> on<00:06:26.620> you<00:06:27.400> know<00:06:27.520> this<00:06:27.699> is<00:06:27.729> how

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
information on you know this is how

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.969 
information on you know this is how
recoil<00:06:28.660> works<00:06:28.870> is<00:06:29.110> how<00:06:29.260> we<00:06:29.320> can<00:06:29.500> adjust<00:06:29.770> it

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
recoil works is how we can adjust it

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.830 
recoil works is how we can adjust it
this<00:06:30.130> is<00:06:30.310> how<00:06:30.460> we<00:06:30.520> can<00:06:30.699> tweak<00:06:30.910> it<00:06:31.060> to<00:06:31.180> fit<00:06:31.210> so<00:06:31.570> it

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
this is how we can tweak it to fit so it

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.960 
this is how we can tweak it to fit so it
feels<00:06:32.139> like<00:06:32.320> 1.6<00:06:32.919> or<00:06:33.160> it<00:06:33.280> feels<00:06:33.430> like<00:06:33.580> source

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
feels like 1.6 or it feels like source

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.339 
feels like 1.6 or it feels like source
or<00:06:34.090> a<00:06:34.120> mix<00:06:34.330> of<00:06:34.479> both<00:06:34.599> or<00:06:34.870> whatever<00:06:35.110> I<00:06:35.169> mean

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
or a mix of both or whatever I mean

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.920 
or a mix of both or whatever I mean
they're<00:06:35.470> so<00:06:35.680> open<00:06:36.039> to<00:06:36.070> pretty<00:06:36.729> much<00:06:36.970> anything

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
they're so open to pretty much anything

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.950 
they're so open to pretty much anything
that<00:06:38.139> suggests<00:06:38.740> and<00:06:39.130> so<00:06:39.220> far<00:06:39.430> so<00:06:39.970> you<00:06:40.810> know<00:06:40.930> I

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
that suggests and so far so you know I

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.270

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
think that the community has a lot of

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.379 
think that the community has a lot of
