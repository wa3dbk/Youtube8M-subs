00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.440
 strong begins against the favorites a range 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.720
 fourth minute 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.509
 Janotta foul 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.390
 first yellow cards 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.390
 the referees blame 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.099
 Friedhelm Funkel the Bremen from Buggingen three minutes in the middle of the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.099
 Place the referee is right at all 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.120
 then you'll have been glad to have yawn here again 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.480
 Ultimately, the ex-Magdeburger is already coming to the ground of the ambulance 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.810
 March 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.810
 the one stay out 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 from Berlin 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 counter-chance Loving 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.710
 Brannenburg 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.310
 they prove 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.690
 but also plays very hard 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.300
 Bring acting budget 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.300
 completely correct as he is the yellow card 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.159
 then recognizes secure or the ball sentenced for the Brandenburger 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.140
 this will be whistled 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 The locals protest are angry 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 he already has yellow 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.400
 Michel Kaiser who appease 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.400
 but that has never helped 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.450
 from Berlin 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.450
 first Brandenburger from approx 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.340
 would be the right points 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.870
 customer funds 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.190
 wonderful things 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.600
 can still take it away as Sun. 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.130
 BitDefender recommends Leitner 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.870
 if you have been so fogged 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.870
 help us only if we have things under Tel 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.399
 but not on it 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.859
 Brandenburg with Wolfgang Kunz mother and Velen bonds Roy Präger 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.879
 and then that comes what must come 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.969
 the answer 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.769
 heads the ball 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.199
 the picture is 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.199
 again from another point of view 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.639
 the mind does not calm that 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.529
 of course for the Tuttlinger 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.200
 The sideline is also getting hectic, which is not good 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.439
 they can hardly control anymore 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:58.809
 Peter Heinke discusses with the linesman better said too tight 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.489
 on the sidelines 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.769
 complained to Habib 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:02.939
 Iran moves 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.930
 The coach from Tuttlingen was in the middle of the square for three minutes 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.239
 Kirch kept the balance 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.229
 Captain Jan Otter 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:15.849
 must make clear to his coach the measure of the referee Heinke dead 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.849
 The players have to fly out of Liguria 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:23.809
 hardly an actor under control 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.539
 there blame the editing of pictures players have heard 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.600
 No he has is not in control 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.600
 The police had great difficulty in ensuring security and order 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.399
 second halftime 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:43.849
 the maître plays the ball 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.089
 Luginger 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.239
 The players have a foul on the penalty spot with animals 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.929
 are hectic 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.929
 provoke and also Nordholter Wießner 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.549
 unfortunately infected 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.549
 In the strictest sense of the word, that's in my job 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.319
 the next red card 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.840
 Daniel Kübler the Appel 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.219
 waiting for months or toilets 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.609
 another around 100 countries Kolbermoor 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.199
 the other one has 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.520
 the return the remark 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.379
 not quite realistic 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.729
 but with a rational core 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.400
 the trainers what should we do 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.879
 he is already with 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.879
 really play holds 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
 also the citizen office justifiable 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.650
 as everything loves 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.430
 the audience the few like a man behind their team 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.499
 there are only seven left 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.770
 only a field planned remote injured 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.680
 Industry experts appreciate 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.680
 inevitably have to 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.779
 the 0 2 2 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.669
 and immediately afterwards 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.669
 the 0 2 3 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.110
 Room without a chance 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.110
 and again it's about the eyes 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.129
 will be dismantled 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.159
 must be eliminated 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.409
 Brandenburger falls under criticism again 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:39.449
 brings back the minds 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.430
 last action Janotta with a 5 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.880
 Brannenburg
