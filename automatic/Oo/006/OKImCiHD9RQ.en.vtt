times they released two in the past

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.800 
times they released two in the past
maybe<00:00:21.480> year<00:00:21.779> or<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.789> I<00:00:23.789> wasn't<00:00:24.480> really

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810

into Phoenix and really didn't know what

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.630 
into Phoenix and really didn't know what
they<00:00:26.670> were<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.720> much<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.260> know

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
they were like so much just you know

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.099 
they were like so much just you know
didn't<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.670> bother<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.449> look<00:00:30.570> into<00:00:30.869> buying

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
didn't really bother to look into buying

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.920 
didn't really bother to look into buying
it<00:00:31.380> or<00:00:31.679> anything<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.940> now<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.390> Phoenix<00:00:33.690> room

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
it or anything but now that Phoenix room

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.580 
it or anything but now that Phoenix room
we<00:00:34.320> released<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.840> was<00:00:36.840> smart<00:00:37.079> enough<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.320> say

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
we released it I was smart enough to say

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.700 
we released it I was smart enough to say
yeah<00:00:38.190> I'm<00:00:38.340> buying<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:40.260> guys<00:00:40.440> can

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
yeah I'm buying that and you guys can

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.740 
yeah I'm buying that and you guys can
probably<00:00:40.770> guess<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.180> Lufthansa

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
probably guess that it is the Lufthansa

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.250 
probably guess that it is the Lufthansa
Airbus<00:00:43.350> a380<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.969> Phoenix<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.960> released

on it a few times in the first-class
section<00:01:15.500> when<00:01:16.500> he<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:17.460> he<00:01:17.670> lives<00:01:17.939> in

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
Miami and Germany so he kind of flies

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.740

back and forth between Miami and Germany

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.640 
back and forth between Miami and Germany
obviously<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:26.840> Lufthansa<00:01:27.840> operates<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
obviously and Lufthansa operates the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.300 
obviously and Lufthansa operates the
a380<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> route<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.590> he<00:01:31.590> gets<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.860> fly<00:01:32.040> on

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
a380 on that route so he gets to fly on

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.819 
a380 on that route so he gets to fly on
it<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> few<00:01:32.729> times<00:01:32.850> he's<00:01:33.659> gotten<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> flying<00:01:34.650> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
it a few times he's gotten to flying it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.730 
it a few times he's gotten to flying it
multiple<00:01:35.640> times<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.970> should<00:01:36.030> say<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.780> he's

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
multiple times I should say and he's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.230 
multiple times I should say and he's
pretty<00:01:37.920> lucky<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.790> trying<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> convince

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
pretty lucky but I'm trying to convince

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.819 
pretty lucky but I'm trying to convince
my<00:01:39.420> parents<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.900> somewhere<00:01:40.350> with<00:01:40.470> tons

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
my parents to go somewhere with tons

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.030 
my parents to go somewhere with tons
that<00:01:40.979> offers<00:01:41.369> a380<00:01:41.909> service<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:43.860> just

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that offers a380 service and I'm just

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.410 
that offers a380 service and I'm just
gonna<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> future<00:01:45.240> holds

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
gonna have to see what the future holds

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.069 
gonna have to see what the future holds
so<00:01:46.520> let's<00:01:47.520> get<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> box<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.509> am<00:01:48.899> NOT<00:01:49.049> a

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
so let's get to the box I am NOT a

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.170 
so let's get to the box I am NOT a
hundred<00:01:49.409> percent<00:01:49.710> sure<00:01:49.770> where<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.970> picture

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
hundred percent sure where this picture

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.149 
hundred percent sure where this picture
is<00:01:51.360> taken<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:51.810> obviously<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.649> Germany<00:01:52.979> I'm

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
is taken but obviously is in Germany I'm

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.170 
is taken but obviously is in Germany I'm
probably<00:01:54.000> gonna<00:01:54.240> say<00:01:54.479> maybe<00:01:54.689> Munich<00:01:55.969> I'm<00:01:56.969> not

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
probably gonna say maybe Munich I'm not

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.830 
probably gonna say maybe Munich I'm not
100%<00:01:57.540> sure<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.820> attend<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> study<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.450> think

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
100% sure but attend you study I think

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.050 
100% sure but attend you study I think
that's<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.409> unit<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.920> asked<00:02:02.460> my<00:02:02.579> mom<00:02:02.729> about<00:02:02.790> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that's in unit I asked my mom about it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.060 
that's in unit I asked my mom about it
but<00:02:03.390> she<00:02:03.570> wasn't<00:02:03.750> even<00:02:03.899> sure<00:02:04.049> either<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:05.040> uh

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
but she wasn't even sure either but uh

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.540 
but she wasn't even sure either but uh
like<00:02:06.079> one<00:02:07.079> four<00:02:07.229> hundred<00:02:07.469> scale<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
like one four hundred scale the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.920 
like one four hundred scale the
registration<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.209> d<00:02:09.450> AI<00:02:09.840> M

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930

so<00:02:13.989> if<00:02:14.989> you<00:02:15.170> amount<00:02:15.379> and<00:02:15.560> then<00:02:16.159> if<00:02:16.250> we<00:02:16.370> turn<00:02:16.549> it

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
so if you amount and then if we turn it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.830 
so if you amount and then if we turn it
to<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.819> back<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:18.290> can<00:02:18.469> see<00:02:18.879> another<00:02:19.879> picture

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
to the back you can see another picture

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.429 
to the back you can see another picture
on<00:02:21.079> the<00:02:21.829> back<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.340> says<00:02:22.519> Cerebus<00:02:22.819> a380<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:24.049> I'm

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
on the back it says Cerebus a380 and I'm

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.990 
on the back it says Cerebus a380 and I'm
not<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> hundred<00:02:24.859> percent<00:02:24.980> sure<00:02:25.310> but<00:02:25.819> that

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
not a hundred percent sure but that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.309 
not a hundred percent sure but that
could<00:02:26.480> be<00:02:26.659> in<00:02:26.750> Berlin

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
could be in Berlin

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.429

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
new planes next year that could easily

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.819

their<00:03:22.629> terminal<00:03:23.629> but<00:03:23.900> not<00:03:24.079> like<00:03:24.319> like<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.190> was

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
their terminal but not like like it was

their terminal but not like like it was
a<00:03:25.579> big<00:03:25.849> terminal<00:03:26.269> because<00:03:26.659> I<00:03:26.750> saw<00:03:26.989> 747s<00:03:27.859> there

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
a big terminal because I saw 747s there

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.479 
a big terminal because I saw 747s there
and<00:03:28.129> 1840s<00:03:28.669> and<00:03:28.909> 83<00:03:29.180> 30s<00:03:29.510> there<00:03:29.659> too<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.620> they

and 1840s and 83 30s there too but they

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.189 
and 1840s and 83 30s there too but they
housed<00:03:32.650> smaller<00:03:33.650> planes<00:03:33.949> well<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:35.049> there<00:03:36.049> was

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
housed smaller planes well and there was

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.349 
housed smaller planes well and there was
like<00:03:36.500> at<00:03:36.680> least<00:03:36.889> two<00:03:37.189> or<00:03:37.400> three<00:03:37.430> 380s<00:03:38.209> that

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
like at least two or three 380s that

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.689 
like at least two or three 380s that
just<00:03:38.540> tax<00:03:38.750> you'd<00:03:38.959> buy<00:03:39.139> me<00:03:39.169> and<00:03:39.639> buy<00:03:40.639> the

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
just tax you'd buy me and buy the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.030 
just tax you'd buy me and buy the
terminal<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.299> you<00:03:41.389> could<00:03:41.569> practically<00:03:42.040> well

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
terminal and you could practically well

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.039 
terminal and you could practically well
not<00:03:43.189> practically<00:03:43.879> go<00:03:44.299> out<00:03:44.419> and<00:03:44.599> touch<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.930> but

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
not practically go out and touch it but

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.920 
not practically go out and touch it but
it<00:03:45.199> was<00:03:45.349> so<00:03:45.560> close<00:03:45.739> maybe<00:03:46.220> around<00:03:46.430> 10<00:03:47.419> or<00:03:47.659> 20

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
it was so close maybe around 10 or 20

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.119 
it was so close maybe around 10 or 20
feet<00:03:48.109> was<00:03:48.379> like<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.799> know<00:03:50.019> not<00:03:51.019> 10<00:03:51.379> 20<00:03:51.739> feet<00:03:51.949> a

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
feet was like you know not 10 20 feet a

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.710 
feet was like you know not 10 20 feet a
good<00:03:52.430> amount<00:03:52.609> of<00:03:52.759> distance<00:03:53.030> but<00:03:53.329> it<00:03:53.389> was<00:03:53.509> still

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
good amount of distance but it was still

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.619 
good amount of distance but it was still
pretty<00:03:53.750> close<00:03:54.340> so<00:03:55.340> uh<00:03:55.370> yeah<00:03:56.239> it's<00:03:56.449> probably

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
pretty close so uh yeah it's probably

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.429 
pretty close so uh yeah it's probably
going<00:03:56.900> somewhere<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.409> New<00:03:57.530> York<00:03:57.769> or<00:03:58.129> Miami<00:03:58.489> or

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
going somewhere to New York or Miami or

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.429 
going somewhere to New York or Miami or
Tokyo<00:04:00.439> or<00:04:00.799> China<00:04:01.329> to<00:04:02.329> Beijing<00:04:02.720> or<00:04:02.959> South

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
Tokyo or China to Beijing or South

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.270

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
France I have to say the Air France over

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.200 
France I have to say the Air France over
there<00:06:30.439> it's<00:06:31.009> kind<00:06:31.249> of<00:06:31.310> heavier<00:06:31.580> than<00:06:31.789> it<00:06:31.909> so

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
there it's kind of heavier than it so

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.659 
there it's kind of heavier than it so
it's<00:06:32.900> kind<00:06:33.139> of<00:06:33.199> embarrassing<00:06:33.680> for<00:06:33.710> such<00:06:34.129> a<00:06:34.159> big

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
it's kind of embarrassing for such a big

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.300 
it's kind of embarrassing for such a big
plane<00:06:34.999> which<00:06:35.360> is<00:06:35.509> supposed<00:06:35.810> to<00:06:35.870> be<00:06:36.080> is<00:06:37.009> it

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
plane which is supposed to be is it

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.969 
plane which is supposed to be is it
really<00:06:37.580> heavy<00:06:38.029> in<00:06:38.210> the<00:06:38.330> model<00:06:38.629> so<00:06:38.960> I<00:06:39.199> mean

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
really heavy in the model so I mean

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.379 
really heavy in the model so I mean
that's<00:06:40.189> something<00:06:40.430> I<00:06:40.639> would<00:06:40.759> definitely<00:06:40.879> fix

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
that's something I would definitely fix

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.350 
that's something I would definitely fix
and<00:06:41.689> uh<00:06:41.719> hopefully<00:06:42.169> I<00:06:42.379> can<00:06:42.529> get<00:06:42.800> this<00:06:42.949> fixed

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
and uh hopefully I can get this fixed

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.760 
and uh hopefully I can get this fixed
maybe<00:06:44.360> I<00:06:44.419> could<00:06:44.569> train<00:06:44.840> it<00:06:44.990> to<00:06:45.110> stay<00:06:45.259> down<00:06:45.439> like

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
maybe I could train it to stay down like

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.959 
maybe I could train it to stay down like
I<00:06:46.039> don't<00:06:46.849> know<00:06:46.939> but<00:06:47.300> no<00:06:47.539> safe<00:06:47.779> I<00:06:47.990> mean<00:06:48.229> it's<00:06:48.969> you
