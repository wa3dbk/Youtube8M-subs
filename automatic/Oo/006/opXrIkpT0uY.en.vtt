penny machine so 40 credits all the way

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.740 
penny machine so 40 credits all the way
up<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.080> 400<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.890> being<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.220> 10<00:02:08.429> x<00:02:08.670> max<00:02:09.000> bed<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.630> I

up to 400 so being a 10 x max bed and I

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.999 
up to 400 so being a 10 x max bed and I
see<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> million-dollar

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
see you have a million-dollar

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.979 
see you have a million-dollar
progressive<00:02:11.760> well<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> progressive<00:02:12.720> always

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
progressive well the progressive always

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.660 
progressive well the progressive always
started<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.470> million<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.190> think<00:02:14.610> the
