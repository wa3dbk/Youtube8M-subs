00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.569 
background or off in front of it you see
a<00:00:47.940> ghost<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.920> that<00:00:49.920> kind<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> shows<00:00:50.309> us<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
a ghost so that kind of shows us the

ghost will be returning to multiplayer

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.889 
ghost will be returning to multiplayer
so<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> real<00:00:54.239> interesting<00:00:54.539> when<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
so this one is a real interesting when I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.560 
so this one is a real interesting when I
think<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> appears<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> target

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
think because it appears to be a target

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.889 
think because it appears to be a target
locator<00:00:58.199> or<00:00:58.440> target<00:00:58.969> designator<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.600> Halo

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
locator or target designator from Halo

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
locator or target designator from Halo
Reach<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.949> most<00:01:02.309> likely

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
Reach but this is most likely

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.880 
Reach but this is most likely
matchmaking<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.539> we'll<00:01:03.840> see<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.199> moving<00:01:04.830> on

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
matchmaking so we'll see and moving on

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.500 
matchmaking so we'll see and moving on
