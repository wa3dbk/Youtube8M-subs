this seventh vial is something that's
going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.459> happen<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.720> future<00:02:28.160> well

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
going to happen in the future well

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.890 
going to happen in the future well
they're<00:02:29.310> partly<00:02:29.580> right<00:02:29.880> because<00:02:30.480> all<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> way

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
they're partly right because all the way

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.699 
they're partly right because all the way
down<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.620> some<00:02:32.040> stuff<00:02:32.310> does<00:02:32.720> but<00:02:33.720> everything

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
down here some stuff does but everything

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.560 
down here some stuff does but everything
that<00:02:34.739> we<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.220> here<00:02:35.250> before<00:02:35.880> us<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.360> is

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
that we see here before us here is

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.630 
that we see here before us here is
something<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.230> has<00:02:37.380> already<00:02:37.680> happened<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
something that has already happened and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.630 
something that has already happened and
then<00:02:39.209> something<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:39.810> going<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.350> happen<00:02:40.739> so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
then something that's going to happen so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.160 
then something that's going to happen so
let's<00:02:41.850> look<00:02:42.060> at<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.540> understand<00:02:43.019> a

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
let's look at this and understand a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.259 
let's look at this and understand a
little<00:02:43.320> better<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.820> seventh<00:02:45.180> angel

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
little better and the seventh angel

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.600 
little better and the seventh angel
poured<00:02:45.570> out<00:02:45.900> his<00:02:45.959> vial<00:02:46.170> into<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.980> air<00:02:47.100> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
poured out his vial into the air and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.400 
poured out his vial into the air and
there<00:02:48.120> came<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.330> great<00:02:48.540> voice<00:02:48.660> out<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
there came a great voice out of the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.229 
there came a great voice out of the
temple<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.860> heaven<00:02:50.070> from<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.519> throne<00:02:50.790> saying

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
temple of heaven from the throne saying

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.530 
temple of heaven from the throne saying
it<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.080> done<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:53.340> vile<00:02:53.670> that's<00:02:54.060> been<00:02:54.209> poured

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
it is done this vile that's been poured

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.410 
it is done this vile that's been poured
out<00:02:54.750> into<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.200> air<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.950> chem<00:02:56.190> trails<00:02:56.519> they

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
out into the air is the chem trails they

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.040 
out into the air is the chem trails they
have<00:02:57.660> been<00:02:57.900> doing<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.820> for<00:02:59.820> more<00:03:00.000> than<00:03:00.060> 40<00:03:00.630> 50

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
have been doing this for more than 40 50

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.070 
have been doing this for more than 40 50
years<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:02.040> us<00:03:02.250> already<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:03.959> were

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
years to us already and there were

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.890 
years to us already and there were
voices<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.100> thunders<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.940> lightnings<00:03:06.600> and

voices and thunders and lightnings and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.410 
voices and thunders and lightnings and
there<00:03:07.470> was<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> great<00:03:07.709> earthquake<00:03:08.130> I'd<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.269> to

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
there was a great earthquake I'd like to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.810 
there was a great earthquake I'd like to
break<00:03:09.600> down<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.380> further<00:03:10.829> listen<00:03:11.549> closely

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
break down this further listen closely

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.240
