maybe of pasta raw pasta and this is

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.680 
maybe of pasta raw pasta and this is
probably<00:02:40.690> about<00:02:40.840> 4<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.500> 3<00:02:41.860> portions<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:43.420> blows

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
probably about 4 to 3 portions it blows

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.740 
probably about 4 to 3 portions it blows
up<00:02:43.930> quite<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.290> lot<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.880> prefer<00:02:46.180> having<00:02:46.390> more

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
