a wireless keyboard but the wireless

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.279 
a wireless keyboard but the wireless
keyboard<00:00:24.029> will<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.240> its<00:00:24.390> own<00:00:24.510> video<00:00:24.840> if<00:00:25.080> any

cuz<00:00:25.590> i'm<00:00:26.369> not<00:00:26.550> been<00:00:26.670> really<00:00:26.820> special<00:00:26.910> about

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
cuz i'm not been really special about

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.370 
cuz i'm not been really special about
that<00:00:27.380> ok<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.439> let's<00:00:28.680> get<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> ipad<00:00:30.380> i

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
that ok so let's get right to the ipad i

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.930 
that ok so let's get right to the ipad i
was<00:00:31.800> we're<00:00:32.130> actually<00:00:32.399> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.790> getting

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
was we're actually going to be getting

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.490 
was we're actually going to be getting
this<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.450> right<00:00:33.660> when<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> first<00:00:34.079> came<00:00:34.290> out

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
this like right when it first came out

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.620 
this like right when it first came out
so<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.610> unboxing<00:00:36.000> would<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.300> actually<00:00:36.420> been

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
so the unboxing would have actually been

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.540 
so the unboxing would have actually been
more<00:00:36.840> appropriate<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.680> now<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.160> everyone

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
more appropriate but now that everyone

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.090 
more appropriate but now that everyone
has<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:39.110> I'm<00:00:40.110> surprised<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.710> actually

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
has it I'm surprised if actually

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.819 
has it I'm surprised if actually
anyone's<00:00:41.520> even<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.090> watch<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.420> video

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
anyone's even really watch this video

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.450 
anyone's even really watch this video
but<00:00:43.829> i<00:00:44.360> figured<00:00:45.360> i<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.570> made<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
but i figured i just made it so that it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.600 
but i figured i just made it so that it
would<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> good<00:00:48.390> video<00:00:48.600> maybe<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> box

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
would be a good video maybe so the box

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.080 
would be a good video maybe so the box
is<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> standard<00:00:54.420> um<00:00:54.809> apple<00:00:56.000> kind<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
is like the standard um apple kind of

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.030 
is like the standard um apple kind of
material<00:00:59.329> and<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.219> ipad<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.110> we'll

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.859 
material and there it is ipad so we'll
just<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.610> ahead<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.970> take<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:08.869> very

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.649 
charger which is a very nice feature and
i<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.490> that's<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.720> box<00:01:41.150> so<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.509> be

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
i think that's it for the box so just be

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.120 
i think that's it for the box so just be
putting<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.140> back<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:49.259> let's<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
putting that back and so let's get to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
putting that back and so let's get to
the<00:01:50.340> device<00:01:50.729> itself<00:01:51.950> i<00:01:52.950> wonder<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.610> it'll<00:01:54.350> if

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the device itself i wonder if it'll if

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.889

it has like you have to plug into itunes
to<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.860> started<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.990> little

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
to get it started so there is a little

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.999 
to get it started so there is a little
apple<00:02:04.829> logo<00:02:06.229> actually<00:02:07.229> pay<00:02:07.380> sure<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.920> to
