00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 let's see what Christian knows 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:15.540
 today to review but what the fuck that 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:18.960
 fuck we are a little big fishery yes 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.010
 it is based on the certainty that it exists 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.250
 Holy shit, that 's a case 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250
 inside 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.650
 all boys and welcome back to these 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.360
 nine episodes of covering passion 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.430
 famine bowles today vi 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.270
 we will present this case a beat felix 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.490
 colossus for living cards thanking 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.350
 of the fenix the thesis of car we will go to 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.240
 fix it as always by analyzing more in the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.170
 detail each of its particular its 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.940
 video studio 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.100
 and here we are again talking about a 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.200
 houses given to make mini pc or computer 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.450
 for lampard in this country is a colossus 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.070
 on mini itx not to be confused with his 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.690
 brother micro atx hicks that of 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.550
 different only has support for 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.380
 motherboards precisely the Croats 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.160
 let us remember for those who did not know that 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.790
 mini itx are 17 cm x 17 cm while the 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.560
 micro atx hicks are 24 cm x 24 cm 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.119
 let's make this small distinction 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.860
 to analyze this particular keys 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.960
 which really impressed us as it is 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.090
 done externally present classics 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.560
 power buttons re 7 as well as ai 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.420
 status LED even disk 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.520
 ignition side by side audio jack for 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.020
 headphones and microphone and all supported by 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.700
 two usb 3.0 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.770
 the design is undoubtedly particular 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.600
 being made of steel apart from frame e 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.490
 in side and even bulkheads 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.530
 characterized by a rubberized plastic e 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.090
 opaque in the frontal part superior to 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.580
 this material as beautiful as the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.679
 sight and touch sometimes boredom 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.030
 as long as it gets dirty easily and done 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.170
 write down your friends' fingerprints 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.700
 green with envy 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 we also read that the upper part 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.970
 downhill if you can say so 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.619
 detailing this even more 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.770
 little girl in the back we find 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.380
 the slot for the 120 mm or 140 fan 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.390
 two PCI slots that will host only one 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.310
 video card in mini itx format provides 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.780
 this is obviously the bulkhead for i 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.399
 motherboard connectors and that 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.350
 of the power supply almost everywhere 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.940
 there are inviting screws 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.480
 completely by hand thanks to them 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.640
 design 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.319
 the front is magnetic in fact it 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.270
 help desk that gives us access to the reader 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.790
 cd and the dust filter of the event 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.050
 lever to seal the front part with 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.270
 of magnets in no time at all 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.040
 without many and hooks you have or grill 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.030
 and leaving a design at a glance 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.860
 clean and sober 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.420
 looking lower and in the bulkheads 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.610
 these strips are visible on the sides 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 plasticous white that they hide under 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.600
 of plastic tubes that by two 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.340
 simple LEDs light up almost 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.500
 all that driven by the curiosity of 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.000
 see what was underneath and how 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.920
 everything worked we got on 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.480
 sbu dell'Aics up to that 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.159
 that seems 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.900
 the main point from which e 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.670
 lights at the beginning of the review indeed 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.500
 we have said that this is what we have 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.909
 very enthusiastic and in addition to many 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.190
 small details and this is that 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.989
 that bitfenix is ​​more interested in fact 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.000
 using a very small and simple 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.890
 board on which two RGB LEDs are mounted 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.140
 manages to illuminate very much 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.879
 the kage is particularly striking and startling 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.650
 from red to then switch to blues and then 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.599
 to the green we find a modality of 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.489
 multicolour fade to then arrive 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.140
 to night mode where live and yes 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.640
 turn off completely to activate color 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.110
 just click the button 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.000
 which is located in the side bulkhead 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.890
 left looking at the kate in front 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.959
 using the tubes as already mentioned 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.640
 transparent plastic the LEDs go to 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.200
 propagate your own color as you are 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.420
 seeing in this video and if not maybe 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.129
 that I don't have a mini itx motherboard already 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.200
 to have used for my configuration a 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.370
 mail and gigi habit fenix for use 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.019
 of this solution to render 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.910
 particular his that the data in a 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.010
 some sense make it almost tamar la 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.620
 beast passing now inside we find 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.629
 two baskets brings ad disk or ssd all e 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.430
 two removable and fixed by that one 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.260
 superior can also be challenged by hand 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.640
 thanks to plastic guides while 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.680
 the one below can be removed 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.160
 unscrewing the screws on the right target for 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.690
 curiosity 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.430
 know that the baskets can be 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.680
 turn completely so you can 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.180
 insert and remove hard disk both from 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.310
 bulkhead to the right than to the left 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.810
 of the houses according to your interest with 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.519
 layout of desk rooms 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.959
 arrived baskets we are there huge 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.750
 front grille that can house 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.510
 two 120 mm sylvan wood fans 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.829
 cd holder or a 200 mm one without this 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.090
 need to live in the cd compartment 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.889
 having this particular 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.450
 predisposition will also allow for 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.340
 mountain a radiator for installation a 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.989
 very aggressive liquid with following the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.360
 turn and we find the housing for the 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.919
 cd or dvd player that is together with the 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.050
 small square from where we will put the 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.490
 mini itx format motherboard included 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.470
 of fairleads under it instead 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.240
 we find the power supply compartment that 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.070
 has anti-rubber mounts 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.750
 vibration for a little above as already mentioned 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.460
 and the slot for having fans in between 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.139
 bitfenix makes available 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.470
 inside the churches are two bitfenixes 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.270
 120 mm moon with 9 brushless motors 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.949
 blades that allow a nice recirculation of 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.449
 air in the upper part we find one 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.380
 nice and stocker and grill that 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.210
 takes up a little the rubberized style of the 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.070
 and that below it can hide two 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.520
 120mm fans for a possible 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.590
 240 mm or 120 mm radiator of a 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.780
 small flaw but normally obvious 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.630
 given the size is that if you put a 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.670
 240 mm radiator or anyway two 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.800
 120mm moon fans let's go to 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.810
 suppress the slot for the player a little 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.340
 bitfenix and had thought of it and when 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.960
 buy the case in fact we find one 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.610
 metal plate that covers precisely 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.650
 the slot this because nowadays 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.810
 voters are hardly used 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.580
 above all, they make lan parties or other 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.140
 in the lower part instead we find 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.720
 the dust filter for the power supply 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.580
 and of the rubberized pawls under unscrewable 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.230
 and you trust that they keep relieved 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.850
 the cases for the flow of area of ​​the 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.530
 power supply fan is possible 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.090
 to arches long video cards up to 33 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.970
 centimeters therefore also mine 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.140
 beautiful that beautiful if 95 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.120
 quietly as long as they are taken away 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.070
 hdd port if the go does not raise the 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.590
 maximum length is reduced to 16 20 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.000
 meters to be understood a gtx 750 which 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.440
 too we can't let you see the 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.240
 assembly or otherwise the various 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.920
 support combinations that have this 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.780
 country because not having a motherboard 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.940
 mini itx and for the moment we cannot 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.770
 don't even do any tests at it though 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.550
 ve ripresenteremo it for its Mousavi 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.020
 pros and cons 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.000
 obviously consider that also the 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.230
 small then cable management and will have to 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.820
 be made in a workmanlike manner 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.320
 if you do not want to return the road 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.150
 case obviously everything disassembled e 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.010
 remountable with screws and the area for the 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.240
 20 in front flows from the loopholes that 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.560
 are located at the top of the door 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.330
 magnetic trying to conclude 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.010
 best ways to those who recommend it 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.170
 with a price that is around 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.940
 100 euros on the puntoit dragon is not one of the 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.800
 better economically speaking but 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.660
 considering the internal arrangement i 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.850
 very special live shows and all his 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.650
 above particularities for sure 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.660
 he would make his figure among so many 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.340
 other keys and if you are looking for a case 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.900
 sober but that the attention 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.520
 I certainly won't mind this 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.290
 remember to take a look at the page 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.640
 facebook of bit phoenix italia per 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.110
 always know the latest news and 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.970
 know that the model also exists 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.800
 micro atx knicks that supports tabs 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.270
 slightly larger and therefore with a 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.340
 more support if you are hardware 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.020
 particularly if you are more interested in 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.920
 micro atx xe instead of that 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.600
 reviewed to us or weapons 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.580
 check in the description where
