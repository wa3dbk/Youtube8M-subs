of<00:02:12.190> white<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:13.060> bone<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.080> now<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.890> first

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
of white and and bone like now the first

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.739 
of white and and bone like now the first
stage<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> dry<00:02:15.940> rock<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.390> going<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.629> be

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:16.749 
stage of the dry rock is going to be

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.130 
stage of the dry rock is going to be
turning<00:02:17.109> brown

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
turning brown

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.020 
turning brown
and<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.620> see<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:19.100> has<00:02:19.310> turned<00:02:19.790> brown

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
and as you can see it has turned brown

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.620 
and as you can see it has turned brown
and<00:02:20.150> several<00:02:20.840> areas<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:22.340> then<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.150> next<00:02:23.420> step

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
and several areas and then the next step

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.370 
and several areas and then the next step
is<00:02:23.810> green<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:25.780> that's<00:02:26.780> what<00:02:27.050> I'm<00:02:27.170> getting

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
is green and that's what I'm getting

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.350 
is green and that's what I'm getting
right<00:02:27.650> now<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.190> let's<00:02:28.370> start<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.790> turn<00:02:29.000> green

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
right now so let's start the turn green

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.480 
right now so let's start the turn green
the<00:02:29.630> next<00:02:30.110> phase<00:02:30.320> will<00:02:30.770> be<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.920> coralline

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
the next phase will be the coralline

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.030 
the next phase will be the coralline
algae<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:32.120> get<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.960> nice<00:02:33.170> purple<00:02:33.470> look<00:02:33.830> that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
algae and get that nice purple look that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.520 
algae and get that nice purple look that
you<00:02:34.220> all<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:34.610> out<00:02:34.820> there<00:02:35.060> already<00:02:35.530> just

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
you all have out there already just

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.730 
you all have out there already just
takes<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:36.890> little<00:02:37.040> bit<00:02:37.280> more<00:02:37.460> time<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.740> a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
takes a little bit more time and a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.490 
takes a little bit more time and a
little<00:02:39.980> bit<00:02:40.130> more<00:02:40.370> patience<00:02:41.230> before<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.320> get

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
little bit more patience before you get

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.520 
little bit more patience before you get
those<00:02:42.710> nice<00:02:42.980> purple<00:02:43.490> colors<00:02:44.020> I'm<00:02:45.020> not<00:02:45.200> saying

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
those nice purple colors I'm not saying

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.230 
those nice purple colors I'm not saying
that<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:45.950> better<00:02:46.190> than<00:02:46.430> live<00:02:46.610> rock<00:02:46.910> live

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
that it's better than live rock live

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.800 
that it's better than live rock live
rock<00:02:47.510> obviously<00:02:48.410> has<00:02:49.160> major<00:02:50.150> benefits

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
rock obviously has major benefits

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.500 
rock obviously has major benefits
compared<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.320> dry<00:02:51.950> rock<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:53.060> if<00:02:53.150> you're<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.480> a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
compared to dry rock but if you're on a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.780 
compared to dry rock but if you're on a
budget<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:54.680> don't<00:02:54.709> have<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.250> scared<00:02:55.670> of

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
budget you don't have to be scared of

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.900 
budget you don't have to be scared of
dry<00:02:56.030> rock<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:57.200> know<00:02:57.320> take<00:02:57.620> some

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
dry rock you know take some

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.160 
dry rock you know take some
precautionary<00:02:58.910> measures<00:02:59.390> for<00:02:59.840> it<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.020> leach

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
precautionary measures for it to leach

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.930 
precautionary measures for it to leach
phosphates<00:03:00.770> even<00:03:01.130> though<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.250> didn't<00:03:01.670> have<00:03:01.790> to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
phosphates even though I didn't have to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.070 
phosphates even though I didn't have to
do<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.380> but<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.470> take<00:03:03.650> those<00:03:03.890> precautionary

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
do that but you take those precautionary

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.860 
do that but you take those precautionary
measures<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.380> then<00:03:07.360> before<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.480> know<00:03:08.660> it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
measures and then before you know it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.550 
measures and then before you know it
it's<00:03:09.290> going<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.620> be<00:03:10.070> turning<00:03:10.730> into<00:03:10.850> live<00:03:11.150> rock

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
it's going to be turning into live rock

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.160 
it's going to be turning into live rock
so<00:03:12.560> I've<00:03:12.920> got<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:14.120> green<00:03:14.390> going<00:03:14.660> but<00:03:14.989> then

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
so I've got the green going but then

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.199 
so I've got the green going but then
let's<00:03:15.590> see<00:03:15.800> if<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.130> get<00:03:16.310> in<00:03:16.489> on<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.700> I've

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
let's see if I can get in on it I've

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.180 
let's see if I can get in on it I've
also<00:03:17.390> got<00:03:17.890> little<00:03:18.890> patches<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.760> red<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:21.190> pink

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
also got little patches of red and pink

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.270 
also got little patches of red and pink
and<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.720> think<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.380> might<00:03:24.769> have<00:03:24.980> some

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
and so I think I might have some

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.479 
and so I think I might have some
coralline<00:03:25.880> algae<00:03:27.760> starting<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:30.400> starting<00:03:31.400> to

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
coralline algae starting to starting to

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.750 
coralline algae starting to starting to
come<00:03:35.680> cameras<00:03:36.680> really<00:03:36.830> not<00:03:37.100> picking<00:03:37.459> up<00:03:37.580> on

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
come cameras really not picking up on

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.840 
come cameras really not picking up on
these<00:03:37.880> little<00:03:38.090> patches<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.720> t'ankin<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:40.040> red

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
these little patches of t'ankin and red

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.370 
these little patches of t'ankin and red
that<00:03:40.880> I<00:03:41.090> have<00:03:41.390> going<00:03:41.630> on<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.230> tank

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
that I have going on in the tank

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.410 
that I have going on in the tank
but<00:03:45.380> if<00:03:45.680> you're<00:03:45.950> worried<00:03:46.370> about<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:47.090> micro

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
but if you're worried about the micro

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.940 
but if you're worried about the micro
flora<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.810> fauna<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.350> can<00:03:48.500> always<00:03:48.739> get

I plan on doing I'm going to go out and
I'm<00:04:01.220> going<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.430> get<00:04:01.519> a<00:04:01.549> baseball-sized<00:04:02.390> piece

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
I'm going to get a baseball-sized piece

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.430 
I'm going to get a baseball-sized piece
of<00:04:02.989> live<00:04:03.200> rock<00:04:04.209> stick<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.360> in<00:04:05.480> here<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.989> fuel

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
of live rock stick it in here to fuel

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.350 
of live rock stick it in here to fuel
the<00:04:06.709> coralline<00:04:07.250> algae<00:04:07.280> growth<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.060> kind<00:04:08.269> of

the coralline algae growth to kind of
seat<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:08.840> hopefully<00:04:09.680> it'll<00:04:10.070> go<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.400> little

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
seat it hopefully it'll go a little

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.170 
seat it hopefully it'll go a little
quicker<00:04:11.470> plus<00:04:12.470> get<00:04:13.070> some<00:04:13.280> micro<00:04:13.670> flora<00:04:13.910> and

quicker plus get some micro flora and

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.690 
quicker plus get some micro flora and

nuisance by just picking a small piece
hopefully<00:04:20.630> don't<00:04:20.780> get<00:04:21.079> any

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
hopefully don't get any
