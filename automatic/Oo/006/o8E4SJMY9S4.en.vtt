00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.879
 crazy thing 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.220

 pippa ultimate team on fifa 14 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.700
 my little ultimate team series that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.690
 I had a brazilian team 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.789
 as you can see but I did 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.180
 a mental sick thing is that I have 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.619
 sold all my other players like you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.119
 can see I won 20 miles and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.380
 I still have polly gnocchi for sale who 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.769
 will take me maybe three minutes of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.890
 blow I had about 23 miles of 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.390
 credit and for that it's 23000 I'm going 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.020
 use them to buy an all one 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.879
 whole new team so there is this 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.379
 idea was given to me by hervÃ© mac it's 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.460
 hide others like this on twitter it 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.770
 told me yeah you should buy one if 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.750
 mittal yen at 13000 so I got the idea 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.010
 to do that I wanted to change 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 of all equipped to have a second 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 team so what I'm going to do is 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.960
 that I want I want two teams in fact 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.670
 so here I have a Brazilian already 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.100

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.629
 second also that I will want 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.809
