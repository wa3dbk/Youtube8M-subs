00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
that it's got the gunmetal component to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.160 
that it's got the gunmetal component to
it<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.670> pendant<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.300> then<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.600> pearls<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.110> I

it the pendant and then the pearls and I
like<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.560> gunmetal<00:02:24.860> because<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.250> think<00:02:25.310> it

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
like the gunmetal because I think it

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.180 
like the gunmetal because I think it
gives<00:02:25.730> an<00:02:26.720> otherwise<00:02:27.170> very<00:02:27.680> ladylike<00:02:28.550> maybe

gives an otherwise very ladylike maybe

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.040 
gives an otherwise very ladylike maybe
kind<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.280> old<00:02:31.610> could<00:02:31.970> skew<00:02:32.240> old<00:02:32.510> pearl

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
kind of old could skew old pearl

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
necklace a little bit of edge it's a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.180 
necklace a little bit of edge it's a
nice<00:02:35.240> detail<00:02:35.690> but<00:02:36.140> if<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.560> just<00:02:36.770> wanted<00:02:37.070> the
