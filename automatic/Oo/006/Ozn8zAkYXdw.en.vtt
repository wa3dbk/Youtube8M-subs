00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi to all guys that this would 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.150
 sold in this new clash video 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.919
 of blind splash france I all these names 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.719
 a bit like that, we have enough bullshit 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.880
 started already bad so boy there 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.500
 we are left last time ie 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.210
 in the previous episode which is the first 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.980
 is that I invite you to look found 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.660
 obviously leaking description or vi 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.430
 I put some miniatures as usual 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.070
 screen as I said we had left 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.810
 so with our newly created village 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.310
 I don't know if it can give you a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.039
 name the village something like that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.590
 but apparently the builders who 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.329
 they can still build and then I was 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.399
 thinking of starting to do something 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.559
 of useful type we could improve the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.930
 gold deposit although I anyway 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.120
 now I'm doing some things without it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.890
 still read your comments seen 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.289
 who is recording a proper episode 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.719
 after recording the first one anyway 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.120
 I would say to work a little on the deposit 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.100
 them and on the elixir extractor 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.530
 obviously the builders will proceed 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.280
 with the construction because they are precisely 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.570
 builders enough bullshit I would say that 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.350
 let's analyze ours a little 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.549
 there are only ten camps 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.470
 troops fighters as we want 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.510
 call them to fight with 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.369
 and in the meantime we can also explore 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.950
 a bit the store as far as I know indeed 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.630
 you can buy djembe with the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.549
 real cash however for now 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.720
 would like to avoid spending the money 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.150
 real 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 and then I guess I fucked up 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.180
 keep busy let's say both 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.510
 the other manufacturer therefore at least for 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.280
 now guys we use gems 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.590
 as I have to record a video me 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.480
 you need to always have ready 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.220
 builders then perhaps in the future 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.260
 they also buy gems to make 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.180
 all much faster though for 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.250
 I prefer to act now 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.920
 this way then let's build the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.960
 barracks then guys apparently the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.020
 builder just finished building 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.820
 the barracks so we have two of those 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.640
 we could also exploit this thing 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.130
 let's see if I build others 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.050
 which little keep training other troops 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.750
 the process should be quite a bit 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.970
 speeded up because now we have 12 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.520
 troops in the camp and the came 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.179
 let's see what we can do or do 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.330
 another pair 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.880
 and here I believe we say it 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.950
 the training continues for the rest 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.810
 I wanted to see the attacks 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.570
 they can do among other things water there 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.280
 also the multiplayer games to do at 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.770
 apparently it is possible to attack too 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.209
 in multiplayer and for sure I want to do 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.970
 even videos of this kind so 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.350
 such as to attack further villages and 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.459
 understand therefore even a little better 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.440
 how the game works 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.270
 the waiting guys i guess it's going to 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.810
 finish because you see the camp 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.120
 and show it to 18 out of 20 so they are missing about 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.220
 another ten seconds and then we could 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.090
 have a very complete camp 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.160
 very well 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.959
 so guys we can go for a 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.480
 proper attack as it should be 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.300
 let's see where we are now so let's see 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.010
 a little attack I would also like to try the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.320
 multiplayer because so many me 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.180
 they recommended it however for now as 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.220
 I'm still poor I want to try the map 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.560
 goblin place at least to understand 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.989
 a little better the game mechanics 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.450
 tap or short and hold to 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.850
 deploy the troops so I couldn't 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.140
 selecting no is not needed at the moment 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.480
 yes perhaps he apologizes and aleph with very well 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.160
 then I put the attack aside 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.780
 very close to the cannons 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.310
 I don't know if it was a right thing but 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.260
 I believe so 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.880
 1 have been destroyed very well by what 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.580
 I wanted and you 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.320
 continues the attack towards should be 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.990
 a municipality that however a hut 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.210
 which contains both sires and money 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.040
 really great guys I recommend 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.380
 I really ask you, please give me 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.630
 some advice because of this game 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.940
 I really feel lost in culture yet 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.470
 it is not that he understood everything well 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.210
 how does it work 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.280
 here go to attack the cannon 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.950
 so we are at 50 percent 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.050
 well the year of ostrich and therefore I believe 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.840
 we have this completely in the dark 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.620
 the contribution of the goblins we see is perfect 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.050
 so we have concluded this 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.460
 attack without major problems 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.350
 now let's see how we're set 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.750
 we have here we have dalisi kings from 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.740
 recover and then these are ours 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.870
 troops 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.850
 meanwhile other troops are coming 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.560
 trained I would say the case to put 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.320
 also another cannon so right for 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.360
 have a further defense then if a 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.920
 cannon and right here as you see in 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.180
 this place say the case of 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.030
 put it on the other side 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.860
 maybe I have placed it here then wait 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.820
 your advice to understand if 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.710
 I did a right thing 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.050
 maybe I fucked up a lot 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.300
 likely in the meantime let's see some 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.290
 we already have 14 troops we see in the 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.270
 shop 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.940
 if I can do anything else I believe in the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.470
 when this is not possible 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.990
 because either both manufacturers 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.970
 in fact apparently engaged then 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.370
 now the camp is finally full 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.610
 therefore we can advance and then the canon 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.260
 I think it was built without problems 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.610
 so now we can go for a 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.710
 other attack 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.600
 I would say to make strong rock then guys 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.490
 from the next episode we will also see a 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.130
 multiplayer because they really are 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.690
 very curious, remember to leave 800 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.940
 I like to have a next episode 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.440
 please don't forget then 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.090
 let's see if we can move forward 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.150
 I believe the only entry you buy 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.650
 what this patch is and I don't have any 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.120
 idea 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.610
 maybe I fucked up let's see a 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.830
 marginal place from this place because 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.780
 they all will say that I did one 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.310
 fuck my boys this time I know 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.140
 that I made it big 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.520
 I know because all the troops are 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.760
 entering from this other side then 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.490
 we do so I can make others play 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.460
 here in fact good can therefore 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.440
 continue to destroy the cannon between 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.150
 the other there are some busy a little 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.210
 further north and had liked how 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.130
 you can see I believe a cannon is 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.680
 destroyed indeed very well and also 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.320
 the other well so I think what 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.130
 door and rocky have no other month 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.890
 so guys 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.060
 I would say that we say this advance is 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.130
 went pretty well 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.650
 meanwhile we continue to buy 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.390
 or rather to conquer an elixir e 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.340
 money that will surely suit us 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.800
 to have empowered the village 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.500
 get more troops and everything else 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.940
 look at how much money we've earned 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.950
 as you can see I have also reached the 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.660
 maximum and probably I could 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.419
 get even more money unfortunately 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.820
 in fact that I didn't upgrade at the moment 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.890
 still let's say that structure that you 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.240
 allows or not the deposit here 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.250
 he offered me the name I called it for 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.620
 structure and as you can see, in fact 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.600
 the deposit is currently undergoing 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.280
 Improvement us put it this way 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.960
 we can indeed get quite a bit of 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.690
 elixir and in the meantime I would say of 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.640
 further train other troops 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.950
 a good idea I think it could 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.830
 already begin to improve 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.590
 a barracks since in fact they could 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.600
 serve this other dudes who are women 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.150
 maybe I have no idea whatever I want 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.860
 even more troops to be conquered 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.540
 or better to use during that 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.130
 attacks that we can carry out together with 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.750
 those guys this episode either 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.520
 Finally here I realize that 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.410
 episodes a little brief but this depends 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.660
 by the fact that the clash of clan is a game 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.370
 which really takes a lot of time either 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.460
 be registered but is just like 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.169
 see to advance in creating new ones 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.030
 things and above all in strengthening the 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.760
 troop village and all the rest 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.440
 so is the video 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.030
 where I remember to leave a lot of me 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.220
 like for this video let's try to 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.840
 exceed 700 800 I like and 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.100
 especially remember also to
