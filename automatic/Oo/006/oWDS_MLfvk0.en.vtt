00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.299
 in december 2012 you do not think 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.429
 necessarily to the summer of 2013 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.280
 but when you see this as cabrio 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.500
 you get lust on sun 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.480
 he looks like a normal a5 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.510
 Convertible is not quite normal because 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 this is the rs model rs stands for 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.289
 racing sports means everything is there 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.570
 a little faster 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.439
 Not everything goes the roof 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.410
 still in 15 seconds on and in 17 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.890
 seconds to which you should again be 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.340
 please always leave on why show that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.340
 we in the next 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.910
 it's 8 V shaped sorted sound 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.770
 Cylinders play their high- speed song 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.960
 and thanks to the missing sheet metal 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.760
 partly over the head also unhindered in 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.850
 turn the ears of the driver 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.800
 the 4.2 liter engine has 450 horses 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.410
 under the bonnet and runs with the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.390
 convertible and 4.9 seconds to 100 the 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.270
 speed is added in the basic package 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.220
 250 km h limited for a small one 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.360
 but audi raises the limit as well 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.670
 like to 280 8 of the rs5 is very much 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.860
 confidently forward but also no 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.330
 big miracle at the ps number in the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.760
 but compared to his competition is 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.590
 even the most modern of the m3 is such a 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.229
 little is coming in the years soon 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.940
 from the four bmw replaced the c-class has 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.170
 actually no cable has any more 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.700
 your platform directly to the e-class 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.100
 passed and tried so one 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.080
 a bit in the comfortable glide and there 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.910
 is this already much sportier 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.160
 You have to say that clearly , but he is 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.390
 no uncompromising cross driver that 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.340
 is now on the all-wheel drive 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.990
 but a bit tail-heavy is designed 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.990
 but rather on stability 8 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.690
 garnished for this sound 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.700
 wonderful car for the fast 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.650
 Country road maybe a few curves 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.820
 That's why I think such conducts 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.610
 also a bit of street pictures 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.860
 fade in or the steering is direct 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 the chassis taut but only if 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.490
 it is also set so for 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.140
 example, the steering on comfort 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.690
 will be surprised how easy it is 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.160
 the rs5 move unfortunately loses 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.140
 one then also any feeling for the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.770
 Feedback is better the dynamic 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.720
 variant 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.400
 By the way, this also switches the tailpipes 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.180
 on passage and lets the sound first 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.190
 right through 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.470
 in comfort mode, the audi sounds 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.330
 rather harmless but worthwhile if 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.980
 There are four of you traveling and yourself 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.980
 maybe also wants to entertain 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.170
 At 380 liters of luggage space is even more 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.970
 place for the beach towels the first 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.650
 convertible we have as many customers as possible 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.959
 satisfy 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.480
 if you want to have a rs5 then 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.970
 please this one here it is the last with 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.680
 the legendary v8 intake engine the next 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.849
 will probably be a six-cylinder 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.739
 have turbo 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.540
 he goes as well as that 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.590
 coupÃ© drives just as confidently 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.329
 he is not necessarily for the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.459
 race track built okay but that 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.019
 coupe also not it is about relaxed 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.700
 to drive fast and in which you have 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.129
 not just the wind around the nose 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.930
 no, you also have the sound in your ears 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.480
 at least if you are in dynamic mode 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.640
 On the way there is one 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.500
 Warnhinweis we when it comes to audi 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.150
 always have to sell and for his 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.190
 contents the audi ag also completely alone 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.879
 responsible for 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.709
 It's about the price 88 1500 euro costs 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.900
 the basis with the speed 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.299
 Raising and the current infotainment 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.639
 But one is fast at 100,000 seems 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.220
 under this sum is hardly a rs 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.290
 5 go on a trip but if you go up 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.549
 open to the sunset drives 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.549
 are financial things
