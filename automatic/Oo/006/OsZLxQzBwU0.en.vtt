00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.630
 hello it all again, I last time 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.670
 we did the exercise 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.529
 everything is not the next shiver as promised in 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.859
 the basis of which is the movement 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.000
 which we last mastered with you 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.010
 to know that we are now taking business 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.120
 I advise you to take the slope out 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.010
 on the same slope where you are comfortable 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.050
 need to go with a little bit of turning 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.080
 who doesn't scare you 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.220
 which is good condition 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.100
 try there was no less out 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.670
 distracted movement will be new 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.440
 interests and just 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.280
 principle we will do the same thing that we 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.670
 do bag again also wide stand 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.489
 feet wide feet wide centimeters 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.260
 30 40 between the legs offset forward 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.930
 check the pressure on out and pressure on 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.750
 plus tango on socks we lay down on the shoes 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.780
 shoes shout hands 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.000
 ahead and begin to go down at it 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.210
 by the word diagonally, moreover 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.100
 we don't care about this angle we don't need 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.480
 drive it down the hill maybe 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.570
 can you imagine moving more 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.170
 across the slope that is, well, pick yourself 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.930
 this angle of the initial slope 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.869
 comfortable for the interests of a dozen o 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.820
 than you develop we are already passing meters 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.890
 5-7 to get some 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.300
 speed 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.280
 initial 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.850
 to do the dynamics this exercise and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.850
 do the previous movement but 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 turning the skis themselves down the slope 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.950
 farther last time we slid just 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.470
 down and now realizing how lighting 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.580
 enclosures affect skiing 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.850
 we do so to go exactly 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.010
 arc as if to radius to anyone 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.510
 down the hill and come 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.460
 she right there part of the plan with which we 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.010
 started to heights we go out unfold 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.750
 ski and charge at the point that we 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.910
 started turning around 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.460
 again forgive diagonally accelerate 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.590
 unfolded above and turned well so 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.480
 here's a video demo shown 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.319
 exercise as again it seems 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.660
 simple but she makes you teach 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.090
 understand and manage your displacement 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.450
 hull forward back and see how it is 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.840
 affects the radius of your trade 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.940
 your turn is actually everything really 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.129
 very simple but in theory to explain it 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.900
 harder than just making and understanding and 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:51.099
 feel essentially you learn 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.069
 combine and manage combinations 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.530
 longitudinal slip and transverse 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.340
 slip as you remember from theory to 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.739
 longitudinally say carried accelerates along 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.530
 highway cross our braking now how 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.080
 No, not when you say it across 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.410
 longitudinal axis clinging Kant without doing 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.049
 so here it is count the braking and 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.840
 gas and pursue this combination 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.660
 gas braking movement on the one you need 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.920
 trajectories here is not tricky but very 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.700
 useful exercise 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.650
 yes do it in different directions yes again 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.459
 still not at the marvelous harbor things say 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.980
 new to full automatic bye and 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.110
 confident fulfillment tryon 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.760
 do it still be creative 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.489
 try to make different turns 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.269
 radius and on different slopes 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.430
 it will give you control skills in different 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.239
 conditions otherwise you can become skiers 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.940
 single slope 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.250
 Here on this with you I can on the neighboring not 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.140
 I mean, do not waste time 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.600
 as the cartoon hero spoke better 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.050
 half an hour three hours later lose five 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.180
 minutes fly all but 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.730
 the next series of our new exercise 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.400
 naturally in which again 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.260
 there will be all the same movements that we 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.570
 have developed this this 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.640
 so not to miss signed 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.230
 channel put here so meet already on 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.230
 all about the movie again
