for the ipod touch iphone and ipad on
iOS<00:00:19.140> four<00:00:19.439> firmware<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> really

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
iOS four firmware so this is a really

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
iOS four firmware so this is a really
cool<00:00:22.710> little<00:00:22.910> tweak<00:00:23.910> i<00:00:24.119> guess<00:00:24.300> you'd<00:00:24.510> call<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
cool little tweak i guess you'd call it

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.599 
cool little tweak i guess you'd call it
for<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> ipod<00:00:25.470> touch<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.890> iphone<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.430> stuff

for the ipod touch and iphone and stuff
but<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.869> downside<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.160> paid<00:00:29.580> in

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
but the downside to this it is paid in

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.840 
but the downside to this it is paid in
cydia<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> buy<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> that
