this<00:00:00.980> video<00:00:01.459> will<00:00:01.999> put<00:00:02.210> forward<00:00:02.510> the<00:00:02.690> idea

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:02.720 
this video will put forward the idea

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.710 
this video will put forward the idea
that<00:00:03.350> time<00:00:03.980> travel<00:00:04.280> into<00:00:05.120> the<00:00:05.150> future<00:00:05.240> is

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
that time travel into the future is

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.250 
that time travel into the future is
possible<00:00:06.259> and<00:00:06.410> that<00:00:07.130> there<00:00:07.310> is<00:00:07.340> a<00:00:07.460> possibility

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
possible and that there is a possibility

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.310 
possible and that there is a possibility
UFOs<00:00:09.260> might<00:00:10.070> be<00:00:10.280> from<00:00:10.490> her<00:00:10.639> own<00:00:10.790> past<00:00:11.320> this

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
UFOs might be from her own past this

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.400 
UFOs might be from her own past this
idea<00:00:12.830> might<00:00:13.370> seem<00:00:13.429> mad<00:00:14.000> but<00:00:14.750> it<00:00:14.840> can<00:00:15.050> be<00:00:15.170> based

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
idea might seem mad but it can be based

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.970 
idea might seem mad but it can be based
on<00:00:15.740> Einstein's<00:00:16.490> theories<00:00:17.300> of<00:00:17.330> relativity<00:00:17.980> in

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
on Einstein's theories of relativity in

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.640 
on Einstein's theories of relativity in

special relativity moving clocks run

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.760 
special relativity moving clocks run
slower<00:00:22.010> and<00:00:22.250> in<00:00:22.880> general<00:00:23.119> relativity<00:00:23.770> clocks

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
slower and in general relativity clocks

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.980 
slower and in general relativity clocks
run<00:00:25.039> faster<00:00:25.609> higher<00:00:26.180> in<00:00:26.449> a<00:00:26.539> gravitational

run faster higher in a gravitational

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.060 
run faster higher in a gravitational
field<00:00:28.090> therefore<00:00:29.090> we<00:00:29.510> can<00:00:29.720> see<00:00:30.080> that<00:00:30.920> the

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
field therefore we can see that the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.219 
field therefore we can see that the
greater<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:31.550> energy<00:00:31.580> of<00:00:32.119> an<00:00:32.599> individual

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
within that reference frame this is

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.229 
within that reference frame this is
called<00:00:38.899> time<00:00:39.170> dilation<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:40.039> it<00:00:40.670> is<00:00:40.789> totally

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
called time dilation and it is totally

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.520 
called time dilation and it is totally
natural<00:00:41.870> process<00:00:42.350> within<00:00:43.069> our<00:00:43.309> universe<00:00:43.760> a

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:48.889 
good example of this is a twin paradox a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:51.329 
good example of this is a twin paradox a

returns<00:01:07.579> to<00:01:08.119> earth<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:09.109> discovered<00:01:09.680> that

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
returns to earth it is discovered that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.810 
returns to earth it is discovered that
he<00:01:10.340> is<00:01:10.460> younger<00:01:10.880> than<00:01:11.030> his<00:01:11.570> sibling<00:01:12.820> this

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
he is younger than his sibling this

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.240 
he is younger than his sibling this
experiment<00:01:14.299> could<00:01:15.020> be<00:01:15.170> turned<00:01:15.380> around<00:01:15.679> and

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
experiment could be turned around and

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.490 
experiment could be turned around and
instead<00:01:16.969> of<00:01:17.090> using<00:01:17.329> the<00:01:17.570> energy<00:01:17.929> for

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
instead of using the energy for

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.550 
instead of using the energy for
traveling<00:01:18.890> in<00:01:18.979> space<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.780> could<00:01:20.780> be<00:01:20.929> used<00:01:21.200> for

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
traveling in space it could be used for

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.810 
traveling in space it could be used for
the<00:01:22.070> effect<00:01:22.369> of<00:01:22.490> time<00:01:22.759> dilation<00:01:23.409> itself<00:01:24.409> in

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
the effect of time dilation itself in

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.510 
the effect of time dilation itself in
this<00:01:25.820> way<00:01:26.119> we<00:01:26.630> could<00:01:26.840> use<00:01:27.049> time<00:01:27.380> dilation<00:01:27.799> to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
this way we could use time dilation to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.080 
this way we could use time dilation to
travel<00:01:28.909> into<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.240> future<00:01:30.429> theory<00:01:31.429> there<00:01:31.939> are

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
travel into the future theory there are

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.529 
travel into the future theory there are
videos<00:01:32.509> on<00:01:32.780> YouTube<00:01:33.469> that<00:01:34.159> suggests<00:01:34.429> that<00:01:35.030> the

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
videos on YouTube that suggests that the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.929 
videos on YouTube that suggests that the
Germans<00:01:35.960> were<00:01:36.049> developing<00:01:36.710> time<00:01:37.280> machines<00:01:37.729> in

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
Germans were developing time machines in

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.840 
Germans were developing time machines in
the<00:01:38.030> 1940s<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:39.079> find<00:01:39.979> this<00:01:40.100> very<00:01:40.340> hard<00:01:40.670> to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
the 1940s I find this very hard to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.300 
the 1940s I find this very hard to
believe<00:01:41.079> because<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.350> technology<00:01:42.560> would<00:01:43.130> be

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
believe because the technology would be

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.899 
believe because the technology would be
beyond<00:01:43.999> them<00:01:44.590> but<00:01:45.590> if<00:01:45.799> time<00:01:46.280> machines<00:01:46.700> were

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
beyond them but if time machines were

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.719 
beyond them but if time machines were
developed<00:01:47.359> in<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.780> 1940s<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.770> could<00:01:49.310> explain

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
developed in the 1940s it could explain

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.929 
developed in the 1940s it could explain
the<00:01:49.789> UFOs<00:01:50.329> we<00:01:50.869> have<00:01:50.990> seen<00:01:51.289> in<00:01:51.590> our<00:01:52.039> skies<00:01:52.399> since

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
the UFOs we have seen in our skies since

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.700 
the UFOs we have seen in our skies since
