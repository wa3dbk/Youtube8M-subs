for<00:00:04.770> Team<00:00:04.920> USA<00:00:05.009> today<00:00:05.940> we're<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.240> talk

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
for Team USA today we're going to talk

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.270 
for Team USA today we're going to talk
about<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.720> importance<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.230> targeting<00:00:07.710> you

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
about the importance of targeting you

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.470 
about the importance of targeting you
know<00:00:08.400> not<00:00:08.580> only<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:08.940> important<00:00:09.269> just<00:00:09.389> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
know not only is it important just to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.089 
know not only is it important just to
have<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> target<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.500> when<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:10.740> start<00:00:10.800> to

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
have a target so that when we start to

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.919 
have a target so that when we start to
make<00:00:11.280> adjustments<00:00:11.429> either<00:00:12.120> left<00:00:12.509> or<00:00:12.690> right<00:00:12.750> on

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
make adjustments either left or right on

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:13.580 
make adjustments either left or right on
the<00:00:13.110> lane

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the lane

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.530 
the lane
we<00:00:14.070> know<00:00:14.280> kind<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.700> where<00:00:14.940> we're<00:00:15.210> targeting

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
we know kind of where we're targeting

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.060 
we know kind of where we're targeting
where<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:15.809> can<00:00:15.960> move<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.379> target<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.890> make

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
where we can move that target to make

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.920 
where we can move that target to make
that<00:00:17.279> adjustment<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:18.119> terms<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.600> hitting<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
that adjustment in terms of hitting the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.560 
that adjustment in terms of hitting the
pocket<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:19.859> also<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.820> distance<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.449> we're

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
pocket but also the distance that we're

quite making it up to the pocket
conversely<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:36.780> look<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.050> little<00:00:37.200> farther

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440

down the lane from our normal target if

down the lane from our normal target if
we<00:00:39.809> generally<00:00:40.200> target<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.590> arrows<00:00:40.770> maybe<00:00:41.160> two

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we generally target the arrows maybe two

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.280 
we generally target the arrows maybe two
or<00:00:41.579> three<00:00:41.790> feet<00:00:42.030> past<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> arrows<00:00:42.840> that's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
or three feet past the arrows that's

or three feet past the arrows that's
going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.590> let<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> balls<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> little

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
going to let the balls get a little

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.040 
going to let the balls get a little
farther<00:00:44.760> when<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> lanes<00:00:45.420> start<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.780> dry<00:00:46.020> out

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
farther when the lanes start to dry out

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
farther when the lanes start to dry out
and<00:00:46.500> should<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.430> ball<00:00:47.610> farther<00:00:47.910> down

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and should get your ball farther down

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.729 
and should get your ball farther down
the<00:00:48.239> lane<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:48.989> don't<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> move<00:00:49.559> as

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the lane so we don't have to move as

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.130 
the lane so we don't have to move as
much<00:00:49.920> left<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> right<00:00:50.579> laterally<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.930> Kim

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
much left to right laterally we have Kim

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
much left to right laterally we have Kim
here<00:00:52.350> today<00:00:52.590> she's<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.039> show<00:00:53.699> us<00:00:53.730> three

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
here today she's going to show us three

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.540 
here today she's going to show us three
shots<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:55.079> looking<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.800> her<00:00:55.890> general<00:00:56.219> target

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
shots one looking at her general target

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.979 
shots one looking at her general target
which<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> arrows<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
which is at the arrows and then one a

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.930 
which is at the arrows and then one a
little<00:00:58.170> closer<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.370> farther<00:00:59.730> down

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
little closer and then one farther down

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.400 
little closer and then one farther down
the<00:01:00.059> lane<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.480> we'll<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.719> how<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.930> changes

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the lane and we'll see how that changes

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.439 
the lane and we'll see how that changes
her<00:01:01.530> ball<00:01:01.739> reaction<00:01:02.190> here's<00:01:02.760> Kim<00:01:03.000> targeting

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
her ball reaction here's Kim targeting

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.910 
her ball reaction here's Kim targeting
where<00:01:03.570> she<00:01:03.719> normally<00:01:04.080> targets<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> at

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
where she normally targets which is at

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770 
where she normally targets which is at
the<00:01:05.070> arrows<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> ball

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the arrows and you can see as the ball

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.300 
the arrows and you can see as the ball
is<00:01:06.810> rolling<00:01:07.110> down<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.409> lane<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.979> doesn't

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
is rolling down the lane it just doesn't

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.800 
is rolling down the lane it just doesn't
quite<00:01:08.400> get<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> pocket<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> carry<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
quite get up to the pocket to carry the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
quite get up to the pocket to carry the
tenpin<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:10.860> we've<00:01:11.010> moved<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.280> target

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
tenpin so now we've moved the target

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.490 
tenpin so now we've moved the target
closer<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> foul<00:01:12.479> line<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:13.380> around

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
closer to the foul line right around

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.620 
closer to the foul line right around
where<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> dots<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.509> is

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
where the dots are so as you can see is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.910 
where the dots are so as you can see is
this<00:01:15.780> ball<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.110> rolling<00:01:16.350> down<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> lane<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
this ball is rolling down the lane it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.320 
this ball is rolling down the lane it
gets<00:01:17.070> into<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> roll<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.970> bit<00:01:18.090> quicker

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
gets into a roll a little bit quicker

that<00:01:21.119> Tenten<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.750> lastly<00:01:22.680> we've<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.159> moved

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
that Tenten and lastly we've now moved

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.039 
that Tenten and lastly we've now moved
the<00:01:23.520> target<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> couple<00:01:24.240> feet<00:01:24.390> past<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> arrows

the target a couple feet past the arrows
where<00:01:25.229> Kim<00:01:25.380> normally<00:01:25.799> targets<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.820> see

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
where Kim normally targets you can see

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.399 
where Kim normally targets you can see
as<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.210> ball<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.570> rolling<00:01:27.840> down<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> lane<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
as this ball is rolling down the lane it

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.020 
as this ball is rolling down the lane it
just<00:01:28.590> goes<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> little<00:01:28.979> bit<00:01:29.159> longer<00:01:29.430> doesn't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
just goes a little bit longer doesn't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.060 
just goes a little bit longer doesn't
quite<00:01:30.299> get<00:01:30.479> into<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.750> roll<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.290> comes<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.890> light

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
quite get into a roll and comes up light

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
quite get into a roll and comes up light
of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> pocket<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.509> remember<00:01:33.869> by<00:01:34.079> making

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
of the pocket so remember by making

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
of the pocket so remember by making
those<00:01:34.470> subtle<00:01:34.799> little<00:01:34.829> changes<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.520> terms<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
those subtle little changes in terms of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
those subtle little changes in terms of
the<00:01:35.909> distance<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.509> we're<00:01:36.689> looking<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the distance that we're looking on the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.899 
the distance that we're looking on the
lane<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.369> small<00:01:38.670> little

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
lane it can be that small little

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.789 
lane it can be that small little
fine-tuning<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.780> terms<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.170> ball<00:01:40.320> motion<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
fine-tuning in terms of ball motion that

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.710 
fine-tuning in terms of ball motion that
you<00:01:40.890> need<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.220> strike<00:01:41.460> consistently<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.600> have

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you need to strike consistently we have

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.569 
you need to strike consistently we have
our<00:01:42.840> normal<00:01:43.020> target<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.399> not

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
our normal target if that's just not

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.950 
our normal target if that's just not
quite<00:01:44.850> working<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.450> bring<00:01:45.689> our<00:01:45.810> eyes<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
quite working we can bring our eyes a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
quite working we can bring our eyes a
little<00:01:46.229> bit<00:01:46.350> closer<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.950> us<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.399> around<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
little bit closer to us more around the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.399 
little bit closer to us more around the
dots<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.540> should<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> ball<00:01:49.110> into<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
dots and that should get the ball into a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.620 
dots and that should get the ball into a
roll<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.130> sooner<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:51.149> conversely

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
roll a little bit sooner or conversely

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.090 
roll a little bit sooner or conversely
if<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> lanes<00:01:52.079> are<00:01:52.200> drying<00:01:52.439> out<00:01:52.649> we<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:52.950> bring

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
if the lanes are drying out we can bring

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.469 
if the lanes are drying out we can bring
our<00:01:53.220> target<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> little<00:01:53.700> bit<00:01:53.820> farther<00:01:54.119> down<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
our target a little bit farther down the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.330 
our target a little bit farther down the
lane<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:55.020> bit<00:01:55.350> longer<00:01:55.680> pass<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> arrows

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
lane a little bit longer pass the arrows

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.649 
lane a little bit longer pass the arrows
and<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.969> will<00:01:57.060> make<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> ball<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:57.509> farther

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
and that will make the ball go farther

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.209 
and that will make the ball go farther
down<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> lane<00:01:58.409> before<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.770> makes<00:01:58.890> its<00:01:59.100> turn

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
down the lane before it makes its turn

down the lane before it makes its turn
to<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.430> pocket
