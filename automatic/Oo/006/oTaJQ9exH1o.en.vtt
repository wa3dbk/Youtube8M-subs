00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.600
 new tutorial from me 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.950
 and today it's about the musket sound 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.080
 in napoleon gate 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.630
 since he thinks something 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.360
 sounds strange, however, I have from 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.920
 a subscribers get a place with 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.020
 the musket sound changes 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 if you have installed the mod 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 you play multiplayer too 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.930
 even ans while still working 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.359
 it only changes the muscles 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.189
 sound and how that with the mod 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:47.520
 I'll show you now in one 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:49.920
 small club so and then I hope that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.149
 the muscles sounded like it 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 and I would say now we go 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.829
 Just over to the tutorial where I can get you 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.140
 shows how to install this place what 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.699
 By the way, relatively easy me so should 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.500
 it also for people dealing with mods 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.039
 not too good know no problem 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.680
 his 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.270
 So then have fun with the tutorial 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.159
 and now we come to the right one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.540
 kind of tutorial namely to the point 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.250
 where I explain how her the mat 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.720
 Installed, you just go on 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.520
 the download link in the description 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 if you look at this page here 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 forwarded there you go to the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.640
 download button with this white arrow 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.400
 on the green background 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.759
 then the download of 7 mb starts 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.549
 big courage and skg to internet line 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.860
 take a little bit about ten seconds 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.689
 be sufficient for up to a minute 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.479
 in any case as soon as the motto down 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.310
 is loaded open the folder that 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.409
 I think that the file is the idea 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.780
 the upload downloads then you go on 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.280
 Computer there you open the hard disk 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.579
 have installed on the iss in my 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.649
 case c and like that to the left 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.110
 for the sake of an overview and so in any case 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.540
 then you go to the folder like steam 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.799
 have installed on 32 bit pcs 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.149
 Program to 64 bit pcs on program 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.380
 86 ps at mac I have worked 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.390
 honestly, no idea 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.820
 In any case , the double-click made 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.560
 then look for the optima people 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.929
 which pushes me a few times but 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.590
 will show you here steam then goes 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.890
 you up 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.269
 the maps will come to napoleon 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.840
 herb sausage can you again, therefore, 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.390
 search 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.550
 there would have to go okay then 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.470
 you just take the file here and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.599
 move them or copy them in 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.640
 you can order this data folder 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.379
 actually close everything with it 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.599
 just start as a team 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.790
 the projector start and you have the 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.129

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.330
 worked with you if it was not 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.709

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.849

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.470

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.260

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.130
