00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
we will put on the listing and this is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.139 
we will put on the listing and this is
the<00:00:36.540> price<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.260> brand<00:00:37.559> new<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:38.040> Japan<00:00:38.520> with

thirty nine thousand nine hundred yen
which<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.989> guess<00:00:43.320> pretty<00:00:43.590> close<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.980> five

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
which is I guess pretty close to five

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.040 
which is I guess pretty close to five
hundred<00:00:44.160> bucks<00:00:44.579> now<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.270> about<00:00:45.510> five<00:00:45.780> hundred

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
hundred bucks now so about five hundred

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.190 
hundred bucks now so about five hundred
dollars<00:00:46.350> worth<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.829> brand-new<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.989> use<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
dollars worth of brand-new and use the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.520 
dollars worth of brand-new and use the
course<00:00:50.059> someone<00:00:51.059> cheaper<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.989> throttle

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
course someone cheaper the throttle

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.040 
course someone cheaper the throttle
controller<00:00:52.890> performance<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.270> economy

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
controller performance and the economy

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.869 
controller performance and the economy
the<00:00:55.440> Eco<00:00:55.739> stands<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.219> economy<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the Eco stands for economy because it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.569 
the Eco stands for economy because it
also<00:00:57.000> has<00:00:57.210> an<00:00:57.360> economy<00:00:57.600> mode<00:00:58.020> as<00:00:58.890> sp1<00:00:59.609> sp2<00:01:00.170> sp3
