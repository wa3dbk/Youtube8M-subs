wins<00:01:12.940> it's<00:01:13.330> as<00:01:13.660> simple<00:01:13.810> as<00:01:14.080> that<00:01:14.140> now<00:01:14.980> at<00:01:15.160> this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
wins it's as simple as that now at this

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.510 
wins it's as simple as that now at this
point<00:01:15.730> stripes<00:01:16.720> is<00:01:17.080> closest<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.950> bobble<00:01:18.370> ball

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
point stripes is closest to bobble ball

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.500 
point stripes is closest to bobble ball
so<00:01:19.480> obviously<00:01:20.470> since<00:01:20.890> I'm<00:01:21.070> solids<00:01:21.610> I'm<00:01:21.760> trying

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
so obviously since I'm solids I'm trying

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.260 
so obviously since I'm solids I'm trying
to<00:01:22.690> either<00:01:23.500> kick<00:01:23.890> him<00:01:24.100> out<00:01:24.130> of<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.550> way<00:01:24.700> or

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
to either kick him out of the way or

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.870 
to either kick him out of the way or
kick<00:01:25.510> myself<00:01:25.750> closer<00:01:26.320> or<00:01:26.710> put<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.490> ball<00:01:27.670> that

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
kick myself closer or put the ball that

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:39.840 
kick myself closer or put the ball that
I'm<00:01:28.000> about<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.540> roll<00:01:29.370> closest<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:35.470> did<00:01:35.740> good

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.870 

nice<00:01:40.850> shot<00:01:41.150> okay<00:01:41.930> at<00:01:42.020> this<00:01:42.110> point<00:01:42.700> solids<00:01:43.700> is

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
nice shot okay at this point solids is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.500 
nice shot okay at this point solids is
still<00:01:44.150> closest<00:01:44.770> oops<00:01:45.940> use<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.120> wrong<00:01:47.270> angle

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
still closest oops use the wrong angle

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.630 
still closest oops use the wrong angle
on<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.260> that<00:01:48.710> happens<00:01:49.130> sometimes

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
on that and that happens sometimes

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.060 
on that and that happens sometimes
unfortunately<00:01:50.120> but<00:01:50.990> i<00:01:51.050> am<00:01:51.260> still<00:01:51.290> closest

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
unfortunately but i am still closest

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.610 
unfortunately but i am still closest
that<00:01:52.190> he's<00:01:52.370> rolling<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:53.000> last<00:01:53.270> ball<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.990> live

it back look at that he's nestled it in

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.469 
it back look at that he's nestled it in
between<00:01:57.110> two<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:58.040> his<00:01:58.130> stripes<00:01:58.970> now<00:01:59.210> this<00:01:59.360> is

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
between two of his stripes now this is

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.030 
between two of his stripes now this is
going<00:01:59.660> to<00:01:59.720> be<00:01:59.840> tough<00:02:00.080> for<00:02:00.290> me<00:02:00.440> because<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:00.680> can't

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
going to be tough for me because I can't

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.760 
going to be tough for me because I can't
really<00:02:01.280> hit<00:02:01.460> my<00:02:01.610> back<00:02:01.850> rail<00:02:02.210> anymore<00:02:02.750> but<00:02:03.740> i

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
really hit my back rail anymore but i

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.920 
really hit my back rail anymore but i
can<00:02:04.010> hit<00:02:04.160> my<00:02:04.340> two<00:02:04.400> ball<00:02:04.850> closer<00:02:05.210> let's<00:02:05.600> see<00:02:05.810> if

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930
