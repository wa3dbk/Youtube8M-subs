00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
here rocket red gold the regular bright

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.660 
here rocket red gold the regular bright
gold<00:02:15.870> maybe<00:02:16.319> that's<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.040> there<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.220> two

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670
