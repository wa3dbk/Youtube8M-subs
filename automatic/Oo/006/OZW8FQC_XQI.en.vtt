sort of a thing you're cooking it has a
lot<00:05:58.699> of<00:05:58.789> fat<00:05:58.999> on<00:05:59.179> top<00:05:59.589> what<00:06:00.589> you<00:06:00.619> do<00:06:00.799> these

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
lot of fat on top what you do these

things<00:06:01.129> are<00:06:01.219> made<00:06:01.399> of<00:06:01.519> like<00:06:01.669> Teflon<00:06:01.939> or

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
things are made of like Teflon or

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.959 
things are made of like Teflon or
something<00:06:02.779> so<00:06:03.649> they<00:06:03.769> don't<00:06:04.099> absorb<00:06:04.429> liquid

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969 
something so they don't absorb liquid

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.149 
something so they don't absorb liquid
but<00:06:05.209> they<00:06:05.299> obviously<00:06:05.389> the<00:06:05.929> fat<00:06:06.469> sticks<00:06:07.009> to
