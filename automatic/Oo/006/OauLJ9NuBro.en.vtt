 get ready for the big show 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.710
 created hannes wagner from munich 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.119
 one of the largest german 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.289
 junior talents and tennis yes I have 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.769
 2011 played a very good year 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.640
 I won two etf tournaments in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.800
 MÃ¶nchengladbach and in Switzerland 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.080
 I was nominated for the davis cup 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.300
 we are and finally to mexico 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.680
 flown 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 then i have the german championship 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.809
 won 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.360
 december that was not the highlight of the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.180
 This year I was very happy 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.020
 along with two more 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.760
 offspring hopes of the so-called 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.879
 draft teams of tennisbase Oberhaching 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.550
 the 16-year-old wants according to the whole 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.890
 make a big leap on the MTV tour 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.780
 though it is difficult with forecasts and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.820
 Of course, no injuries are allowed 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.079
 in between, for example, missed 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.730
 hannes for a shoulder injury 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.980
 this year the french open 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.940
 But the requirements are on everyone 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.500
 cases available 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.549
 as a pure one has several talents in the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.229
 physical area it is clear the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.840
 Coordination he is incredibly good at 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.689
 athletes so far very good 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.890
 endurance is technically good 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.540
 trained as far as the basics are concerned 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.340
 which is a huge advantage 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.439
 talent is too he goes with the stress 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 on the tour with the stress that the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.240
 Whole performance brings with it 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.110
 very good, of course, and packs very well 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.000
 all very well 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.979
 So these are the talent tractors 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.750
 from hannes tennis is called but right now in 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.710
 personal area on much too 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.900
 renounce 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.729
 mexico costa rica and italy croatia 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.920
 France and the Czech Republic 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.770
 that's just a little bit abstract 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.810
 hannes tournament plan this year and comes to it 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.590
 yes even the school visit this 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.340
 year a long-distance school and me 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.820
 train twice a day in between 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.649
 I do my homework and 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.969
 then a little bit more 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.390
 and then it does all very well 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.030
 and a book of Wagner 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.370
 despite already great successes amazing 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.530
 and fortunately totally normal 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.720
 teenagers remained for him too 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.480
 his current trainer to graduate only 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.470
 praising words finds 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.450
 First , we have to say that we 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.360
 Of course here is a team of trainers 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.790
 are working together 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.040
 it has many years also hometrainer in the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.290
 had the frank pokorny that are 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.100
 People you should not forget 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.770
 Certainly it is the trade 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.239
 have been very close for many years now 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.010
 work together and it is always whole 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.570
 great if someone develops that way 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.370
 it is clearly not important that the 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.030
 athletes are doing well 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.580
 develop further and that pleases also completely 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.830
 especially is just a great guy 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.690
 away from the tennis court also and that 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.820
 is it clear if so room so the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.950
 name heinz wagner before 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.830
 maybe in three four years' time 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.830
 regularly from politics on the tour
