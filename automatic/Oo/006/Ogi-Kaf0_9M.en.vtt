00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.600
 viewers Alek ww Rick not generally right away 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.920
 get down to business card 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.420
 big card is big on it a lot 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.199
 technicians present aircraft and helicopter 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.900
 and tanks also btras 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.530
 well i it turns out three cards out of four 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.390
 ten is intended for technology only 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.189
 one infantry card very much 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.180
 reminds 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.420
 co-op card if anyone at all 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.979
 played it from bf3 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.140
 the very first where they started by helicopter 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.320
 here flew here between such two on 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.689
 mountains and then the shooter and the driver 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.000
 killed there on the field shorter than infantry 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.159
 then there every anti-aircraft guns easier well you 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.550
 Straight very much reminded principle 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:35.500
 The card is quite good, it is in moderation. 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.510
 beautiful but she is so gray is obtained 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.720
 it is somewhat similar to communication channel c 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.580
 gray nebula here's a channel but all 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.350
 since no one understood everything from battlefield 3 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.050
 we compare the same of 23 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:53.970
 all locations brown water all this 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.560
 dirt is very much like the ears and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.360
 also if any barges that cost 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.340
 very very cool to be 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.500
 play a sniper on this map here a lot 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.619
 where can you sit down 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.330
 also here i'm also missing here 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.670
 levolution and bomber present 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.950
 which we talked about in each series and 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.210
 probably here we will not miss it again 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.980
 do not miss a couple of rockets 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.830
 to show what's here and now 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.030
 defibrillators right now I 'll kill you understand 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:28.680
 I'll be flying in general in general in 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.680
 overall it turns out that the map 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.160
 map here I’ve been flying okay saying that 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.260
 you can still say something than you can 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.930
 say infantry technique basically here 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.520
 she is such if the first is trained 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.260
 the first two cards they were purely for 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.840
 technology 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.410
 the third card was for infantry here she 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.970
 everything is balanced here and the infantry where 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.000
 there is a junk roam and technology then 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.020
 there is a button not very much but enough 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.620
 all in digging 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.450
 buildings all these rocks principle for 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.470
 infantry battles where are you the same technique 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.730
 because of the open fields of the technician and 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.140
 there is no cargo here by the way 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.150
 a helicopter that is a little sad 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.510
 transport worker here I have not looked by the way 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.130
 need to show here now you have tobi 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.709
 Hordes have a viper and Chinese counterpart 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.470
 viper to which as the moment more 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.850
 beautiful often reminds important 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.820
 not present here also 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.840
 Jet Ski Motorcycle Tank Machine 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.239
 one zenith a and btr is missing yet 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.840
 helicopter and twice then and the plane 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.000
 bomber here is not a bomber 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.580
 how do you call it right now 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.049
 I will look so shock aircraft here exact 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.260
 hitting the plane is missing the total of all 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.799
 cards from this add-on they are in 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.799
 no principle 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.630
 now i'm flying i'm gonna show you all the top 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.790
 what it looks like spect map such 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.820
 You would say that the most beautiful but 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:12.520
 not bad not bad 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:15.430
 I'll very playable even thy dwelling 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.450
 I do not see the yard. you made new glitch 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.570
 in fact 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.730
 personally little helicopter yes you can 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.850
 ass you stick in any part 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.650
 surface and fly backwards and you will 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.040
 swing sharply forward while doing so 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.700
 the helicopter will not get helpful but 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.320
 lipstick you too would not seem to be yes 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.600
 The most interesting of their friend only you above 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.850
 crashing into a destructible object which 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.390
 possesses any destructibility you 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.510
 Immediately you get very strong damage 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.210
 I know because you were not in battle 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.370
 what it doesn’t work out the most 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.930
 the interesting thing is that this is the only one 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.190
 map where point c is not at all 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.220
 it is highlighted the most ugly 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.320
 most ordinary card ok this was it 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.950
 was flawless I went out is created and 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.580
 crushed a shield hop and fast b3 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.620
 battlefield 4 welcome what else to say to them 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.410
 at least in the battlefield is an attack on 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.020
 point c this scorer bomber 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.800
 as in all other cards now we 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.470
 his calls 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.750
 our tradition and while i'm calling 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.530
 I will say because the movie is already approaching the end 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.440
 that 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:33.040
 that if you want to know how 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.410
 run the battlefield about the sea and tea on 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.200
 rating come on come on show me 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.180
 blocker can be called even if. 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.919

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.830
 running from and its side just below i 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:51.610

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:54.400

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:59.710
 Unfortunately not because I do not see.

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.319
 trees kick and 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.179

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.270
 three because recently this could 

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:20.979
 In general, if you want to run a tea 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.990
 raising if you have before order 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:26.740
 but not premium but because you 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:30.069
 greedy or poor as i can 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.099
 see the guide on how to run how 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.449
 run that and tear down the tea Rising to 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:38.709
 December 17th 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:41.499

 Now did the same stati 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:57.699
 bomber got off at all and ziyad 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.709
 two shots made it exploded this 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.899

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:10.629
 the rest of the cards it was the last review 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:12.399

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:17.680
 I don’t have anything special 

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:18.819
 she is the easiest to stand out 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.349
 nothing special 

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:22.329
 if there was a levolution manner 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:24.189
