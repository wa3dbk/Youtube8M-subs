00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:08.549 
so we're taking off obviously from

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.449 
so we're taking off obviously from
runway<00:00:08.969> to<00:00:09.120> 8:00<00:00:09.450> at<00:00:09.719> Alicante<00:00:10.469> today<00:00:10.770> and<00:00:11.280> we

runway to 8:00 at Alicante today and we

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:12.920 
runway to 8:00 at Alicante today and we
would<00:00:11.549> say<00:00:11.730> after<00:00:11.820> pushback

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
would say after pushback

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.920 
would say after pushback
we'll<00:00:13.350> be<00:00:13.590> expecting<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:14.549> exit<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:15.299> apron<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
we'll be expecting to exit the apron and

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.120 
we'll be expecting to exit the apron and
on<00:00:16.230> touching<00:00:16.470> down<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> delta<00:00:18.619> -<00:00:19.619> via

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
on touching down in a delta - via

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.999 
on touching down in a delta - via
Charlie<00:00:20.550> six<00:00:20.849> and<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.960> enter<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.740> runway

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
Charlie six and then to enter the runway

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.689 
Charlie six and then to enter the runway
by<00:00:23.189> Charlie<00:00:23.580> seven<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:24.089> twenty<00:00:24.390> or<00:00:24.660> Charlie<00:00:25.169> a

by Charlie seven or twenty or Charlie a
that<00:00:26.699> takes<00:00:26.999> us<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.990> departure<00:00:28.740> itself

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
that takes us on to the departure itself

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.999 
that takes us on to the departure itself
basically<00:00:29.999> is<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.509> good<00:00:30.810> pictorial<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
basically is a good pictorial of the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
basically is a good pictorial of the
train<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> area<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.300> we're<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.870> do

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
train in the area and we're going to do

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.740 
train in the area and we're going to do
the<00:00:34.440> Astro<00:00:35.100> Sri<00:00:35.340> delta<00:00:35.820> which<00:00:36.180> basically<00:00:36.539> will

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the Astro Sri delta which basically will

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
the Astro Sri delta which basically will
take<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> straight<00:00:37.379> head<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.430> back<00:00:38.670> on

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
take the straight head and then back on

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.119 
take the straight head and then back on
this<00:00:39.059> routine<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.109> see<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.739> salient

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
this routine and you can see the salient

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.860 
this routine and you can see the salient
point<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.460> we've<00:00:41.879> got<00:00:42.000> high<00:00:42.239> ground<00:00:42.600> right

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
point here we've got high ground right

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.869 
point here we've got high ground right
in<00:00:43.170> front<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.559> us<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.100> we'll<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.460> later<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
in front of us and we'll see later that

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
in front of us and we'll see later that
we<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.270> lose<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.600> engine<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.289> obviously

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
we do lose an engine and obviously

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.229 
we do lose an engine and obviously
they're<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> turn<00:00:47.579> will<00:00:47.760> take<00:00:47.910> us<00:00:48.030> away

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
they're going to turn will take us away

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.490 
they're going to turn will take us away
from<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.449> ground<00:00:48.840> they're<00:00:49.019> bringing<00:00:49.410> us

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
from that ground they're bringing us

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.290 
from that ground they're bringing us
back<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:49.859> south<00:00:50.100> away<00:00:50.550> from<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:50.940> trains

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
back to the south away from the trains

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.020 
back to the south away from the trains
the<00:00:51.539> bigger<00:00:51.719> she<00:00:51.930> returns

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the bigger she returns

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.930 
the bigger she returns
so<00:00:54.660> once<00:00:55.110> lined<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:55.680> runway<00:00:56.190> expecting

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
so once lined up on the runway expecting

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.360 
so once lined up on the runway expecting
a<00:00:56.970> flat<00:00:57.180> five<00:00:57.450> departure<00:00:58.160> accelerating<00:00:59.160> down

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
a flat five departure accelerating down

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.640 
a flat five departure accelerating down
the<00:00:59.550> runway<00:00:59.850> if<00:01:00.540> we<00:01:00.720> get<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> beat<00:01:01.110> beat<00:01:01.350> beat

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
the runway if we get a beat beat beat

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.990 
the runway if we get a beat beat beat
they're<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.489> same<00:01:02.640> configuration

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
they're not the same configuration

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.990 
they're not the same configuration
warning<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.379> I'll<00:01:04.530> reject<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.949> take-off<00:01:05.370> if

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
warning and so I'll reject a take-off if

warning and so I'll reject a take-off if
we<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> beat<00:01:06.600> beat<00:01:06.870> feet<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.590> air<00:01:07.620> and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
we get a beat beat feet in the air and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.730 
we get a beat beat feet in the air and
we're<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.760> 10,000<00:01:09.450> feet<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.320> assume<00:01:10.590> it's

we're of 10,000 feet then we assume it's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the problem and we'll do any memory

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.850 
the problem and we'll do any memory
reads<00:01:38.460> items<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:39.509> required<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.770> an

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
reads items as required but there is an

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.290 
reads items as required but there is an
emergency<00:01:41.070> turn<00:01:41.369> today<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.940> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.119> all

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
emergency turn today and this is all

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.520 
emergency turn today and this is all
gonna<00:01:42.509> happen<00:01:42.630> very<00:01:42.960> quickly

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
gonna happen very quickly

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
gonna happen very quickly
so<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.039> may<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.580> we'll<00:01:44.910> follow<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> roads

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
so it may be that we'll follow the roads

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.210 
so it may be that we'll follow the roads
in<00:01:45.600> turn<00:01:45.780> initially<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:46.710> we'll<00:01:46.860> look<00:01:47.009> at

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
in turn initially and then we'll look at

00:01:47.220 --> 00:02:11.589 
in turn initially and then we'll look at
the<00:01:47.399> unknown<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> items
