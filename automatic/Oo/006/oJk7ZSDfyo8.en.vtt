00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
little tutorial or showing of how to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
little tutorial or showing of how to
make<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> rapid<00:00:36.300> fire<00:00:36.450> dispenser<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.260> I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
make like a rapid fire dispenser and I

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.500 
make like a rapid fire dispenser and I
have<00:00:38.969> two<00:00:39.180> versions<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.510> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
have two versions of it right here that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.030 
have two versions of it right here that
one<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.440> fast<00:00:43.770> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
one as you can see is really fast that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.110 
one as you can see is really fast that
one's<00:00:44.480> slower<00:00:45.620> but<00:00:46.620> uh<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.250> works<00:00:49.879> let's<00:00:50.879> put

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
one's slower but uh it works let's put

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.270 
one's slower but uh it works let's put
it<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:52.140> put<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:52.770> right

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
it like that and then put this one right

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.029 
it like that and then put this one right
here<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.289> don't<00:00:55.289> know<00:00:55.440> no<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.739> there

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
here I don't know no right there

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.200 
here I don't know no right there
right<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.770> first<00:00:58.770> off<00:00:59.010> let<00:00:59.910> me<00:01:00.000> get

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
right there and first off let me get

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
right there and first off let me get
some<00:01:00.390> snowballs<00:01:04.070> put<00:01:05.070> some<00:01:05.220> snowballs<00:01:05.580> in

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
some snowballs put some snowballs in

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.240 
some snowballs put some snowballs in
there<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.420> snowballs<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.080> um<00:01:07.920> with

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
there some snowballs in there um with

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.660 
there some snowballs in there um with
this<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.810> very<00:01:10.020> fast<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.670> it's

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
this one it's not very fast but it's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.030 
this one it's not very fast but it's
enough<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.990> repetitive<00:01:13.439> it'll<00:01:13.890> keep

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
enough it's it's repetitive it'll keep

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.690 
enough it's it's repetitive it'll keep
going<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> that's<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.340> no<00:01:17.520> one's

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
going so that's that's that one no one's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.170 
going so that's that's that one no one's
not<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:18.810> fast<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> other<00:01:20.850> hand

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
not not fast this one on the other hand

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
not not fast this one on the other hand
you<00:01:21.570> can't<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.229> connect<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.799> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you can't just connect it like that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.670 
you can't just connect it like that
otherwise<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:23.970> shoots<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
otherwise it just shoots one or two at a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.880 
otherwise it just shoots one or two at a
time<00:01:26.330> you<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> hook<00:01:28.710> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
time you actually have to hook a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.620 
time you actually have to hook a
repeater<00:01:29.220> up<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.909> it'll<00:01:30.090> keep<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> tick

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
repeater up to it so it'll keep the tick

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.069 
repeater up to it so it'll keep the tick
and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.590> there<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.130> goes<00:01:32.329> it's<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.390> fast

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and then there it goes it's really fast

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.670 
and then there it goes it's really fast
as<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:35.119> where<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.390> arrows<00:01:36.960> right

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
as you can see where the arrows right

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.580 
as you can see where the arrows right
there<00:01:37.890> yep<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
there yep and you can go like that and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.480 
there yep and you can go like that and
it<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.100> keeps<00:01:41.430> firing<00:01:41.670> them<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:43.399> when<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it just keeps firing them and when the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.330 
it just keeps firing them and when the
1.5<00:01:45.000> update<00:01:45.420> comes<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.810> you'll<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.619> able<00:01:46.710> yeah

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340

be able to aim dispensers and so you'll
be<00:01:51.119> able<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.600> shoot<00:01:52.320> many<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.189> these<00:01:53.280> at<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.729> time

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
be able to shoot many of these at a time

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.850 
be able to shoot many of these at a time
but<00:01:55.890> yeah<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:57.380> that's<00:01:58.380> how<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.619> make<00:01:58.829> a
