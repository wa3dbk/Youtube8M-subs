a<00:05:27.620> are<00:05:29.060> pole<00:05:30.060> which<00:05:30.690> took<00:05:31.080> about<00:05:31.440> 20<00:05:32.099> minutes

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 
a are pole which took about 20 minutes

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.670 
a are pole which took about 20 minutes
of<00:05:32.610> cutting<00:05:33.180> each<00:05:33.419> of<00:05:33.659> the<00:05:33.780> pull-up<00:05:34.229> because

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
of cutting each of the pull-up because

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:53.810

put it up there and and try to
straighten<00:05:59.670> out<00:06:00.030> I<00:06:00.210> don't<00:06:00.420> really<00:06:00.570> care<00:06:00.870> right

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
now and then what you're going to do is

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.180 
now and then what you're going to do is
just<00:06:03.920> cut<00:06:04.920> out<00:06:05.100> your<00:06:05.490> inside<00:06:06.240> piece<00:06:06.620> and<00:06:07.620> then

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
just cut out your inside piece and then

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.070 
just cut out your inside piece and then
just<00:06:08.610> get<00:06:08.820> more<00:06:09.060> phone<00:06:11.300> phone<00:06:12.300> tape<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:12.960> then

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.980 

like<00:06:22.250> this<00:06:24.040> now<00:06:25.040> it<00:06:25.220> just<00:06:25.250> kind<00:06:25.639> of<00:06:25.820> looks<00:06:26.000> 3d

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
like this now it just kind of looks 3d

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.900

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
yes then you can so that's pretty much

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.200 
yes then you can so that's pretty much
how<00:06:59.630> you<00:06:59.660> do<00:06:59.870> it<00:06:59.990> so<00:07:00.650> if<00:07:01.039> you<00:07:01.220> want<00:07:01.430> more<00:07:01.639> detail

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
how you do it so if you want more detail

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.750 
you can get you can cut more of the card
that<00:07:05.419> you<00:07:05.630> do<00:07:05.900> think<00:07:06.410> that<00:07:06.710> will<00:07:07.580> have<00:07:07.729> a

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
that you do think that will have a

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.230 
that you do think that will have a
better<00:07:08.060> effect<00:07:08.270> on<00:07:08.750> the<00:07:08.840> 3d<00:07:09.320> so<00:07:10.160> like<00:07:10.400> my

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
better effect on the 3d so like my

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.969 
better effect on the 3d so like my
button<00:07:11.690> I<00:07:12.070> did<00:07:13.070> cut<00:07:13.340> up<00:07:13.460> the<00:07:13.669> extra<00:07:14.090> eyes<00:07:14.330> and

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:14.979 
button I did cut up the extra eyes and

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:18.550 
button I did cut up the extra eyes and
the<00:07:15.979> nose<00:07:16.220> which<00:07:16.580> gave<00:07:17.510> him<00:07:17.690> more<00:07:18.080> of<00:07:18.260> the

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
the nose which gave him more of the

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.980 
the nose which gave him more of the
effect<00:07:19.010> of<00:07:19.220> being<00:07:19.720> 3d<00:07:21.280> so<00:07:22.300> the<00:07:23.300> more<00:07:23.510> layer<00:07:23.720> you

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
effect of being 3d so the more layer you

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.260 
effect of being 3d so the more layer you
have<00:07:24.199> the<00:07:24.440> probably<00:07:24.919> the<00:07:25.130> better<00:07:25.340> artwork<00:07:25.970> um

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
have the probably the better artwork um

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.680 
have the probably the better artwork um
