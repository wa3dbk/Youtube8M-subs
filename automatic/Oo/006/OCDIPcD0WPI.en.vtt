review this base and I'm gonna bring you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
review this base and I'm gonna bring you
a<00:00:52.590> few<00:00:52.800> replays<00:00:53.219> today<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> want<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
a few replays today but I want to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.670 
a few replays today but I want to
discuss<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> look<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.289> when<00:00:55.649> choosing

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
discuss what to look for when choosing

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.910

where<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.760> attack<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.420> base<00:00:57.660> from<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.800> have

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
where to attack a base from so you have

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.010 
where to attack a base from so you have
a<00:00:58.949> townhall<00:00:59.430> centralized<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.570> now<00:01:00.870> this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
a townhall centralized here now this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.139 
a townhall centralized here now this
works<00:01:01.289> against<00:01:01.710> non<00:01:01.890> max<00:01:02.219> basis<00:01:02.609> obviously

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
works against non max basis obviously

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.670 
works against non max basis obviously
but<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> first<00:01:03.809> thing<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.049> want<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> note<00:01:04.439> eight

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
but the first thing I want to note eight

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.190 
but the first thing I want to note eight
is<00:01:04.860> where<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> clan<00:01:06.330> castle<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.869> Archer

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
Queen and where are the expose obviously

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
Queen and where are the expose obviously

breakers<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:03.060> deploying<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.659> wizards

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
breakers so when deploying the wizards

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.499 
breakers so when deploying the wizards
make<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> huge<00:02:04.920> long<00:02:05.310> line<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.640> wizards<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
finger down the device and then you

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.770 
finger down the device and then you
bring<00:02:11.710> plenty<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.340> wallbreakers<00:02:13.150> because

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
bring plenty of wallbreakers because

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.780 
bring plenty of wallbreakers because

cloak at all yet so this is voting

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.550 
cloak at all yet so this is voting
pretty<00:02:57.700> well<00:02:57.970> now<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.600> strategy<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.350> very

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
pretty well now this strategy is very

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.250 
pretty well now this strategy is very
effective<00:03:00.490> guys<00:03:00.730> go<00:03:01.360> ahead<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.720> try<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:01.990> when

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
effective guys go ahead and try it when

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.320 
effective guys go ahead and try it when
you<00:03:02.410> get<00:03:02.590> comfortable<00:03:02.860> with<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:03.790> really

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
you get comfortable with it it's really

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.270 
you get comfortable with it it's really
hard<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.810> lose<00:03:04.990> a<00:03:05.050> base<00:03:05.410> even<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:06.130> they're

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
hard to lose a base even if they're

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.370 
hard to lose a base even if they're
against<00:03:06.790> weird<00:03:07.120> bases<00:03:07.570> like<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:07.930> bases<00:03:08.320> you

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
against weird bases like this bases you

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.220 
against weird bases like this bases you
don't<00:03:08.560> see<00:03:08.770> necessarily<00:03:08.980> every<00:03:09.910> day<00:03:10.120> now<00:03:10.750> at

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
but when you use this and you really

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.940 
but when you use this and you really
assess<00:03:39.640> a<00:03:39.670> base<00:03:40.200> it's<00:03:41.200> hard<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.560> lose<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.860> this

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
assess a base it's hard to lose it this

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.610 
assess a base it's hard to lose it this
strategy<00:03:42.370> if<00:03:42.540> executed<00:03:43.540> well<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:44.140> know<00:03:44.260> this

outside<00:04:32.659> of<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.020> base<00:04:33.169> so<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:33.979> can<00:04:34.189> afford

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
outside of the base so you can afford

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.879 
outside of the base so you can afford
for<00:04:34.759> a<00:04:35.030> little<00:04:35.330> hiccup<00:04:35.930> here<00:04:36.229> and<00:04:36.409> there<00:04:36.650> with

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
me all it does is stall the attack when

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.480 
me all it does is stall the attack when
the<00:04:52.729> lava<00:04:53.120> hound<00:04:53.419> in<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:54.080> maclean<00:04:54.770> castle<00:04:55.250> it
