the<00:02:33.150> main<00:02:33.330> thing<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.680> want<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.890> get<00:02:35.010> rid<00:02:35.069> of

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the main thing I just want to get rid of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.430 
the main thing I just want to get rid of
that<00:02:35.340> caliber<00:02:35.760> either<00:02:35.940> most<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.330> all<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.599> then

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
that caliber either most of all and then

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.619 
that caliber either most of all and then
he<00:02:38.129> lost<00:02:38.310> control<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.730> his<00:02:38.819> chariots<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.450> that

he lost control of his chariots and that

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.470 
he lost control of his chariots and that
pretty<00:02:39.840> much<00:02:39.959> sucked<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.940> main<00:02:42.090> battle<00:02:42.390> is

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
pretty much sucked so the main battle is

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.610 
pretty much sucked so the main battle is
about<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.690> start<00:02:43.019> over<00:02:43.200> here<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.440> see

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
about to start over here you can see

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.089 
about to start over here you can see
it's<00:02:46.800> pretty<00:02:47.010> epic<00:02:48.590> family-type<00:02:49.590> man<00:02:49.860> going

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
it's pretty epic family-type man going

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.000 
it's pretty epic family-type man going
in<00:02:50.250> Levi<00:02:50.760> spearmen<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:54.019> we<00:02:55.019> got<00:02:55.170> some<00:02:55.470> light

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
in Levi spearmen and we got some light

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.860 
in Levi spearmen and we got some light
Lancers<00:02:56.430> chasing<00:02:56.879> after<00:02:57.000> what's<00:02:57.330> left<00:02:57.629> and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
Lancers chasing after what's left and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.190 
Lancers chasing after what's left and
then<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:59.150> was<00:03:00.150> using<00:03:00.330> these<00:03:00.540> guys<00:03:00.810> over<00:03:01.049> here

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
then I was using these guys over here

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.900 
then I was using these guys over here
and<00:03:01.410> trying<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.650> maneuver<00:03:01.920> against<00:03:02.760> these

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and trying to maneuver against these

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.620 
and trying to maneuver against these
hoplites<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.730> seemed<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> work<00:03:06.150> out<00:03:06.450> because

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
hoplites it seemed to work out because

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.699 
hoplites it seemed to work out because
they<00:03:06.840> routed<00:03:07.230> over<00:03:08.209> here<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.390> thought<00:03:09.989> hey

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
they routed over here I thought hey

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.710 
they routed over here I thought hey
maybe<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:11.130> shouldn't<00:03:11.640> let<00:03:11.760> these<00:03:11.940> guys<00:03:12.180> destroy

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
maybe I shouldn't let these guys destroy

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.839 
maybe I shouldn't let these guys destroy
my<00:03:12.959> guys<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.500> realized<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.430> was<00:03:14.579> getting

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
my guys I realized that I was getting

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.500 
my guys I realized that I was getting
owned<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.560> backed<00:03:16.829> them<00:03:17.010> away<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:18.709> then<00:03:19.709> I

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
owned so I backed them away and then I

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.690 
owned so I backed them away and then I
tried<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.660> maneuver<00:03:21.900> around<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:25.489> because<00:03:26.489> I

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
tried to maneuver around it because I

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.979 
tried to maneuver around it because I
knew<00:03:26.849> I'd<00:03:27.000> have<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.329> get<00:03:27.480> rid<00:03:27.599> of<00:03:27.690> those<00:03:27.780> guys

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
knew I'd have to get rid of those guys

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.030 
knew I'd have to get rid of those guys

remaining<00:06:37.810> so<00:06:38.810> you<00:06:39.470> might<00:06:39.590> ask<00:06:39.860> me<00:06:40.010> why<00:06:40.550> did

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
remaining so you might ask me why did

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.030 
remaining so you might ask me why did
you<00:06:41.000> let<00:06:41.180> them<00:06:41.450> have<00:06:41.690> less<00:06:41.930> than<00:06:41.960> you<00:06:42.320> well<00:06:42.860> the

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040 
you let them have less than you well the

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.710 
you let them have less than you well the
reason<00:06:43.160> I<00:06:43.400> did<00:06:43.580> that<00:06:43.610> is<00:06:43.760> because<00:06:44.030> they<00:06:44.480> had

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
reason I did that is because they had

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.990 
reason I did that is because they had
some<00:06:44.930> upgrades<00:06:45.410> and<00:06:45.650> those<00:06:46.340> upgrades<00:06:46.790> should

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
some upgrades and those upgrades should

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.880 
some upgrades and those upgrades should
have<00:06:47.120> been<00:06:47.210> sufficient<00:06:47.510> enough<00:06:48.020> because<00:06:48.590> also

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
have been sufficient enough because also

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.510 
have been sufficient enough because also
they<00:06:49.490> were<00:06:49.550> on<00:06:49.820> hard<00:06:50.060> difficulty<00:06:50.470> now<00:06:51.520> the

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
they were on hard difficulty now the

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.550 
they were on hard difficulty now the
reason<00:06:52.670> i<00:06:52.880> can't<00:06:53.120> play<00:06:53.240> online<00:06:53.420> is<00:06:53.840> cuz<00:06:54.200> when<00:06:54.530> i

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
reason i can't play online is cuz when i

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.880 
reason i can't play online is cuz when i
