hey<00:00:00.329> it's<00:00:00.510> kyle<00:00:00.780> guess<00:00:01.199> what<00:00:01.380> i'm<00:00:01.500> walking

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
hey it's kyle guess what i'm walking

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.760 
hey it's kyle guess what i'm walking
again<00:00:02.480> this<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.600> what<00:00:03.750> I'm<00:00:03.840> talking<00:00:03.870> about

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.360 

steady-state<00:00:08.269> cardio<00:00:10.010> wall<00:00:11.010> you're<00:00:11.219> an

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
steady-state cardio wall you're an

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.900 
steady-state cardio wall you're an
adaption<00:00:12.000> phase<00:00:12.540> two<00:00:12.870> ketosis<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.860> not<00:00:14.700> so

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
adaption phase two ketosis is not so

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
adaption phase two ketosis is not so
great<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.389> checked<00:00:16.320> my<00:00:16.440> blood<00:00:16.650> glucose<00:00:17.930> day

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
great I checked my blood glucose day

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.349 
great I checked my blood glucose day
before<00:00:19.289> yesterday<00:00:19.490> and<00:00:21.410> it<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:23.160> 90<00:00:23.609> 91

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
before yesterday and it was like 90 91

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.740 
before yesterday and it was like 90 91
which<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.740> relatively<00:00:26.279> low<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.449> it's<00:00:27.599> not

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
which is relatively low but it's not

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.560 
which is relatively low but it's not
those<00:00:27.960> keto<00:00:28.320> numbers<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:29.160> i<00:00:29.429> need<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> i

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.650 

made<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> couple<00:00:33.899> changes<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:35.820> everything<00:00:36.630> that

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
made a couple changes to everything that

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.860 
made a couple changes to everything that
i<00:00:36.809> ate<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.500> how<00:00:38.430> i<00:00:38.460> timed<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.120> my<00:00:39.300> meals<00:00:39.540> that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
i ate and how i timed out my meals that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.670 
i ate and how i timed out my meals that
day<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:41.420> checked<00:00:42.420> my<00:00:42.480> blood<00:00:42.719> glucose<00:00:43.200> again

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
day and checked my blood glucose again

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.040 
day and checked my blood glucose again
at<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> same<00:00:44.250> time<00:00:44.780> this<00:00:45.780> morning<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:47.030> I<00:00:48.050> was

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
at the same time this morning and I was

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.760 
at the same time this morning and I was
down<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.260> 75<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:52.250> actually<00:00:53.300> got<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.770> ketone

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
down to 75 and I actually got a ketone

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
down to 75 and I actually got a ketone
reading<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:56.520> only<00:00:57.149> point<00:00:57.660> five<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.320> it's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
reading it was only point five but it's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.189 
reading it was only point five but it's
still<00:00:58.620> something<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:01.309> I'm<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.640> saying<00:01:03.199> hang

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
still something so I'm just saying hang

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.310 
still something so I'm just saying hang
in<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:05.420> everything<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.689> trial<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.140> error

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
in there everything is trial and error

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.740 
in there everything is trial and error
you<00:01:07.560> need<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> lot<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.330> experimentation<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
you need a lot of experimentation and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.010 
you need a lot of experimentation and
this<00:01:10.619> doesn't<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.280> apply<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.020> ketosis

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
this doesn't just apply to ketosis

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.640 
this doesn't just apply to ketosis
eating<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:15.110> whatever<00:01:16.110> you're<00:01:16.380> trying<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
eating this is whatever you're trying to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.499 
eating this is whatever you're trying to
do<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:19.110> know<00:01:19.229> make<00:01:19.640> make<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:20.850> decisions

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
do and you know make make your decisions

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.830 
do and you know make make your decisions
in<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.689> change<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.200> smart<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:24.750> is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
in your change is smart and this is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
in your change is smart and this is
where<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:24.990> talk<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.259> you've<00:01:26.009> got<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.250> be

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
where I talk about you've got to be

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.249 
where I talk about you've got to be
honest<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.759> yourself<00:01:28.759> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.200> had<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
honest with yourself you know I had to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.020 
honest with yourself you know I had to
be<00:01:31.350> honest<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.680> myself<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.640> had<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
be honest with myself that I had to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.929 
be honest with myself that I had to
chill<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:34.100> my<00:01:35.100> training<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.579> little<00:01:35.610> bit

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
chill out with my training a little bit

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.490 
chill out with my training a little bit
that<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.049> change<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.530> made<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:39.500> just

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that was one change that I made and just

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.060 
that was one change that I made and just
to<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:42.470> experiment<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.560> something<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
to kind of experiment with something I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.499 
to kind of experiment with something I
am<00:01:46.130> changed<00:01:47.130> my<00:01:47.310> fiber<00:01:47.579> supplementation

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
am changed my fiber supplementation

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.310 
am changed my fiber supplementation
because<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.530> take<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> fiber<00:01:50.130> supplement<00:01:51.320> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
because I do take a fiber supplement and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.399 
because I do take a fiber supplement and
I<00:01:53.100> wasn't<00:01:53.430> sure<00:01:53.700> exactly<00:01:54.450> what<00:01:55.079> was<00:01:55.200> going

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I wasn't sure exactly what was going

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.639 
I wasn't sure exactly what was going
into<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:57.049> over<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> counter<00:01:58.700> like

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
into it it was a over the counter like

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.920 
into it it was a over the counter like
pre-mixed<00:02:01.880> soluble<00:02:02.880> insoluble<00:02:03.750> fiber<00:02:04.909> blend

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
pre-mixed soluble insoluble fiber blend

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.150 
pre-mixed soluble insoluble fiber blend
but<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> did<00:02:07.950> was<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.509> mixed<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.629> my<00:02:09.720> own

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
but what I did was I mixed up my own

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.680 
but what I did was I mixed up my own
like<00:02:11.160> hundred<00:02:11.550> percent<00:02:11.849> insoluble<00:02:12.209> fiber

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
like hundred percent insoluble fiber

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.340 
like hundred percent insoluble fiber
blend

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
blend

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.490 
blend
and<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:14.690> mean<00:02:15.690> at<00:02:15.840> least<00:02:15.990> gave<00:02:16.320> me<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and I mean at least gave me the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.920 
and I mean at least gave me the
confidence<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.760> moving<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> right

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
confidence that I'm moving in the right

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.010 
confidence that I'm moving in the right
direction<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.800> if<00:02:20.610> anything<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.540> supplement

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
direction and if anything the supplement

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.400 
direction and if anything the supplement
itself<00:02:22.680> actually<00:02:23.490> is<00:02:23.850> making<00:02:24.180> making<00:02:25.050> me<00:02:25.230> feel

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
itself actually is making making me feel

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.330 
itself actually is making making me feel
better<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.700> got<00:02:27.330> pretty<00:02:27.600> good<00:02:27.660> results<00:02:28.170> from

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
better I got pretty good results from

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.590 
better I got pretty good results from
from<00:02:29.340> switching<00:02:29.580> my<00:02:29.910> my<00:02:30.330> fiber

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
from switching my my fiber

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.750 
from switching my my fiber
supplementation<00:02:32.090> anyways<00:02:36.080> don't<00:02:37.080> ditch<00:02:37.760> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
supplementation anyways don't ditch the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.870 
supplementation anyways don't ditch the
diet<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:40.800> because<00:02:41.040> you're<00:02:41.190> not<00:02:41.310> adapting

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
diet just because you're not adapting

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.220 
diet just because you're not adapting
there's<00:02:42.210> way<00:02:42.480> more<00:02:42.980> advantages<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.310> eating<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
there's way more advantages to eating a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.380 
there's way more advantages to eating a
low-carb<00:02:46.230> high-fat<00:02:46.470> diet<00:02:47.040> than<00:02:47.430> just

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
low-carb high-fat diet than just

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.950 
low-carb high-fat diet than just
