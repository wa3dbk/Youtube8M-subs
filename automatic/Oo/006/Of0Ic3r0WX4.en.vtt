icebreaker and that meant that running

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.280 
icebreaker and that meant that running
for<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.210> coast<00:00:33.920> seemed<00:00:34.920> pointless

not<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> mention<00:01:08.610> along<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> way<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.479> started

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
not to mention along the way we started

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.679 
not to mention along the way we started
having<00:01:10.049> some<00:01:10.170> problems<00:01:10.590> with<00:01:10.650> our<00:01:10.890> trailer

having some problems with our trailer

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.899

one<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> our<00:01:12.930> tires<00:01:13.310> decided<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.580> didn't<00:01:14.820> want

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
one of our tires decided it didn't want

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.630 
one of our tires decided it didn't want
to<00:01:15.060> spin<00:01:15.299> any<00:01:15.479> longer<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.950> simply<00:01:17.369> caused

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
to spin any longer this is simply caused

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.920 
to spin any longer this is simply caused
by<00:01:18.060> ice<00:01:18.680> jamming<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.860> brake<00:01:20.400> rotors<00:01:20.930> we

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
by ice jamming up the brake rotors we

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.230 
by ice jamming up the brake rotors we
managed<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.740> fixed<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.970> get

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
managed to get that fixed and get

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.890 
managed to get that fixed and get
underway<00:01:24.659> again<00:01:25.909> but<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> other<00:01:27.180> issue<00:01:27.479> on

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
underway again but the other issue on

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.859 
underway again but the other issue on
this<00:01:28.110> road<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.710> fuel<00:01:29.430> consumption<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> in

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this road is fuel consumption and in

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
this road is fuel consumption and in
this<00:01:30.990> case<00:01:31.320> yeah<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.460> didn't<00:01:32.729> make<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.030> into

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this case yeah we didn't make it into

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.330 
this case yeah we didn't make it into
