all<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:01.709> midnight<00:00:02.190> here<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:03.000> I'm<00:00:03.179> gonna

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
all right midnight here and I'm gonna

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.760 
all right midnight here and I'm gonna
walk<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.689> through<00:00:03.720> making<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.529> simple

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
walk you through making a simple

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.820 
walk you through making a simple
rotation<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:06.529> like<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.680> switch<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.809> 3d<00:00:09.830> full

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
rotation I like to switch to the 3d full

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.900 
rotation I like to switch to the 3d full
screen<00:00:11.929> if<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.019> hold<00:00:13.230> down<00:00:13.469> command<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.790> Mac

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
screen if you hold down command on a Mac

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
screen if you hold down command on a Mac
you'll<00:00:15.809> rotate<00:00:16.020> around<00:00:17.600> let's<00:00:18.600> make<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> simple

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
you'll rotate around let's make a simple

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.410 
you'll rotate around let's make a simple
mesh<00:00:22.010> you<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.220> apply<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.550> rotation<00:00:24.240> to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
mesh you can apply that rotation to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.230 
mesh you can apply that rotation to
anything<00:00:25.160> and<00:00:26.160> we're<00:00:26.369> gonna<00:00:26.460> move<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
anything and we're gonna move it to the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.290 
anything and we're gonna move it to the
middle<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:28.250> make<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.400> white<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:32.180> rotate<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
middle here make it white and rotate it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.720 
middle here make it white and rotate it
flat<00:00:35.059> like<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.149> said<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.450> could<00:00:36.630> apply<00:00:37.170> this

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
flat like I said you could apply this

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
flat like I said you could apply this
process<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.180> any<00:00:39.360> geometry<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.260> gonna

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
process to any geometry I'm just gonna

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.290 
process to any geometry I'm just gonna
use<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:41.090> simple<00:00:42.090> plate<00:00:42.510> mesh<00:00:43.789> now<00:00:44.789> let's<00:00:45.000> pull

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
use a simple plate mesh now let's pull

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.080 
use a simple plate mesh now let's pull
up<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.870> few<00:00:46.440> menus<00:00:47.570> hierarchy<00:00:50.090> object

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
up a few menus hierarchy object

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.279 
up a few menus hierarchy object
properties<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.940> animation<00:00:53.940> time<00:00:54.629> which<00:00:55.110> is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
properties and animation time which is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.479 
properties and animation time which is
the<00:00:55.440> animation<00:00:55.829> slider<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> first<00:00:59.309> thing

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the animation slider so the first thing

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.130 
the animation slider so the first thing
we<00:00:59.579> need<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.789> do<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.510> switch<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.739> object<00:01:02.609> mode

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
we need to do is switch to object mode

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.469 
we need to do is switch to object mode
and<00:01:04.519> go<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:06.000> animation<00:01:06.750> group<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:08.390> hit<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and go make animation group I hit the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
and go make animation group I hit the
little<00:01:09.720> plus<00:01:09.930> sign<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
little plus sign and you can see the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.490 
little plus sign and you can see the
object<00:01:12.030> mesh<00:01:12.270> inside<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> animation<00:01:13.590> group

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
object mesh inside the animation group

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
object mesh inside the animation group
has<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.799> inside<00:01:17.189> an<00:01:17.340> animation<00:01:17.850> group<00:01:18.060> in

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
has to be inside an animation group in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
has to be inside an animation group in
order<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> animation<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.460> any

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
order for the animation to have any

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.050 
order for the animation to have any
effect<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.299> object<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.369> go<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> make

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
effect on the object so now go to make

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.620 
effect on the object so now go to make
rotation<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> little<00:01:27.360> yellow

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
rotation and you see a little yellow

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.719 
rotation and you see a little yellow
line<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> rotation<00:01:30.780> vector

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
line there that is the rotation vector

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.730 
line there that is the rotation vector
now<00:01:32.729> let's<00:01:33.000> line<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
now let's line it up with one of the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.810 
now let's line it up with one of the
edges

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.780 

and<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.930> switch<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.440> vertex<00:01:40.950> mode<00:01:41.280> here

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
and if you switch to vertex mode here

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
and if you switch to vertex mode here
and<00:01:43.250> select<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:44.580> of<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:46.080> corners<00:01:46.560> by<00:01:46.890> shift

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and select one of the corners by shift

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.630 
and select one of the corners by shift
and<00:01:47.670> click<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:51.530> move<00:01:52.530> them<00:01:52.740> together<00:01:53.160> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
and click and now move them together and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.150 
and click and now move them together and
it<00:01:53.850> automatically<00:01:54.660> aligns<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.620> with<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
it automatically aligns it with that

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.640 
it automatically aligns it with that
edge<00:01:56.460> there<00:01:58.010> switch<00:01:59.010> back<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> object

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
edge there switch back to object

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.330 
edge there switch back to object
deselect<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:02.160> select<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.970> rotation<00:02:03.510> again

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
deselect and select the rotation again

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.820 
deselect and select the rotation again
and<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.430> still<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.729> got<00:02:05.910> nothing<00:02:06.150> down<00:02:06.510> here

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
and we still have got nothing down here

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.560 
and we still have got nothing down here
which<00:02:07.830> means<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.369> need<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.550> enter<00:02:08.790> in<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.240> number

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
which means we need to enter in a number

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.870 
which means we need to enter in a number
here<00:02:10.490> put<00:02:11.490> in<00:02:11.610> 60<00:02:12.150> or<00:02:12.180> any<00:02:13.170> angle<00:02:13.620> really<00:02:14.840> now

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
here put in 60 or any angle really now

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.180 
here put in 60 or any angle really now
we've<00:02:17.880> got<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> hinging<00:02:18.570> door<00:02:21.920> all<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:23.040> now

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
we've got a hinging door all right now

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.310 
we've got a hinging door all right now
that<00:02:23.310> we've<00:02:23.459> made<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.880> rotation<00:02:24.450> I'm<00:02:25.080> gonna

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
that we've made this rotation I'm gonna

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.470 
that we've made this rotation I'm gonna
point<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> few<00:02:26.130> details<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:27.090> need<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.360> know

point out a few details you need to know
about<00:02:27.630> these<00:02:28.290> windows<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.010> I've<00:02:29.160> pulled<00:02:29.430> up

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
about these windows that I've pulled up

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.520 
about these windows that I've pulled up
explain<00:02:31.500> object<00:02:32.070> properties<00:02:32.550> tells<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
you keep track of them they were all

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
called rotations then you would get

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.690 
for me for this project and my other
Halo<00:05:20.970> projects<00:05:21.419> and<00:05:22.970> they<00:05:23.970> simply<00:05:24.450> are

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
Halo projects and they simply are

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.490 
Halo projects and they simply are
regular<00:05:26.700> data<00:05:26.940> refs<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.450> make<00:05:27.900> things<00:05:28.139> move

regular data refs that make things move

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.290 
regular data refs that make things move
they<00:05:29.010> work<00:05:29.220> just<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.639> same<00:05:29.669> as<00:05:30.060> any<00:05:30.210> other

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
they work just the same as any other

goes<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:33.660> don't<00:05:33.900> let<00:05:34.020> them<00:05:34.169> confuse<00:05:34.590> you

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
goes so don't let them confuse you

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.670 
goes so don't let them confuse you
now<00:05:36.479> if<00:05:36.600> you<00:05:36.690> look<00:05:36.810> over<00:05:36.930> here<00:05:37.260> we've<00:05:37.410> got<00:05:37.440> the

now if you look over here we've got the

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.159 
now if you look over here we've got the

anchor rotation he effects these two

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.210 
anchor rotation he effects these two

well not really anyways you can see that
effect<00:06:09.960> as<00:06:10.520> you<00:06:11.520> watch<00:06:11.789> the<00:06:12.680> two<00:06:13.680> lower

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979

rotation vectors moved by the ones above

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.140 
rotation vectors moved by the ones above
and<00:06:18.240> then<00:06:19.020> of<00:06:19.199> course<00:06:19.229> the<00:06:20.160> objects<00:06:20.669> are

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
and then of course the objects are

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.680 
and then of course the objects are
layered<00:06:21.660> in<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.380> same<00:06:22.590> way<00:06:23.330> so<00:06:24.330> that<00:06:24.509> they<00:06:24.630> are

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
layered in the same way so that they are

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.810 
layered in the same way so that they are

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
proper time all this is kind of trial

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.310 
proper time all this is kind of trial
and<00:06:32.039> error<00:06:32.190> a<00:06:32.810> little<00:06:33.810> bit<00:06:33.930> of<00:06:34.020> lateral

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
and error a little bit of lateral

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.629 
and error a little bit of lateral
thinking<00:06:34.740> and<00:06:34.949> you<00:06:35.010> can<00:06:35.190> do<00:06:35.340> just<00:06:35.370> about

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
thinking and you can do just about

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.279 
thinking and you can do just about
anything<00:06:36.030> with<00:06:36.360> rotations<00:06:36.990> and<00:06:37.229> translations

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:41.350 
anything with rotations and translations
in<00:06:38.070> X<00:06:38.220> plane<00:06:39.380> now<00:06:40.380> let's<00:06:40.590> look<00:06:40.710> at<00:06:40.889> the

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
in X plane now let's look at the

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.390 
in X plane now let's look at the
properties<00:06:42.360> window<00:06:42.600> if<00:06:43.139> we<00:06:43.350> select<00:06:43.770> one<00:06:44.370> of

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
these rotations we can see that it's

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.980 
these rotations we can see that it's

you know these two animation groups are

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.150 
you know these two animation groups are
separate<00:07:52.820> but<00:07:53.820> I've<00:07:54.720> played<00:07:55.440> with<00:07:55.680> the<00:07:55.860> angles

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 
separate but I've played with the angles

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.100 
separate but I've played with the angles
so<00:07:56.400> that<00:07:56.610> they<00:07:57.270> look<00:07:57.510> like<00:07:57.570> they<00:07:57.930> work

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.110 
so that they look like they work

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.800 
so that they look like they work
together<00:07:58.320> and<00:07:59.310> that's<00:08:00.240> the<00:08:00.360> kind<00:08:00.540> of<00:08:00.570> thing

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:00.810 
together and that's the kind of thing

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.530 
together and that's the kind of thing
that<00:08:00.840> you<00:08:01.140> just<00:08:01.170> have<00:08:01.560> to<00:08:01.590> sort<00:08:01.980> of<00:08:02.510> try<00:08:03.510> and

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:03.540 
that you just have to sort of try and

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.630 
that you just have to sort of try and
work<00:08:04.410> out<00:08:05.630> till<00:08:06.630> it<00:08:06.780> works<00:08:06.870> for<00:08:07.170> you<00:08:07.380> and

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:07.640 
work out till it works for you and

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.040 
work out till it works for you and
that's<00:08:08.640> just<00:08:09.030> one<00:08:09.300> of<00:08:09.420> the<00:08:09.510> things<00:08:09.750> that<00:08:09.960> you

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.050 
that's just one of the things that you

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.210 
that's just one of the things that you
can<00:08:10.230> do<00:08:10.380> with<00:08:10.530> rotations<00:08:11.100> in<00:08:11.670> explain
