00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.429
 have a little chin for you and i want 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.230
 like the video here so I go 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.059
 start with makeup of sins I have 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.830
 I have the most bought in to it 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390
 makeup from america that but all on 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.619
 we don't see this form this way 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.130
 The Netherlands 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.599
 and they have the party store so 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.630
 went there to look and then I had a few 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.020
 bought things as the first lipliners from 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.200
 asus party and news and arranger and it 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.670
 its color red and new the pink 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.530
 then I have a lipstick in the color 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.230
 cheeky it's one 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 shane new color i have a big plus 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.219
 but find my highlighter and this is called 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.350
 pink test I bought you two brushes 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.289
 This is a flawless concealer brothers 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.289
 but i use it for in greece and 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.030
 this is a mascara and shadow shield 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.670
 i used it but i just really like it 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.580
 not handy because it just comes here 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.130
 underneath and if you keep it that way there 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.260
 is the news force's next thing 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.150
 I still speak English later 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.409
 a make-up lacks a set of spring bought 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.049
 then I also found the duo les grill 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.670
 this very very popular and i very here 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.710
 many people use and when I saw him 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 I thought hey 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.909
 Campbell nice with me then I have 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.310
 finally a good white nail polish 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.780
 found and it is just pure white must 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.799
 just as good two layers 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.689
 apply 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.700
 but you get that from the eye and each 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.299
 nail polish so it just makes sense and 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.240
 I have baby lip color that she doesn't put in 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.869
 the netherlands this is 45 josh josh 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.299
 peachy and so did it is a minute 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.759
 it is a species that 200 lipstick line 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.170
 it really is a lot of color but still is 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.780
 it a lip balm 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.630
 and I her very much to mint than 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.060
 Have you found something that I really don't 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.260
 could actually believe because i have this 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.570
 time comes with 13 notes 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.429
 watched a movie and she had it from china 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.630
 or billy barnes only grabbed me for my 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.520
 China 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.680
 taken along and it turned out that it is 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.200
 not where they live or had at Mieke 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.600
 so something i don't know how it is but me 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.640
 have found the baby's chin it is one 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.960

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.920

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.140
