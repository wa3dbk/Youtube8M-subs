00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello and yes, of course you have again 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.270
 I switched on again today 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.429
 a video for the beauty lovers below 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.410
 you because I show you today like me 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.240
 my nylander strokes so always pull 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.740
 Some of you wanted that from me 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.230
 know how some of you might know 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.539
 already know one belonged to me 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.460
 everyday look so I make up like this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.590
 pretty much since the last five years 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.019
 stroked an eyeliner almost every day 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 if you just like it pretty much 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.279
 and that's why I think I can 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.869
 Show how I do it today 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.969
 Of course, there are 100,000 different ones 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.440
 ways to do that and 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.989
 maybe some are better than 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.610
 The kind I do but I show it 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.320
 Just like me doing today 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.579
 Maybe you can get one 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.579
 or look for other trick 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.800
 we may have already seen 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.379
 I am not in mine 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.969
 habitual film environment but I have 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.170
 put me here from my box because 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.969
 I have a mirror here 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.860
 right next to me because I have mine 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.660
 it's going to be a bit ironic 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.190
 without pulling in the mirror 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.619
 I just try it 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.390
 here with this mirror next to me 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.670
 of course have the curtain behind 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 have to close because direct light 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.909
 from the back is not so good either 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.310
 if the light is not so good please 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.979
 forgive me I tip me here 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.619
 Appeal the daylight lamps right next to it 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.810
 me and outside feels like 25 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.520
 grad i just show you now 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.330
 the eyeliner for me at the moment 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.470
 use 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.429
 and I'm in the middle of it 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.610
 cosmetics products also animal-free 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.649
 to change the products and the countries the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.210
 do not use now that is still 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.369
 one I bought before me 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.200
 I have changed and I have until now 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.569
 not yet the right replacement 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.789
 So found an equally good replacement 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.159
 I already have the mountain out of liquid 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:51.259
 eyeliner tried but is is 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.820
 not so good has a very stupid 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.649
 applicator unfortunately just not 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.420
 can paint throughout 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.909
 and if you are a good one 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.229
 a navis of cruelty free please 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.850
 We definitely write in the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.310
 comments purely because I want me 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.289
 but try the I time to 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.049
 Still using is from max factor cover 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.700
 x-pert waterproof eyeliner so the found 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.170
 I'm actually pretty good but like 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.070
 I will not say that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.440
 buy more 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.630
 I paint my no one always stroked 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.850
 with the right hand and try it 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.130
 from my left side of the face too 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.250
 to paint my right side of the face 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.500
 so I first paint the wings from here 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.690
 and down and thanks to the next 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.410
 next eye and paint from the inside out 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.299
 Outside 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.459
 that may be quite unusual 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.170
 but I used it that way 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.130
 I'll just show it to you here 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.859
 in the mirror 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.840
 Unfortunately, I make my no on how to 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.390
 there can be such a point here 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.549
 and I try the product here too 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.370
 just do not overline too much 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.280
 to take from it and then 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.769
 I really take my eyelashes with the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.900
 finger down so many girls 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.060
 You can just do it this year 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.720
 paint over but I can just do it 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.340
 Not 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.769
 I do it that way and I think so too 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.079
 really so much easier if you have the 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.799
 eyelashes with the index finger and the 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.170
 ring finger 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.269
 what am I doing here? 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.540
 press down and then you already have that 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.329
 song like that and can on it times and 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.500
 then I just start up here 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.500
 the same time with the ring 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.549
 I try to skinny tomorrow 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.459
 so those yes me inside 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.840
 come the thinner I make that and 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.000
 It is also difficult to do before 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.620
 camera to do that really perfect 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.180
 So believe me it's not that easy 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.180
 in front of the camera as it looks 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.519
 rectification is of course allowed so the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.079
 first page is already finished 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.269
 and now I'm just doing that 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.340
 second page as I said, I start 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.950
 not again with the wing outside 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.620
 but this time I start with the eye 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.379
 inside because I like to go from left to right 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.819
 right male and I'm totally here 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.700
 black on my finger 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.650
 I start now on very thin paint 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.650
 and get fatter on the outside 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.480
 Of course, those who still want to can 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.900
 pointed at the end again correctly pointed 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.900
 do 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.480
 so now I am already finished 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.580
 I've already got those too 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.250
 mascara on it and did that 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.010
 I there from patrice the allround mascara 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.150
 what I use in ultra black too 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.100
 I think I have only very good 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.440
 recently bought and I'm already 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.120
 totally in love with this thing now 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.610
 Of course I also show you close 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.160
 so the whole thing looks like a few 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.820
 recordings and then that was it 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.820
 even from me 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.900
 yahoo has made it to the gutted 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.270
 that means you have the video completely 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.070
 and that makes me very happy 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.230
 and because I liked the video me 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.210
 another thumb up there 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.950
 can you always subscribe me and 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.590
 also check out my instagram channel 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.180
 and around me somewhere I know now 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.100
 do not believe on this page or on 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.450
 this side because I'm confused 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.820
 also in the last few videos 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.770
 again and again you will find two others 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.810
 I also like to share videos with you 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.910
 Otherwise, I wish you all the best 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.790
 just have a nice day and say 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.790
 bye bye until the next video
