00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:08.500
 I make a pin for a tension roller with 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:17.170
 one side as standard 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:23.790
 Variant 10 from was 10 1 25 with another 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:27.060
 sides 12 175 175 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:35.820
 of course I did not know that she was so 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:40.480
 the store bought 25 for 25 and 1 5 here 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.519
 175 only in the set it is long tomorrow 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.089
 I will buy it because it is long 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.219
 there are few threads you can not run and that can 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:53.440
 and run but uncomfortable in bought 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:58.449
 to get rid of the two sets and 2 1 2 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.409
 to make it easier to cut properly and so this 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:06.520
 hairpin spin here we are ready 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.270
 try on this two drills first 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.590
 drilled 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.909
 and then tap everything is fine okay 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.829
 will spin before experience to 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.170
 it was not so if 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:23.079
 cut somewhere first on the workpiece 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.420
 stay there something might not 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:29.380
 turn out 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.119
 variants of another then on the block if 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.549
 thread 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.549
 badly cut even more we increased 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:43.590
 I do not know, he will give no crown blanks 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:45.250
 stay if we allow even heels 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.500
 smooth 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.990
 I do not for no narezhetsya the washer 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.720
 lost it no way interfere already puck 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:02.410
 they themselves did only life if we allowed 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:05.470
 crookedly she somehow twist the puck here 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:11.470
 maybe crooked let's say it can close 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:14.080
 anyway the gaps allows when to bolt 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.530
 nut we will have to pull 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.480
 to the block anyway, this way 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.300
 pulled wrong anyway on 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.400
 be attracted normally here creona not 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.670
 will rise in relation to the unit 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.900
 and tensioning pulley also to the puck 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.610
 will be pulled even if it is crooked 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.980
 will stand stud like that there is not 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.640
 tight on gray heels and 3 speak 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:44.620
 that crooked somehow the stud was pulled 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:49.019
 it will be exactly a block tomorrow I will cut 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:55.390
 show how it will look 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:59.260
 the puck still find to all could not resist here 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.620
 today is a tic that he was 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.420
 started cutting when 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.500
 cut anyway so here's a look 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:14.170
 even unevenly goes right to the left of 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.269
 all sides at 90 degrees he walked but 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.489
 if a little bit nothing goes there 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:24.400
 scary but still need to try 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:27.630
 about me go and not immediately 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:33.910
 It is worth passing that accumulates there 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:37.780
 shavings need to be cleaned anyway 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.470
 several times this case has never 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:46.290
 engaged and chopped reboot so if 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.290
 that's what I'm doing wrong don't blame me 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:56.810
 engine two pillows rated one with left 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:59.120
 hand left on the box and it turns out 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.840
 so loves on the winch hung 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:10.510
 engine ok pretty ki crawl 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:15.220
 no problem and so it was chopped 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:22.490
 hairpin now try to twist 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:30.860
 the spirit is spinning fine I donâ€™t have 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:35.720
 there is only one 10 1 25 so here's the principle 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:40.100
 I understand everything I tighten to the end I will tighten 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.370
 Tomorrow I will put someone tensioner 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:49.760
 like this video like or not 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:52.990
 I liked that I will do something new 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.990
 I will lay the useful
