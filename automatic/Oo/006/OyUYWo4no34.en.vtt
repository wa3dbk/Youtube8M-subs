 lighthouse 18 goals 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.799
 the river 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.799
 the discomfort 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.380
 so luciane I know how you guys I am 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.710

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.480
 of the daily series of the master alloy be 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.850
 start seeing him there my first 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.580
 hiring the season that was the half 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.620
 Venezuelan striker called the long him 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.230
 actually a fictional version of 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.960
 the Venezuelan who calls the arango who plays 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.640
 in a smaller German team in real life and 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.830
 in the game it will help a lot because 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.320
 it has good statistics mainly 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.250
 comparing with the rest of my team he 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.900
 will serve to replace Valdivia the 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.550
 other daniel oak socks when 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.890
 they are tired 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.330
 will be a good team is just to give 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.670
 an update on the end of the pre- 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.489
 season the friendly matches was a 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.500
 disgrace i just took turns i started 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.450
 to win from 1 to 0 the games thought to be 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.549
 calm ends up taking 2 to 1 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.130
 so the tip is for you guys never play 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.080
 who seemed quiet in the master league 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.210
 you must trust that he stays very 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.530
 careful because it's very treacherous you 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.300
 It can take turns as what 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.640
 It happened to me 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.790
 we then moved on to the first game 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.190
 official of the season that was the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.510
 the palm of my team in the 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.790
 Brazil 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.920
 And how the Copa do Brasil is more than 20? 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.260
 times what is the amount of the championship 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.390
 it is necessary for the game to be 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.890
 introduces some unknown teams to the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.440
 final and not have graduated all 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.320
 times in Brazil and that's why I 've 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.820
 Copa do Brasil against fc northoff is 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.010
 the unknown sync there but that was a 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.290
 cool quarry saw 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.390
 I noticed that the game might be the 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.470
 first officer started very 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.110
 busy 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.909
 was a good start I do not know if it was 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.680
 Excitement but I thought it was less 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.770
 truncated than the training games was a 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.239
 game to play better than 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.819
 friendly games and so not much 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.069
 time of play got a good play and 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.680
 in the rebound at the entrance of the area made the 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.709
 first goal has already opened 1 to 0 which was 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.480
 very good what it took to get a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.829
 little back weight at debut 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.659
 mainly by taking into account 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.560
 thought that it had taken just that 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.250
 in the preseason 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.110
 the draw several defeats and the game itself 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.360
 it was good the game in the first half despite 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.910
 of not having a goal chance and only 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.160
 absolutely a goal kick that was a 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.580
 kick in which I scored the game the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.110
 first time I thought it was good I could test 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.360
 some changes I made in the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.310
 tactical training and despite not having 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.830
 goal and also have not played 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.160
 bright and I found a good game 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.310
 The problem is that in the beginning of the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.989
 second time in a huge bobaada one 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.060
 ball that was left like that for the entrance 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.959
 of the area ahead the goalkeeper so 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.959
 very dumb and in an attacker of fc porto 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.569
 benfica who got ahead and duck to match 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.150
 I really got really pissed because 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.230
 these start of season are very 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.420
 difficult matches are very 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.880
 balanced the information team you 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.430
 is even knowing the mechanics of the game is 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.160
 because you have little time playing foot 2013 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.880
 and then in this great bobaada I took the 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.760
 tie at 1-1 and boy I'll tell you 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.459
 thing after that match tie 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.859
 turned that thing that galvanized 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.940
 bueno I 'd say a test for heart finds 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:42.730
 What happened because it was really cool. 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.840
 see that my team was very limited either 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.579
 to say I could not do many 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.660
 like when you get a 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.430
 barcelona life and go out to play but 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.329
 At the same time, the match did not 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.530
 frustrating 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.030
 I mean, there are some plays I 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.500
 I knew I could not do more 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.540
 plays you make with Messi and the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.670
 cristiano ronaldo life but still 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.470
 I could play well, I could put the 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:09.340
 plays and ended up that's why the match 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.100
 It was very close to me in several bids 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.500
 I tried the goals I tried to tie I 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.870
 which can detect the weaknesses of 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.820
 another team and the changes I made in 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.639
 tactical training have also 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.280
 could manage could have chances 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.370
 goal at least be running at there 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.530
 area of ​​the opponent and a bid I almost 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.630
 I did the goal had a ball stretched like this 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.400
 in front of the goalkeeper that I got to 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.229
 dribbling the goalkeeper but I think the 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.840
 striker was tired missing leg and 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.479
 a bit of a lack of decision I'm done 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.490
 losing a goal 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:45.159
 but it was a great match as I already said 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.069
 return after the tie 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.960
 It was really cool having a match like this. 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.879
 early in the official matches because 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.439
 then we even get carried away to 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.780
 continue in the master league since it is a 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:58.000
 tournament so well the tournament not a way 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.919
 a very dense game that can be 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.550
 frustrating for many people because it is 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.069
 very complicated in the beginning because well the game 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.900
 was 1 to 1 in the normal time was 1 to 1 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.610
 also in overtime and then my friends 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.180
 we went for penalties 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.650
 I already started on penalties, but I did not know 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.319
 I still do not hit a beat 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.639
 penalty at the foot of 2013 and I lost my 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.740
 pilot who proposes now that I'm going 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.000
 losing you is eliminated even though I 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.699
 I have no experience 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.150
 only in this game but I was lucky and soon 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.849
 then pick up the computer pilot 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.520
 I got the pilot should be a tonic and in 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.969
 I then did mine and got another one. 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.419
 penalty shoot-out of the opposing team then 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.909
 I was in advantage in the match and what 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:46.240
 happened were the goal sequences 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:49.810
 made and I did and last opponent did 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.009
 also again in the decoration attack 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.740
 in the last penalty the opposing team did 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.839
 his charge and left me with the 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.479
 decision for exactly the last beat 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:04.210
 my fifth beat if I did 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.919
 I would finish the game and if I lost I would 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.009
 for alternate charges 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:15.310
 It turned out that unfortunately I converted 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:17.710
 I scored 4 to 3 and won the game is 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.270
 mine the opposing team was the next 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.650
 Copa do Brasil Round 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.919
 So this one I think was a great one. 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.529
 debut in the official games was not 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.110
 brilliant in technical terms and made more 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.060
 in terms of emotion had a lot o 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.539
 match 1 to 1 in a very 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.370
 busy but did not have many goals 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.740
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.270
