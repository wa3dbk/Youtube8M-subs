prankster comets silver stars in double

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.400 
prankster comets silver stars in double
time<00:00:02.700> this<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.210> beat<00:00:03.449> block<00:00:03.659> galaxy<00:00:04.170> on

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
time this is the beat block galaxy on

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.760 
time this is the beat block galaxy on
Super<00:00:04.830> Mario<00:00:05.009> Galaxy<00:00:05.130> 2<00:00:06.200> so<00:00:07.200> like<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.500> said<00:00:07.560> in

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
Super Mario Galaxy 2 so like I said in

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.580 
Super Mario Galaxy 2 so like I said in
previous<00:00:07.890> video<00:00:08.570> the<00:00:09.570> blocks<00:00:09.840> switch<00:00:10.260> much

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
previous video the blocks switch much

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.870 
previous video the blocks switch much
faster<00:00:11.010> now<00:00:11.130> if<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.309> didn't<00:00:11.550> figure<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.759> out

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
faster now if you didn't figure that out

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.020 
faster now if you didn't figure that out
this<00:00:12.179> one<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.660> one<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.170> more<00:00:13.290> challenging

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
this one is one of the more challenging

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.400 
this one is one of the more challenging
definitely<00:00:15.030> probably<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.929> most<00:00:16.020> challenging

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
definitely probably the most challenging

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.500 
definitely probably the most challenging
level<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.800> early<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.430> game<00:00:17.510> because

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
level this early on in the game because

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.710 
level this early on in the game because
you're<00:00:18.630> only<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.900> world<00:00:19.109> three<00:00:19.320> right<00:00:19.500> now<00:00:19.619> so

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
you're only on world three right now so

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.000 
you're only on world three right now so
if<00:00:21.720> you're<00:00:21.900> getting<00:00:22.170> stuck<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.680> don't

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
if you're getting stuck on this don't

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.900 
if you're getting stuck on this don't
worry<00:00:23.640> about<00:00:23.939> moving<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.480> if<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:25.910> if

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
worry about moving on if you don't if

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.460 
worry about moving on if you don't if
you're<00:00:27.060> getting<00:00:27.420> stuck<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.109> want<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you're getting stuck and just want to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
you're getting stuck and just want to
come<00:00:28.619> back<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.949> later<00:00:29.689> anyway<00:00:30.689> pick<00:00:30.929> up

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
come back to this later anyway pick up

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.540 
come back to this later anyway pick up
Yoshi<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.769> use<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.130> flutter<00:00:32.460> jump

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
Yoshi if you can use this flutter jump

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.500 
Yoshi if you can use this flutter jump
and<00:00:34.430> that<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.640> life<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.180> little<00:00:36.360> bit

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and that will make life a little bit

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.940 
and that will make life a little bit
easier<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.899> timing<00:00:37.260> some<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.469> these<00:00:37.559> jumps<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
easier in timing some of these jumps a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.619 
easier in timing some of these jumps a
little<00:00:38.010> bit<00:00:38.129> easier<00:00:38.309> also<00:00:38.610> if<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.390> get<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
little bit easier also if you get in a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.880 
little bit easier also if you get in a
situation<00:00:39.809> where<00:00:40.200> he<00:00:40.290> missed<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> jump<00:00:40.739> don't

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
situation where he missed a jump don't

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.010 
situation where he missed a jump don't
forget<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> little<00:00:41.879> spin<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
forget that you can do a little spin to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.420 
forget that you can do a little spin to
give<00:00:43.170> yourself<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.590> couple<00:00:43.829> extra<00:00:43.920> feet<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
give yourself a couple extra feet of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.410 
give yourself a couple extra feet of
elevation<00:00:46.489> when<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.550> move<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.360> next

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
elevation when you move on to this next

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.500 
elevation when you move on to this next
area<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> little<00:00:50.160> bit<00:00:50.340> I'm<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
area you have a little bit I'm we have a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.720 
area you have a little bit I'm we have a
much<00:00:51.660> larger<00:00:52.110> pyramid<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> end<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> five

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
much larger pyramid at the end and five

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.369 
much larger pyramid at the end and five
silver<00:00:54.180> stars<00:00:54.420> are<00:00:54.629> spread<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:54.960> quite<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> bit

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
silver stars are spread out quite a bit

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
silver stars are spread out quite a bit
further<00:00:55.800> than<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:56.760> were<00:00:56.910> before<00:00:57.059> there's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
further than they were before there's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
further than they were before there's
also<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.690> couple<00:00:58.140> set<00:00:58.530> blocks<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.250> should

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
also a couple set blocks that you should

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
also a couple set blocks that you should
use<00:00:59.699> right<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> middle<00:01:00.600> data<00:01:03.530> will<00:01:04.530> not

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
use right in the middle data will not

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.830 
use right in the middle data will not
move<00:01:05.610> position<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:07.700> what<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.180> get

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
move position so what I like to do get

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.050 
move position so what I like to do get
that<00:01:09.990> silver<00:01:10.320> star<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.799> front<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.909> then

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
that silver star right in front and then

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.760 
that silver star right in front and then
get<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:12.659> top<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.260> leap

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
get up to the very top and just leap

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.499 
get up to the very top and just leap
over<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.400> corner<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.180> silver

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
over into this corner get that silver

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.469 
over into this corner get that silver
star<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.580> kind<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.610> rely<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.000> luck<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
star I kind of rely on luck there a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.660 
star I kind of rely on luck there a
little<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.220> area<00:01:20.520> with

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
little bit get to them this area with

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.679 
little bit get to them this area with
the<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:22.250> move<00:01:23.250> over<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> other<00:01:24.299> corner

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the one up move over to the other corner

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.179 
the one up move over to the other corner
of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.820> pyramid<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.540> oh<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.770> kind<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.040> cut

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
of the pyramid so oh I got kind of cut

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.499 
of the pyramid so oh I got kind of cut
off<00:01:29.280> at<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.460> last<00:01:29.700> video<00:01:29.970> when<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:30.390> trying

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
off at the last video when I was trying

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.710 
off at the last video when I was trying
to<00:01:30.600> say<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:32.150> when<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.329> pick<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.600> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
to say this but when you pick up that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.030 
to say this but when you pick up that
final<00:01:34.350> star<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:36.090> world<00:01:36.329> are<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.500> blocks<00:01:37.710> stop

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
final star the world are the blocks stop

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640 
final star the world are the blocks stop
switching<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.000> need<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.450> sure<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:40.500> pick

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
switching so you need to be sure to pick

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.800 
switching so you need to be sure to pick
up<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.860> fifth<00:01:41.220> star<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> block

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
up that fifth star when there is a block

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.300 
up that fifth star when there is a block
underneath<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.070> jumped

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
underneath it because if I just jumped

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670 
underneath it because if I just jumped
at<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.399> star<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:45.290> like<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.470> did

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
at that star right now like I just did

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.249 
at that star right now like I just did
I'm<00:01:47.450> very<00:01:48.450> good<00:01:48.689> chance<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.200> to

fall off right now which is kind of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.850 
fall off right now which is kind of
frustrating<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.869> died<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> couple<00:01:52.290> times<00:01:52.619> so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
frustrating and I died a couple times so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.730 
frustrating and I died a couple times so
I<00:01:53.240> got<00:01:54.240> lucky<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.570> spun<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.500> right

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
I got lucky I spun out of that right

I got lucky I spun out of that right
away<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.250> shaking<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> controller<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
away I was shaking the controller the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.670 
away I was shaking the controller the
entire<00:01:57.540> time<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:58.110> cutscene<00:01:58.560> was

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
entire time that little cutscene was

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.410 
entire time that little cutscene was
playing<00:01:58.979> showing<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> star<00:01:59.939> go<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> top

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
playing showing the star go to the top

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.690 
playing showing the star go to the top
but<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.040> made<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:02.250> life<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.579> lot

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700

easier<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.320> timed<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.619> final

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
easier if I just timed that final
