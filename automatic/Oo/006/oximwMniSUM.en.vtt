00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
screws poking out at the bottom you'll

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.820 
screws poking out at the bottom you'll
see<00:01:15.830> under<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> side<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.830> now

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
see under to the side of the now

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.980

stainless steel screws on the top row

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.840 
stainless steel screws on the top row
here<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.619> originally<00:01:23.159> had<00:01:23.340> poking<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.060> well

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
here I originally had poking out as well

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
here I originally had poking out as well
but<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.630> really<00:01:27.899> serve<00:01:28.110> no<00:01:28.319> purpose<00:01:28.530> at<00:01:28.830> all

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
but they really serve no purpose at all

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.700 
but they really serve no purpose at all
the<00:01:29.250> Apple<00:01:29.580> pieces<00:01:29.759> were<00:01:30.060> simply<00:01:30.420> getting

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
the Apple pieces were simply getting

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
the Apple pieces were simply getting
impaled<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.250> ends<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.819> screws<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
impaled on the ends of the screws so I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.480 
impaled on the ends of the screws so I
back<00:01:34.140> those<00:01:34.380> out<00:01:34.619> not<00:01:35.009> sure<00:01:35.190> what<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.369> gonna

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
back those out not sure what I'm gonna

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.180 
back those out not sure what I'm gonna
do<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.789> them<00:01:36.080> but<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.409> screws<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
do with them but the screws at the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.040 
do with them but the screws at the
bottom<00:01:38.399> help<00:01:39.119> prevent<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> Apple<00:01:39.929> pieces

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
bottom help prevent the Apple pieces

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.680 
bottom help prevent the Apple pieces
from<00:01:40.440> sliding<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.130> sliding<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.970> past<00:01:42.330> the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
from sliding and sliding in past the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.139 
from sliding and sliding in past the
cylinder<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> most<00:01:44.549> part<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:44.970> seem

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
cylinder and for the most part they seem

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.840 
cylinder and for the most part they seem
to<00:01:45.299> work<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:46.679> maybe<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.950> could<00:01:47.009> screw<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.789> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to work I think maybe I could screw in a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.639 
to work I think maybe I could screw in a
few<00:01:48.060> more<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.569> for<00:01:49.409> now<00:01:49.560> they're<00:01:49.800> working<00:01:51.649> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
few more but for now they're working and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.999 
few more but for now they're working and
we<00:01:52.709> have<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.860> side<00:01:53.099> view<00:01:53.129> here<00:01:54.530> at<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.679> bottom

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
we have a side view here at the bottom

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.160 
we have a side view here at the bottom
we<00:01:56.099> have<00:01:56.129> a<00:01:56.280> food-grade<00:01:56.729> bucket<00:01:57.300> for

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
we have a food-grade bucket for

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.680 
we have a food-grade bucket for
collecting<00:01:58.560> our<00:01:58.679> crushed<00:01:58.979> Apple<00:01:59.459> at<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.390> back

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
collecting our crushed Apple at the back

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.350 
collecting our crushed Apple at the back
I've<00:02:00.959> put<00:02:01.319> a<00:02:01.619> couple<00:02:02.099> of<00:02:02.520> wheels<00:02:02.789> so<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.149> can

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
I've put a couple of wheels so we can

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.770 
I've put a couple of wheels so we can
tilt<00:02:03.599> the<00:02:03.750> unit<00:02:04.020> back<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.560> wheel<00:02:04.709> it<00:02:04.860> around

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
tilt the unit back and wheel it around

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.859 
tilt the unit back and wheel it around
the<00:02:07.160> structure<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.369> largely<00:02:08.670> made<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.179> what<00:02:09.780> is

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the structure is largely made of what is
