00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.419 
geocaching event to make it great
let's<00:00:09.630> go<00:00:09.840> geocaching<00:00:10.200> what<00:00:10.950> has<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.219> do<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
let's go geocaching what has to do is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.549 
let's go geocaching what has to do is
find<00:00:11.639> nine<00:00:11.910> geocaches<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:12.960> get<00:00:13.110> stamps

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
find nine geocaches we get stamps

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.279 
find nine geocaches we get stamps
perfect<00:00:13.950> ones<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.330> let's<00:00:15.509> go<00:00:15.690> let's<00:00:16.170> go

electrical<00:00:58.470> box<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.860> let's<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.280> can

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
electrical box so let's see if we can

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.470 
electrical box so let's see if we can
find<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:03.440> there<00:01:04.440> it<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.620> right<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:04.920> and
