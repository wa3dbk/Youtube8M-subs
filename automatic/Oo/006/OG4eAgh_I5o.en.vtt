00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello my dear friends my name is 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.940
 npd and over the past decade 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.109
 this is becoming more and more of a modern one 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.389
 Sport develops because of it 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.830
 There are different techniques to learn 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.000
 In this video I want you my 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.000
 bring three favorites closer 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.480
 in the spring after school gives for 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.270
 me nothing better than with the jörg 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.470
 to go and pike to fish 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.720
 of course, jerks are wonderfully suitable 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.560
 and shallow water zones news 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.270
 scan 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.890
 I have some here for you 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.780
 we can hang out the same 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.430
 year and look like in the background 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.980
 we have a ship island with one 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.200
 a lot of sandbank right in 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.730
 breege you can wonderfully fresh here 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.600
 you build boats and has wheat 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.710
 spot you should with the jörg angele 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.590
 It is advisable to use shallow water areas 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.480
 a good length of 2 meters 20 230 too 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.950
 Use and have a job weight of 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.140
 about 80 grams depending how heavy 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.360
 köhler is here, too 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.190
 the much longer or strengthen the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.680
 people just take what damn right 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.869
 is resistant and really stiff runs the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.550
 the advantage is the bait of jörg 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.470
 if you hit him or just 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.420
 just pulls a good one actually and 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.009
 through this stiff the apron of the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.780
 Cooler just better and you have the 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.250
 beneficial when he puts throw could be 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.250
 better without getting tangled in the subject 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.490
 top köhler 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.650
 in the summer when the water is a few degrees 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.390
 the fish have arrived 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.040
 do not necessarily want to eat much anymore 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.630
 who has enough food because 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.610
 if i like the drobs system very much 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.170
 the advantage of this is you can 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.729
 bait leyen in one place hold the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.190
 fish enough to irritate him 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.900
 bite to persuade yourself with the 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.369
 dropshot I use a long route 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.800
 with a very great tip 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.630
 the good thing is the sharp tick bite 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.190
 the fish bite cautiously went 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.560
 Mayor and this is the bit 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.630
 already you have a while with the drop 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.330
 fished top and noticed the fish bite 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.459
 not really true I hang 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.320
 Can you play with the lead with the lead? 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.120
 distance from construction to bait as you can see 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.510
 that's the bait here 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.010
 you can vary and adjust here 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.850
 often there are already 1 2 cm 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.850
 I have noticed a difference 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.040
 the spring water is still too high 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.540
 cold and the fish are not yet 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.569
 really awakened from hibernation 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.670
 I like to understand a fine fish 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.230
 also called new action but not synonymous 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.120
 That's why I really like fishing a lot 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.380
 These things here the advantage here 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.049
 she is very, very, very 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.190
 rubber and can be good at the time 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.739
 use airflow kabul for packing 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.790
 very very fine and of course breaks 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.090
 is not it he just understands it 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.799
 not a dickhead if these had on 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.269
 The good thing is the advantage that 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.160
 The bait stands vertically upwards 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.890
 and should the zander right this fish 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.650
 attacking can follow from above 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.880
 and the rubber pushes transverse rows 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.019
 You do not necessarily have this technique 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.239
 Fishing from the boat could be done here 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.099
 to go on a walk on one 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.989
 quay jump far along the believe that 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.400
 ding down let the reason search and 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.840
 then raise slightly again 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.280
 then the light beats on the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.319
 route and the top makes the rest the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.970
 vibrations we were really quite out 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.590
 let you down again and look for the 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.350
 ground permanently on the sheet pile wall 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.350
 long I always say pro reli lives 1 1 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.329
 be this willing, finer one 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.709
 a thumbs up subscribes to the 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.439
 channel and easily my facebook page 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.129
