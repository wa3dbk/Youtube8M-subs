 Yes, you need I have here 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.449
 a little something prepared 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.460
 You have to fly with one of your dolls 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.750
 and at the same time it must have to be learned 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.460

 and yes these are all met the criteria 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.520
 are not that hard to get 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.010
 You just have to play the game completely 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.969
 normally play through or just hold up 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.160
 to the kinobar island from then you can 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.160
 follow my steps you go here 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.989
 after I show it on the map 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.440
 Of course I do not have it with me 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.780
 I'm sure I'm leaving 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.989
 I can show here is her city 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.839
 the second city there shall ye back and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.329
 here is when you go up in the way 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.979
 Direction of the forest there with the whole 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.030
 small insect is this man 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.830
 which lets through at the beginning of the game 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.090
 not by now but lets you 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.990
 but you can still do it 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.340
 talk and he tells you something but me 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.100
 I finally got my coffee 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.080
 of course you can happen you have it 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.630
 in a hurry and here it is important that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.220
 you say no you are not 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 actually you have a lot of time because 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.869
 the good lord wants to explain something to you 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.850
 aha you use a pokédex if you have one 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.000
 Pokemon fans will be your pokédex 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.830
 automatically updated what you know 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.330
 not how to catch pokémon i hope 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.909
 you already know that this is here 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.770
 important for the trick so let us know 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.170
 make you 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.030
 no problem, I'll explain it to you yes and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.899
 Now you come this nice fight 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.619
 animations and we see the old man 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.270
 fight against a wild of liu more 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.450
 or less we fight we use 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.170
 one of his 50 poker balls and throws 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:09.929
 this on the defenseless little horn mio 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:11.790
 and catches is of course you want right away 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.950
 You have to catch a pokemon first 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.239
 speak yes now we have directly 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.290
 learned again how to catch pokémon 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.610
 is great and now it is important that we 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:29.010
 fly to the cinnabar island which is here 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:30.660
 below and next you have to 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.459
 decide which old me because 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.920
 would like to duplicate that goes with it 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.760
 every item because not all items are 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.500
 a sense above all 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.580
 duplicating, for example, brings 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.209
 you absolutely nothing you can do it 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.670
 still do 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.989
 I 'm just the year 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.100
 screening of the set, effect to 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.450
 a believer decided here 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.890
 duplicate and this would have to be done now 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.739
 to the six at the sixth position 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.239
 Your laborious press her select so 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.830
 and dennis could have been chosen 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.610
 the sixth place will bring ten times 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.110
 you with 123456 that's easy 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.540
 then press select again 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.530
 his sixth job 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.640
 This also applies to all other items 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.120
 I would not have changed that now 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.190
 would 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.720
 m45 the chosen duplication 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.120
 have been used to yes next 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.250
 we surf here 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.220
 We'll take care of that who has it 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.350
 just in dragun you our dolls and the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.370
 choice with server and surf here and 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.310
 from 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.000
 and here comes a wild pokémon 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.799
 who is it an ebita rooster wants that too 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.140
 still level 43 interesting interesting 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.390
 for our trick but not relevant 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.180
 why are we just flying off? 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.590
 that has no desire for another bird 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.590
 fell here in the video 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:52.010
 a ditto also nice but not that 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.349
 what I'm looking for but nice that you 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.560
 here too , he smiles completely 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.560
 cute 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.980
 How long does it take until you take each one? 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.570
 that will find what you will see soon 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.160
 hopefully that can be done completely 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.840
 be different but that should be in the 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.730
 normal case does not take too long 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.500
 I have this trick already since I 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.350
 I do not know 6 7 years old 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.870
 be regularly used to say about it 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.600
 Of course , the trick may be eventual 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.420
 so damage your game 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.550
 a memory that can be in 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.660
 the most extreme case was me, though 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.580
 never happened yet it can 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.320
 happen and that's why I want you to 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.750
 Of course, that can make sure that 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.240
 your score is lost 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.260
 if you meet this adversary here 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.670
 bit yes then you can the game new 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.870
 stood so play does not break that 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.430
 you can play germany then it works 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.660
 again, however, can stop 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.000
 Speicherstadt lost in the 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.160
 Seriously, yes, everything you can do now 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.150
 either catch what the highest catch 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.290
 Probability has the game 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.030
 to somehow damage 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.890
 you can only fight me but you 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.730
 You can also just flee that I do 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.250
 now just as the fastest 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.880
 go for the video and now it is already 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.460
 so far 123456 now distinguished one 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.200
 even symbol with a number behind it 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.040
 that means we have 129 pieces of this 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.840
 items as soon as you're the hundredth at 100 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.010
 have arrived and another - will 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.840
 there are 99 there that's it 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.520
 summarized so goes the metric 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.190
 I hope I I helped 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.190
 Take care of your bird shot
