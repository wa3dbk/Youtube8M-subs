00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
technique for making the strap which is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.020 
technique for making the strap which is
just<00:00:33.180> cardboard<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.110> duct<00:00:34.290> tape<00:00:34.469> which<00:00:35.030> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
just cardboard and duct tape which it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.750 
just cardboard and duct tape which it
doesn't<00:00:36.390> sound<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:37.100> great<00:00:38.300> quality<00:00:39.300> but

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
doesn't sound that great quality but

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.319 
doesn't sound that great quality but
it's<00:00:41.760> actually<00:00:42.149> not<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.360> bad<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.730> I<00:00:44.730> just

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
it's actually not that bad and I just

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.840 
it's actually not that bad and I just
carve<00:00:46.170> everything<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> wood<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
carve everything in the wood with a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.799 
carve everything in the wood with a
dremel<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:50.309> took<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> long<00:00:51.090> time<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.719> this

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
dremel and it took a long time for this

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.689 
dremel and it took a long time for this
boat<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:52.820> there's<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.969> lot<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
boat to do it because there's a lot of

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.369 
boat to do it because there's a lot of
detail<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.789> everything<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.199> this

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
detail and everything and I think this

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.979 
detail and everything and I think this
boat<00:00:58.620> turned<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.460> little<00:01:00.180> better<00:01:00.510> than<00:01:01.309> no

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
boat turned out a little better than no

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.800 
boat turned out a little better than no
intercontinental<00:01:03.989> belt<00:01:05.090> but<00:01:06.090> because

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
intercontinental belt but because

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.230 
intercontinental belt but because
there's<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.409> lot<00:01:07.590> more<00:01:07.799> detail<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.970> one

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
there's a lot more detail on this one

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.649 
there's a lot more detail on this one
and<00:01:09.590> took<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> lot<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:11.159> time<00:01:13.760> kind<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.850> I'm

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
and took a lot more time kind of I'm

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.690 
and took a lot more time kind of I'm
pretty<00:01:15.900> proud<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.610> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
pretty proud of this one I think it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.570 
pretty proud of this one I think it
turned<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.320> pretty<00:01:19.320> decent<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.979> being<00:01:20.400> only

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580

turned out pretty decent for being only
my<00:01:20.790> second<00:01:21.210> thought<00:01:21.360> I've<00:01:22.229> ever<00:01:22.409> made

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
I'd another thing is I did this with the
