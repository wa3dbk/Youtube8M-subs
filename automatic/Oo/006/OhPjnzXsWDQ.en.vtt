00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.970
 very good to all and come to this 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.770
 new video of grand theft auto 5 in the 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.440
 that I am going to comment and teach you a little 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.510
 how can you get two vehicles that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.980
 they are strange but I'm sure that 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.360
 all of you who are very fond of 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.400
 game and have played quite a few hours 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.560
 for surely you know them and 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.510
 you have usaid is works to this video is not 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.699
 for you but it is for the people 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.140
 that has not yet seen it 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.150
 you can be sure of course that you 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.060
 I wanted to teach two excavators two 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.000
 heavy machinery machines as well 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.820
 say it can be found in gta 5 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.769
 in GTA 5 Online also in January 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.780
 can even but he assured us that they are 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.720
 locations that I'll tell the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.280
 gta 5 if online gta I can not 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.979
 ensure it's also true I love you 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.190
 teach two there is a third one that is a 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:53.470
 tunneling machine but that third one is more 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.360
 with a mold I found out that you can not 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.909
 catch it like that with the by standards 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.199
 you have to modify something and I 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.989
 honestly, I do not want to modify 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.729
 nothing my play or my game or anything like that 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.180
 that I will not teach you this 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.870
 way you can search for it in in by google 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.790
 tuning machine gta 5 and something will finally come out 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.220
 for these that come in the location 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.590
 of two of them the first is the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.510
 excavator the excavator is good then 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.160
 you are watching it in the video just where 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.800
 you can find it in always are in 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.690
 works is therefore can be found in 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.369
 some other location more but 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.920
 this is the most common here you can even 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.979
 find two to three even and the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.680
 second then it is this huge super truck 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.390
 own mines so if they see anything 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.610
 this are the two vehicles that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.960
 they would be a signal as it had already been said 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.479
 you have played a lot since the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.729
 you will know but if not then they will be 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.340
 quite curious and surely not 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.899
 you have seen you know you played as few 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.009
 hours finally I hope you liked it 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.690
 And until next time 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.550
 goodbye 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.670
 to me 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.670
 i
