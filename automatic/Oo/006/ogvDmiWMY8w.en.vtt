 hello everyone is welcome video branch for 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.420
 the purge in the academy today we talk about 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.519
 a cosmetic treatment for nails e 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.309
 specifically we will talk about treatment 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.139
 last growth composed precisely of not 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.580
 there is regenerating is an active base 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.920
 growth 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.500
 let's see specifically first of all 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.250
 how to apply regenerating gel is what 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.250
 contains inside 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.750
 let's start with the gel that will come 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.380
 applied on clean nails even on the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.969
 cuticles as circular movements 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.340
 directly with the appropriate applicator 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.079
 in fact this applicator helps us to 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.969
 massage the product well on 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.739
 nails and puti cole 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.170
 this product is the formula in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.280
 water-based gel with valuable vitamins 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.320
 encapsulated micro help the general 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.910
 nail structure and to favor the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.160
 growth thanks derivatives of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.100
 amino acids is also enriched with 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.559
 marine plant extracts from properties 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.750
 regenerating in fact you have to feel that 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.400
 also the smell really good and after 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.979
 having massaged well with the applicator 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.930
 we can conclude the absorption of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.860
 gel with circular movements directly 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.110
 with the fingers 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.030
 so let's massage with fine first 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.070
 the applicator and then proceed with the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.979
 fingers to make jazz stay away 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.710
 all the while continuing to massage 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.259
 I tell you some curiosities about growth 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.880
 nail the growth process 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.729
 of the tested union carries a process 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.060
 continuous even if the speed varies 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.950
 various according to age and maximum in the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.070
 period of childhood and decreases 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.130
 progressively with age 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.829
 there is no exact mm number of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.600
 daily growth as the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.939
 Nail growth varies from subject to 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.880
 subject 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:54.220
 the normal growth of the nail of the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.190
 hand varies between one point eight to 4 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.910
 5 mm per month so it could be estimated 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.100
 an average growth rate of 0.1 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.930
 millimeters per day 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.460
 however the important thing is that the nail 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.850
 to have proper growth must 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.250
 being a strong and healthy nail after was 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.500
 precisely made to serve this well 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.180
 gel we take a simple risked of 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.340
 cotton and remove or any 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.070
 excess over long before applying the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.260
 base now let's take the second one 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.170
 product contained in the kit that precisely 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.840
 the active basis growth this base is a 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.209
 true treatment for weak short nails 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.640
 because it favors the growth of 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.640
 nails making them elastic and resistant 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.070
 moreover enriched with vitamins is in 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.430
 natural regenerating layers to adapt 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.340
 precisely estimate the growth to a finish 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.230
 transparent brilliant and this causes that 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.770
 in fact we can use it not only 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.170
 as a protective butter before one 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.700
 colored enamel but we could use it 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.640
 even on its own to have precisely or 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.630
 a natural nail then effect 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.230
 natural but with this ultra finish 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.230
 brilliant
