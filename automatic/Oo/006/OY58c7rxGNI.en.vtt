00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 that hour of positive news by 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.160
 the first time they meet in Bogota two of 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.049
 the best philharmonic orchestras 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.450
 juveniles of the city though 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.460
 will interpret several pieces together these 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.290
 young people have never had the opportunity 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.790
 to know is filled tell us what 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.020
 groups we are talking to mercedes 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.940
 we are talking about the orchestra 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.650
 juvenile philharmonic of the town of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.539
 san crist칩bal genres of the city and the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 gymnasium philharmonic orchestra 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.619
 pines located at 193 street by the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.599
 distance these young people have never 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.980
 However, the director 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.960
 of the orchestras in the same force 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.759
 that's why today they are in a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.759
 concert without problems 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.020
 for Fabi치n Cotelo an Argentinian who 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.320
 declares love of colombia music 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.000
 it is a true complement that's why its 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.190
 greatest challenge has been to direct two 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.350
 Philharmonic orchestras each in a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.020
 end of the city the process let's say 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.059
 production started a year ago when 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.100
 one conceives the idea and begins to dream 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.750
 with the possibilities to direct the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.820
 gymnasium orchestra the pines and the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 juvenile philharmonic of san crist칩bal has 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 been a job that today will pay off 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.080
 in a symphonic encounter without 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.770
 precedents with a single objective 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.930
 to break down barriers let's say 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.500
 strata what is the problem here is 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.530
 if the child did not look at me and the notebook was 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.630
 the cover that I wanted and there is if I have 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.730
 if I pass through the mountain to get a 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.620
 sayo the director of both orchestras 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.750
 He has been preparing this concert for a year 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.010
 in different places these children never 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.270
 have been seen with the children of san 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.460
 crist칩bal today they will do it for the first time 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.170
 for these children and young people the music is 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.659
 the clearest example of union and 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.689
 Fraternity for me is a very honor 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.890
 big because it's almost sometimes impossible 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.780
 by filiation 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.549
 you have to have a lot of foundation to be able 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.940
 be in a chorus that is as big as 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.010
 this face 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.260
 this concert will undoubtedly leave a 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.620
 footprint worth continuing to see us as well as 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.090
 you see it now it really is 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.159
 Excites too much is too much 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.990
 it is well expected that this is just the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.850
 first of a series of wins thank you 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 to the collaboration of many talents that 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.909
 they put aside the barriers and they 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.909
 they joined the rhythm of music
