00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.629 

as<00:00:11.830> I<00:00:12.190> was<00:00:12.340> saying<00:00:12.610> my<00:00:12.820> wife<00:00:14.010> said<00:00:15.010> to<00:00:15.190> me<00:00:15.340> today

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
as I was saying my wife said to me today

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.310 
as I was saying my wife said to me today
when<00:00:15.910> I<00:00:15.940> came<00:00:16.059> in<00:00:16.420> she<00:00:16.600> can<00:00:16.720> hear<00:00:16.900> me<00:00:16.930> come<00:00:17.170> up

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
when I came in she can hear me come up

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.610 
when I came in she can hear me come up
the<00:00:17.439> driveway<00:00:17.470> now<00:00:18.070> with<00:00:18.279> these<00:00:18.400> fights<00:00:18.700> on

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.350 

the<00:00:22.980> client<00:00:23.370> we<00:00:23.430> still<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.790> the<00:00:23.910> same<00:00:24.120> amount

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
the client we still have the same amount

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.300 
the client we still have the same amount
of<00:00:24.540> torque<00:00:24.810> with<00:00:25.050> it

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
of torque with it

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.640 
of torque with it
shifting<00:00:27.150> seems<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.690> a<00:00:27.840> little<00:00:28.170> different

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
shifting seems just a little different

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.970 
shifting seems just a little different
for<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.860> Rebs<00:00:29.360> but<00:00:30.360> I<00:00:30.779> don't<00:00:31.680> know<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:31.800> that's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
for the Rebs but I don't know if that's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
for the Rebs but I don't know if that's
an<00:00:32.130> indication<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.760> the<00:00:32.790> bikes<00:00:33.030> or<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.360> or

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
an indication on the bikes or not or

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.310 
an indication on the bikes or not or
it's<00:00:33.720> just<00:00:33.780> my<00:00:34.940> imagination

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.620 

3<00:00:41.150> here's<00:00:42.150> where<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:43.410> had<00:00:43.560> to<00:00:43.710> cut<00:00:43.980> off<00:00:44.130> those

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
3 here's where you had to cut off those

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.470 
3 here's where you had to cut off those
rear<00:00:45.630> footnotes<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.280> said<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.640> local<00:00:47.970> she

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
rear footnotes and said in local she

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.050 
rear footnotes and said in local she
chopped<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.900> and<00:00:49.340> had<00:00:50.340> activity<00:00:50.790> in<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> ball

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
chopped it and had activity in the ball

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.150 
chopped it and had activity in the ball
for<00:00:51.270> hours

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:06.070 

we're<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> use<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.300> existing<00:00:57.600> rocket

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.230 

so<00:01:06.290> she<00:01:06.350> sounds<00:01:06.770> pretty<00:01:06.860> good<00:01:07.430> Julie<00:01:07.970> rips

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
so she sounds pretty good Julie rips

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.390 
so she sounds pretty good Julie rips
down<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.480> road<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.930> can<00:01:08.960> hear<00:01:09.290> me<00:01:09.410> now<00:01:09.560> so

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
down the road you can hear me now so

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:20.800 
down the road you can hear me now so
then<00:01:10.610> again<00:01:10.790> loud<00:01:11.030> pipes<00:01:11.300> do<00:01:11.690> not<00:01:11.900> save<00:01:12.200> lives

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.870 

I<00:01:20.899> don't<00:01:21.290> know<00:01:21.350> if<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:21.500> get<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.740> hit<00:01:21.950> side<00:01:22.610> shot

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
I don't know if I get a hit side shot

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:35.590 
I don't know if I get a hit side shot
here<00:01:23.090> or<00:01:23.119> not

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.860 

so<00:01:36.020> they're<00:01:36.170> pretty<00:01:36.290> clean

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
so they're pretty clean

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
and I'm saying my next step will be for

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.940 
and I'm saying my next step will be for
the<00:01:46.630> left<00:01:46.930> side<00:01:48.120> running<00:01:49.120> board<00:01:49.360> here<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.950> don't
