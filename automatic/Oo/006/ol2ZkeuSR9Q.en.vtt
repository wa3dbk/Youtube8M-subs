figure<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:06.030> potential<00:02:06.450> pose<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
figure so this is one potential pose I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.969 
figure so this is one potential pose I
might<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.409> him<00:02:07.530> in

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:20.190 

the<00:02:10.979> detail<00:02:11.579> of<00:02:11.730> that's<00:02:11.939> great

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.720 

so<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.190> one<00:02:21.400> pose

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.339 

on<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.510> next<00:02:25.720> one<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.489> here<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.349> second

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
on to the next one so here is the second

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.160 
on to the next one so here is the second
pose<00:02:29.610> because<00:02:30.610> he's<00:02:30.910> from<00:02:31.150> Iron<00:02:31.450> Man<00:02:31.599> 3<00:02:31.870> I

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
pose because he's from Iron Man 3 I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.920 
pose because he's from Iron Man 3 I
thought<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.500> opposed<00:02:32.800> him<00:02:32.980> with<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.370> Python<00:02:33.970> in

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
thought I opposed him with the Python in

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.930 
thought I opposed him with the Python in
ace<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.440> combat<00:02:35.890> scene<00:02:36.220> where<00:02:36.580> they're<00:02:36.760> both

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
ace of combat scene where they're both

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.850 
ace of combat scene where they're both
fighting<00:02:37.450> off<00:02:37.569> an<00:02:37.690> attack<00:02:38.019> from<00:02:38.349> various

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
repulsor firing pose leaning forward

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.930 
repulsor firing pose leaning forward
very<00:02:46.269> aggressive<00:02:46.780> pose<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.380> I've<00:02:48.250> got<00:02:48.489> the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
very aggressive pose and I've got the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.960 
very aggressive pose and I've got the

Python with his head head mask up the
faceplate<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.450> up<00:02:53.069> this<00:02:54.069> is<00:02:54.280> not<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:56.140> standard

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
faceplate is up this is not the standard

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.430 
faceplate is up this is not the standard
Python<00:02:57.459> faceplates<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.420> custom<00:02:58.870> head

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
Python faceplates it's a custom head

Python faceplates it's a custom head
sculpt<00:02:59.799> here<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.810> don't<00:03:01.810> expect<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.440> be

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
sculpt here so don't expect it to be

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.530 
sculpt here so don't expect it to be
everywhere<00:03:03.130> but<00:03:03.400> it's<00:03:03.549> something<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.360> picked

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
everywhere but it's something I picked

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.509 
everywhere but it's something I picked
up<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.810> thought<00:03:04.989> was<00:03:05.110> quite<00:03:05.260> nice<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:09.220> star

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
up I thought was quite nice the star

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.970 
up I thought was quite nice the star
boosts<00:03:09.790> feels<00:03:10.390> very<00:03:10.810> solid<00:03:11.230> when<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.680> put<00:03:11.860> it

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
boosts feels very solid when you put it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.949 
boosts feels very solid when you put it
a<00:03:12.010> pose<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.610> feels<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.269> it's<00:03:13.480> going<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.690> stay

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
a pose it feels that it's going to stay

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.430 
a pose it feels that it's going to stay
in<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.230> pose<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.720> think<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.319> get

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
in that pose so you can I think and get

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.710 
in that pose so you can I think and get
a<00:03:17.470> lot<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.799> range<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.130> motion<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.390> think

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
a lot of range of motion and I think

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.670 
a lot of range of motion and I think
that<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.530> pose<00:03:20.860> is<00:03:21.390> an<00:03:22.390> iconic<00:03:23.700> Iron<00:03:24.700> Man

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
that this pose is an iconic Iron Man

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.009 
that this pose is an iconic Iron Man
attacking<00:03:26.680> pose<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.760> just<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.720> looks

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
attacking pose and it just it looks

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.750 
attacking pose and it just it looks
really<00:03:29.530> good<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:30.010> contrast<00:03:30.489> in<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.700> colors

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
really good the contrast in the colors

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.289 
really good the contrast in the colors
between<00:03:31.389> the<00:03:31.690> black<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.260> white<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:33.299> the

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
between the black the white the the

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:47.000 
between the black the white the the
plates<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.290> has<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.769> ceramic<00:03:36.340> plates

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.360 

so<00:03:47.640> yeah<00:03:47.849> I<00:03:48.120> like<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.569> quite<00:03:48.810> like<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:48.989> pose

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
so yeah I like I quite like this pose

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.649 
so yeah I like I quite like this pose
hadn't<00:03:50.370> decided<00:03:50.760> which<00:03:50.879> ones<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.239> use<00:03:51.420> yet

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
hadn't decided which ones you use yet

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.399 
hadn't decided which ones you use yet
for<00:03:51.870> my<00:03:51.959> display<00:03:53.269> so<00:03:54.269> let's<00:03:54.569> go<00:03:54.750> on<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.019> the

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
for my display so let's go on to the

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:00.080 
for my display so let's go on to the
final<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.610> third<00:03:57.150> pose<00:03:58.069> right<00:03:59.069> guys<00:03:59.340> this<00:04:00.030> is

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
final and third pose right guys this is

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.160 
final and third pose right guys this is
the<00:04:00.209> third<00:04:00.440> pose<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.849> actually<00:04:02.849> spent<00:04:03.239> about<00:04:03.510> 20

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
the third pose I actually spent about 20

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.930 
the third pose I actually spent about 20
minutes<00:04:04.530> trying<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.890> do<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.160> power<00:04:05.370> pose<00:04:05.670> with

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
minutes trying to do the power pose with

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.250 
minutes trying to do the power pose with
him<00:04:06.090> if<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:07.010> guys<00:04:08.010> are<00:04:08.780> planning<00:04:09.780> on<00:04:09.930> giving<00:04:10.080> a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
him if you guys are planning on giving a

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.000 
him if you guys are planning on giving a
try<00:04:11.209> be<00:04:12.209> careful<00:04:12.690> because<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.590> could<00:04:13.799> well

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
try be careful because you could well

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.680 
try be careful because you could well
scratch<00:04:14.310> some<00:04:14.519> paint<00:04:14.730> off<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.180> have<00:04:15.510> done

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
scratch some paint off that I have done

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.920 
scratch some paint off that I have done
already<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:17.449> don't<00:04:18.449> think<00:04:18.810> it's

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
already and I don't think it's

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.590 
already and I don't think it's
articulated<00:04:19.680> enough<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:19.979> do<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.579> have<00:04:21.419> seen

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
articulated enough to do it I have seen

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.120 
articulated enough to do it I have seen
a<00:04:21.630> picture<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:22.079> it<00:04:22.169> online<00:04:22.350> that<00:04:22.680> someone<00:04:22.949> has

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
a picture of it online that someone has

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.650 
a picture of it online that someone has
done<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.490> he<00:04:23.639> may<00:04:23.850> have<00:04:23.910> just<00:04:24.090> taken<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.479> ball

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
done it he may have just taken the ball

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.510 
done it he may have just taken the ball
joint<00:04:24.990> off<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:26.070> leg

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
joint off the the leg

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.310 
joint off the the leg
I<00:04:26.550> don't<00:04:26.820> think<00:04:26.880> articulation<00:04:27.630> allows<00:04:27.960> for<00:04:28.260> it

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
I don't think articulation allows for it

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.740 
I don't think articulation allows for it
but<00:04:28.530> I'm<00:04:28.979> sure<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.520> reviewers<00:04:29.970> will<00:04:30.000> probably

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
but I'm sure the reviewers will probably

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.409 
but I'm sure the reviewers will probably
go<00:04:30.870> through<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.289> because<00:04:31.850> they<00:04:32.850> want<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.150> see

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
go through it because they want to see

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.300 
go through it because they want to see
if<00:04:33.510> what's<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.139> range<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.560> motion<00:04:34.830> he<00:04:34.889> can<00:04:35.100> do

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
if what's the range of motion he can do

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.490 
if what's the range of motion he can do
but<00:04:35.520> anyway<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.940> decided<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.780> go<00:04:36.900> for<00:04:36.930> this<00:04:37.289> of

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
but anyway I decided to go for this of

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.180 
but anyway I decided to go for this of
space<00:04:38.039> I'm<00:04:38.400> floating<00:04:39.240> an<00:04:39.330> orbit<00:04:39.780> type<00:04:40.050> look<00:04:40.350> so

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
space I'm floating an orbit type look so

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.990 
space I'm floating an orbit type look so
his<00:04:41.310> arms<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:42.740> help<00:04:43.740> position<00:04:44.550> keeping<00:04:44.820> his

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
his arms just help position keeping his

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.650 
his arms just help position keeping his
position<00:04:45.530> outside<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:47.010> space<00:04:47.460> station<00:04:47.660> while

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
position outside the space station while

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.170 
position outside the space station while
he's<00:04:48.900> working<00:04:49.110> on<00:04:49.410> something<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:50.070> there<00:04:51.030> he

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
he's working on something and there he

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.640 
he's working on something and there he
is<00:04:51.270> conscious<00:04:51.539> floating<00:04:52.200> in<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.380> air<00:04:54.650> giving

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
is conscious floating in the air giving

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.430 
is conscious floating in the air giving
that<00:04:55.860> overall<00:04:59.510> orbital<00:05:00.510> look<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.289> I<00:05:01.410> think

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
that overall orbital look and I think

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.029 
that overall orbital look and I think
this<00:05:02.010> is<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.220> fantastic<00:05:02.910> suit<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:04.039> the

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
this is a fantastic suit and the

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.420 
this is a fantastic suit and the
dimensions<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.120> flexibility<00:05:07.430> absolutely

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
dimensions the flexibility absolutely

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.070 
dimensions the flexibility absolutely
perfect<00:05:08.880> I<00:05:09.000> can't<00:05:09.270> fault<00:05:09.539> this<00:05:09.690> at<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.930> moment

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
perfect I can't fault this at the moment

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.560 
perfect I can't fault this at the moment
that<00:05:10.860> I've<00:05:11.010> I've<00:05:11.550> only<00:05:11.970> had<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.180> for<00:05:12.270> about<00:05:12.450> a

that I've I've only had it for about a

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.060 
that I've I've only had it for about a
couple<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:12.900> hours<00:05:13.050> playing<00:05:13.560> about<00:05:13.800> with<00:05:13.950> it

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
couple of hours playing about with it

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.790 
couple of hours playing about with it
and<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:15.150> few<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.750> know<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:16.020> few<00:05:16.139> collectors<00:05:16.530> have

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
and a few I know a few collectors have

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.440 
and a few I know a few collectors have
it<00:05:16.889> already<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.610> review<00:05:17.970> is<00:05:18.090> I'm<00:05:18.210> sure

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
it already and the review is I'm sure

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.409 
it already and the review is I'm sure
going<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:18.810> loads<00:05:19.139> of<00:05:19.229> detail<00:05:19.380> about<00:05:19.889> this<00:05:20.099> but

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
going to loads of detail about this but

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.360 
going to loads of detail about this but
one<00:05:21.419> of<00:05:21.539> I<00:05:21.780> think<00:05:22.380> actually<00:05:22.530> one<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.950> best

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
one of I think actually one of the best

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.360 
one of I think actually one of the best
iron<00:05:24.120> figures<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.169> have<00:05:25.260> come<00:05:25.440> out<00:05:25.590> I'm<00:05:25.919> so

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
iron figures that have come out I'm so

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.680 
iron figures that have come out I'm so
impressed<00:05:26.639> by<00:05:26.880> this<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.300> I<00:05:27.330> don't<00:05:27.389> normally

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
impressed by this and I don't normally

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.400 
impressed by this and I don't normally
