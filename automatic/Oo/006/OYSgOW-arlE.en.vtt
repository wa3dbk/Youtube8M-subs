garments the other thing we're going to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.050 
garments the other thing we're going to
show<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.650> use<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> water-based<00:00:29.429> ink<00:00:29.789> with

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
show is the use of water-based ink with

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359 
show is the use of water-based ink with
the<00:00:30.179> standard<00:00:30.689> plastisol<00:00:31.230> emulsion<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.189> see

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the standard plastisol emulsion you see

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.889 
the standard plastisol emulsion you see
this<00:00:32.489> emulsion<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.969> pink<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
this emulsion is pink it's just the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.410 
this emulsion is pink it's just the
standard<00:00:34.230> DXP<00:00:34.680> duo<00:00:34.920> cure<00:00:35.219> emulsion<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.820> we're

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
standard DXP duo cure emulsion and we're

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.700 
standard DXP duo cure emulsion and we're
going<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.600> print<00:00:36.840> some<00:00:37.020> white<00:00:37.170> ink<00:00:37.380> through<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
going to print some white ink through it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.830 
going to print some white ink through it
to<00:00:38.129> show<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.399> their<00:00:38.730> adverse<00:00:39.180> effects<00:00:39.600> that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
to show you their adverse effects that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.530 
to show you their adverse effects that
water-based<00:00:40.290> ink<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> emulsion

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
water-based ink can have on the emulsion

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.180 
water-based ink can have on the emulsion
let's<00:00:42.540> load<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> screen<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.410> ink<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
let's load the screen up with ink as you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.920 
let's load the screen up with ink as you
see<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.550> ink<00:00:44.789> has<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> lot<00:00:45.239> more<00:00:45.270> pigment<00:00:45.840> in

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
see this ink has a lot more pigment in

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.840 
see this ink has a lot more pigment in
it<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.710> much<00:00:46.890> thicker<00:00:47.280> than<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.700> other

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it so it's much thicker than your other

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
it so it's much thicker than your other
RC<00:00:48.420> colors<00:00:50.510> you<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.690> want<00:00:51.930> more<00:00:52.170> ink<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.590> your

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
RC colors you do want more ink on your

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.369 
RC colors you do want more ink on your
screen<00:00:53.039> than<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.340> standard<00:00:53.520> plastisol<00:00:57.379> once

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
screen than your standard plastisol once

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.689 
screen than your standard plastisol once
loaded<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.859> always<00:00:59.070> want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.280> make<00:00:59.370> sure<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
loaded you always want to make sure to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.060 
loaded you always want to make sure to
cap<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.030> ink<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.780> clean<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:01.620> goob<00:01:01.800> scoop

pretty much cleaned out except for that

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.790 
pretty much cleaned out except for that
corner<00:04:35.850> right<00:04:35.880> there<00:04:36.320> so<00:04:37.320> now<00:04:37.500> what<00:04:37.620> we<00:04:37.740> need

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
corner right there so now what we need

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.360 
corner right there so now what we need
to<00:04:37.920> do<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:39.020> we<00:04:40.020> need<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.200> scrape<00:04:40.500> as<00:04:40.710> much<00:04:41.100> ink

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
to do is we need to scrape as much ink

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:52.250 
to do is we need to scrape as much ink
out<00:04:41.580> as<00:04:41.730> possible<00:04:42.360> over<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:43.020> print<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:51.260> then

out as possible over the print and then

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.670 
out as possible over the print and then
if<00:04:52.410> needed<00:04:52.860> we'll<00:04:53.580> hit<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:54.500> with<00:04:55.500> a<00:04:55.560> little

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680

water<00:06:21.540> so<00:06:22.169> the<00:06:22.290> water<00:06:22.320> in<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:22.770> ink<00:06:22.950> actually

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310

water so the water in the ink actually
starts<00:06:23.640> to<00:06:23.760> adversely<00:06:24.150> affect<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:24.750> emulsion

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
starts to adversely affect the emulsion

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.590 
starts to adversely affect the emulsion
on<00:06:25.169> the<00:06:25.290> screen<00:06:25.530> itself<00:06:26.120> right<00:06:27.120> now<00:06:27.270> we'll<00:06:27.479> see

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
on the screen itself right now we'll see

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.909 
on the screen itself right now we'll see
how<00:06:27.720> it<00:06:27.750> prints<00:06:28.229> and<00:06:28.350> how<00:06:28.440> it<00:06:28.590> already

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
how it prints and how it already

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:30.500 
how it prints and how it already
degrades<00:06:29.250> the<00:06:29.370> edge<00:06:29.520> definition<00:06:30.240> on<00:06:30.330> the

degrades the edge definition on the

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:40.910 
degrades the edge definition on the
design

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.860 

we<00:06:41.920> can<00:06:42.040> already<00:06:42.190> see<00:06:42.490> right<00:06:42.700> here<00:06:43.150> right<00:06:43.750> over

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
we can already see right here right over

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.440 
we can already see right here right over
here<00:06:44.290> right<00:06:44.980> here<00:06:45.280> that<00:06:45.790> our<00:06:45.850> edges<00:06:46.270> aren't

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
here right here that our edges aren't

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.350 
here right here that our edges aren't
crisp<00:06:46.810> anymore<00:06:47.290> in<00:06:48.250> fact<00:06:48.700> right<00:06:48.940> there<00:06:49.180> the

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
crisp anymore in fact right there the

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.420 
crisp anymore in fact right there the
emulsion<00:06:49.690> is<00:06:49.870> actually<00:06:50.320> let<00:06:50.650> go<00:06:50.860> enough<00:06:51.190> for

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
emulsion is actually let go enough for

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.610 
emulsion is actually let go enough for
ink<00:06:51.580> to<00:06:51.760> start<00:06:52.000> showing<00:06:52.390> through<00:06:52.690> it<00:06:52.810> so<00:06:53.560> you

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
ink to start showing through it so you

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.380 
ink to start showing through it so you
definitely<00:06:53.860> want<00:06:54.100> to<00:06:54.250> use<00:06:54.460> a<00:06:54.490> water-resistant

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
definitely want to use a water-resistant

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.210 
definitely want to use a water-resistant
emulsion<00:06:55.630> have<00:06:56.050> proper<00:06:56.500> exposure<00:06:56.890> when

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
emulsion have proper exposure when

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.300 
emulsion have proper exposure when
you're<00:06:57.340> printing<00:06:57.550> with<00:06:57.790> these<00:06:57.940> inks
