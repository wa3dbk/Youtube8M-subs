00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.600 

so<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:30.410> first<00:00:30.620> thing<00:00:30.890> I<00:00:30.920> kind<00:00:31.130> of<00:00:31.250> want<00:00:31.430> to<00:00:31.460> do

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
so the first thing I kind of want to do

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.730 
so the first thing I kind of want to do
before<00:00:31.850> I<00:00:32.090> even<00:00:32.870> build<00:00:33.080> the<00:00:33.260> whole<00:00:33.410> caves

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
before I even build the whole caves

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.800 
before I even build the whole caves
there's<00:00:34.490> snow<00:00:34.640> shelters<00:00:35.060> I<00:00:35.150> want<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.360> pack<00:00:35.570> out

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
there's snow shelters I want to pack out

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.060 
there's snow shelters I want to pack out
the<00:00:35.960> initial<00:00:36.320> spot<00:00:36.620> where<00:00:36.800> I'm<00:00:36.890> going<00:00:37.010> to

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
the initial spot where I'm going to

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.340 
the initial spot where I'm going to
build<00:00:37.190> it<00:00:37.400> from<00:00:37.670> picking<00:00:38.510> right<00:00:38.660> here<00:00:38.870> decent

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
build it from picking right here decent

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.870 
build it from picking right here decent
light<00:00:39.530> it's<00:00:39.860> good<00:00:40.040> good<00:00:40.220> consideration<00:00:40.700> a

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
light it's good good consideration a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.180 
light it's good good consideration a
little<00:00:41.030> bit<00:00:41.120> of<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.300> slant<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.930> be<00:00:42.050> helpful<00:00:42.500> and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
little bit of a slant to be helpful and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.590 
little bit of a slant to be helpful and
we're<00:00:43.370> just<00:00:43.430> going<00:00:43.580> to<00:00:43.670> pack<00:00:43.879> this<00:00:44.090> down<00:00:44.360> and

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
we're just going to pack this down and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.390 
we're just going to pack this down and
then<00:00:44.690> throw<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:44.989> bunch<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.379> snow<00:00:45.590> on<00:00:45.710> top<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.070> it

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
then throw a bunch of snow on top of it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.220 
then throw a bunch of snow on top of it
it's<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.000> old<00:00:47.150> master<00:00:47.540> plan<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:47.960> make<00:00:48.110> an

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
it's the old master plan and make an

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.040 
it's the old master plan and make an
edge<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.590> it<00:00:48.680> comes<00:00:48.920> in<00:00:49.100> from<00:00:49.309> down<00:00:49.489> below<00:00:50.050> all

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
edge and it comes in from down below all

00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:10.600 
edge and it comes in from down below all
right<00:00:51.170> pack<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:51.440> down

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.240 

you<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.060> mix<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.990> snow<00:01:13.770> by

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you just need to mix up the snow by

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
you just need to mix up the snow by
mixing<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> snow<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.479> science<00:01:15.900> behind<00:01:16.050> it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
mixing the snow up the science behind it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
mixing the snow up the science behind it
is<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.800> it<00:01:17.010> all<00:01:17.130> glues<00:01:17.490> back<00:01:17.700> together<00:01:17.940> so

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
is that it all glues back together so

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.390 
is that it all glues back together so
the<00:01:18.600> bonds<00:01:19.050> within<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> everything<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the bonds within it everything like a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.790 
the bonds within it everything like a
snow<00:01:20.729> bank<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> shovel<00:01:22.050> by<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.650> it's

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
snow bank with a shovel by it so it's

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.010 
snow bank with a shovel by it so it's
hard<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> rock<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> make<00:01:24.780> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
hard as a rock you want to make so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.930 
hard as a rock you want to make so
that's<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.440> that<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.280> hard<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> rock<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
that's like that so it's hard to rock to

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.080 
that's like that so it's hard to rock to
build<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> outside<00:01:27.690> shell<00:01:28.020> good<00:01:29.009> way<00:01:29.159> mix<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
build the outside shell good way mix it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
build the outside shell good way mix it
all<00:01:30.300> up<00:01:30.330> by<00:01:30.630> stepping<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.800> makes<00:01:32.009> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
all up by stepping on it that makes it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:41.200 
all up by stepping on it that makes it
hard<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> rock

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.639 

that<00:01:42.210> easy<00:01:42.450> part<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:42.960> putting<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> big<00:01:43.439> pile

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that easy part was putting the big pile

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
that easy part was putting the big pile
of<00:01:43.770> snow<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.369> hard<00:01:44.579> part<00:01:44.820> begins<00:01:44.880> now

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
of snow on the hard part begins now

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.100 
of snow on the hard part begins now
which<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.320> Simon<00:01:46.679> -<00:01:46.859> in<00:01:46.950> my<00:01:47.100> hand<00:01:47.340> off<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.110> want

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
which is Simon - in my hand off I want

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.450 
which is Simon - in my hand off I want
to<00:01:49.200> dig<00:01:49.350> down<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> way<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> ground

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to dig down all the way to the ground

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.399 
to dig down all the way to the ground
for<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.179> entry<00:01:51.600> hole<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.110> want<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.289> be

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
for my entry hole because you want to be

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.749 
for my entry hole because you want to be
low<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:52.979> one<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.219> reason<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.520> kind<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
low that's one of the reason we kind of

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.700 
low that's one of the reason we kind of
picked<00:01:53.969> a<00:01:54.060> hill<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.289> want<00:01:55.500> your

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
picked a hill here now you want your

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.190 
picked a hill here now you want your
opening<00:01:56.069> to<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:56.969> small<00:01:57.299> enough<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.869> keeps

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
opening to be small enough that it keeps

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.510 
opening to be small enough that it keeps
the<00:01:58.380> heat<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.709> big<00:01:58.950> enough<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.459> not

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the heat in but big enough that it's not

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
the heat in but big enough that it's not
so<00:01:59.819> difficult<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.270> build<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> Quincy

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
so difficult to build the Quincy

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:41.720 
so difficult to build the Quincy
that<00:02:01.740> balance<00:02:02.179> is<00:02:03.179> a<00:02:03.240> tricky<00:02:03.569> one

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.100 

yeah<00:02:42.730> I'm<00:02:42.940> just<00:02:43.150> holding<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.600> handle<00:02:43.960> like

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
yeah I'm just holding the handle like

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.800 
yeah I'm just holding the handle like
this<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:44.650> scraping<00:02:45.130> away<00:02:45.360> make<00:02:46.360> some<00:02:46.570> snow

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
this and scraping away make some snow

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.300 
this and scraping away make some snow
and<00:02:46.990> can<00:02:47.200> push<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.500> down<00:02:47.650> hill<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.010> push<00:02:48.130> it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
and can push it down hill and push it

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.240 
and can push it down hill and push it
out<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:49.090> idea<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.690> gotta<00:02:50.440> lurk<00:02:50.740> one<00:02:50.950> side

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
out the idea that gotta lurk one side

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.240 
out the idea that gotta lurk one side
and<00:02:51.610> roll<00:02:52.090> over<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.540> work<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.840> other<00:02:52.930> side

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
and roll over and work the other side

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.590 
and roll over and work the other side
but<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.550> can<00:02:54.670> definitely<00:02:54.760> get<00:02:55.030> inside<00:02:55.420> of

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
but you can definitely get inside of

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.350 
but you can definitely get inside of
this<00:02:55.690> if<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.020> were<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> nasty<00:02:57.010> blizzard<00:02:57.670> and

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
this if you were in a nasty blizzard and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.940 
this if you were in a nasty blizzard and
it<00:02:58.510> was<00:02:58.600> really<00:02:58.840> bad<00:02:58.990> out<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.500> would<00:02:59.620> be<00:02:59.710> a<00:02:59.740> lot
