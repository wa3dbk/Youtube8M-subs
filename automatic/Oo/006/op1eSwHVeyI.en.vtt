anything<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> lot<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.960> science

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
anything like this it's a lot of science

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.310 
anything like this it's a lot of science
courses<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:29.039> anatomy<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.640> physiology

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
courses it's anatomy and physiology

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.860 
courses it's anatomy and physiology
biochem<00:00:31.460> organic<00:00:32.460> chem<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.149> two<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
biochem organic chem one and two so you

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.299 
biochem organic chem one and two so you
definitely<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.710> an<00:00:34.829> interest<00:00:35.130> in

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
definitely have to have an interest in

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.610 
definitely have to have an interest in
the<00:00:35.430> science<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.510> strong<00:00:36.840> background<00:00:37.200> in

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
go on for your master's degree you have

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.619 
go on for your master's degree you have
to<00:00:45.140> find<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.500> place<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.309> internship<00:00:47.700> this

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
to find a place to do an internship this

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.660 
to find a place to do an internship this
internship<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.680> full-time<00:00:50.309> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
internship if you go full-time is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.819 
internship if you go full-time is
somewhere<00:00:51.210> between<00:00:51.390> six<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.110> nine<00:00:52.289> months<00:00:52.680> if

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
somewhere between six to nine months if

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.779 
somewhere between six to nine months if
you<00:00:52.890> go<00:00:53.190> part-time

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
you go part-time

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.500 
you go part-time
then<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.390> two-year<00:00:55.070> internship<00:00:56.070> process<00:00:56.510> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
then it's two-year internship process so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.819 
then it's two-year internship process so

you have to do the internship and then

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.520 
you have to do the internship and then
you<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.890> pass<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.370> national<00:01:02.969> exam<00:01:03.530> now

you have to pass the national exam now

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
you have to pass the national exam now
once<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.850> sit<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.299> exam

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that I had to do two years of the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
that I had to do two years of the
science<00:01:27.180> prerequisites<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
but it's quite a long process especially

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.850 
but it's quite a long process especially
if<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.450> don't<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.290> undergraduate

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
if you don't have your undergraduate

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
degree in a nutrition related field it's

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.469 
degree in a nutrition related field it's
much<00:02:01.530> longer<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.430> almost<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.210> to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
much longer it's almost like going to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.050 
much longer it's almost like going to
medical<00:02:03.899> school<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:05.130> well<00:02:05.340> worth<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.850> in

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
medical school but it's well worth it in

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.290 
medical school but it's well worth it in
the<00:02:06.119> end<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.250> becoming<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.399> dietitian<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.179> you
