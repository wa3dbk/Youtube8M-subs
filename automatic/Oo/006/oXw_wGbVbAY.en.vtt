00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.230 
another review for some gear this time
it<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:07.049> for<00:00:07.429> some<00:00:08.429> hunting<00:00:08.760> boots<00:00:09.830> they<00:00:10.830> are

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
it is for some hunting boots they are

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.390 
it is for some hunting boots they are
danner<00:00:12.349> pronghorns<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.650> these<00:00:13.950> actually<00:00:14.340> were

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
danner pronghorns on these actually were

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.680 
danner pronghorns on these actually were
sold<00:00:14.639> under<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.969> shield's<00:00:15.360> name<00:00:15.480> they're

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
sold under the shield's name they're

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.029 
sold under the shield's name they're
still<00:00:15.870> made<00:00:16.020> by<00:00:16.170> Danner<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.710> they're<00:00:16.800> still

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
still made by Danner and they're still

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.880 
still made by Danner and they're still
called<00:00:17.250> there<00:00:17.460> were<00:00:17.550> shields<00:00:17.910> pronghorn<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
called there were shields pronghorn and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
called there were shields pronghorn and
the<00:00:19.890> only<00:00:20.039> difference<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:21.720> these<00:00:22.020> were

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the only difference was that these were

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.509 
the only difference was that these were
a<00:00:22.350> little<00:00:22.560> bit<00:00:22.650> cheaper<00:00:22.980> because<00:00:23.279> they<00:00:23.460> were

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
a little bit cheaper because they were

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.300 
a little bit cheaper because they were
under<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.910> shield's<00:00:24.240> name<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.740> ended<00:00:26.189> up

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
under the shield's name so I ended up

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.769 
under the shield's name so I ended up
getting<00:00:26.580> these<00:00:26.730> instead<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> other<00:00:27.539> ones

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
getting these instead of the other ones

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.040 
getting these instead of the other ones
but<00:00:29.900> they<00:00:30.900> are<00:00:32.239> simply<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> best<00:00:33.510> boots<00:00:33.870> that

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
but they are simply the best boots that

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.819

I've<00:00:34.140> ever<00:00:34.290> had

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
stuff but this is just from what I've

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.660 
stuff but this is just from what I've
experienced<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:58.100> that's<00:02:59.100> why<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.280> timber

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
experienced that that's why the timber

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.140

is<00:02:59.760> usually<00:03:00.000> fit<00:03:00.180> me<00:03:00.300> good<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.600> because<00:03:00.780> they

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
is usually fit me good is because they

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.540 
is usually fit me good is because they

but these like I said a little older but

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.140

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
I like instead of steel because steel

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.390 
I like instead of steel because steel
strings<00:04:46.260> suck<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.740> heat<00:04:46.920> out<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.070> your<00:04:47.130> foot

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.290 
and these are not there no safety Tawana
or<00:04:50.310> anything<00:04:50.460> like<00:04:50.670> that<00:04:50.730> they're<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.240> a

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
or anything like that they're just a

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.940 
or anything like that they're just a
regular<00:04:51.630> boot<00:04:51.840> but<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.500> know<00:04:52.590> it's<00:04:52.740> still

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
regular boot but you know it's still

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.700 
pretty sturdy on just a great or on boot
I<00:04:57.480> think<00:04:57.690> they're<00:04:58.050> expensive<00:04:58.380> though<00:04:58.680> a

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
I think they're expensive though a

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.730 
I think they're expensive though a
dancer<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.250> think<00:04:59.790> I<00:04:59.850> paid<00:05:00.090> about<00:05:00.360> 180<00:05:01.260> some

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
dancer I think I paid about 180 some

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.550 
dancer I think I paid about 180 some
bucks<00:05:01.980> for<00:05:02.250> them<00:05:02.810> back<00:05:03.810> in<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.080> day<00:05:04.230> and<00:05:04.410> right

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
bucks for them back in the day and right

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.900 
bucks for them back in the day and right
now<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.860> probably<00:05:05.100> that's<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.490> same<00:05:05.670> price

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
now that probably that's the same price

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.690 
now that probably that's the same price
