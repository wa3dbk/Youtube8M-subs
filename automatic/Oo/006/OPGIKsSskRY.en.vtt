00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.760
 which one makes such a band I show you 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.369
 today it needs the talk of 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.949
 black and white rubber rings the hook 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.730
 who loves volume while running and 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.390
 have a lock reported the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.929
 juso of the right and left happen with 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.910
 the power if I remain less free 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.310
 and the rail should survive like that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.700
 that they are each exactly opposite 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.700
 32 10 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.940
 I start now with a black one 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.760
 cooking.de not for sale over the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.770
 third place and opposite the first 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.120
 this is exactly how I do it 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.340
 opposite left over the third 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:07.290
 and right over the first and yet 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:11.490
 a horizontal here in the first round 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.600
 are these gummed crosses after that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.070
 no more 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.380
 then I take two white around year 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:26.280
 pull those under these injuries 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:30.149
 by way of the beginning of the rings again 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:37.409
 on the needle on the cards and see 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:42.149
 then the left under the right 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:46.340
 I solve these two deer from the hagen and 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.340
 bring closure to have here 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.219
 Now this I turn down 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.500
 and now follow very simple 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:07.409
 work steps I take two 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.409
 rubber rings in this sequence 0 in white 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.280
 next steps in black as 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:18.760
 refer black change 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.430
 this change and again white and afterwards 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.220
 i pull these black rubber rings off 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:32.819
 in the first step on this 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.819
 this wise about this wise location 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.960
 Now I press the white rubber rings 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.940
 down the finger and can here 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.510
 who is a bit on closure 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.510
 pull 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.500
 wrap the band to right next round 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:08.390
 I'll just start right now 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:12.830
 This time with black rubber and now 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:16.000
 Every day the whites of ours over the 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.000
 black over it 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.049
 press with your finger again 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:33.700
 downstairs and they handle something 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.700
 it goes back to black 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.150
 black because my situation is black 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:04:05.420
 audience 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:12.790
 it goes on and shows now I pull 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.790
 the black rubber ring has grown over 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.900
 press the ways down and here 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.210
 are to be judged 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.210
 Now the blacks come in line 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:48.510
 is again and finally questionable 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:52.530
 and coat and push that and after 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.710
 pull and process now until that 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.570
 band has the desired length and then 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.570
 I'll show you the conclusion 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.980
 but I'm almost at the end of a bracelet 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.460
 is long enough 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:12.740
 I still have the last situation with me 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.740
 spotted smelling black rubber 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:25.040
 every day with the underlying one 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:25.040
 lager and finish the work and that 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:34.950
 I was here at the third from the right 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:39.180
 down the rubbers and see silly about 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.550
 the first sentence on the left and 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:51.150
 here also on the opposite 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:56.970
 pull page and here is the same 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:06:02.180
 right now I'm working on that 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.180
 lower two above the top 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:15.289
 and she from right to left 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:38.820
 and see the two over the middle 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:38.820
 tap I see the bottom four here 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:50.920
 over the top two and then pull that 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:53.800
 untied and through these two I pull 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.919
 now have the lock from the beginning so 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:02.040
 the other side and then mine is soon 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:02.040
