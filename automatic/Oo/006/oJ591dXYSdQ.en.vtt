00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.440
 today we are going to make a recipe a lot 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.420
 fast and also very cheap 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.740
 let's start with these spectacular 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 spaghetti 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 some say we all have water 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.169
 what boils we go up and go and put 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.849
 spaghetti 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.980
 here they are concentrated 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.570
 spaghetti that cook in 9 minutes in 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.610
 these new minutes we will go to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.260
 make our recipe that is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.360
 really really simple 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 take the pan we put a thread 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.030
 of oil as you see I still do n't know 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.100
 lighting the fire below because it 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.410
 we will do just at the last moment e 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.410
 let's put half a squeezed lemon 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:01:02.520
 then a bit of parsley that we will go to 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:04.250
 chop quite finely and there 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.670
 we also take a fresh pepper 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.040
 let's go remove the seeds and go 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.700
 slice with chilli pepper 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.579
 the rounds are rather thin then 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.710
 let's say the decorating part of 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.740
 completely in the dish is ready here 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.679
 we have tuna and very simple 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.409
 drained canned tuna that we now 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:32.670
 as soon as the pasta is almost ready 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.749
 we're just going to warm up in 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.700
 cooking pan 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.109
 I light the fire under the pan not 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.020
 we need the temperature there 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:46.219
 much raises and goes to add the tuna 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.219
 trying to crumble it further 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.850
 so let's move the tuna from the flames 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.470
 leaving perhaps slightly lit in 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.119
 such that the temperature can 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.640
 stay now the pasta is almost ready 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.030
 so we just have to wait for a 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.890
 minute 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.360
 we are ready for pupils to red 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.360
 pass then we can put out the fire 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.980
 put the pan back on the fire and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.069
 let's go and put the spaghetti now 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.780
 we practically finish to flavor the 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.989
 our pasta with this oil sauce 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.989
 and lemon 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:37.739
 put some parsley a little 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:39.420
 chili as you and let's go there 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.850
 our pasta is ready at this point not 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.860
 we just have to take the dish and andrea 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.060
 let's see if we can do it 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.310
 a plant worthy of the name but me 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:58.160
 I'm absolutely not good at it 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:03:00.420
 oplÃ  with nanny nanny tata nanny treats well 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.100
 let's say it's not really the best but 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.860
 we put ourselves 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:11.030
 a little bit of tuna is a little bit 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:15.840
 of the remaining chilli pepper parsley 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:19.730
 a little bit of raw oil and let's go to 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:24.290
 finish our recipe with a little 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.290
 lemon peel grated on top 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.730
 and these are our spaghetti with the 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.940
 lemon turkey 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.940
 enjoy your meal
