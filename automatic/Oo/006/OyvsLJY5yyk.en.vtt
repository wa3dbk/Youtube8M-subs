00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
move in the draft think it's really

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.039 
move in the draft think it's really
smart<00:01:40.580> that<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:40.880> thought<00:01:41.149> about<00:01:41.299> performance

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
looks expensive I think also because of

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.660 
looks expensive I think also because of
the<00:01:47.750> amount<00:01:47.929> of<00:01:48.080> leather<00:01:48.319> that<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.770> used<00:01:49.280> I
