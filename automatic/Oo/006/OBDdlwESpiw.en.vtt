00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 end of the year and it is time to change 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.870
 tires before you travel 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.330
 You have two tires that can not 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.550
 more used and two tires that can 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.070
 run a little bit more then you 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.570
 applies the penalty for two new tires 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.660
 here comes the problem 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.420
 you have a set of good tires and a 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.910
 set of half-life tires and now 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.510
 some say that the best tire should be 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.269
 stay in the front others in the rear 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.489
 g1 is in the pirelli field of evidence in 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.210
 interior of sÃ£o paulo to unveil 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.210
 defined 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.770
 well then let's go here on the track try 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.410
 unravel this mystery 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.489
 let's start a test with new tires 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.059
 on the rear axle and used tires are 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.879
 on the front axle many people say that 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.239
 this is the most secure configuration for the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.280
 car fourth gear 70 km per 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.260
 hour 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.410
 several puddles of water I feel that the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.020
 the front began to lose grip I 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.990
 I have this sensitivity the car informs 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.840
 the grip but note that in no 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.850
 we lost the control car 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.340
 Let's make matters worse, I'm going to get in. 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.280
 in a more closed curve 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.970
 I'm going to hit the wheel and take my foot off 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.240
 now nothing has happened 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.369
 car has kept its trajectory in a 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.100
 so now let's reverse let's put 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.979
 the new tires at the front and the tires 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.420
 used in the rear what many people do 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.420
 and we'll see what happens 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.280
 good back on track now to do the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.310
 second test where I now have the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 back the more worn tires and the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.250
 front tires 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.680
 the first feeling is very good at 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.960
 sense of steering wheel is that I have a 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.050
 car firmer in the hand 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.420
 even because the new tires are 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.700
 curve cut the water well or opa opa 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.520
 is changing correct 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.820
 It's my job you saw how the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.320
 bring escaped at once you do not feel 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.780
 to bring escaped 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.209
 what do you have the good feeling of 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.110
 front but the rear stealing the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.690
 trajectory 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.580
 Let's take the second curve now. 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.260
 it will be more coarse because I go 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.290
 turn took his foot running 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.909
 Grandpa of ours 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.040
 It is good that we are in a field of 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.439
 on a road 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.319
 we would have been marking bad 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:46.019
 so it became clear the new tires 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.140
 must be on the rear axle of the car and 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.629
 the tires used at the front and a tip 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.790
 important whether your car is 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.790
 front wheel drive or rear wheel drive
