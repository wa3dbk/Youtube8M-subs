here<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.460> via<00:02:07.300> this<00:02:07.510> red<00:02:07.840> knurled<00:02:08.229> knob<00:02:08.409> you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
here and via this red knurled knob you

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.130 
here and via this red knurled knob you
can<00:02:09.129> set<00:02:09.429> your<00:02:09.640> own<00:02:09.700> hard<00:02:10.119> stops<00:02:10.420> for<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.929> lens

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
can set your own hard stops for the lens

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.089 
can set your own hard stops for the lens
so<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.930> follow<00:02:13.930> focus<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.620> matte<00:02:14.860> box

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
so this is a follow focus and matte box

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.280 
so this is a follow focus and matte box

millimeter<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:40.819> actually<00:02:41.000> do<00:02:41.360> all<00:02:41.720> three

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
millimeter we actually do all three

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.809 
millimeter we actually do all three
there's<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.500> 15<00:02:42.980> millimeter<00:02:43.220> lightweight

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
there's a 15 millimeter lightweight

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.550 
there's a 15 millimeter lightweight
support<00:02:44.239> standard<00:02:44.599> which<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.870> shown<00:02:45.049> here<00:02:45.110> and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
support standard which is shown here and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.039 
support standard which is shown here and
then<00:02:46.099> there's<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.370> 15<00:02:46.970> or<00:02:47.000> 19<00:02:47.660> millimeter

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
then there's a 15 or 19 millimeter

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.170 
then there's a 15 or 19 millimeter
bridge<00:02:48.349> plate<00:02:48.650> support<00:02:49.129> standard<00:02:49.610> which<00:02:50.030> is

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
bridge plate support standard which is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.660 
bridge plate support standard which is
shown<00:02:50.360> here<00:02:50.659> as<00:02:50.810> well<00:02:51.049> for<00:02:51.980> some<00:02:52.220> people<00:02:52.250> that

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
shown here as well for some people that

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.369 
shown here as well for some people that
are<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:53.000> getting<00:02:53.209> into<00:02:53.569> that<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:54.049> three

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
are just getting into that the three

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.960 
are just getting into that the three
different<00:02:54.560> standards<00:02:55.190> cause<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> bit<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.879> a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
different standards cause a bit of a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.729 
different standards cause a bit of a
confusion<00:02:56.420> but<00:02:56.989> it's<00:02:57.200> interesting<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.709> note

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
confusion but it's interesting to note

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.470 
confusion but it's interesting to note
that<00:02:57.920> they<00:02:58.160> have<00:02:58.340> been<00:02:58.519> around<00:02:58.640> for<00:02:58.970> almost<00:02:59.000> 40

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
that they have been around for almost 40

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.050 
that they have been around for almost 40
years<00:02:59.510> yeah<00:03:00.260> well<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.500> compatibility<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.549> go

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
years yeah well the compatibility to go

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.910 
years yeah well the compatibility to go
between<00:03:02.239> different<00:03:02.750> systems<00:03:03.109> this<00:03:03.590> one<00:03:03.769> is

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
between different systems this one is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.580 
between different systems this one is
nice<00:03:04.299> definitely<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:05.569> with<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.109> modularity

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
nice definitely and with the modularity

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.460 
nice definitely and with the modularity
of<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.190> MB<00:03:07.459> 20<00:03:07.790> system<00:03:08.269> we<00:03:08.660> have<00:03:08.690> over<00:03:09.019> twenty

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
of the MB 20 system we have over twenty

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.009 
of the MB 20 system we have over twenty
three<00:03:09.829> unique<00:03:10.280> configurations<00:03:11.239> for<00:03:11.780> this

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
three unique configurations for this

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.380 
three unique configurations for this
matte<00:03:12.230> box<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.890> modularity<00:03:13.370> allows<00:03:14.150> you

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
matte box so the modularity allows you

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.900 
matte box so the modularity allows you
an<00:03:14.510> upgrade<00:03:14.720> path<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.769> any<00:03:16.040> camera<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:16.730> may

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
an upgrade path to any camera that may

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.119 
an upgrade path to any camera that may

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
lmb 15 we've added a third filter stage

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.339 
lmb 15 we've added a third filter stage

things of that nature I notice you have
a<00:03:55.280> follow<00:03:55.519> focus<00:03:55.730> on<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.239> oh<00:03:56.780> that's<00:03:57.590> correct

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
a follow focus on this oh that's correct

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.580 
a follow focus on this oh that's correct
what<00:03:58.130> we<00:03:58.250> have<00:03:58.430> here<00:03:58.790> is<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.060> FF<00:03:59.359> 5<00:03:59.599> HD<00:04:00.290> and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
what we have here is the FF 5 HD and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.289 
what we have here is the FF 5 HD and
this<00:04:00.980> was<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.160> follow<00:04:01.430> focus<00:04:01.700> from<00:04:02.090> aerie

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
this was a follow focus from aerie

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.629 
this was a follow focus from aerie
specifically<00:04:02.989> designed<00:04:03.440> for<00:04:03.650> two-thirds

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
specifically designed for two-thirds

chip camera lenses that have a smaller
lens<00:04:07.849> barrel<00:04:08.359> diameter<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.290> what<00:04:09.919> we've<00:04:10.099> done

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
lens barrel diameter and what we've done

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.300 
lens barrel diameter and what we've done
here<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.760> we<00:04:11.000> have<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.239> wider<00:04:11.780> gear<00:04:12.260> ratio<00:04:12.709> if<00:04:13.099> we

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
here is we have a wider gear ratio if we

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.920 
here is we have a wider gear ratio if we
were<00:04:13.430> using<00:04:13.579> a<00:04:13.790> regular<00:04:13.940> cine<00:04:14.389> follow<00:04:14.660> focus

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
were using a regular cine follow focus

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.659 
were using a regular cine follow focus
we<00:04:15.470> will<00:04:15.590> be<00:04:15.799> able<00:04:15.889> to<00:04:16.010> go<00:04:16.250> from<00:04:16.459> one<00:04:16.639> extreme

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
we will be able to go from one extreme

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.849 
we will be able to go from one extreme
to<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.269> other<00:04:17.389> in<00:04:17.720> about<00:04:18.139> half<00:04:18.199> a<00:04:18.590> turn

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
to the other in about half a turn

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.219 
to the other in about half a turn
whereas<00:04:19.729> with<00:04:19.760> this<00:04:20.120> gear<00:04:20.359> ratio<00:04:20.750> we<00:04:20.930> can<00:04:21.079> get

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
whereas with this gear ratio we can get

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.469 
whereas with this gear ratio we can get
to<00:04:21.440> good<00:04:21.799> solid<00:04:22.250> turns<00:04:22.490> on<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:22.910> follow<00:04:23.210> focus

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
to good solid turns on this follow focus

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.450 
to good solid turns on this follow focus
and<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:24.530> gives<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.830> a<00:04:24.860> much<00:04:25.010> more<00:04:25.250> accurate

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
and it gives you a much more accurate

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.700 
and it gives you a much more accurate
focus<00:04:26.120> bull<00:04:26.360> we've<00:04:26.750> also<00:04:26.900> incorporated<00:04:27.289> a

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710
