then you can fully rotate the arms and

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.360 
then you can fully rotate the arms and
going<00:02:53.870> out<00:02:54.110> he<00:02:54.470> does<00:02:54.620> find<00:02:54.860> out<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.099> elbow

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
going out he does find out the elbow

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.130 
going out he does find out the elbow
which<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.030> armor<00:02:56.329> is<00:02:56.480> connected<00:02:56.870> right<00:02:56.900> there

which the armor is connected right there

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.559 
which the armor is connected right there
so<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.530> has<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:58.370> moves<00:02:58.670> along<00:02:58.940> with<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.420> arm

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
so it has it moves along with the arm

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
waist articulation the legs to go

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.479 
waist articulation the legs to go
forward<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.510> back<00:03:06.110> they<00:03:06.650> do<00:03:06.709> go<00:03:07.010> in<00:03:07.160> now<00:03:07.280> but

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
forward and back they do go in now but

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.009

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
you have to move them this way and

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.530 
you have to move them this way and
because<00:03:09.799> there's<00:03:09.980> no<00:03:10.130> upper<00:03:10.730> leg<00:03:10.910> rotation

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
because there's no upper leg rotation

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.360 
because there's no upper leg rotation
his<00:03:11.959> legs<00:03:12.200> will<00:03:12.380> be<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.769> way<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.220> that's
