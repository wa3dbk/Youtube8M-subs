00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 big hello to everyone in this video i want 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.299
 show you how to create an image on 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 who inspired me 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.250
 show dolce gabbana here actually 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 everything is very simple so I will try 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.769
 focus on important 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.929
 moments 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.789
 note that in this makeup I 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.330
 very gently modulate the face with a brush for 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.910
 powder 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.580
 it helps to create a more youthful look and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.250
 lighter skin early on mix and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.490
 I apply them in a very thin layer of wide 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.490
 brush 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.260
 very gently fill eyebrows and excess 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.260
 wipe brush for concealer 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.280
 I put the first shadows on my finger and very 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.280
 I shade well 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.330
 an important point to highlight the fold of the century 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.330
 bones the same shade as cheekbones 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.230
 in order to cream shadows not 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.730
 rolled up I fill them like 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.730
 hue pressed shadows 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.200
 draw the ciliary line waterproof 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.980
 pencil and draw it with a brush for 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.980
 feathering pencil 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.170
 on top of the liner brush I fill black 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.340
 the shadows thus obtained effect 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.340
 soft arrow 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.989
 the same shade we used 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:45.390
 for cheekbones and for drawing the upper eyelid 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:49.370
 we paint over the lower eyelids with a thin layer 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.370
 I paint eyelashes and glue bunches 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.180
 even written 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.650
 I put on a wine-colored lipstick and a little 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.650
 feather contour 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.710
 hair still just combing 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.930
 back of the head 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.140
 and all hair we pin studs in 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.120
 a bunch of slightly releasing the front strands 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.430
 this way the view is more 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.740
 natural romantic headache 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.100
 we borrowed the decoration from the girl who 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.100
 is engaged has i think she is very 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.320
 fits well with this image and here 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.540
 the end result is ready for everyone 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.600
