00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
seems pretty spread out at the moment

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.120 
seems pretty spread out at the moment
you've<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> few<00:01:22.470> guys<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> left<00:01:23.040> flank

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you've got a few guys on the left flank

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.590 
you've got a few guys on the left flank
a<00:01:23.310> few<00:01:23.460> guys<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> right<00:01:23.970> flank<00:01:24.210> we've<00:01:24.420> got

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
a few guys on the right flank we've got

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.499 
a few guys on the right flank we've got
a<00:01:24.750> scout<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.670> far<00:01:26.970> left<00:01:27.270> there

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
a scout on the far left there

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.240 
a scout on the far left there
unfortunately<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.439> been<00:01:28.619> taken<00:01:28.979> out<00:01:29.070> dude

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
unfortunately just been taken out dude

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
unfortunately just been taken out dude
obviously<00:01:29.340> being<00:01:29.670> tracked<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.259> then

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
obviously being tracked and then

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
obviously being tracked and then
destroyed<00:01:31.799> by<00:01:32.130> his<00:01:32.430> counterpart<00:01:33.090> who's<00:01:33.270> just

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
destroyed by his counterpart who's just

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.200 
destroyed by his counterpart who's just
taking<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.960> position<00:01:34.790> over<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> left

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
taking up a position over on the left

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.380 
taking up a position over on the left
flank<00:01:36.329> there<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.880> looks<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.299> had

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
flank there so it looks like they had

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.910 
flank there so it looks like they had
gone<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.840> an<00:01:39.930> early<00:01:40.170> cut<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:40.740> maybe

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
gone for an early cut but then maybe

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160 
gone for an early cut but then maybe
being<00:01:41.220> spotted<00:01:41.549> by<00:01:41.670> somebody<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:42.450> maybe

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
being spotted by somebody or maybe

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.910 
being spotted by somebody or maybe
pushed<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.680> by<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> fact<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:45.259> somebody<00:01:46.259> had

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
pushed out by the fact that somebody had

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.859 
pushed out by the fact that somebody had
turned<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.700> now<00:01:48.060> they're<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.299> doing<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.600> grid

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
turned up now they're not doing to grid

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:49.969 
turned up now they're not doing to grid
the<00:01:48.990> moment<00:01:49.229> they're<00:01:49.320> already<00:01:49.439> losing<00:01:49.680> three

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
haven't left it long enough and you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.240 
haven't left it long enough and you
don't<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.180> you've<00:02:48.870> got<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> weird<00:02:49.440> almost<00:02:49.980> 30

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
don't it you've got a weird almost 30

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.330 
don't it you've got a weird almost 30
seconds<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.390> reload<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.500> massive<00:02:52.980> cannon

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
seconds to reload that massive cannon

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.000 
seconds to reload that massive cannon
there<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:54.660> almost<00:02:54.870> real<00:02:55.530> ordered<00:02:55.890> so

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
there so it's almost real ordered so

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.970 
there so it's almost real ordered so
he's<00:02:56.129> just<00:02:56.160> going<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.519> pop<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.560> easily

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
he's just going to pop out and it easily

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.069 
he's just going to pop out and it easily
should<00:02:59.190> be<00:02:59.280> able<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.579> this<00:02:59.760> guy<00:02:59.970> out<00:03:00.180> there<00:03:00.810> you

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
should be able to this guy out there you

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.349 
should be able to this guy out there you
go<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.890> that's<00:03:02.040> three<00:03:02.310> shots<00:03:02.579> three<00:03:02.670> kills<00:03:03.090> so

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
go so that's three shots three kills so

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.849 
go so that's three shots three kills so
far<00:03:03.630> for<00:03:03.959> evolution<00:03:04.709> epc<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.470> looks<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.680> it's

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
far for evolution epc so looks like it's

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.319 
far for evolution epc so looks like it's
just<00:03:08.010> doing<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.190> bit<00:03:08.250> flanking<00:03:08.760> maneuvers<00:03:09.150> now

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
just doing a bit flanking maneuvers now

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.740 
just doing a bit flanking maneuvers now
on<00:03:09.450> force<00:03:09.690> with<00:03:09.840> team<00:03:10.019> still<00:03:10.319> losing<00:03:10.709> 625

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
on force with team still losing 625

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.000 
on force with team still losing 625
looks<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.049> took<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.440> shot<00:03:13.980> there

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
looks like you took a shot there

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.690 
looks like you took a shot there
probably<00:03:14.549> from<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:15.000> hidden<00:03:15.359> tank<00:03:15.690> destroyer<00:03:16.079> or

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
probably from a hidden tank destroyer or

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.069 
probably from a hidden tank destroyer or
even<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.760> piece<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:17.970> artillery<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:18.780> luckily

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
even a piece of artillery but luckily

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.530 
even a piece of artillery but luckily
most<00:03:19.590> do<00:03:19.920> zero<00:03:20.310> damage<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:20.880> was<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> glancing

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
most do zero damage as it was a glancing

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.259 
most do zero damage as it was a glancing
blow<00:03:21.599> on<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.319> top<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.739> his<00:03:23.010> turret<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:24.090> looks

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
blow on the top of his turret so looks

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.740 
blow on the top of his turret so looks
like<00:03:24.299> they're<00:03:24.480> going<00:03:24.569> for<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.810> cup<00:03:25.019> again<00:03:25.579> and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
like they're going for a cup again and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.050 
like they're going for a cup again and
there<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.169> kv-1<00:03:28.980> hiding<00:03:29.700> around<00:03:29.790> this

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
there is a kv-1 hiding around this

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.210 
there is a kv-1 hiding around this
corner<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:31.230> probably<00:03:31.620> going<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.829> see<00:03:31.980> what<00:03:32.130> he

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
corner so probably going to see what he

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.420 
corner so probably going to see what he
can<00:03:32.340> do<00:03:32.549> about<00:03:32.819> him<00:03:33.889> no<00:03:34.889> it<00:03:34.980> looks<00:03:35.160> like<00:03:35.310> he's

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
can do about him no it looks like he's

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.659 
can do about him no it looks like he's
hidden<00:03:35.609> behind<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.239> building<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.669> nobody

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
hidden behind the building so nobody

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.099 
hidden behind the building so nobody
else<00:03:38.700> really<00:03:39.359> seems<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.780> be<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.989> good

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
else really seems to be in a good

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.690 
else really seems to be in a good
position<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.530> stop<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:41.010> cup<00:03:41.250> from<00:03:41.400> happen

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
position to stop this cup from happen

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.770 
position to stop this cup from happen
and<00:03:41.819> so<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:41.940> looks<00:03:42.060> like<00:03:42.120> old<00:03:42.359> friends<00:03:42.450> gonna

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
and so it looks like old friends gonna

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.659 
and so it looks like old friends gonna
have<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.230> after<00:03:43.769> getting<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.310> shot<00:03:44.489> on

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
have to do that after getting a shot on
