00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.359 
is I'm going to show you how it works so
basically<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.779> whole<00:00:27.990> goal<00:00:28.260> behind<00:00:28.529> quads<00:00:29.070> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
basically the whole goal behind quads is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.120 
basically the whole goal behind quads is
to<00:00:30.090> pick<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> color<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> board<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.920> has

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
to pick the color on the board that has

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.010 
to pick the color on the board that has
the<00:00:32.369> most<00:00:32.579> blocks<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.680> every<00:00:34.680> time<00:00:34.950> you

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
the most blocks in it and every time you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.770 
the most blocks in it and every time you
pick<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.230> correct<00:00:37.829> color<00:00:38.329> each<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.629> those

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
pick the correct color each of those

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.100 
pick the correct color each of those
blocks<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.610> quad<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:42.059> counts<00:00:42.510> toward<00:00:42.960> your

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
blocks is a quad that counts toward your

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.470 
blocks is a quad that counts toward your
overall<00:00:43.469> score<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:44.879> quads<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
overall score and the more quads you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.990 
overall score and the more quads you
have<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.289> know<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> more<00:00:46.770> quad<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.579> destroy

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
have you know the more quad you destroy

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.020 
have you know the more quad you destroy
essentially<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> higher<00:00:48.930> your<00:00:49.200> score<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:50.030> so

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
essentially the higher your score is so

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.340 
essentially the higher your score is so
just<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> show<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:53.300> press<00:00:54.300> play<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.809> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
just to show you a press play and this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.099 
just to show you a press play and this
is<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> board<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.629> there<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> few

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
is the board you can see there are a few

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.990 
is the board you can see there are a few
different<00:00:58.230> colors<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.850> do

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
different colors and all you have to do

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.729 
different colors and all you have to do
to<00:01:00.120> play<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:02.149> tap<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.359> color<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.379> has<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
to play is tap the color that has the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
to play is tap the color that has the
most<00:01:04.920> quads<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.729> whichever<00:01:06.330> color

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
most quads in it so whichever color

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.030 
most quads in it so whichever color
takes<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> most<00:01:07.560> area<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:09.770> naturally<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
takes up the most area and naturally you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.700 
takes up the most area and naturally you
can't<00:01:11.310> take<00:01:11.700> time<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.299> count<00:01:12.570> every<00:01:12.840> single

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
can't take time to count every single

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
can't take time to count every single
quad<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:15.259> each<00:01:16.259> color<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
quad in each color so really what you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.560 
quad in each color so really what you
have<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.420> kind<00:01:21.420> of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
have to do is you just have to kind of

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.740 
have to do is you just have to kind of
open<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.650> eyes<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> bit<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.330> make<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> quick

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
open your eyes a bit and make a quick

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.440 
open your eyes a bit and make a quick
judgment<00:01:25.700> instead<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.790> taking<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.270> wild

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
judgment instead of taking a wild

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.080 
judgment instead of taking a wild
account<00:01:28.250> but<00:01:29.250> overall<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> really

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
account but overall it's a really

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.270 
account but overall it's a really
relaxing<00:01:30.990> game<00:01:31.200> once<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> hang<00:01:31.979> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it and you kind of get into the mode of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.469 
it and you kind of get into the mode of
picking<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.829> right<00:01:37.829> colors<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.270> see
