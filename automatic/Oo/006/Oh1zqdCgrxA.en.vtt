00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.910 
doesn't oh my not do the same this one's
kind<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.909> liquor<00:02:06.420> more<00:02:06.630> cartoon<00:02:07.229> looking<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
kind of liquor more cartoon looking and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.300 
kind of liquor more cartoon looking and
this<00:02:08.039> one's<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.550> little<00:02:09.090> less<00:02:09.390> cartoon<00:02:09.780> looking

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
this one's a little less cartoon looking

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.429 
this one's a little less cartoon looking
so<00:02:11.310> that's<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.849> difference<00:02:13.489> um<00:02:15.260> yeah<00:02:16.260> that's

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
so that's the difference um yeah that's

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.630 
so that's the difference um yeah that's
it<00:02:16.560> for<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.739> minifigures<00:02:17.159> that's<00:02:17.430> all<00:02:17.549> you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
it for the minifigures that's all you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.539 
it for the minifigures that's all you
get<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.810> decent<00:02:19.500> enough<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.860> think<00:02:20.430> it

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
get but it's decent enough I think it

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.050 
get but it's decent enough I think it
should<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.819> come<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:22.099> commander<00:02:23.099> got

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
should have come with a commander got

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.020 
should have come with a commander got
like<00:02:24.209> Captain<00:02:25.200> Rex<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:25.829> snow<00:02:26.340> uniform<00:02:26.909> or

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
like Captain Rex like snow uniform or

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.030

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
something that'd be l'acqua lower than

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.520 
something that'd be l'acqua lower than

comparison<00:04:52.300> here<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:53.350> a<00:04:53.380> Starfighter<00:04:55.680> grab

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
comparison here to a Starfighter grab

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.760 
comparison here to a Starfighter grab
the<00:04:56.800> Starfighter<00:04:58.140> compare<00:04:59.140> here<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.560> an

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
the Starfighter compare here to an

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.470 
the Starfighter compare here to an
against<00:05:00.130> jedi<00:05:00.430> starfighter<00:05:00.490> because<00:05:01.210> it's

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
against jedi starfighter because it's

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.750 
against jedi starfighter because it's
probably<00:05:01.870> one<00:05:02.110> of<00:05:02.140> the<00:05:02.290> more<00:05:02.470> popular<00:05:03.190> Jedi

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
probably one of the more popular Jedi

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.600 
probably one of the more popular Jedi
starfighters<00:05:04.440> it's<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:06.010> little<00:05:06.250> bit<00:05:06.340> shorter

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
starfighters it's a little bit shorter

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.760 
starfighters it's a little bit shorter
than<00:05:06.640> the<00:05:06.790> jedi<00:05:07.030> starfighter<00:05:07.470> as<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:08.620> might

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
than the jedi starfighter as you might

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.590 
than the jedi starfighter as you might
see<00:05:08.950> it<00:05:09.160> looks<00:05:09.370> small<00:05:09.640> a<00:05:09.790> lot<00:05:10.060> smaller<00:05:10.390> than

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
see it looks small a lot smaller than

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.630 
see it looks small a lot smaller than
the<00:05:10.720> jato<00:05:10.930> servers<00:05:11.290> not<00:05:11.500> big<00:05:11.680> but<00:05:11.800> it's<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.430> good

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
the jato servers not big but it's a good

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.590 
the jato servers not big but it's a good
size<00:05:12.910> it's<00:05:13.270> big<00:05:13.450> for<00:05:13.479> a<00:05:13.690> speeder<00:05:16.380> big<00:05:17.380> person

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
size it's big for a speeder big person

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.659 
size it's big for a speeder big person
overall<00:05:19.600> yeah<00:05:19.990> it's<00:05:20.229> pretty<00:05:20.440> much<00:05:20.650> it<00:05:20.830> that's

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
overall yeah it's pretty much it that's

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.370 
overall yeah it's pretty much it that's
primitive<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.240> set<00:05:22.479> I'll<00:05:22.690> show<00:05:23.050> you<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.260> back
