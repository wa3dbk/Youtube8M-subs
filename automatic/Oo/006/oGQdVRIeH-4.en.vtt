00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.469
 the idea stems from the economic crisis and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.379
 then this starting from Greece 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.820
 because greece is the country more in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.360
 danger in this name 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.090
 and then to represent aggression 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.110
 to Greece from all economic points of view 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.750
 financials pulled out an old man 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.509
 enemy of Greece which is one of the myths 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.430
 more popular than the minotaur minotaur 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.620
 that comes out of the maze and goes to meet 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.390
 new to its sacrificial victims 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 and this time he wins defeats and theseus 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 the choice of the minotaur is because it has one 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.890
 double identity half animal half human 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.019
 and in my opinion the truth behind the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.899
 pressure from financial markets and 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.450
 groups and world oligarchies is 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.440
 a skill that has the monstrous because it is 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.740
 really something that has no appetite 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.510
 and like the minotaur 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.790
 the victims were treated 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.890
 this ability to destroy to see 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.410
 they are the poor of tightening madness 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.920
 this crisis manifests itself in double-breasted 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.140
 and ties, however, he has no real what 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.950
 mask 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.490
 the flight of the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.490
 not tauro 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:27.500
 it is a golden mask without identity that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.490
 among other things I have resumed from the carnival 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.830
 Sardinian of old boys of madness who do 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.040
 a dirty word while fighting 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.880
 herdsman make this ritual carnival 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.520
 with these masks 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.980
 cow by train so i like it 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.510
 also this fact that the symbolism of the 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.820
 alone because these ours have more 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.100
 the sun and the symbolism of the bull of the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.590
 sun in returns through the carnival 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.659
 through 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.439
 and in any case it is precisely this 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:07.819
 this lack of goals this power that 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:10.700
 it is hidden from most is that it is not seen 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.730
 what should we expect this year 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.430
 seven interval choreographic paintings 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.799
 from a brief comment on the cone 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.750
 in the Greek choir but will make up but 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.890
 joking 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.900
 I saw girls representing 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.880
 we do not lose this function of 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.230
 narration these little as the tragedies 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:36.000
 Greek graffiti that will make a brief 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.000
 word intervention between 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.319
 it will not be the DVD 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.120
 the icaro 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.770
 the speech democracy 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.000
 good for pericles 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.000
 united and all that they are 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.840
 it moves 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.340
 I could really say more popular than the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.430
 race 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.760
 read the ones there 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.760
 we see 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.190
 remedies in short 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.030
 and you 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.459
 they are just part of the night 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.170
 yes yes because then there is the director la 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.980
 Greece is the most affected country however also 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.200
 the cradle of the western world 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.900
 somehow the fate of history 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.860
 a thorn is reflected right there 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.530
 it is not 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.220
 so now I don't have what he grants 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.220
 of democracy 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.959
 in the meantime 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.959
 yes no 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.079
 clown 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.560
 one year 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.040
 come on
