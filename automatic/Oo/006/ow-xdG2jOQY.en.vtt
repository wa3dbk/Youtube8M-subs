00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.740
 Italian tomato sauce 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.160
 we will need 

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:11.405
 about 1kg of tomatoes 

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:13.223
 a minced onion 

00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:15.253
 6 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:17.205
 a clove of garlic 

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:18.983
 a few basil leaves 

00:00:18.983 --> 00:00:20.611
 salt and pepper 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.240
 we wash the tomatoes 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.770
 we will remove them 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.200
 we make this cross because 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 we will stop them 

00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:50.157
 and that will help us 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.480
 to break the bark more easily 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 I will stop the tomatoes 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.540
 tomatoes are ready 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.860
 we will let them cool and then peel them off 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 I'll crush a little garlic 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.980
 I put a pan on the fire 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.220
 I'll put some of the olive oil 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.160
 and a part I will leave for the end 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.000
 put the garlic 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.880
 add onions 

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:42.988
 I leave it until it becomes glassy 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.400
 salt 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.020
 pepper 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.280
 add tomatoes 

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:11.294
 I will add the basil leaves 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.100
 I will extinguish the fire and add the rest of the olive oil 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.400
 this was the recipe for Italian sauce 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.140
