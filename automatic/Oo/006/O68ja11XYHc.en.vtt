00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.480
 have you ever killed a pokémon 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.310
 possibly without tempted they killed magicard without success jajajajajajajajaja 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.110
 pokémon revive one were different from their successors only in style and 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.010
 slightly more advanced graphics was something more to do with the filin in 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.710
 general what separated them 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.189
 music empties people in one place by doing nothing talking 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.570
 with themselves the inhospitable environment 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.470
 little immaterial live 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.279
 it was difficult back then in our childhood to notice this kind of thing 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.340
 details that we overlook that nowadays can result 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.300
 disturbing 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.390
 taking a look on the internet come to the web kotaku 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.590
 who normally visited where I found a very interesting article 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.590
 I saw the beginning and I found something that horrified me 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.010
 it was a remake version of red pokémon nicknamed pokémon black on these 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.800
 see is the cartridge 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.510
 it was described as super scary but after reading the article I realized 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.710
 that that definition fell short 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.180
 I'm here to summarize the game 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.360
 being a fan friend of the series according to the author I found this year quite 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.410
 disturbing 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.030
 however before I start I would like to say that this sexist artist 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.020
 or maybe not since the editor never shows screenshots of the game 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.350
 itself claiming that it has lost 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.480
 but anyway the idea deserves to be heard 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.450
 nothing else you understand the game you will see the normal intro with my nephew and that to walk 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.370
 fighting 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.750
 When you get to the title screen you can see the coach as always 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.090
 but something is missing 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.920
 the pokémon that is normally facing that is no longer 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.960
 under the title pokémon you see a poster that says blas version 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.240
 everything starts the same until you get your first pokémon 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.720
 a pokémon that you could never get now occupies a niche in 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.510
 tourist 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.140
 his name is ghost and he is at level 1 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.190
 has the form of the phantom pokémon of the town tower the band before 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.760
 get the object that identifies you 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.890
 Now comes the part that is scary 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.630
 this pokémon has only one curse movement curse 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.909
 when you use it against a coach's pokémon the screen turns black and 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.110
 the myth of poker with the characteristic cry of pokémon can be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.009
 hear 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.119
 when the screen reappears the pokémon is gone 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.889
 does not appear on the coach's list either 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.879
 this means that the rival pokémon has died or been killed 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.769
 after getting money from the coach because I would give you a coach money 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.289
 after killing his pokémon 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.029
 the battle options reappear 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:33.309
 you can escape and abandon the rival coach but you can also fight with the 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:34.459
 same coach 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.879
 if you do it the trainer also moves 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.510
 when you leave the battle mode the figure of the coach is no longer 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.299
 If you leave the area and re-enter the place where the coach was 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.069
 a tombstone appears like those found in the town tower the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.089
 band 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.629
 the game is incredibly easy if you use august 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.970
 you can not deposit August on the pc 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.090
 which means you have to have it throughout the game 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.760
 you can not kill recurring opponents that appear several times in the game 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.489
 as your rival or giovani 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.110
 however, if the next time the last time 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.990
 if you can kill them for example you fight with giovani three times in the 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.569
 game 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.980
 two of them as an evil boy but in the third battle the gym 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.980
 you can kill him since it's the last time you find him 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:26.009
 once you've killed everything you find during the game and the elite 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:30.219
 4 you enter the john of fame and you pokémon cost will be there exposed 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.029
 then the screen turns black and a text appears that says 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.729
 many years later 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:40.309
 you're back in town the band and now you're no longer the young guy but a 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:44.209
 old man like the one who teaches you to capture pokémons in green city 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.079
 That old man is you 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.079
 you do not have a single pokémon and you have also left 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.409
 the village music the band sounds wherever I go if all the people 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.179
 of the game are gone 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.539
 you are literally only in this vast world 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:02.399
 You can not go very far as many areas are blocked by some 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:06.529
 objects like that bush that you can usually cut but without pokémon not 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:07.999
 you can go through it 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:12.439
 however, you enter the cave of Birla Tila Naughty arriving in the area that 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.409
 it is between the silver city and the green forest the tree has been cut 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.299
 thus allowing the passage 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.009
 now it can be up town for eta 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.099
 when you get to the exact tile where you started the game on the screen 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.249
 appear all the Pokémon on which you used the curse attack and 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.699
 also all the coaches you killed with that attack 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.250
 the battle text comes out suddenly and coast seems right in front of the text 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:38.509
 voice wants to fight 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.600
 you can not escape and without pokémons 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.140
 you can only use combat the attack that is used when all your pp is over and 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.419
 as always heller is yourself when you attack 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.240
 when it's August's turn 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.319
 on the screen it only comes out 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:57.419
 once your hp is almost exhausted 2 finally use curse and the screen 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:58.539
 it is dyed black 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.180
 nothing else happens and the only thing you can do is turn the game on and off 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.520
 when you understand it, it only shows the new heading option 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.960
 Your file has been deleted 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.580
 have been murdered 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.689
 fuck 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.969
 well those are all I have if they ask me more I will definitely put them 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.110
 it is assumed that here you should insert one is to create 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.319
 efe 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:22.709
 rox attend bonzo
