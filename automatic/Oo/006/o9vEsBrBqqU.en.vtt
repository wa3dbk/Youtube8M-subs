00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 as we discussed prior to the analysis of the notes 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.040
 each of the lines of our staff is used to represent 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.640
 the associated notes 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.769
 has determined instrument of our battery 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.409
 because in the end we remember 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.049
 the drums are nothing more than percussion instruments 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.849
 that are all played by the same person 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.599
 as we had already commented 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.130
 the tarola or the notes that go 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.080
 associated with the tarola 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.840
 typically they are written 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.840
 the second row of our staff 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.840
 perfectly centered that between the second and third line 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.490
 the hype 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.500
 N otan low edge is drawn on the fourth row of our pentagram 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.179
 if nothing else we have a drum in our battery 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.579
 we can draw the centered notes between the fourth and fifth line 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.460
 as he ordered the fifth line 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.530
 as in the example of the screen 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.530
 if we had two drums in our battery 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.440
 we would try to put the notes of the main drum 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.630
 perfectly well centered between the fourth and fifth line 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.670
 pillar of our secondary hype 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.890
 dying the fifth line 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.870
 as we can also appreciate 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.979
 to be 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.680
 of the last line of the staff 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.310
 the lines of the garages sixteenths and graves 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.270
 they are meant to draw by drawing them down like this instead of up 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.490
 not to go through 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.189
 all the lines already without interfering with the drawing of the other notes 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.020
 when it comes to the saucers, two styles are usually used 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.660
 one is to draw the beating in three heights of the first line of the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.250
 staff 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.290
 and the other one that is the one that we are going to use is to draw all 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.430
 be it the setback 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.399
 the root joel crash 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.769
 biting the first line of the staff 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.559
 but using distinctive letters that help us differentiate the ones from 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:22.929
 others 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.390
 in these moments we would be seeing 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.100
 how the notes are drawn for the setback 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.040
 we will notice the presence of two letters 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.569
 hc accompanied by a point 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.759
 that is the abbreviation d the name of the setback in English 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.579
 there 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.319
 As you can see the notes of the mishap in this case 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.379
 eighth notes 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.059
 instead of drawing as a filled circle or as a filled ellipse 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.529
 they are drawn as an x 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.099
 that is also a universally accepted trend 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:08.349
 the next dish in terms of importance refers sevilla the country 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.079
 to differentiate it from the setback 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.079
 we will use the letters rc 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.169
 that come from the name in English 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.169
 Kelly explained to ips 5 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:28.419
 finally we would have our auction plates or as it is known 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.019
 in English joachim 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.719
 in this case to differentiate it from the jamaica fidel bÃ¡ez 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:37.290
 let's use the letters 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.049
 -uppercase and lowercase r 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.049
 which are the abbreviation we go through 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:49.939
 a battery can have as many fools as space allows us or as the 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.159
 drummer want it 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.010
 It is customary that the first of the stones that are usually air 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.139
 which is in front of the tarola 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.499
 is drawn perfectly centered 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.909
 between the first and second line of the staff this is on the first line 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.129
 the tone that follow 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.430
 also air 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.509
 and also in front of our tarola he got used to drawing by biting the 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.859
 second line of the staff 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.439
 the following ones that could also be of air but that are generally of 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:25.490
 floor 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.830
 would be the third and fourth I took 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.749
 which draw and amos respectively 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:36.169
 biting the third line and biting the fourth line of the staff 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.800
 finally let's see an integration case 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.790
 of notes so much for the misfortune as for the tarola as for the hype 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.449
 let's play eight notes in the mishap 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.650
 in times 1 1 and a half 2 and a half 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.819
 3 3 and a half four and four and a half 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.330
 two notes on the bass drum 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.279
 at times 1 and 3 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:04.059
 and two notes in the tarola in the 2004 times 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.479
 what is usually called rob of eight notes is perhaps the most compass 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.349
 common 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.240
 I would like to draw your attention to the fact that even though they are touching 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.999
 only two notes in the jar 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:20.590
 we are drawing them 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.490
 like kurt chivas 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.490
 instead of drawing a white and a mega 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.039
 because this is done 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.370
 very easy 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.370
 why 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.669
 the carola 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.000
 and the setback 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.430
 they touch with their hands 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.999
 therefore it is considered that the notes are successive 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:43.449
 even when we are actually playing different instruments 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.449
 that's the reason then 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.930
 why we not only join them 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.379
 but we also change its duration
