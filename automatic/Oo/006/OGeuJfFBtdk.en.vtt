trying to sit down there's a little
rubber<00:01:44.640> strip<00:01:45.119> right<00:01:45.299> here<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:46.500> actually

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
rubber strip right here it's actually

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
rubber strip right here it's actually
used<00:01:47.070> from<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.490> his<00:01:47.579> lights<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> sound

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
used from one of his lights and sound

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840 
used from one of his lights and sound
gimmicks<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.960> part<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.729> he's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
gimmicks on this part so when he's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.929 
gimmicks on this part so when he's
driving<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:51.899> push<00:01:52.200> him<00:01:52.320> down

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
driving if you actually push him down

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.539 
driving if you actually push him down
I<00:01:57.649> guess<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:58.859> supposed<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.159> used<00:01:59.429> if

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
I guess that's supposed to be used if

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
I guess that's supposed to be used if
you<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.789> he's<00:01:59.969> running<00:02:00.270> into<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.679> know

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you know he's running into you know

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.800

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.449 

yeah<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:22.169> do<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.290> breaking<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:22.950> it's<00:03:23.190> very

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
yeah I can do it breaking it it's very

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.129 
yeah I can do it breaking it it's very
important<00:03:23.760> thing<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> lot

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
important thing so that is it a lot

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.839 
important thing so that is it a lot
flips<00:03:25.530> here<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.799> flip<00:03:25.980> these<00:03:26.130> up<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.579> you<00:03:26.700> can

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
flips here you flip these up and you can

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.610 
flips here you flip these up and you can
fold<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.239> wheel<00:03:27.480> inside<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.260> then

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
fold this wheel inside of it and then

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.319 
fold this wheel inside of it and then
close<00:03:29.099> this<00:03:29.280> back<00:03:29.459> down<00:03:29.700> these<00:03:29.910> little<00:03:30.120> pegs

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
close this back down these little pegs

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.900 
close this back down these little pegs
this<00:03:31.139> whole<00:03:31.349> piece<00:03:31.500> will<00:03:31.650> flip<00:03:32.220> close<00:03:32.549> and

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
this whole piece will flip close and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.030 
this whole piece will flip close and
lift<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.690> up<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.989> he's<00:03:34.230> got<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.410> foot<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.829> need

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040

lift it up and he's got a foot you need
the<00:03:35.160> same<00:03:35.340> thing<00:03:35.489> on<00:03:35.579> this<00:03:35.700> side<00:03:35.910> here<00:03:38.660> close

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
the same thing on this side here close

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.610 
the same thing on this side here close
this<00:03:39.810> whole<00:03:40.019> panel<00:03:41.900> now<00:03:42.900> my<00:03:43.049> panel<00:03:43.380> seemed<00:03:43.560> a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
this whole panel now my panel seemed a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.960 
this whole panel now my panel seemed a
little<00:03:43.799> bit<00:03:43.919> flimsy<00:03:44.280> here<00:03:44.459> like<00:03:44.609> they'll<00:03:44.760> pop

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
little bit flimsy here like they'll pop

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.330 
actually fairly good I mean his legs
will<00:05:57.340> go<00:05:57.490> any<00:05:58.419> number<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.840> directions<00:05:59.140> so<00:05:59.740> he

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
will go any number of directions so he

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.700 
will go any number of directions so he
can<00:06:00.610> is<00:06:01.210> he's<00:06:01.539> got<00:06:01.660> really<00:06:01.810> long<00:06:02.080> feet<00:06:02.530> in<00:06:02.650> the

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
can is he's got really long feet in the

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.110 
can is he's got really long feet in the
front<00:06:03.010> but<00:06:03.220> I<00:06:03.280> mean<00:06:03.460> I<00:06:03.490> guess<00:06:03.700> it's<00:06:03.850> good<00:06:04.000> the

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
front but I mean I guess it's good the

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.279 
front but I mean I guess it's good the
sense<00:06:04.300> if<00:06:04.389> you<00:06:04.479> want<00:06:04.660> to<00:06:04.720> try<00:06:04.870> you<00:06:04.930> know<00:06:05.110> give
