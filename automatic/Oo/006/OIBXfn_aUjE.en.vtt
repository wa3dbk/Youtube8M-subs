00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.830
 when marcinho learned to play the second because the flamengo team 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:07.950
 did not like twisted in the established percent of a little in front the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.779
 to organize 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.779
 for the are caetano 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.080
 air 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 that is the power 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.730
 It was not for you to decide. 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.410
 You may have had some 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 fable made a good table in the lethal attack 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.060
 This worries, yes, maybe they're in shape. 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.710
 with the possible lack 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.820
 I did not participate in Aílton who are players who have a power of 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.160
 marking 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.130
 you decrease 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.350
 in the power of creation of these players naturally has the possibility of 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.430
 stay longer with the ball 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.060
 and comes the flamengo renewed with the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.619
 the diploma passing a lot on the bottom line made the crossing and hit the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.200
 goal tinga from head to back has moved away and itaqui 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
 Can you confirm this? 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.080
 I hope I can 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.859
 the doubt and the vagner mission to attack the ball was disputed in stuttgart 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.350
 marcinho on the farm 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.350
 Ask Tony for time. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.900
 will divide this ball with him had freedom 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.939
 movie hundreds 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.140
 the response of the Flemish with the marcinho faces marking made the touch in the front 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.670
 parish of são paulo 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.879
 he makes the third 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.879
 with the ethical mark 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:39.629
 I think maybe 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.849
 the agenda includes 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.849
 it was not a luciana video view 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.260
 with excessive speed exposure if the accident project 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.459
 I have the impression that the goalie Eduardo failed to make sure she walks behind 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:53.909
 of the ball
