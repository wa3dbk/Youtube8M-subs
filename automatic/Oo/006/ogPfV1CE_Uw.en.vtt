00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.160 
hello youtube today I'm showing you how
to<00:00:02.939> crack<00:00:03.449> restrictions<00:00:04.440> code<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:05.549> your<00:00:06.450> iPad

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
to crack restrictions code on your iPad

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.430 
to crack restrictions code on your iPad
so<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.400> quite<00:00:08.700> annoying<00:00:08.970> when<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.599> go<00:00:09.750> into

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
so it is quite annoying when you go into

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.200 
so it is quite annoying when you go into
general<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.160> then<00:00:11.280> restrictions<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.000> then

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
general and then restrictions and then

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.160 
general and then restrictions and then
someone<00:00:12.599> set<00:00:12.960> around<00:00:14.809> essentially<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:16.049> they

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
someone set around essentially what they

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.160 
someone set around essentially what they
can<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:17.060> is<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:20.300> say<00:00:21.300> well<00:00:21.570> heaps<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.960> stuff

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
can do is just say well heaps of stuff

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
can do is just say well heaps of stuff
which<00:00:22.439> I've<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.890> done<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:23.550> this

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
which I've just done just for this

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.800 
which I've just done just for this
demonstration<00:00:25.939> yeah<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.150> kind<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> gets

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
demonstration yeah it kind of gets

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.420 
demonstration yeah it kind of gets
annoying<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.830> don't<00:00:29.039> know<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> code

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
annoying because you don't know the code

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.049 
annoying because you don't know the code
so<00:00:33.469> if<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.980> don't<00:00:35.190> know<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.820> there<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
so if you don't know this but there is a

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.060 
so if you don't know this but there is a
glitch<00:00:36.420> where<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> Bluetooth<00:00:37.800> keyboard

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
glitch where with the Bluetooth keyboard

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.770 
glitch where with the Bluetooth keyboard
with<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> Bluetooth<00:00:41.430> keyboard<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.120> glitches

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
with a Bluetooth keyboard it glitches

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
with a Bluetooth keyboard it glitches
and<00:00:43.050> even<00:00:43.559> though<00:00:43.680> there's<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.219> minute

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and even though there's the one minute

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.709 
and even though there's the one minute
thing<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.760> like<00:00:47.760> where<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> says<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.600> have

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
thing it on like where it says you have

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.479 
thing it on like where it says you have
to<00:00:48.750> try<00:00:49.050> again<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.559> minute<00:00:49.710> five<00:00:50.010> minutes

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to try again in one minute five minutes

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.740 
to try again in one minute five minutes
and<00:00:50.789> keep<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:52.850> if<00:00:53.850> there's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> glitch<00:00:54.420> where

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and keep going if there's a glitch where

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.510 
and keep going if there's a glitch where
it<00:00:55.050> doesn't<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:56.100> Bluetooth

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it doesn't do that for Bluetooth

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.389 
it doesn't do that for Bluetooth
keyboards<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.539> keep<00:00:57.690> going

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
keyboards and you can just keep going

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.400 
keyboards and you can just keep going
what<00:00:59.399> has<00:00:59.670> what<00:01:00.059> I've<00:01:00.180> done<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.289> an

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
what has what I've done is there is an

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.619 
what has what I've done is there is an
app<00:01:01.590> called<00:01:01.620> type<00:01:02.280> 2<00:01:02.760> phone<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.329> sure<00:01:03.570> I'm

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
app called type 2 phone I'm sure I'm

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.840 
app called type 2 phone I'm sure I'm
going<00:01:03.840> show<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.080> now<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.070> go

going show you now so it's just it go
away<00:01:05.939> from<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> iPad<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> second

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.560 

type<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> phone<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.290> use<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.570> connect

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
type the phone I use you just connect

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.749 
type the phone I use you just connect
with<00:01:15.900> using<00:01:16.530> bluetooth<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.220> Bluetooth<00:01:17.580> has

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
with using bluetooth your Bluetooth has

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.460 
with using bluetooth your Bluetooth has
to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.479> connect<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to be on and you just connect with you I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.910 
to be on and you just connect with you I
thought<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:21.479> acts<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> Bluetooth

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
thought and it acts as a Bluetooth

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.010 
thought and it acts as a Bluetooth
keyboard<00:01:23.159> really<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:27.090> tells<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.960> up

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
keyboard really it just tells you up

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.990 
keyboard really it just tells you up
there<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.590> presses<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.340> stuff<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.530> just

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
there with it presses and stuff so just

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.260 
there with it presses and stuff so just
put<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.090> aside<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:35.159> I've<00:01:35.280> done<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.990> I

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
put this aside and what I've done is I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:47.030 
put this aside and what I've done is I
have<00:01:39.270> made<00:01:40.460> an<00:01:41.460> apple<00:01:42.119> script<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:45.170> use<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.409> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
have made an apple script and use it to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.060 
have made an apple script and use it to
to<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.579> run<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.049> you<00:01:49.049> need<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.259> use<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:52.829> run<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
to like run it you need to use to run it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.550 
to like run it you need to use to run it
you<00:01:53.189> need<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> use<00:01:53.700> Apple<00:01:54.149> script<00:01:54.450> editor<00:01:54.840> so

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you need to use Apple script editor so

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.649 
you need to use Apple script editor so
I'm<00:01:55.979> gonna<00:01:56.189> get<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.610> my<00:01:56.700> documents<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.390> here

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.429 
going and you can see it doesn't matter
see<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.049> says<00:02:31.200> dragons<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.549> much

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
see it says dragons like that much

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.300 
see it says dragons like that much
doesn't<00:02:34.439> matter

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.729 

so<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:38.519> this<00:02:38.670> does<00:02:38.909> is<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.359> puts<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.379> every

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
so what this does is it puts in every

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.869 
so what this does is it puts in every
single<00:02:40.950> possible<00:02:41.280> code<00:02:41.730> from<00:02:42.090> zero<00:02:42.989> zero<00:02:43.260> zero

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
single possible code from zero zero zero

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.949 
single possible code from zero zero zero
to<00:02:44.879> one<00:02:45.389> two<00:02:45.959> nine<00:02:46.319> nine<00:02:46.470> nine<00:02:46.500> nine<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.840> if<00:02:48.840> I

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
to one two nine nine nine nine so if I

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.410 
to one two nine nine nine nine so if I
press<00:02:49.019> run<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:50.310> will<00:02:50.430> open<00:02:50.549> up<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.239> I'll

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
press run it will open up this and I'll

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.780 
press run it will open up this and I'll
type<00:02:51.659> in<00:02:51.840> all<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.049> codes<00:02:52.280> which<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.489> not<00:02:53.670> going

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
type in all the codes which is not going

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.009 
type in all the codes which is not going
to<00:02:53.879> happen<00:02:54.060> right<00:02:54.209> now<00:02:54.359> because<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.780> don't<00:02:54.930> know

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
to happen right now because I don't know

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:10.339 
to happen right now because I don't know
the<00:02:55.109> restrictions<00:02:55.620> open<00:03:08.629> so<00:03:09.629> if<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.079> give<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
the restrictions open so if I give the

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.030 
the restrictions open so if I give the
conditions<00:03:11.959> open<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.049> up<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.970> run<00:03:15.269> this

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
conditions open this up and I run this

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.330 
conditions open this up and I run this
it'll<00:03:17.040> start<00:03:17.310> bashing<00:03:17.609> in<00:03:17.910> codes<00:03:19.340> that'll

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
it'll start bashing in codes that'll

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.710 
it'll start bashing in codes that'll
happen<00:03:20.489> until<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:22.879> stops<00:03:23.879> and<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.940> use<00:03:27.269> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
happen until it stops and you use the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.710 
happen until it stops and you use the
failed<00:03:28.260> passcode<00:03:29.010> attempts<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.970> check<00:03:30.569> out

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
failed passcode attempts to check out

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.300 
failed passcode attempts to check out
the<00:03:30.810> code<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.230> if<00:03:31.349> you<00:03:31.500> record<00:03:31.919> it<00:03:32.069> you<00:03:32.129> put<00:03:32.280> a

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
the code so if you record it you put a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.990 
the code so if you record it you put a
video<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.699> it<00:03:32.819> your<00:03:32.970> record

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
video on it your record

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.860 
video on it your record
so<00:03:36.000> my<00:03:36.510> over<00:03:36.840> 20<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.470> then<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:38.010> look<00:03:38.750> just<00:03:39.750> like

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
so my over 20 and then I look just like

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.500 
so my over 20 and then I look just like
that<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.290> they<00:03:40.349> get<00:03:40.500> stopped<00:03:41.329> once<00:03:42.329> it

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
that and they get stopped once it

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.300 
that and they get stopped once it
unlocks<00:03:43.609> you<00:03:44.609> look<00:03:45.150> at<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.359> video<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:48.949> if<00:03:49.949> it

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
unlocks you look at the video and if it

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.089 
unlocks you look at the video and if it
said<00:03:50.519> like<00:03:50.790> mine<00:03:51.000> mine<00:03:51.299> said<00:03:51.599> 20<00:03:52.229> thing<00:03:52.829> you

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
said like mine mine said 20 thing you

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:11.320 
said like mine mine said 20 thing you
add<00:03:53.250> he<00:03:53.909> said<00:03:54.180> 25<00:03:56.690> attempts

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.360 

20s<00:04:12.330> there<00:04:12.510> okay<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.410> went<00:04:13.710> to<00:04:13.830> false<00:04:14.100> whoops<00:04:14.730> oh

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
20s there okay I went to false whoops oh

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.530 
20s there okay I went to false whoops oh
oh<00:04:18.110> oh<00:04:21.470> okay

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
oh oh okay

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.520 
oh oh okay
so<00:04:25.760> it's<00:04:26.760> on<00:04:26.970> 20<00:04:27.360> so<00:04:27.690> then<00:04:27.840> what<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.140> do<00:04:28.290> is<00:04:28.320> you

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
so it's on 20 so then what you do is you

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.240 
so it's on 20 so then what you do is you
add<00:04:28.680> one<00:04:28.980> so<00:04:29.310> since<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:29.820> was<00:04:30.060> 20<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:30.660> add<00:04:31.020> one<00:04:31.350> so

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
add one so since I was 20 I add one so

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.180 
add one so since I was 20 I add one so
the<00:04:32.580> code<00:04:32.820> must<00:04:33.120> be<00:04:33.270> zero<00:04:34.850> so<00:04:35.850> your<00:04:36.920> code<00:04:37.920> must

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
the code must be zero so your code must

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:47.390 
the code must be zero so your code must
be<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:39.750> know<00:04:40.070> zero<00:04:41.070> zero<00:04:42.500> two<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.780> then<00:04:46.400> we

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
be you know zero zero two and then we

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.870 
be you know zero zero two and then we
can<00:04:47.610> change<00:04:47.850> it<00:04:48.090> all<00:04:50.810> so<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:53.460> was<00:04:53.610> just<00:04:53.760> a

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
can change it all so that was just a

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.560 
can change it all so that was just a
quick<00:04:54.060> story<00:04:54.270> makes<00:04:54.870> all<00:04:55.170> in<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.440> description
