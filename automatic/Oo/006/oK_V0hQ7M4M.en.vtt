00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.050
 the woman 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.829
 let's start with three cheese legs 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.829
 cream 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.000

 grab our pool and let's grab 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 our three excess bars have to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.890
 be at room temperature because if 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.910
 It will not be very difficult to mix it 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.120
 ok now we're not going to beat with this what 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.900
 let's make it very creamy 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.900
 we believe if we believe it milestone it seems 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.900
 Mayonnaise 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.170
 since it's okay we want that way we're going to 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.750
 put sweetened condensed milk one 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.579
 If you do not know 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.820

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.760
 our condensed and sweetened milk what 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.840
 let's put vanilla extract and 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.150
 also a pinch of salt like that but now 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.160
 here we have a pound of strawberry but the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.340
 we're going to shred so they look like this and 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.320
 We are going to mix them very well here 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.960

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.110
 coconut the coconut oil looks so thick 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.110

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.470
 Look, nothing else, that made me tasty 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.590

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:36.100

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.740
