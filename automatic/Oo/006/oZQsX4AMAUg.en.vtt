difference<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.640> Green<00:02:37.180> was<00:02:37.960> more<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.260> a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
difference is the Green was more of a

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.980 
difference is the Green was more of a
metallic<00:02:38.650> green<00:02:39.130> he<00:02:39.670> had<00:02:39.820> more<00:02:40.030> gold<00:02:40.390> gloves

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
metallic green he had more gold gloves

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.530 
metallic green he had more gold gloves
his<00:02:41.710> gloves<00:02:42.010> were<00:02:42.160> more<00:02:42.340> gold<00:02:42.580> similar<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.420> his

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
his gloves were more gold similar to his

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.230 
his gloves were more gold similar to his
boots<00:02:43.750> here<00:02:43.960> and<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:45.130> think<00:02:45.340> his<00:02:45.430> cape<00:02:45.820> was<00:02:46.030> more

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
boots here and I think his cape was more

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.600 
boots here and I think his cape was more
of<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.330> metallic<00:02:46.660> purple<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.920> only<00:02:48.130> drawback

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
of a metallic purple the only drawback

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.280 
of a metallic purple the only drawback
is<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.150> only<00:02:49.180> reason<00:02:49.450> why<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.690> didn't<00:02:50.110> get

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
is and the only reason why I didn't get

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.820 
is and the only reason why I didn't get
it<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.590> because<00:02:51.330> well<00:02:52.380> one<00:02:53.380> thing<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.650> liked

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
it is because well one thing I liked

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.200 
it is because well one thing I liked
about<00:02:53.860> Mysterio<00:02:54.430> was<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.880> never<00:02:55.000> saw

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
about Mysterio was that you never saw

about Mysterio was that you never saw
his<00:02:55.360> face<00:02:55.390> Alicia<00:02:56.050> didn't<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.740> earlier

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
his face Alicia didn't in the earlier

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.390 
his face Alicia didn't in the earlier
comics<00:02:58.350> that's<00:02:59.350> why<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.530> like<00:02:59.770> this<00:02:59.950> figure<00:03:00.130> so

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
comics that's why I like this figure so

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.240 
comics that's why I like this figure so
much<00:03:00.550> is<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.420> his<00:03:01.690> dome<00:03:02.290> even<00:03:03.040> though<00:03:03.100> he's

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
much is that his dome even though he's

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.220 
much is that his dome even though he's
got<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.580> face<00:03:03.790> underneath<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:04.840> see

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
got the face underneath that you can see

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.840 
got the face underneath that you can see
I<00:03:05.560> mean<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.740> can<00:03:05.920> make<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.220> out<00:03:06.340> if<00:03:06.520> you<00:03:06.610> look

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
I mean you can make it out if you look

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.680 
I mean you can make it out if you look
at<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.620> from<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.770> distance<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.330> looks<00:03:10.600> like

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
at it from a distance it just looks like

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.430 
at it from a distance it just looks like
a<00:03:10.810> dome<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.940> other<00:03:13.440> reissue

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
a dome and the the other reissue

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.950 
a dome and the the other reissue
Mysterio<00:03:15.310> had<00:03:15.550> actually<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:15.970> lighter<00:03:16.510> colored

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
Mysterio had actually a lighter colored

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.360 
Mysterio had actually a lighter colored
dome<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.380> could<00:03:17.530> actually<00:03:17.650> see<00:03:17.950> right<00:03:18.160> into

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
dome you could actually see right into

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.490 
dome you could actually see right into
it<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:19.540> me<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.810> kind<00:03:19.990> of<00:03:20.020> spoils<00:03:20.380> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
it to me that kind of spoils the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.980 
it to me that kind of spoils the
character<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.100> didn't<00:03:21.340> get<00:03:21.460> him<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.870> way

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
character so I didn't get him in the way

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.110 
character so I didn't get him in the way
of<00:03:23.110> accessories<00:03:24.210> he's<00:03:25.210> got<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.660> cloud<00:03:26.940> puffs<00:03:27.940> of

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
of accessories he's got a cloud puffs of

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.750 
of accessories he's got a cloud puffs of
smoke<00:03:28.300> I<00:03:28.600> guess<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.250> guess<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:30.580> going<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
smoke I guess and I guess it's going to

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.520 
smoke I guess and I guess it's going to
be<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.910> puff<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.240> smoke<00:03:31.300> that<00:03:31.720> that's<00:03:32.230> what<00:03:32.410> it

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
be a puff of smoke that that's what it

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.260 
be a puff of smoke that that's what it
looks<00:03:32.710> like<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:33.040> me<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.670> makes<00:03:33.850> sense<00:03:34.120> with

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
looks like to me and it makes sense with

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:41.750 
looks like to me and it makes sense with
the<00:03:34.360> character<00:03:35.910> there<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.090> also<00:03:37.330> a<00:03:39.660> gallows<00:03:40.660> oh

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
the character there is also a gallows oh

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.700 
the character there is also a gallows oh
well<00:03:42.760> it's<00:03:43.180> on<00:03:43.360> wheels<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:44.080> idea<00:03:44.110> is<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.650> think

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
well it's on wheels the idea is I think

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.970 
well it's on wheels the idea is I think
you<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.310> rev<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.850> back<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:47.140> moves<00:03:47.410> forward

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
you you rev it back and it moves forward

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.980 
you you rev it back and it moves forward
so<00:03:48.160> when<00:03:48.970> he's<00:03:49.090> standing<00:03:49.570> on<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.960> looks

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
so when he's standing on it it looks

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.280 
so when he's standing on it it looks
like<00:03:50.290> he's<00:03:50.440> hovering<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:50.950> smoke<00:03:52.140> he<00:03:53.140> also

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
like he's hovering on smoke he also

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.070 
like he's hovering on smoke he also
comes<00:03:53.560> with<00:03:53.700> not<00:03:54.700> one<00:03:55.030> but<00:03:55.540> two<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:55.870> these

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
comes with not one but two of these

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.240 
comes with not one but two of these
birds<00:03:59.080> I<00:03:59.850> guess<00:04:00.850> they're<00:04:01.060> birds<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.920> don't

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
birds I guess they're birds and I don't

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.600 
birds I guess they're birds and I don't
know<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.600> think<00:04:04.600> they're<00:04:04.720> kind<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:04.900> dumb<00:04:05.110> but

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
know I think they're kind of dumb but

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.980 
know I think they're kind of dumb but
you<00:04:06.610> know<00:04:06.700> they<00:04:06.850> actually<00:04:07.180> look<00:04:07.330> a<00:04:07.450> lot<00:04:07.690> like

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
you know they actually look a lot like

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.070 
you know they actually look a lot like
the<00:04:08.320> one<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.550> creatures<00:04:10.330> in<00:04:10.360> Legend

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
from that I mean that's that's the

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.590 
from that I mean that's that's the
character<00:04:48.110> that's<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.190> toy<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:50.030> would

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
character that's the toy I would

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.050

definitely<00:04:50.990> recommend<00:04:51.110> him<00:04:51.970> especially<00:04:52.970> if

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
definitely recommend him especially if

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.880 
definitely recommend him especially if
you're<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.240> Mysterio<00:04:53.810> fan<00:04:54.080> like<00:04:54.320> I<00:04:54.470> am

you're a Mysterio fan like I am

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.460 
you're a Mysterio fan like I am
he's<00:04:55.520> definitely<00:04:55.970> worth<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.150> money<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.720> if

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
he's definitely worth the money and if

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.180 
he's definitely worth the money and if
you<00:04:57.620> ask<00:04:57.770> me<00:04:57.980> and<00:04:59.200> not<00:05:00.200> many<00:05:00.410> people<00:05:00.590> do<00:05:00.860> but<00:05:01.100> if

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
you ask me and not many people do but if

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.160 
you ask me and not many people do but if
you<00:05:01.310> ask<00:05:01.430> me<00:05:01.700> I<00:05:01.730> would<00:05:02.030> say<00:05:02.270> get<00:05:02.510> this<00:05:02.750> figure

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
you ask me I would say get this figure

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.280 
you ask me I would say get this figure
over<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.920> repaint<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:05.270> body<00:05:05.540> is<00:05:05.720> nice<00:05:05.960> on<00:05:06.200> the

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
over the repaint the body is nice on the

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.830 
over the repaint the body is nice on the
other<00:05:06.440> one<00:05:06.650> but<00:05:07.250> just<00:05:07.790> that<00:05:07.970> clear<00:05:08.330> dome<00:05:08.630> I

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
other one but just that clear dome I

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.140 
other one but just that clear dome I
think<00:05:09.050> spoils<00:05:09.470> it<00:05:09.620> for<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.860> character<00:05:10.280> if<00:05:11.000> you

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
think spoils it for the character if you

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.510 
think spoils it for the character if you
get<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.390> opportunity<00:05:12.020> you<00:05:12.860> definitely<00:05:13.340> want
