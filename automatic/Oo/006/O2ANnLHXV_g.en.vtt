00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:16.039
 FUJIFILM achieved the best wide-angle lens of 8.4 mm in its class as a high-performance high-magnification lens 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.039
 We will release a 99x zoom lens from December 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.870
 It is easy to occur on the telephoto side with a completely new optical vibration control mechanism this time 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:31.280
 I am improving the correction accuracy of the touching 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.880
 Is wide 832m strong good defense range from the show 4 runs 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.210
 I think it's a pen 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.120
 Not only objection is, for example, baseball Toka those things 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.500
 The theater is Air Goldia 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.390
 A good wide range of sports 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.690
 It is highly compatible with that said I see an event 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.840
 I think ease of use in various places 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.460
 It is such a nature 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.059
 We greatly review including constitution of lens in 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.930
 It is easy to touch the god already, expanded it 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:13.120
 Therefore policy is more likely effectiveness even for big shake 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.510
 With Toka high frequency is no longer lipid Ri feeling when you took it even for leaves sway 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.080
 I will 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:22.030
 It is easy to use more than two new questions in any way 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:26.500
 In addition, lens data such as zoom and focus can be output with high resolution 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:32.320
 Equipped with a 16-bit encoder as standard 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:35.620
 It is a great scene that generally use a virtual thing, which now went a little Toka relay 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.550
 Let's go together when we zoom in on two cameras 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.730
 The water of virtual condition is the data used for such kind of inside 2 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.810
 Is creating emissions from the lens 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:53.740
 99x high magnification zoom and resolution and transparency 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.620
 The combination of high optical performance with excellent color reproducibility is realized by the state-of-the-art engineering simulation technology 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.200
 It has been 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.050
 One of the features that do that Tteyuu is kana high-magnification zoom lens say the television lens 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.480
 is not it 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.840
 Not the Tteyuu technology to develop so went the zoom lens is we think that from that long ago 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.400
 The 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.170
 Have this much of the zoom Mr. Toka 99 times Toka 101 times act while 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.140
 You can't stop thinking of the spirit 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.030
 The technology of that optical design that entered and then the technology of polishing such a large lens 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.730
 Can not go to bed 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.060
 We are good at 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.930
 It is based on the place where saying 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.069
 The child is developing new products rapidly 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.510
 Is capturing the needs of the customer 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.510
 I'm promoting the phone in that way
