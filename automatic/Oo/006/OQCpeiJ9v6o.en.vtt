00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
you just don't know okay let's go with

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.609 
you just don't know okay let's go with
the<00:01:59.330> wind<00:01:59.600> ring<00:01:59.929> there<00:02:00.500> let's<00:02:01.190> get<00:02:01.399> Marisa<00:02:02.030> a

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
let's see that's only an IQ up by four

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.240 
let's see that's only an IQ up by four
and<00:02:08.840> considering<00:02:09.289> it's<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.560> high<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.130> think

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and considering it's that high I think

into a lot of fights out here and
they're<00:04:57.070> not<00:04:57.190> exactly<00:04:57.640> easy<00:04:58.090> I<00:05:00.900> am<00:05:01.900> really

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
they're not exactly easy I am really

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.680 
they're not exactly easy I am really

how<00:05:14.290> about<00:05:14.320> here<00:05:16.530> human<00:05:17.530> Revolution<00:05:19.530> I'll<00:05:20.530> see

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
how about here human Revolution I'll see

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.910 
how about here human Revolution I'll see
what<00:05:20.890> that<00:05:20.920> is<00:05:21.160> first<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.730> is<00:05:21.940> shield<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:26.740> would

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
what that is first it is shield it would

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.250 
what that is first it is shield it would
be<00:05:27.040> another<00:05:27.250> one<00:05:27.370> of<00:05:27.460> these<00:05:28.050> even<00:05:29.050> higher

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
be another one of these even higher

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.860 
be another one of these even higher
defense<00:05:31.350> well<00:05:32.350> let's<00:05:32.620> see<00:05:32.710> Uranus<00:05:33.160> defense<00:05:33.550> is

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
defense well let's see Uranus defense is

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:41.720 
defense well let's see Uranus defense is
47<00:05:34.870> vs.<00:05:35.830> defenses<00:05:36.520> 45

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:50.790 

and<00:05:43.440> then<00:05:44.440> give<00:05:44.680> her<00:05:46.050> prey<00:05:49.110> this<00:05:50.110> is<00:05:50.320> a<00:05:50.350> big

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
and then give her prey this is a big

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.480 
and then give her prey this is a big
area

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.830 

stop<00:05:56.490> I'm<00:05:56.670> going<00:05:56.850> this<00:05:57.060> way<00:05:57.210> anyway<00:05:58.460> I'm

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
stop I'm going this way anyway I'm

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:10.650 
stop I'm going this way anyway I'm
quickly<00:06:00.840> running<00:06:01.170> out<00:06:01.440> of<00:06:01.470> psychic<00:06:02.010> points

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:23.120 

I<00:06:10.750> don't<00:06:11.320> wanna<00:06:12.690> quit<00:06:13.690> it<00:06:15.390> so<00:06:16.390> many<00:06:16.770> enemies

appear<00:06:24.130> sign

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.990 

okay<00:06:28.810> so<00:06:28.870> I<00:06:29.200> assume<00:06:29.620> up<00:06:29.890> is<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.430> correct<00:06:30.820> way

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
okay so I assume up is the correct way
