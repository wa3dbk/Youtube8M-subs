over<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.480> realized<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
over I realized that you know the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.229 
over I realized that you know the
coaches<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.370> my<00:00:44.489> best<00:00:44.670> interest<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.180> heart

and<00:00:45.649> they<00:00:46.649> had<00:00:46.770> obviously<00:00:47.070> made<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> decision

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and they had obviously made a decision

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.709 
and they had obviously made a decision
but<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.750> decided<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:51.000> know<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.329> was<00:00:51.539> all

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
but I decided that you know it was all

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.410 
but I decided that you know it was all
worth<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.289> worth<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.550> opportunity<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
worth it it was worth the opportunity to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.280 
worth it it was worth the opportunity to
keep<00:00:54.570> fighting<00:00:55.020> football's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.680> crazy<00:00:55.920> game
