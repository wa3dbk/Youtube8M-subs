00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.820
 two 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.710
 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.740
 new bone tutorial video is not new it is 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.190
 my first video tutorial for them to 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.180
 like here I will teach 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:41.300
 makes music blocks 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.520
 and music discs and music box 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.850
 first we will see how to get out 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.990
 music discs 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:59.500
 they have to do this 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:01:04.480
 and then 30 later on so a giant 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.480
 of 15 of 15 long as well 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.259
 I already want to do the same 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.259
 hi finish doing the same 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.490
 yes 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.040
 and that's it 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:27.940
 the following have to put doors 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.020
 and so in this way why 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.220
 in this way he serves us does not work 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.630
 only so 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.630
 there since it does not matter 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.740
 no answer they were missing completely 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.680
 they do this well 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.450
 and here they continue to follow and leave a 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.320
 hollow in the middle to be malpensed that 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.820
 I say it 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.820
 good still 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.560
 up to the end 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.520
 and that would be like that 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.940
 you have to open the door 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.990
 every afternoon 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.800
 in what 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.150
 what is to put a skeleton 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.390
 yin 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.390
 and still believe here as vice versa 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.300
 Y 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.300
 Here I'll show you how you are 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.790
 they have to have an armor is not 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.050
 necessary but not something to 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.050
 kill for you 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.040
 get from scratch 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.330
 when to be at night 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.910
 Y 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.660
 you have to put and I say is that I'm in 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.270
 this map very difficult to do but it is 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.150
 normal is much easier because there is no 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.590
 so many tournaments and here you run and 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.030
 the skeleton is going to go on without 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.190
 problems 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.940
 well here we are going to be in the skeleton 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.940
 but almost 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:29.220
 come on me 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.350
 follow me here he closed the turn and go 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.350
 quickly home quickly 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.819
 and it made it very impressive 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.450
 well this is the most difficult step to put 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.450
 to the creever 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.140
 and without it killing him without exploding 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.610
 so let's do it like that 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.150
 that they run 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.349
 so quickly 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.349
 but where I am given 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.250
 not so much 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.060
 to 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.060
 that's why the complicated 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.420
 make another turn 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.510
 or trust 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.860
 and the sierra 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.860
 a fast fast fast 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.840
 and now what does it consist of? 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.840
 stay like this 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.740
 online line up so that the 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.800
 skeleton mater clip 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.780
 you have to have a long distance 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.780
 here here 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.900
 but no 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.540
 he killed 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.460
 and there is our disc 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.160
 I'm the same, you die a long time friend 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:34.050
 go dead 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.050
 well this would be the way to get it out 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.450
 well now 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.120
 and now I'm going to show you how to get 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.710
 how to make a music box 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.009
 with the day 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:58.540
 Oh 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.540
 is they need 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.110
 of work as you want to call it 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.110
 they need 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.169
 to see around here they should be 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.260
 here one diamond 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:17.150
 one of the rest 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.080
 Y 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.740
 all 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.460
 that is not necessary so much here leave 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.460
 all this without 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:34.409
 here put is called will have the turntable 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:37.159
 it's called a music box 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.159
 and here 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.370
 can you hear the sound of your child 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.690
 listen out 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.750
 what we have given 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.750
 it's all the same 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:09.010
 around the rest and so it would be 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:26.230
 good this is for music or for 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.790
 to put on and how it consists of melodies 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.480
 pencils 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.480

 no no 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:57.360

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.360
 thank you very much for watching 

00:07:57.529 --> 00:08:03.979
