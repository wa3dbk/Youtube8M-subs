00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
time that I spent getting those three

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.080 
time that I spent getting those three
glyphs<00:02:03.660> because<00:02:04.070> it's<00:02:05.070> kind<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.550> boring<00:02:05.760> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
glyphs because it's kind of boring and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.420 
glyphs because it's kind of boring and
repetitive<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.720> not<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.990> fun<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.230> watch<00:02:07.440> but
