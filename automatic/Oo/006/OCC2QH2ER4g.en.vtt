00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
there's a moon light in the main fixture

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.950 
there's a moon light in the main fixture
and<00:02:03.040> then<00:02:03.130> I've<00:02:03.250> got<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> hidden<00:02:03.670> LED<00:02:04.119> that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
and then I've got a hidden LED that

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.200 
and then I've got a hidden LED that
doubles<00:02:05.530> as<00:02:05.650> my<00:02:05.710> normal<00:02:06.640> light<00:02:06.790> that<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.000> just

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
doubles as my normal light that I just

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:30.990 
doubles as my normal light that I just
had<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.370> glowy<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.150> awesome

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000

and<00:02:31.090> then<00:02:31.810> at<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.350> main<00:02:33.220> moonlight<00:02:33.790> turned

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
and then at the main moonlight turned

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.890 
and then at the main moonlight turned
off<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.070> just<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.610> less<00:02:37.480> powerful

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
off so it's just the less powerful

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.380 
off so it's just the less powerful
moonlight<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:41.260> glows<00:02:41.650> even<00:02:42.160> more<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:43.060> it's

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:06.200 
although I think those LEDs in the back
are<00:02:54.540> throwing<00:02:54.780> off<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.200> colors
