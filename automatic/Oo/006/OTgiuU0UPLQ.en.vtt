smooth case now at first glance this
case<00:00:13.350> looks<00:00:13.559> pretty<00:00:13.770> simple<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.309> sort<00:00:14.549> of

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:14.609 
case looks pretty simple it's sort of

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.369 
case looks pretty simple it's sort of
like<00:00:14.699> a<00:00:14.760> mix<00:00:15.059> between<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.449> silicon<00:00:15.840> case<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.320> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
like a mix between the silicon case on a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.679 
like a mix between the silicon case on a
hard<00:00:16.680> case<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.520> know<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:18.000> flexible<00:00:18.539> but

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
hard case you know it's flexible but

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.829 
hard case you know it's flexible but
it's<00:00:18.810> still<00:00:19.020> tough<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.680> rigid<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:21.119> if<00:00:21.599> you

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
it's still tough and rigid but if you

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.120 
it's still tough and rigid but if you
look<00:00:21.960> at<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.109> closer<00:00:22.380> you'll<00:00:22.619> notice<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
look at it closer you'll notice that the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.849 
look at it closer you'll notice that the
corners<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.669> the<00:00:24.150> case<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.660> sort<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.499> bowed

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
corners of the case are sort of bowed

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.279 
corners of the case are sort of bowed
out<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> little<00:00:26.579> bit<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.419> act<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.839> bumpers

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
out a little bit and they act as bumpers

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.589 
out a little bit and they act as bumpers
and<00:00:28.560> these<00:00:29.310> little<00:00:29.880> corners<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.449> can

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and these little corners you can

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.390 
and these little corners you can
actually<00:00:30.749> change<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> colors<00:00:31.829> will<00:00:31.980> get<00:00:32.220> that

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
actually change the colors will get that

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.310 
actually change the colors will get that
in<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.640> sec<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.120> point<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.600> case<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.110> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
in a sec the point of this case is to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.490 
in a sec the point of this case is to
keep<00:00:34.560> your<00:00:34.770> phone<00:00:35.250> slim<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.239> sleek<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:37.320> also

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
keep your phone slim and sleek but also

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.709 
keep your phone slim and sleek but also
to<00:00:37.800> protect<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> against<00:00:38.670> drops<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.180> best<00:00:39.539> as

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
to protect it against drops as best as

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
to protect it against drops as best as
it<00:00:39.809> possibly<00:00:40.199> can<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:41.100> that's<00:00:41.280> why<00:00:41.430> these

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
it possibly can now that's why these

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.160 
it possibly can now that's why these
coordinates<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.270> great<00:00:42.510> because<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:43.050> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
coordinates are so great because as you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
coordinates are so great because as you
can<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.710> some<00:00:44.070> added<00:00:44.489> cushion<00:00:44.969> here

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
can see there is some added cushion here

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.599 
can see there is some added cushion here
at<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> corners<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:46.230> most<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> time<00:00:47.309> are

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
at the corners and most of the time are

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.660 
at the corners and most of the time are
a<00:00:47.789> lot<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> time<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.750> drop<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.289> phone

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
a lot of the time if you drop your phone

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.209 
a lot of the time if you drop your phone
to<00:00:50.670> break<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.179> it<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:52.769> breaks<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
to break it it what really breaks the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.340 
to break it it what really breaks the
phone<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.609> when<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.879> hit<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.269> on<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.480> corner<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
phone is when you hit it on a corner and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.579 
phone is when you hit it on a corner and
it<00:00:56.039> did<00:00:56.370> shatters<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.359> that<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.870> it's

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
it did shatters like that and it's

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.310 
it did shatters like that and it's
really<00:00:58.739> easy<00:00:58.859> all<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.429> to<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.199> put<00:01:01.199> it

that i definitely recommend this case

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.219 
that i definitely recommend this case
it's<00:01:47.369> super<00:01:47.729> cool<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.659> shape<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it's super cool with this shape of the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.359 
it's super cool with this shape of the
corners<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> color-changing

corners it adds a little bit of flare to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.310 
corners it adds a little bit of flare to
a<00:01:53.490> case<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.030> otherwise<00:01:54.420> wouldn't<00:01:54.930> really

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
a case that otherwise wouldn't really

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.279 
a case that otherwise wouldn't really
stand<00:01:55.770> out<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.979> much<00:01:56.689> so<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.840> take<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.200> off

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
stand out that much so if we take it off

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.660 
stand out that much so if we take it off
again<00:01:58.350> i'll<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.890> show<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.369> quickly

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
again i'll just show you really quickly

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.120 
again i'll just show you really quickly
how<00:01:59.789> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.149> change<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.659> color<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.130> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
how you can change the color of the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.520 
how you can change the color of the
corners<00:02:02.609> now<00:02:03.090> each<00:02:03.329> case<00:02:03.689> comes<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.289> bunch

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
corners now each case comes with a bunch

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.340 
corners now each case comes with a bunch
of<00:02:04.649> different<00:02:05.009> bumper<00:02:05.430> colors<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.700> let's<00:02:08.940> just

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.850 

I'll<00:02:12.160> throw<00:02:12.460> in<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.670> red<00:02:12.910> one<00:02:13.120> just<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.540> show<00:02:13.750> you

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.110 

so<00:02:17.860> will<00:02:18.040> pop<00:02:18.280> out<00:02:18.460> one<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.670> these<00:02:18.790> green<00:02:19.060> ones

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
so will pop out one of these green ones

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.690 
so will pop out one of these green ones
the<00:02:19.540> way<00:02:19.630> I've<00:02:19.780> been<00:02:20.080> doing<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.800> push<00:02:21.490> it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
the way I've been doing it is I push it

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.110 
the way I've been doing it is I push it
through<00:02:22.680> into<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> case<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:24.910> pops

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
through into the case and just pops

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.420 
through into the case and just pops
right<00:02:25.270> out<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.110> then<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.190> just

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
right out like that and then you just

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.130 
right out like that and then you just
line<00:02:27.820> up<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:30.370> go<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.910> go<00:02:30.940> from<00:02:31.300> inside<00:02:31.810> and

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
line up you go you go from inside and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.260 
line up you go you go from inside and
you<00:02:32.740> push<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.190> color<00:02:33.430> out<00:02:34.230> until<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:39.270> pops

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
you push the color out until it pops

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:48.270 
you push the color out until it pops
into<00:02:40.600> place<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:45.360> there<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.480> go<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:48.010> black
