00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
playing the game first of all the thing

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.500 
playing the game first of all the thing
that<00:00:26.310> helps<00:00:26.519> me<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> most<00:00:26.820> actually<00:00:27.390> my

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that helps me the most actually my

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960 
that helps me the most actually my
accuracy<00:00:27.960> has<00:00:28.289> improved<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.890> lot<00:00:29.130> because<00:00:29.519> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
accuracy has improved a lot because of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.939 
accuracy has improved a lot because of
the<00:00:30.570> dome<00:00:30.869> thumbsticks<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.619> guys<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.890> see

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the dome thumbsticks as you guys can see

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
the dome thumbsticks as you guys can see
first<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.669> they're<00:00:33.180> actually<00:00:33.690> elevated

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
first of all they're actually elevated

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.569 
first of all they're actually elevated
so<00:00:34.469> they're<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> little<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:35.040> higher<00:00:35.190> than<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
so they're a little bit higher than the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.580 
so they're a little bit higher than the
regular<00:00:35.790> thumbsticks<00:00:36.510> they're<00:00:37.079> much<00:00:37.410> more

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
regular thumbsticks they're much more

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
regular thumbsticks they're much more
comfy<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.100> well<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> don't<00:00:38.520> know<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:38.969> feels

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
comfy as well I don't know it just feels

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.479 
comfy as well I don't know it just feels
like<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.899> squishy<00:00:40.350> ish<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.219> they're

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
like kind of squishy ish but they're

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.220 
like kind of squishy ish but they're
really<00:00:41.670> grippy<00:00:42.239> which<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> main

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
really grippy which is one of the main

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860 
really grippy which is one of the main
things<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.700> seems<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.570> should

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
things and it just seems like it should

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
things and it just seems like it should
been<00:00:46.020> made<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.500> originally<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.370> think

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
been made like this originally I think

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.450 
been made like this originally I think
it's<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> ps3<00:00:48.809> thumb<00:00:49.020> sticks<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.680> Xbox<00:00:50.129> so

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's the ps3 thumb sticks on the Xbox so

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
it's the ps3 thumb sticks on the Xbox so
it<00:00:50.969> definitely<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> lot<00:00:51.629> more<00:00:51.780> grippy<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it definitely is a lot more grippy and I

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.680 
it definitely is a lot more grippy and I
think<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.239> better<00:00:54.390> for

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
think it's just a lot better for

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.319 
think it's just a lot better for
accuracy<00:00:55.230> wise<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.789> back<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
accuracy wise then on the back of the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
accuracy wise then on the back of the
controller<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> actually<00:00:58.109> has<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> grip<00:00:58.800> on

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
controller it actually has a grip on

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.160 
controller it actually has a grip on
that<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.280> well<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.809> prevent

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that as well and it's just to prevent

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.380 
that as well and it's just to prevent
your<00:01:01.410> hands<00:01:01.649> from<00:01:01.890> sweating<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.430> much<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
your hands from sweating as much and it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.210 
your hands from sweating as much and it
also<00:01:03.539> keeps<00:01:04.080> them<00:01:04.260> from<00:01:04.409> slipping<00:01:04.769> which<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
also keeps them from slipping which is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.250 
also keeps them from slipping which is
really<00:01:05.489> nice<00:01:05.729> actually<00:01:06.110> especially<00:01:07.110> after

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
really nice actually especially after

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.600 
really nice actually especially after
you<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:07.799> nervous<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.280> know<00:01:08.400> say

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
you get really nervous you know say

you get really nervous you know say
you're<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> quad<00:01:09.360> mob<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.750> something

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
you're going for a quad mob or something

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.080

you're<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> fourth<00:01:10.799> moab<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.340> start

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
you're on the fourth moab and start

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.760 
you're on the fourth moab and start
getting<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.390> nervous<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:13.260> hands<00:01:13.500> don't

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
getting really nervous your hands don't

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
getting really nervous your hands don't
slip<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.189> much<00:01:14.369> which<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:14.939> nice<00:01:15.180> then

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
slip as much which is really nice then

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.960

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
away from my aim stick which is really

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.649 
away from my aim stick which is really
nice<00:01:46.710> because<00:01:47.009> whenever<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.180> are<00:01:48.420> moving

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
nice because whenever you are moving

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.380 
nice because whenever you are moving
your<00:01:49.140> right<00:01:49.380> thumb<00:01:49.979> away<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:51.060> buttons

your right thumb away these buttons
right<00:01:51.509> here<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.840> hit<00:01:51.960> any<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.290> those<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
right here to hit any of those it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.410 
right here to hit any of those it
definitely<00:01:53.399> does<00:01:53.549> take<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
definitely does take a little bit of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480 
definitely does take a little bit of
time<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.500> time<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.100> definitely<00:01:56.280> be

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
time in that time you can definitely be

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
time in that time you can definitely be
getting<00:01:56.610> killed<00:01:56.969> by<00:01:57.060> an<00:01:57.180> enemy<00:01:57.299> because

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
getting killed by an enemy because

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480 
getting killed by an enemy because
obviously<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.680> won't<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.920> able<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> aim<00:01:59.340> or

the<00:02:36.720> scuf<00:02:37.110> controller<00:02:37.500> i<00:02:37.590> actually<00:02:38.040> ended<00:02:38.160> up

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
the scuf controller i actually ended up

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.160 
the scuf controller i actually ended up
getting<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.910> wired<00:02:39.270> one<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.870> guys<00:02:39.990> can

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
getting the wired one as you guys can

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.080 
getting the wired one as you guys can
see<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:41.400> reason<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.850> it's

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
see and the reason for that it's

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.820 
see and the reason for that it's
actually<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> little<00:02:42.780> bit<00:02:42.990> more<00:02:43.140> responsive

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
actually a little bit more responsive

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.680 
actually a little bit more responsive
than<00:02:43.860> wireless<00:02:44.550> obviously<00:02:45.060> because<00:02:45.450> you

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
than wireless obviously because you

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.240 
than wireless obviously because you
don't<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.020> go<00:02:46.170> through<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> wireless<00:02:46.710> signal<00:02:47.040> or

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
don't to go through a wireless signal or

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.250 
don't to go through a wireless signal or
anything<00:02:47.520> like<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.780> they<00:02:49.020> also

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
anything like that and then they also

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.950 
anything like that and then they also
sent<00:02:49.710> me<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.160> case<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.940> put<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.420> I'm<00:02:51.840> not

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
sent me this case to put it in I'm not

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.120 
sent me this case to put it in I'm not
really<00:02:52.080> sure<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.410> guys<00:02:52.590> will<00:02:52.830> need<00:02:52.980> that
