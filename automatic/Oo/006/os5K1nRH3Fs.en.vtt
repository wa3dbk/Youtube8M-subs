00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 very good to all these guys and 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.700
 welcome you map that you see you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.560
 a parkour map that I think is going to 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.650
 be very but very epic is called 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.179
 symbol x created with lord brands that 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 as you are seeing in the poster 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.960
 there on the left and around here I put 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.400
 a steve head because I'm not 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.390
 premium or not the truth that was head of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.470
 this and I do not see it for the package 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.330
 textures and by the version in which 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.890
 I am and let's see let's see let's 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.269
 see everything and a chest and here a strange 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.039
 to begin with let's determine the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.180
 standards and then we're going to launch 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.519
 start while I'm going to tell you a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.230
 couple of little things that I have in my head 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 play in creative to taste or by default 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.559
 the map is an adventure when you play 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.180
 in creative in case I fall because it is not 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.710
 I learn a lot of time do not change the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.809
 time has justified reasons to play 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.940
 in peaceful amount of august chung 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.250
 performance of everyone having fun by 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.710
 marc jazz coffee so without more ocampo 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 group would I'm not going to put the one of the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.860
 chung if I have it right in 16 I'm going to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.390
 Take away the music a little bit because I 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.800
 I'm going to play music of mine in the background 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.750
 so that you are relaxed and enjoying 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.309
 the video just let's go to was of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.190
 parkour that I have already been sent some 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.570
 images parc a symbol x only deviated 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.070
 parkour simulator already made a boat 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.019
 simulates and after a lot of time today 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.909
 welcome to symbolic bonus 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.750
 x parkour simulator because I have to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.550
 look like you 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.480
 a massive simulation room this is 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.860
 no kind of secret project 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.490
 It is only designed for your 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.140
 enjoyment 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 but before we start, we practice a bit 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.890
 are you see gamer yes or no chat tip 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.260
 and press response the brush and person 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.090
 answer placed well said 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.800
 my systems are ready in this 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.460
 moment you have to press the jump 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.460
 jump 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.550
 the boys assaulted here 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.930
 possibly we are in this part of 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.790
 down here but the jump looks like it's not 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.260
 it works at all and without more let's see 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.300
 if we can do this little parkour 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.860
 he has his things different things well 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.990
 cool look when looking at this has a 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 very epic paints a patch that relies on 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.560
 my systems were this goes against 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.340
 of any rule but to send to review 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.410
 that fails looks for the way to turn on 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.200
 simulate keys or my god engine not this that 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.520
 it's the engine it seems worth it puts once 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.649
 there he looks for the different engines of my 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 center to prepare me are three recorded 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.970
 this big band 'this seems to be pulsating 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.080
 all this we are going to have to look for what 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.550
 is what happens in this pair course 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.190
 simulator that and why it does not work 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.709
 I'm using everything I can 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.709
 in fact I would say that depression 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.040
 we have to relight this 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.720
 next and the truth is that the map is 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.860
 very curious and has taken quite some time 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.620
 of work because the boy was more 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.050
 sending pictures of parkour itself a 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.849
 design makes for cool to get the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.549
 stairs because this is going to me like watching 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.049
 because that after baleares that parkour 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.299
 It looks like that wall has been 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.709
 activated a parkour sell like this we 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.000
 we can pass the stop to be able 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.140
 get a little more ladder like that 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.489
 that we have to do this parkour of 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.500
 here that the truth is that it does not seem that 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.209
 it's very complicated but we're also going 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.819
 to see there we are the plates 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.530
 great because this other because open 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.209
 my god I fall as I do not have the day 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.489
 and a world of type be of a parkour 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.110
 and of course I ended up falling and if more 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.340
 boy tell you that even if you're not well 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.360
 lately many maps of parkour not 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.560
 you can continue sending the maps that 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.390
 you want to see me steal yahoo.es 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.239
 because every week I plan to go up 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.799
 one or two parkour maps to the taste of 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.140
 Sir, see if in the second one you want this 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.970
 week the truth is that these maps 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.860
 They are very cool and they are very cool 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.930
 that I love stairs of letter 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.650
 emergency enabled stairs that to 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.870
 times thus activated 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.370
 thanks every time I bet you shot 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.659
 I have to go for the stairs 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.129
 what is this I think I had gone to a 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.019
 strange place to try your port that I am 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.489
 over here he must have thrown the part 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.349
 from behind but I also just cut 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.030
 quickly by this side disabled 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.620
 emergency schemes so that I can 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.069
 continue this parkour simulator that 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.590
 I have here number 2 engine 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.269
 or if you start to feel better than ever 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.010
 one or two minutes is missing and also dyes 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.959
 as free and this strange world think 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.579
 missing the number 3 engine that would be this 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.749
 from here so if we are going to activate it 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.819
 so that everything is complete 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:50.650
 great mission 3 back to the parkour 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.810
 here we are going to paste the parkour itself and 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.549
 we continue with this small mission that 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.620
 is to make these little jumps from here today 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.569
 map is very cool and if more guys 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.400
 I wanted to tell you about the video 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.829
 yesterday they also commented the video for 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.239
 later you want the theme of what 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.980
 close of canada and more than some already 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.260
 they had given up for dead not some guys not 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.980
 no I'm not going to stop uploading videos to this 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.480
 channel 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.310
 you're good with the bow let's hope so 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.780
 of wii that sent here since for 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.129
 do you have to hit the target of your 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.530
 around higher than to give that of 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.949
 there or designation has got the focus a 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.949
 a little more 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.390
 Oh my God 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.390
 with the bow 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.300
 next to the ice in front of you that you're 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.770
 going up and super improvements but 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.200
 let's see let's see let's see 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.030
 let's go to the parkour simulator I'll have 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.010
 to climb to the top of the whole 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.010
 how is the issue of having to continue 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.520
 rivers do not kill us 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.630
 authors of the semi-frozen Cuba a 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.160
 caregiver is we want the much that the 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.330
 map interact with me 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.460
 in this way not that I'm commenting 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.290
 of depending on my position in which 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.150
 I am but what was good we 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.590
 saying is that some had taken for 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.030
 dead as if my channel would already be 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.380
 closed not yet not closed in fact 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.090
 I've already lived with two strikes in itself and 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.280
 has resisted not soon I wanted 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.540
 warn you of that case you do not see me in my 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.220
 channel disappears then it is in another 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.660
 channel but for now my content is going 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.430
 to continue as today in this same 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.570
 channel they are not allowed to fall into the 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.630
 parkour here surely is me 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.860
 Ferran speed I detour as I like 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.890
 this little being also wins with the 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.750
 ice that goes super sedated and super fast 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.750
 run runs run runs 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.070
 my god is beautiful is beautiful indeed 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.450
 I think you can find it in the 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.860
 plan page in minecraft if not me 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.140
 I'm wrong trying to leave the link in 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.970
 the description and if not then what if the 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.800
 creator of the map see the video that I 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.930
 put the comments on the link of your 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.280
 good the link where you have uploaded this 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.350
 map so you can download it and 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.830
 play it quietly this parkour 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.830
 simulator 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.080
 let's go up and never jump down 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.310
 Well, these guys who do not understand me 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.990
 yet I still left me fishing and 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.580
 For a while in fact I already commented that no 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.930
 you give me from youtube although they will mix the 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.310
 channel would follow me in another and it is no longer 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.270
 there was no problem whatsoever and people 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.160
 that I want to follow if it is already 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.300
 with me we mark get to last jump 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.760
 tells me 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.690
 today and it's great, I arrived just 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.520
 we are mail is running up is 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.200
 right now it is that we are also taking 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.450
 They are so frantic that you can not stop 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.400
 absolutely nothing let's go there see 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.780
 because the more concentration you have 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.160
 well I think I'm being the way 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.330
 correct of although I do not know I would 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.630
 they get very epic here between 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.310
 species of ice skewers and good if 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.840
 marquez later you will have a video of 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.700
 the worst tattoos in history to 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.740
 volume number two that in the end you liked 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.509
 a lot and a lot 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.880
 the tattoos that I think you're going to 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:41.400
 Have fun for a while, get on the block 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:49.650
 snow when I climb closer to the
