00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.299
 in 1980 and Dutch Japanese scientists invent an object that will 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.950
 revolutionize the music industry the compact disc today the cd allows 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.430
 to store millions of lives type of data at the office in the studios 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.030
 registration at home or in archived services after the cb is 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.030
 become an indispensable 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.849
 the manufacture of compact discs requires an environment of a 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.009
 cleanliness that meets charles any dust to compromise the 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.149
 process 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.959
 compact discs are copies of a disc do it after masters 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.560
 manufacturing starts a machine serious information in this case 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.640
 music on a thin glass plate with a laser beam 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.980
 after the transfer of the data one applies two chemicals a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 primer and a photo resist coating 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.410
 the disc and gently remove it from the machine and let the diaper dry 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.220
 photo resistant in an oven for 30 minutes 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.220
 m 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.950
 this developing machine has two giants the a1 projects water 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.570
 demineralized the second a solution that develops the data etched on 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.850
 glass 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.120
 the information is now written on the disk 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.420
 it is moved to a pooling station 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.780
 anaerobic digestion involves applying a thin layer of nickel and vanadium 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.100
 this age electrophoresis process gives birth to a matrix from 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.360
 which cdd will be made 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.060
 the younger of engraved glass and immersed in a chemical solution during 70 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.700
 minutes 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.329
 after this operation it can serve as a template for all copies 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.759
 a press cuts it according to the desired shape and the falls are 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.759
 recovered for recycling 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.909
 the matrix is ​​extracted from the machine and the film that protect the data and 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.079
 took of 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.909
 after a visual examination the disc is sent into the press room it is 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.909
 delicately placed in the mold that will give birth to the 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.109
 the discs are molded in a plastic called polycarbonate 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.509
 we close the mold in which we inject polycarbonate the team 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.169
 once hardened it comes in the form of a small hard drive and 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.469
 translucent 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.909
 the disc is now ready to be metallized to be read by a reader 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.699
 compact discs 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.339
 a robotic arm removes the disc from the ball and places it on a support 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.609
 anaerobic digestion is an extremely simple and brief operation 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.119
 consists of covering the plastic disc with a layer of aluminum on 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.119
 traffic 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:51.089
 here is the inside of the mold in which is applied the aluminum coating 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.179
 thanks to the almost complete automation of the process a plant can 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.179
 make up to a hundred thousand records a day 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.929
 in order to protect the surface of the speech apply to him a license that will serve 

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:18.929
 also adhesive backing for screen printing 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.729
 the varnish is dried by an ultraviolet lamp 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.319
 the past discs then to the labeling this machine can 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.319
 serigraphy and 70 help in 60 seconds 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:42.969
 once the operation is complete the disks are sent to the service 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.259
 shipping is as simple as that
