00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.980
Well, guys, we decided to sit down 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.290
and rest a bit under this wonderful tree,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.230
and were surprised to find tanks which must have really seen battle

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.470
and lived to see our days.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.130
You can tell, it must be some armored train.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.780
I mean, there are tracks under the vehicles, and on the right,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.420
there are shock absorbers.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.590
I think they are for rail tracks. Look here.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.090
Here you can see tank guns. 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.310
I don’t know where they belong.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.240
You can see these ones don’t have turrets, so they must be from here.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.400
Well, who knows?

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.390
What do we have here? Let’s see!

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.110
Yes, guys, this is the stupendous FV alpha striker, the British Tier X TD.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.850
Or Tier IX!

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.720
Or Tier IX.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.590
When you’re standing near it, 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.330
you can’t even figure what modification it is.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.800
They are all alike, but… this one certainly was stupendous.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.320
Can you feel the power?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.280
And guys, look what happens if you get hit by artillery.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.610
Both tracks.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.590
Both tracks are knocked off. Poor Sherman.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.830
And, guys, you get this unspeakable feeling when you see a Churchill arty.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.990
What do we see here? 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.800
Some variation of Matilda.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.190
And this thing? Quadratisch, praktisch, gut.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.560
Ah, that’s the Cruiser Mark II A.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.660
And this one is from the same family, I guess.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.010
Well, Cruiser Mark I.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.840
Clear. Low level—not very interesting for me, personally.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.180
I think I know these contours!

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.550
And this is the Somua, the S35 Somua.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.910
This is certainly a Crusader.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.240
You know these curves, right? Every tanker does.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.980
Here, you can watch “Fury” for free.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.830
And this, I missed it at first, is a Conqueror, Tier IX, yes, that one.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.780
Looks great, eh?

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.770
This one, as you may easily guess, is the Centurion.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.100
And the Comet is standing near it.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.370
You can put a hand in there, but there’s no light,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.670
so you won’t see a thing there.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.030
А TOG II, wow!

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.190
Guys, this is the TOG II!

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.510
Max!

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.940
Here you are!

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.630
Guess what!

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.830
You little sausage!

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.340
Is there a way to get inside?

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.550
Well, well, well. 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.160
Nice. 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.530
That’s really a long one.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.930
I won’t see that myself, but my camera will!

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.050
My hand was inside the TOG!

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.120
What’s up, Vlad?

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.800
This hand was inside the TOG!

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.700
This one is your favorite, right?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.440
I’m not going to wash my hand ever again!

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.840
Who's that pokémon? It’s the Matilda!

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.680
Our T-34. Well, not really “our,” this one is Polish!

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.010
See, 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.780
this eagle on the emblem says

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.820
it’s from the Polish army.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.120
And this, I assume, is that very Tiger.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.390
I hope it’s the one, because, you see, it has the same sandy color.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.980
The Tiger you can see starring in “Fury.”

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.620
It seems to be in running condition and fully repaired.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.940
Today, we are going to see if it’s true and what it looks like.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.600
The Comet cruiser.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.160
Oh, the T-72. You can easily recognize it.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.870
Oh my god! Oh my god!

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.810
Who was asking for a Type 59? Come here, to Bovington.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.650
There is one, take it, it’s pretty good. Nice one to ride.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.750
And the M60, by the way.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.740
With that commander’s cupola many players dislike.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.660
And a lamp. 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.110
You wide-eyed thing!

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.290
Kids love the Type 59, and not only on the RU server.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.380
This one said: “Oh, the Type 59!”

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.050
Which I think means: “Oh, the Type 59! Take a photo,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.410
take a photo, this is that Chinese tank!”

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.370
The Tiger 131 is preparing 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.500
for its next battle with the Shermans.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.610
Starting soon.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.930
The reenactment of the battle from “Fury” is about to start—

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.410
I think we all remember it pretty well.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.140
OK, we’ll try to capture it, although the field is so large

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.410
and I’m afraid you won’t be able to hear any comments.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.120
This museum has a motto 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.760
you can sometimes hear on the radio between the songs:

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.060
“Not all museums are quiet!”

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.770
How good can the British be at reenactment?

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.240
Oh! I could even feel the heat.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.020
Me too!
