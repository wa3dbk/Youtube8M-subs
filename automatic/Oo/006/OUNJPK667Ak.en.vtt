00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 hey people today i have the box 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.519
 here at the start - probably already 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.559
 seen above why is the white 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.849
 bought that is just so little 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.139
 black I wanted and because I too 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.570
 not red wanted and because it is still so 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.460
 did not exist and because it is not black either 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.230
 gave and then I just took white 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.779
 Well, I think that's pretty much anyway 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.160
 fresh it is not so 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.890
 real white really sounds right now 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.330
 pretty stupid but I mean so 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.500
 here you have the paper , so to speak 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.559
 papers and here you have a nice wm 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.420
 Ok so I know a bit 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.820
 make time an all-round view of the part 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.469
 and then you tell each other perfectly 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.410
 all around here was tata up there 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:01:01.379
 Of course this is the company of course 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:02.609
 sides or here probably so here 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.470
 design is not acceptable at all 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.320
 complain you have two speakers 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.960
 a pure one is clear I am here one 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.490
 right here and here he is not into the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.470
 because he really is not that much 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 subwoofer power has but say now 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.700
 always perfect jobs the price is 300 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.890
 Now I'll probably be 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.250
 think 300 euros so I can 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.960
 about 30 years buy candles like 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 possible to smell good about lavender 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.409
 or other super devices like Bose 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.530
 and so on 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.590
 Of course you can not do that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.570
 pose device also live audio I think 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.110
 no no I do not think so no because 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.030
 live audio aka dj box the game of skate 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.909
 jam ochs but in the big box funny 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.090
 much better than live audio but too live 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.950
 audio come to me later said live audios 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.729
 and you can, so to speak, the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.399
 software rarely update 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.390
 You can freshen up so to speak simply 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.640
 times 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:19.720
 stick your sweet box to the computer 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.190
 and yes then this woman felka bonn.de 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.020
 or come or wherever you are 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.190
 roots and then here it can be partly 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.470
 nice update so I think it's pretty 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.170
 pretty cool that's a great incentive 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.350
 to buy the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.030
 yes then I think that's what it was from 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.930
 We just have the facts now 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:46.810
 So what's all on it so here 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.500
 You can easily query your jam box 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.959
 how much battery is still available so 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.340
 I can show you the same 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:03.250
 here you have a break at plus break and 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.950
 play back before - um plus so - is 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.220
 it is clear that will extend volume 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.400
 increase again according to stengl 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.360
 here on the right side 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.730
 So from my point of view now home 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.959
 institution button 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.730
 That's it so you can say two 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.799
 Connect devices if you have the button 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.940
 So presses two iphones two android 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.519
 and so on 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.049
 Ios devices and so you can 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.640
 So a little djs play then you can 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.620
 what to play and then a buddy what 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.100
 so it pretty much plays on it 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.820
 nice gimmicks I say so here 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.640
 connect the cable 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.540
 here it is so a pc can knock 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:50.250
 and here it is raining then I think 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.250
 Let's turn on the first monument 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.579
 right there starts with such a nice kink 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.019
 and just to show me so the 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.000
 sound quality as well as likely 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.630
 Every thousand type is not so good 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.670
 like a youtube here as if you were 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:12.180
 as when I hear that, so I have 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.180
 just have a nice arabica music in 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:26.260
 that is lightweight the absolute live 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:28.900
 audio the wisdom of god do I do with 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.290
 times live audio just goes up there 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:56.260
 plus and minus together for 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:57.639
 three days it's been really loud 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.180
 I really have to admit she is doing very well 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.460
 very loud 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.260
 probably also heard here and 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:13.539
 So you can go here I wanted you to go before it 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:16.030
 Show that this is really great you 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:20.289
 know exactly batteries 11 o'clock and here 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.900
 upstairs if you look at it here 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.789
 that next to the battery indicator wherever 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.340
 again , this is what it wants to charge 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.960
 small woods that the battery too 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.539
 if it is twice as empty, of course 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.979
 It says as much as the box is simple 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.979
 you have to damn the recordings 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.910
 I am generally with the vegetable 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.620
 quite satisfied that had now times 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.450
 so I did all the stuff here 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.830
 in general I am the jem if you are 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.889
 I am happy with you 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.720
 drive with you to take it easy 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:53.979
 just too complicated to take easy 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.050
 scrap prodi and testified beach though 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.690
 just she is just really cool 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.620
 take a cat she has a strong 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:04.900
 super horny designer super horny design 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.550
 to 300 euros so there you have it today 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.560
 even consider if I'm worth something like that 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.150
 which, of course, all networks players 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.800
 Tire is the software update 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.300
 and you can change the voice of 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.340
 For example, we have this device 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.419
 now this sexy female voice but 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.039
 you can also do one for example 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.150
 superheroes or something on it 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:24.470
 that's why the box gets 80 of me 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.470
 out of 100 possible points
