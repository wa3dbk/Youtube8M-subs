00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 kitchen and body is engaged like crazy 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.649
 just to take out the toxins we're 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.690
 talking about a fast in our times 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.019
 it seems unusual to us because 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.179
 eat we are used to eating 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.880
 but formerly it was eaten or made 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.770
 these fasts in a habitual way 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.750
 religiously even medically the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.170
 modern world led us to leave it 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.240
 sideways 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.519
 however fasting is something that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.230
 practice a long time ago and for purposes 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.900
 therapeutic also yes and some 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.210
 religions do it in a common way the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.640
 True transport variation arrives 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 how to connect with the tourist 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 absolutely for meditation 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 deep one giving a special status 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.820
 with a much deeper perception and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.250
 more lucid as to see not only with the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 external world there is a specialization of 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.800
 not be consuming the world then 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.020
 there is also an introspection with 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.360
 regarding your own paradigms 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.760
 of cleanliness to the integral leader not only 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.460
 physically mentally and emotionally then 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.320
 there are a thousand things that if there are people you need 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.840
 in crisis or in your partner 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.540
 source of toxicity is she because this 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.610
 is the product of the thought study of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.890
 name this be loved I mistreat you what 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 it is almost guarantee that with lucidity 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.600
 of the syrup decided to separate heat I 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.100
 down at the source the toxin 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.110
 the weight loss is finally like the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.740
 second derivative of this the objective 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.170
 new is like inevitably the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.050
 others of people of benefit and one very 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.300
 strong that competes go with the best 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.520
 diets that but it's a plus benefit 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.259
 among many others that's why I say I 'm not 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.060
 a diet is once intoxications that 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.280
 he says I'm not interested in detoxifying myself 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.869
 I want to pay ten kilos today dale no 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.310
 Detoxify yourself as much as possible 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.740
 deeply possible and in this way 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.600
 As a consequence, you will not only lose 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.490
 weight but to keep you in time what 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.990
 what it costs to rebound the organs how 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.600
 the metabolism works better 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.789
 that way you do not know how to eat like before 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.440
 that you live as before with time 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.500
 surely will achieve how much time there 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.600
 to do great things and stand 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.009
 if you eat as before you will get to what 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.519
 ideal but the minute arrived when you're going to 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.159
 get to mess up all this again 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.049
 It should be done once a year 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.120
 is one at the beginning is a little and I 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.590
 comes out sometime years ago and it's not like 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.299
 bad degree of toxicity that one accumulates 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.599
 then much smaller than the first few times 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.349
 that they let your body purge 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.720
 absolutely then but what 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.390
 important is to create habit there is a switch 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.519
 that those who did it know that it is 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.680
 automatic you propose it or not be 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:37.439
 good guide taking only liquid 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.579
 it's a journey in experience and 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.260
 depending clear of your anxiety degree 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.810
 it is as long as it is not done then 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.340
 that modifies you there is something that I know very rich 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.849
 regarding the awareness of what 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.739
 He has said not only not to eat but 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.750
 that you can not smoke 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.659
 there are a number of other prohibitions not 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.849
 nothing just water infusions or you take 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.469
 during the 10 days of syrup the syrup 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.060
 as such that is your food is to say you 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.889
 you are feeding what is happening that is not 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.609
 is chewing and swallowing but you're 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:10.419
 Feeding and nourishing is a fast 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:12.549
 protected is not with water such homeopathy 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:15.069
 sorry that also important that 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.810
 guarantees that you are machines that 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.430
 They are very good at dancing and throwing 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.409
 body is located through the urine and 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.879
 that superimportant generates migraine and one 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.840
 associates it with hunger, which is what 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.969
 it happened to me the first day 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.870
 the toxin when a lot when I'm very 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.340
 toxic 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.150
 the toxin at the beginning yes they are 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.150
 saying error 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.020
 like not where is the sausage the 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.660
 burger where is this pure 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.700
 I do not understand liquid myopathy 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.280
 what it does is to say that toxin that 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.560
 are moving it will not be generated alone in a 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.750
 headache but take it out for 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.310
 the urine 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.650
 at no time by don felipe del 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.300
 nervous system for no reason is 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.340
 it may have collapsed there is no 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.740
 why entering the nervous system is 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.920
 the one that most benefits to entering a class 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.840
 of yoga we are attacking just that 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.420
 the nervous system is much more 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.600
 focused writing your thoughts 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.680
 much more clearly when one meditates 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.050
 there are more lights 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.880
 and I can imagine a day without eating and 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.170
 I would be tearing out of video granda I is 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.830
 the same and in fact at the first time 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.830
 I'm going to confess it 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:28.140
 but not even seven days we made a 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.270
 group as well as it is not the idea one be 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.480
 full and conditioned of ideas and 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.500
 paradigms 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:42.760
 my idea was if I do not like to die if I do not 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:44.950
 as good as great in society 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.210
 He is super and I am dying this 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.210
 anxiety for the tomato
