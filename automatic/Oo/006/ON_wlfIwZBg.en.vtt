we<00:00:29.830> were<00:00:29.980> asked<00:00:30.370> as<00:00:30.430> USDA<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.180> look<00:00:31.780> at<00:00:31.930> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
we were asked as USDA to look at the

we were asked as USDA to look at the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
started thinking about mining data and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.869 
started thinking about mining data and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.640 
think as your services brings us it's a
