 heil hi to all i'm james alias 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.540
 jah fixed on youtube 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.700
 I make video tutorials on 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.990
 photoshop after effects on the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.420
 web development with remember 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.630
 eventually our paw more over is 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.420
 on bones linux operating system 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.420
 and windows 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.760
 so I'm 22 years old from the Caribbean 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.860
 hi then me this is there is surf i'm going 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.450
 do my presentation right after that I 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.830
 will make you the presentation of g3 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.660
 design so he did not have time to 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.230
 to do hers so I do it to her 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.079
 quickly 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.630
 so it was actually a graphic designer so 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.500
 mainly on cinema 4d and 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.480
 photoshop 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.610
 so I do not know perfectly 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.010
 but that's what I see it does too 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.820
 so in his spare time videos on 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.160
 video games 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.570
 so it's pretty crazy gamer so 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.980
 apparently not a professional gamer 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.810
 but a gamer for fun 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.390
 so I think he will suggest you 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.280
 really good quality videos 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.950
