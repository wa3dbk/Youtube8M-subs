drawings via photographs via impressions
what<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.110> what<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.799> all<00:02:20.950> about<00:02:20.980> this

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
what that what that is all about this

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.280

these the semester and it's really

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.240 
these the semester and it's really
important<00:02:26.200> phase<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.620> project<00:02:26.829> where

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
important phase of the project where

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.880 
important phase of the project where
they<00:02:27.340> where<00:02:27.700> they<00:02:27.940> get<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.420> chance<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.590> give

back<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.140> our<00:02:32.260> studio<00:02:32.620> see<00:02:33.250> them<00:02:33.430> represent

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
back to our studio see them represent

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.580 
back to our studio see them represent
these<00:02:34.209> things<00:02:34.510> via<00:02:34.780> their<00:02:34.989> documentation

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
these things via their documentation

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.840 
these things via their documentation
sketching<00:02:36.430> models<00:02:36.820> etc

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
sketching models etc

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.060 
sketching models etc
not<00:02:38.180> only<00:02:38.600> at<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.870> physical<00:02:39.380> side<00:02:39.590> but<00:02:39.920> also

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
not only at the physical side but also

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.000 
not only at the physical side but also
at<00:02:40.450> economical<00:02:41.450> conditions<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
at economical conditions and

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.740 
at economical conditions and
relationships<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.030> site<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.720> think

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
relationships to the site and I think

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.840 
relationships to the site and I think
that's<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.350> best<00:02:45.500> way<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.770> be<00:02:46.070> actually<00:02:46.520> here

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
that's the best way to be actually here

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.030 
that's the best way to be actually here
and<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.750> meet<00:02:47.930> with<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.200> committee<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.680> meet

with Berner those sort of things that's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.670 
with Berner those sort of things that's
actually<00:02:52.280> our<00:02:52.940> main<00:02:53.300> task<00:02:53.630> for<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.410> first

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
actually our main task for this first

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.730 
actually our main task for this first
site<00:02:54.980> visit<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:56.270> look<00:02:56.780> at<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.110> bridge<00:02:57.470> in

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
site visit you look at that bridge in

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.650 
site visit you look at that bridge in
just<00:02:58.010> less<00:02:58.550> than<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.790> hundred<00:02:59.090> years<00:02:59.210> ago<00:02:59.420> there

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
just less than a hundred years ago there

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.750 
just less than a hundred years ago there
was<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.840> railroad<00:03:00.140> train<00:03:00.710> running<00:03:01.160> across<00:03:01.430> that

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
was a railroad train running across that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.940 
was a railroad train running across that
bridge<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.390> now<00:03:02.570> here<00:03:02.930> they're<00:03:03.440> thinking<00:03:03.800> of

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
bridge and now here they're thinking of

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.980 
bridge and now here they're thinking of
taking<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.430> away<00:03:04.550> from<00:03:04.700> us<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.450> our<00:03:05.600> history

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
taking it away from us and our history

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.470 
taking it away from us and our history
so<00:03:06.040> important<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:07.490> what<00:03:07.730> people<00:03:07.880> come<00:03:08.270> to

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
so important it's what people come to

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.930 
so important it's what people come to
the<00:03:08.600> key<00:03:08.780> for<00:03:09.170> not<00:03:09.380> just<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.800> fish<00:03:10.040> not<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.730> to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the key for not just to fish not just to

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.060 
the key for not just to fish not just to
dive<00:03:11.180> not<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.960> to<00:03:12.050> have<00:03:12.200> wonderful

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
dive not just to have wonderful

dive not just to have wonderful
friendship<00:03:13.610> here<00:03:13.970> but<00:03:14.420> also<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.840> know<00:03:15.110> the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
friendship here but also to know the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
before they were here to save history I

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.200 
before they were here to save history I
mean<00:03:23.330> even<00:03:24.230> Europe<00:03:24.710> they<00:03:24.920> can<00:03:25.220> say<00:03:25.550> Kendrick

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
mean even Europe they can say Kendrick

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.930 
mean even Europe they can say Kendrick
is<00:03:26.360> all<00:03:26.630> buildings<00:03:27.260> we<00:03:27.800> certainly<00:03:28.340> can<00:03:28.640> save

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
this wonderful section of fish

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.030 
this wonderful section of fish
this<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.879> not<00:03:32.090> only<00:03:32.299> for<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.200> futures<00:03:33.890> to

this is not only for the futures to

this is not only for the futures to
count<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:35.090> also<00:03:35.420> this<00:03:36.049> is<00:03:36.109> a<00:03:36.260> tribute<00:03:36.980> to

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
that work to build this whole section

that work to build this whole section
from<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.989> city<00:03:45.370> west<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.810> right<00:03:47.810> now<00:03:48.049> we're

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
from the city west and right now we're

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.610 
from the city west and right now we're
working<00:03:48.859> on<00:03:49.099> saving<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.540> old<00:03:50.780> section<00:03:51.439> of

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
working on saving this old section of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.800 
working on saving this old section of
the<00:03:51.829> old<00:03:52.010> seven<00:03:52.609> mile<00:03:52.790> tree<00:03:53.090> well<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.510> think

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
the old seven mile tree well I think

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.709 
the old seven mile tree well I think
that<00:03:54.200> this<00:03:54.319> is<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.730> fantastic<00:03:55.730> opportunity<00:03:56.000> I

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:56.719 
that this is a fantastic opportunity I

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.990 
that this is a fantastic opportunity I
mean<00:03:57.379> when<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.650> was<00:03:57.739> with<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.189> ot<00:03:58.459> many<00:03:58.700> years

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
mean when I was with the ot many years

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.229 
mean when I was with the ot many years
ago<00:03:59.739> we<00:04:00.739> always<00:04:01.099> tried<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.519> save<00:04:01.909> the<00:04:02.120> old

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
ago we always tried to save the old

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.539 
ago we always tried to save the old
bridges<00:04:02.749> I<00:04:02.959> think<00:04:03.319> it<00:04:03.439> would<00:04:03.560> be<00:04:03.709> an<00:04:03.799> asset<00:04:04.310> for

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
bridges I think it would be an asset for

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.759 
bridges I think it would be an asset for
the<00:04:04.700> history<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.150> this<00:04:05.299> community<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:06.049> what

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
the history of this community and what

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.059
