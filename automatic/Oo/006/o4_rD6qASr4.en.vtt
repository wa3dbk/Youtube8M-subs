 hello to all guys here at blizzard that 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.490
 speaks to you in this video today we will go to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.730
 see how to create a server for 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.859
 minecraft in version 1.4 1.6.4 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.529
 sorry because you still can't 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.029
 make server at 1.7.2 since it is not 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.150
 released at the kraft update 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.420
 bike.it ok let's go first 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.160
 google and we look for kraft on the internet 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.010
 buckley bach kate we go to the site 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.010
 where there is written dl punto bar kit tutor 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 download and download the arcom and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.649
 build markit version 2.0 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.629
 then the video divides it into two parts 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.230
 the one in which we will install server e 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.250
 the one in which we will start it in 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.219
 sense we will connect with us p it will create 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.290
 a custom ip type not with i 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.570
 numbers but with words and other things that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.010
 now pauses a second visa for 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.880
 do not wait 20 seconds of video 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:19.310
 without speaking hi 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.140
 ok has finished downloading now meanwhile 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 let's go to the desktop and create one 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.479
 new folder and name tutorials 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.479
 I do not know 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:44.430
 and watch out for the Phoenicians to dump you 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:49.380
 really means a lot from the ok is 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.229
 finished we put in the ok folder 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.500
 Now let's open the folder and do a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.659
 right click new text document e 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.659
 we call it start 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.180
 let's open and now the five a string of 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 text that I will leave you in anyway 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.459
 description you only need to make a copy 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.070
 paste in in the notepad and then 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.360
 let's save as 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.459
 select the directory but the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:28.260
 folder we call it starred two start 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:30.540
 bat point the bat point must be there 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.220
 it must be because otherwise it will never start 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.700
 need ok so let's go save we'll see 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.360
 which will add this to a batch file 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.489
 windows 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:49.950
 ok block our we can only cancel 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:52.320
 now it will be enough for us only to open here and have 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.540
 already of course we will have to rename the 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.540
 kraft markit file 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.220
 so we have to call it craft bike it 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.170
 without nothing 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.269
 we can turn on without problems yes 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.340
 start it all now you see that it prepares everything 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.459
 and the spawn area that would be the world 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.610
 where we won't answer then I'll show you 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.640
 also the settings how to set as 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.459
 server shit like they serve online on 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.780
 line sense prix yakhont premium that for 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.750
 doing it the first time will take a 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.410
 moment because it must spur must do 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.410
 all say 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.170
 must generate all finished 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.349
 we see we see that they have been created 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:46.959
 lots of file folders is all of us 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:49.390
 we're going to look for file servers as well as 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.480
 must be a file of type file 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.000
 properties there is a right button 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.190
 open with you can open it either with block 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.050
 notes that note more 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.360
 try advice notes papi more because 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.060
 so you can once when adding 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.819
 server networks you can set better 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.310
 ok we will see it all together 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.220
 written then but in class to have 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.430
 properties qua non not touch anything 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.220
 double nothing the nether we leave on true 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.540
 if you want black if you don't want the level 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.690
 of the world that will go to load like 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.720
 main world in this case ops in 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.530
 this world case is enough for you 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.229
 put another you can also put a 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.630
 other world delete this ward here 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.280
 rename it and rename the world that 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.900
 you put world so you can have 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.900
 what you want 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.830
 then all of light to allow 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.140
 to fly 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:50.050
 leave the server port on falls 2 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.360
 55 65 we leave it so the veltheims 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:59.380
 default does not touch anything here Force 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:01.510
 game mode falls the game mode as god 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.270
 the creative mode the ip servers that 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.660
 we will go see what we need in the 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.080
 second part of the video in another 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.750
 in another video maqboul eight al 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.550
 maximum constructions the maximum height 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.350
 of the buildings that in this case there 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.220
 256 npc spawn is true i 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.070
 bot 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.960
 when you want to put a bot for example 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.970
 with your name to show that 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.729
 you are the founders of the server 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.639
 the white list would be the list of 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.840
 people who can enter the server 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.120
 they always look on falls so they can 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.250
 enter everyone 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.720
 spoon and animal where we can play 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.030
 animals the arc mode bow texture 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.440
 pack puts marquee with texture packs 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.389
 that you want to keep in this case 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.970
 leave white for the texture of 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.010
 default ie don't write anything online 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.630
 mode through if you want server to be 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:00.210
 online then for premium or maybe if 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.130
 you want ppp through if 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.900
 you want there to be maybe you don't want it 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.820
 ie pvp player versus player or a 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.310
 player bring another player has 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.960
 with the pendulum the zero difficulty is 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:18.979
 peaceful or easy 2 blah blah 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:22.169
 the 00 survival or creative one 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:25.139
 play time out yesterday 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.660
 the max player player node the number 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.389
 of maximum default event players 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.169
 but we could also put it 2000 and ne 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.220
 so spam 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:38.729
 monsters on the web like zombies 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.830
 creeper so generalit structures that 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:44.910
 are the structures like the villages of the 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:47.099
 villic so max of distance and la 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.740
 block generation ie chunk 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:51.599
 maximum one chang corresponds to 16 for 16 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.330

 your server when you open minecraft 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.690
 go multiplayer you will see it 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:11.570
