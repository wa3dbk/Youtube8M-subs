00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:06.850
 money every year all over the world 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.820
 produced 100 billion banknotes a 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.130
 the expense goes even more the total amount of all 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.070
 banknotes in everyday life is trillion 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.269
 dollars is thousands and thousands and millions 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.820
 dollars but the trouble is that these 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.189
 money does not live long average 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.579
 the life expectancy of a banknote is a little 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.460
 more than a year and worse still so 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.550
 relatively easy way to fake them 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.160
 so how do you create a virtually eternal 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.399
 a banknote with which you can do everything and 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.690
 only you can not fake it 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:46.269
 made welcome to 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.149
 australian melbourne where is the money for a long time 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.170
 already stopped being dirty 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.329
 faced with a double problem in 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.339
 first fast wear note in 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 second notable improvement 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.929
 counterfeit money production methods 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.280
 Australian Reserve Bank decided 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:05.049
 radically destroy the tradition in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.119
 1988 there began an experiment with 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.710
 fundamentally new banknotes which 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.619
 literally impossible to spoil 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.380
 made it out of plastic it was such 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:18.579
 success she became popular around the world 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.979
 from new zealand to nepal production 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.310
 plastic money Australians started here 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.439
 with these little polymer granules 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.659
 tiny balls melt on top of this 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.450
 huge metal pipe and in front 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.210
 us with the spectacle of the feeding stage 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.610
 molten polymer mass on the way 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.100
 liquid is cooled by streams of water 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.000
 now it's time to move on to the next phase 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.689
 process 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.520
 if you ever blown up bubbles 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.729
 get ready for a surprise this is one of 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.570
 the largest bubbles in the world with a height of 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.570
 five-story house 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.410
 he is so huge that its impossible 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 see all at once it's just the tip 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.550
 while the bubble is under the right 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.500
 the pressure of his wall is always one 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.900
 thickness it must be constantly monitored 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:18.160
 just this huge bubble 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:21.400
 stretched to 20 meters at the very bottom 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.230
 bubble polymer is rolled into rolls and he 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.230
 becomes like a sticky film 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 using infrared meter 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.160
 bandwidth checked correctly or 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.750
 the film has polymer sheets thickness 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.090
 rolled into rolls 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.030
 each of which represents 8 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.640
 kilometers of film and weighs one and a half tons 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.580
 now after creating polymer films 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.800
 there is another problem like plastic 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.850
 apply paint so that it is not at all 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:03.830
 erased to solve the problem need 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.030
 powerful press and very resistant paint on 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.519
 each side of the sheet 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.489
 put up to five layers of white paint 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.850
 creating a matte adhesive surface on 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.680
 which can now be applied drawing 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.380
 it may seem that something is not here 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.680
 enough but on every note should 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.700
 stay small transparent window 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.680
 the presence of such windows 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.319
 on the film they check special 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.150
 pulsating flash is one of 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.040
 main characteristics of plastic 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.080
 banknotes because it will be here 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.299
 located the main element of protection against 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.920
 fakes the next stage in 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.500
 special camera in these windows 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.940
 Eats an image providing 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.430
 counterfeit protection 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.070
 the process is closely watching 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.250
 technical specialist for each cat 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.920
 laser causes 5 tiny images 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.070
 at a speed of 20 billion operations in 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.760
 second this image is very similar to 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.130
 hologram 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.019
 except that its possible 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.480
 design with a laser 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.269
 pointer and through it you can look at 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.370
 light such a thing is very difficult to fake 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.750
 and we still do not know the fact of forgery 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.750
 our products 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.600
 now the polymer can be cut into a sheet and 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.220
 they are practically and ready for the next one 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.220
 production stage drawing pattern 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.169
 at first this special machine deals 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:40.970
 background colors on both sides 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:43.009
 banknotes next banknotes are moved to 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:52.220
 another machine where it will be imposed 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:54.500
 next coat of paint worker 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.110
 shakes the sheets to make sure 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.470
 that they are not stuck in it now for 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:04.789
 the hands of future banknotes worth 750 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:07.729
 thousand dollars the next printing press 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.949
 causes the next paint layer to be embossed 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.949
 drawings and some fine details 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.440
 due to different ink layer thickness 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.389
 the surface of the banknote becomes uneven 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.139
 ribbed and and it becomes easier to distinguish 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.139
 from fake 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.440
 the process of creating banknotes is almost complete 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.500
 but they lack one important thing 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.230
 element of protection from a fake unique 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.110
 serial number 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.660
 the first is set manually on the meter 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.120
 the number of the next series of banknotes and now 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.810
 the machine is ready to start printing serial 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:53.630
 numbers for an 8-hour shift from it 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:55.730
 get off two and a half million banknotes in 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.800
 a few kilometers from here on the local 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.080
 beach swimmers should not forget 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.840
 pull your bills out of your pockets 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.960
 before you go water but in australia 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.060
 it doesnâ€™t matter dipping your cash 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.490
 this guy can also calm 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.690
 pay them off at the bar how he did it 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.690
 before swimming
