00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
and I'm freaking out cool ROM it's made

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.919 
and I'm freaking out cool ROM it's made
by<00:00:12.150> DPA<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.440> look<00:00:13.590> into<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.750> these<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:15.870> all

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
by DPA if you look into it these are all

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.660 
by DPA if you look into it these are all
the<00:00:15.990> components<00:00:16.139> goes<00:00:16.800> away<00:00:17.130> stores<00:00:17.520> pretty

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the components goes away stores pretty

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.880 
the components goes away stores pretty
nicely<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.590> actual

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
nicely so this is the the actual

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.380 
nicely so this is the the actual
microphone<00:00:20.310> with<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> gooseneck<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
microphone with the gooseneck and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.570 
microphone with the gooseneck and
condenser<00:00:22.199> microphone<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.800> phantom

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
condenser microphone it's a phantom

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.250 
condenser microphone it's a phantom
powered<00:00:23.820> mic<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.750> we'll<00:00:24.869> need<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> run<00:00:25.140> that

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
powered mic so we'll need to run that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.750 
powered mic so we'll need to run that
channel<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.890> 40v<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> adapter

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
channel with 40v this is the adapter

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.790 
channel with 40v this is the adapter
just<00:00:29.760> XLR<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.900> button<00:00:31.380> pin

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
just XLR to this little like button pin

thing<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:32.940> clips<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
thing and it just clips on them to the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.299 
thing and it just clips on them to the
violinists<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.739> pants<00:00:35.070> or<00:00:35.190> whatever

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
they're built cool so you take the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.160 
they're built cool so you take the
microphone<00:00:39.870> out<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.680> its<00:00:41.520> case<00:00:42.079> you'll<00:00:43.079> see

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
microphone out of its case you'll see

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
is actually how the Tao the the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.700 
is actually how the Tao the the
microphone<00:01:07.860> mounts<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.090> violin<00:01:09.420> so

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
microphone mounts on to the violin so

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.450 
microphone mounts on to the violin so
you'll<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.040> there's<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.310> little

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
you'll see that there's this little

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.120 
you'll see that there's this little
groove<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.720> see<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.860> there

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
groove here you can see that like there

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.670 
groove here you can see that like there
this<00:01:14.820> goes<00:01:15.060> onto<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> gooseneck<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
this goes onto like the gooseneck at the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.450 
this goes onto like the gooseneck at the
very<00:01:16.860> bottom<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.810> then<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.530> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
very bottom and then what you do is you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.160 
very bottom and then what you do is you
take<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.729> little<00:01:20.909> shield<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.750> pull<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> down

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
take this little shield and pull it down

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
take this little shield and pull it down
over<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.490> connection<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.330> kind<00:01:24.450> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
over the connection so it just kind of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.660 
over the connection so it just kind of
like<00:01:24.630> locks<00:01:24.900> into<00:01:25.110> place<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> has

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
like locks into place and then it has

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.600 
like locks into place and then it has
this<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.619> zip<00:01:28.619> tie<00:01:28.799> kind<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.189> thing<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
this little zip tie kind of thing that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.719 
this little zip tie kind of thing that
you<00:01:30.450> pull<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> down<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.430> your

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you pull up and down so if you have your

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
you pull up and down so if you have your
mic<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.290> violin

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
mic or your violin

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.800 
mic or your violin
so<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.490> violin<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.210> here<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
so your violin is like right here and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.679 
so your violin is like right here and
your<00:01:37.439> bridge<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.770> about<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.509> point

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
your bridge is about here at that point

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
your bridge is about here at that point
you<00:01:39.840> take<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.259> violin<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.130> put<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you take your violin and you put it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.840 
you take your violin and you put it
inside<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.810> push<00:01:43.290> down<00:01:43.320> or<00:01:44.040> push<00:01:44.549> up

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
inside and then you push down or push up

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
inside and then you push down or push up
on<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.570> thing<00:01:45.689> until<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.079> snugs<00:01:46.350> into

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
on that little thing until it snugs into

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
on that little thing until it snugs into
place<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.130> once<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.909> place<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
place and once it's in place there you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389 
place and once it's in place there you
