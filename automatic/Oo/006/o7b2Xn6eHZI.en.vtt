well a lot of people ask why are we
doing<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.680> trip<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.480> why<00:00:12.480> don't<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.080> just

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
doing this trip and why don't we just

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.280 
doing this trip and why don't we just
try<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> like<00:00:14.070> sell<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.910> thing<00:00:15.210> try<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.960> start

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
dramatically change not just the way we

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.220 
dramatically change not just the way we
build<00:00:47.249> and<00:00:47.519> use<00:00:47.699> electric<00:00:48.089> vehicles<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:49.170> also

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
build and use electric vehicles but also

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.779

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
vision is these things go underneath the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.229 
vision is these things go underneath the
car<00:02:00.929> in<00:02:01.170> some<00:02:01.500> sort<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.920> compartment<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.000> this

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.239 
car in some sort of compartment but this

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.270 
car in some sort of compartment but this
is<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.630> our<00:02:03.659> trip<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.590> nice<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.009> easy

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
is for our trip it's nice and easy

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.690 
is for our trip it's nice and easy
I<00:02:05.629> designed<00:02:06.629> a<00:02:06.750> wireless<00:02:07.469> network<00:02:07.500> where<00:02:08.429> each

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
I designed a wireless network where each

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.940 
I designed a wireless network where each
module<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.329> talk<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.750> each<00:02:09.840> other<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
module can talk to each other and the
