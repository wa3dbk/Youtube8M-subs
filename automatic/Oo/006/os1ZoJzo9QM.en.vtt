00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.710
 the part of three sixty can both 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.189
 leisure as well as backside shot 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.949
 become 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:37.899
 the most important elements of movement are 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:41.699
 in both directions very similar people 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.699
 the turn with a tight turn 1 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.579
 initially load the back foot slightly 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.470
 stronger 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.659
 So the board comes to the 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.269
 Snow surface and is easier 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.010
 rotate 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.930
 after about 90 degrees you reduce the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.030
 effort angle and shift the weight 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.710
 on the other leg 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.350
 more precisely on the new rear leg 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.080
 at 180 degrees, import plan is in the snow 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.500
 that means you do not have it right now 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.780
 known your weight remains on the new 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.770
 back leg and slowly you knew 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.899
 the board on after three quarters 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.920
 Rotation relocates the weight 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.570
 the original rear leg to the end 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.729
 The turn will reduce you again 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.729
 rise angle and make the bot plan 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.200
 in an advanced version 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.849
 you can do the first 180 degrees as well 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.670
 Jump in where you talk about that 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:41.830
 back leg pushes off after the first 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.479
 half turn you land plan on the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.060
 los and Slayer is in connection the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.259
 second 180 degrees as in the already 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 known variant 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.460
 Have fun with your bergfex team
