from<00:00:09.780> behringer<00:00:10.200> here<00:00:10.349> so<00:00:11.309> as<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:11.610> said<00:00:11.790> this

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
from behringer here so as we said this

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.610 
from behringer here so as we said this
is<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> mixer<00:00:12.750> designed<00:00:13.080> for<00:00:13.230> use<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.590> your

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
is a mixer designed for use with your

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.799 
is a mixer designed for use with your
tablet<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.759> say<00:00:14.910> tablet<00:00:15.360> because<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.690> have

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
tablet and I say tablet because we have

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.660 
tablet and I say tablet because we have
an<00:00:15.900> iPad<00:00:16.260> here<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:16.800> we're<00:00:16.920> also<00:00:17.070> planning<00:00:17.430> on

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
an iPad here but we're also planning on

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.510 
an iPad here but we're also planning on
providing<00:00:17.869> Android<00:00:18.869> support<00:00:19.199> as<00:00:19.350> well<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.890> so

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
providing Android support as well and so

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.609 
providing Android support as well and so
with<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.630> mind<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.109> don't<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.439> any

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
with that in mind we don't have any

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.189 
with that in mind we don't have any
docking<00:00:23.130> system<00:00:23.519> here<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.539> actually<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
docking system here we actually have the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.830 
docking system here we actually have the
Wi-Fi<00:00:25.619> unit<00:00:26.070> directly<00:00:26.609> built<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.269> here<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
Wi-Fi unit directly built in here so you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.300 
Wi-Fi unit directly built in here so you
haven't<00:00:28.140> don't<00:00:28.380> worry<00:00:28.650> about<00:00:28.740> plugging<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
haven't don't worry about plugging in a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.589 
haven't don't worry about plugging in a
router<00:00:29.490> no<00:00:29.789> configuration

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
router no configuration

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.840 
router no configuration
you<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.289> connect<00:00:32.040> right<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> internal

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
you just connect right to the internal

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.870 
you just connect right to the internal
router<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.750> good<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.989> go

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
router and you're good to go

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.860 
router and you're good to go
taking<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> look<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> connectivity<00:00:36.719> here

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
taking a look at the connectivity here

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.440 
taking a look at the connectivity here
this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.170> actually<00:00:37.469> an<00:00:37.559> 18<00:00:38.040> input<00:00:38.520> twelve<00:00:39.180> bus

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
this is actually an 18 input twelve bus

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.510 
this is actually an 18 input twelve bus
mixer<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.230> how<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.680> breaks<00:00:40.860> down<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.399> have

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
mixer so how that breaks down is we have

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.900 
mixer so how that breaks down is we have
16<00:00:42.000> -<00:00:42.390> designed<00:00:42.719> mic<00:00:43.379> preamps<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.280> those<00:00:44.760> are

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
16 - designed mic preamps and those are

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.250 
16 - designed mic preamps and those are
con<00:00:45.059> combo<00:00:45.510> jack<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.140> go

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
con combo jack so you can go

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.709 
con combo jack so you can go
quarter-inch<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.039> well<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.480> then<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.690> have

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
quarter-inch in as well and then we have

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.830 
quarter-inch in as well and then we have
two<00:00:49.110> more<00:00:49.260> inputs<00:00:50.039> via<00:00:50.250> RCA<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:51.149> return<00:00:51.600> from

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
two more inputs via RCA for return from

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.080 
two more inputs via RCA for return from
CD<00:00:52.410> player<00:00:52.620> etc<00:00:54.500> basically<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.949> twelve<00:00:56.640> buses

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
CD player etc basically the twelve buses

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
CD player etc basically the twelve buses
breaks<00:00:57.329> down<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.840> six<00:00:58.170> aux<00:00:58.440> sends<00:00:58.949> four

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
breaks down we have six aux sends four

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.990 
breaks down we have six aux sends four
monitor<00:01:00.239> mixing<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> those<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.739> dedicated

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
monitor mixing and those have dedicated

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.450 
monitor mixing and those have dedicated
graphic<00:01:03.000> EQs<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.449> outputs<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.280> have

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
graphic EQs and outputs and then we have

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370 
graphic EQs and outputs and then we have
four<00:01:05.820> dedicated<00:01:06.060> effects<00:01:06.780> ends<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.170> we

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
four dedicated effects ends because we

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.230 
four dedicated effects ends because we
feature<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.799> same<00:01:08.040> effects<00:01:08.580> processors<00:01:09.060> as

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
feature the same effects processors as

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.109 
feature the same effects processors as
the<00:01:09.360> x32<00:01:09.750> digital<00:01:10.170> console<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:10.920> CF<00:01:11.820> for

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the x32 digital console in here CF for

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
the x32 digital console in here CF for
dedicated<00:01:12.720> sends<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
dedicated sends for that and then of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.679 
dedicated sends for that and then of
course<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> stereo<00:01:14.610> bus<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.060> there's<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.360> 18

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
course a stereo bus so there's your 18

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.550 
course a stereo bus so there's your 18
inputs<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.290> 12<00:01:17.280> buses<00:01:17.990> lot<00:01:18.990> far<00:01:19.470> as

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
inputs and 12 buses lot far as

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.749 
inputs and 12 buses lot far as
processing<00:01:20.070> goes<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.520> everything

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
processing goes it's got everything

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
processing goes it's got everything
you'd<00:01:21.000> expect<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.479> digital<00:01:21.810> mixer<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.409> lot

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you'd expect from a digital mixer a lot

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
you'd expect from a digital mixer a lot
of<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.830> will<00:01:22.920> look<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> same<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.580> our<00:01:23.700> x32

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of it will look the same as our x32

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080 
of it will look the same as our x32
family<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.979> gates<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.580> dynamics

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
family so you have gates and dynamics

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
family so you have gates and dynamics
and<00:01:27.210> eq<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.840> chat<00:01:28.049> every<00:01:28.320> channel<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and eq is on chat every channel and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.249 
and eq is on chat every channel and
again<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> four<00:01:29.790> effects<00:01:30.570> slots<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.049> about

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
again the four effects slots with about

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.350 
again the four effects slots with about
45<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:31.979> 50<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> different<00:01:32.939> effects<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.240> can

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
45 or 50 of different effects you can

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.780 
45 or 50 of different effects you can
choose<00:01:33.659> from<00:01:34.159> taking<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> look<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> back<00:01:35.610> of

choose from taking a look at the back of
the<00:01:35.880> unit<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.900> include<00:01:37.259> alternate<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.890> here

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the unit we do include alternate on here

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.219 
the unit we do include alternate on here
which<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.360> our<00:01:39.450> personal<00:01:39.869> monitoring

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
