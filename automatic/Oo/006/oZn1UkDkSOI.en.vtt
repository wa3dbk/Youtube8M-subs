00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
windup hunter is one of those cards

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
windup hunter is one of those cards
where<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:47.910> purpose<00:00:48.539> does

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
ever used this card after as a mighty

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.600 
ever used this card after as a mighty
went<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.719> only<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.070> main<00:00:56.250> reason

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
went to one and the only the main reason

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
went to one and the only the main reason
that<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.910> mighty<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.329> broken<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:57.989> three<00:00:58.289> was

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that the mighty was broken at three was

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.260 
that the mighty was broken at three was
because<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.190> wind<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.699> hunt<00:00:59.850> early<00:00:59.940> like

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
because of the wind up hunt early like

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.970 
because of the wind up hunt early like
it<00:01:00.390> doesn't<00:01:00.780> serve<00:01:00.930> any<00:01:00.960> practical<00:01:01.500> purpose

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it doesn't serve any practical purpose

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.520 
it doesn't serve any practical purpose
in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> deck<00:01:02.489> other<00:01:03.059> than<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.690> facilitate<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
in the deck other than to facilitate the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.250 
in the deck other than to facilitate the
loop<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.700> as<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> card

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
loop so I just don't like it as a card

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.080 
loop so I just don't like it as a card
ultimate<00:01:07.260> offering<00:01:07.470> band<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.640> been<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
ultimate offering band it's been in the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.960 
ultimate offering band it's been in the
TCG<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> definitely<00:01:11.549> think<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
TCG so you know I definitely think that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.910 
TCG so you know I definitely think that
it<00:01:12.240> probably<00:01:12.270> needs<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.080> go<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.229> OCT<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> mean

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it probably needs to go in OCT I mean

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.249 
it probably needs to go in OCT I mean
all<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> does<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.509> know<00:01:15.659> gadget
