00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
no one of course a six months later that

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.360 
no one of course a six months later that
I<00:00:42.239> would<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.480> doing<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.899> that

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
I would be doing just that

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.819 
I would be doing just that
now<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.760> point<00:00:45.050> had<00:00:46.050> he<00:00:46.260> been<00:00:46.410> showing

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
now at that point had he been showing

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.060 
now at that point had he been showing
signs<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:48.570> come<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.260> are

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
signs that you have now come to know are

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.630 
signs that you have now come to know are
indicative<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.840> CTE<00:00:52.190> certainly<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> time

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
indicative of CTE certainly at the time

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.750 
indicative of CTE certainly at the time
I<00:00:53.699> would<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.180> never<00:00:54.710> thought<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> putting

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
I would have never thought of putting

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
I would have never thought of putting
the<00:00:56.850> two<00:00:57.000> together<00:00:57.410> but<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.649> course

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the two together but now of course

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.270 
the two together but now of course
looking<00:00:59.219> back<00:00:59.539> yes<00:01:00.539> definitely

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
looking back yes definitely

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.780 
looking back yes definitely
you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.239> nothing<00:01:03.660> nothing<00:01:04.110> major<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.519> there

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you know nothing nothing major but there

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.450 
you know nothing nothing major but there
were<00:01:05.880> certain<00:01:06.330> signs<00:01:06.570> yes<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:08.100> short-term

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
were certain signs yes the short-term

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.830 
were certain signs yes the short-term
memory<00:01:08.820> loss<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> short<00:01:11.580> fuse<00:01:11.960> definitely

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
memory loss the short fuse definitely

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.679 
memory loss the short fuse definitely
and<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:17.490> didn't<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:17.909> make<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and you didn't actually make the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.730 
and you didn't actually make the
arrangements<00:01:19.259> until<00:01:19.590> after<00:01:19.920> he<00:01:20.070> passed<00:01:20.630> yes

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.690 

that<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.100> thing<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.400> left<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that was the one thing when I left the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.179 
that was the one thing when I left the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
