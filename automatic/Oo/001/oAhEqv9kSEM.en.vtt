 that is eaten in a sauce 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.500
 but also here there is something important the 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.040
 light chile in an ancestral importance 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.770
 if in this area precisely very 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.460
 close to trasqua pan is the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.309
 town of 26 and this town until the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.190
 date is a great producer of chile 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.080
 serrano chile serrano siles is the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.720
 most known variety here in this 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.630
 so that they produce even more 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.630
 great that it has and so do those 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.330
 dry it dehydrated to put the chile 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.560
 serrano seco and chile serrano fresco today 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.210
 and this sauce is made by this insect 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.920
 it's called jaoui or software this in this 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.930
 language is practically emerging and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.210
 they are practically in this region of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.460
 mezquital valley 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.530
 It is practically a type of spider 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.190
 practically that is in this 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.250
 mesquites or in this the wizards is a 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.970
 very peculiar flavor this could not 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.300
 compare with some others 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.180
 but it's a little animal 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.760
 Harmless the only way to defend 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.550
 of your urine which is this one as a type 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.500
 acid is based on very aromatic iodine and 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:09.740
 this irritant but the animal is milled 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.200
 complete with the chili in favor of this 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.900
 you have and tomato the chile the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.520
 insect is fried in oil first it 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.160
 it has to decline because of the high content 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.710
 of iodine then this is to translate it 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.780
 in water with salt 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.640
 and healthy is giving us iodine 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.250
 if you want but still it's pretty 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.250
 strong the amount of iodine 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.900
 with a proud corn tortilla and 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.790
 we have here within cut 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.770
 two larvae in fact here we have what 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.410

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.320
 maguey one is the buzzer and the other is 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.090

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.350
 it is less known even to me more this 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.130
 hard to find 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.280

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.590
