vinyl cleaner but this is a good first

00:01:18.950 --> 00:02:25.690 
vinyl cleaner but this is a good first
step<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.700> do<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.920> clean

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.369 

anyway<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.879> still<00:02:27.329> I<00:02:27.569> still<00:02:27.719> have<00:02:28.109> to<00:02:28.230> go<00:02:28.349> over

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
anyway I still I still have to go over

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.759 
anyway I still I still have to go over
this<00:02:28.709> with<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.980> better<00:02:29.519> cleaner<00:02:29.879> solution<00:02:30.769> but

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
this with a better cleaner solution but

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.429 
this with a better cleaner solution but
it<00:02:32.549> gets<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.909> bulk<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:33.450> off<00:02:33.599> at<00:02:33.840> first<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
it gets the bulk of it off at first and

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.050 
it gets the bulk of it off at first and
