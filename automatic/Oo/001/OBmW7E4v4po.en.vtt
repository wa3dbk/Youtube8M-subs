00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
okay now I'm coming in and in bar seven

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.110 
okay now I'm coming in and in bar seven
of<00:00:05.640> this<00:00:06.090> 12<00:00:06.750> bar<00:00:06.990> slow<00:00:07.349> blues<00:00:08.000> picking<00:00:09.000> up

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
of this 12 bar slow blues picking up

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.790 
of this 12 bar slow blues picking up
from<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> end<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.690> bar<00:00:09.870> six<00:00:10.230> which<00:00:10.500> was<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
from the end of bar six which was the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.390 
from the end of bar six which was the
four<00:00:11.040> chord<00:00:11.570> moving<00:00:12.570> back<00:00:12.720> to<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> one<00:00:13.080> chord

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.019 

so<00:00:17.400> right<00:00:17.640> there<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:19.160> got<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.369> full<00:00:20.609> step<00:00:20.849> Bend

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
so right there I got a full step Bend

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.349 
so right there I got a full step Bend
that's<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.329> end<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.599> that<00:00:21.689> previous<00:00:22.169> bar<00:00:22.409> and

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
that's the end of that previous bar and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.060 
that's the end of that previous bar and
that<00:00:24.359> half<00:00:24.659> step<00:00:24.960> Bend<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.409> F<00:00:25.589> up<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.829> f-sharp

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
that half step Bend on F up to f-sharp

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.589 
that half step Bend on F up to f-sharp
the<00:00:26.519> flat<00:00:26.789> three<00:00:27.089> to<00:00:27.749> the<00:00:27.779> major<00:00:28.079> third<00:00:29.599> hangs

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the flat three to the major third hangs

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.260 
the flat three to the major third hangs
over<00:00:31.050> into<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> beginning<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> bar<00:00:32.730> seven

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
over into the beginning of bar seven

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.590 
over into the beginning of bar seven
which<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.170> nice

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
which is nice

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.940 
which is nice
resolving<00:00:36.600> back<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> major<00:00:37.290> third<00:00:37.650> back

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
resolving back to the major third back

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
resolving back to the major third back
to<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.340> chord<00:00:38.610> that's<00:00:38.970> why<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.240> sounds

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
to the one chord that's why it sounds

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.220 
to the one chord that's why it sounds
good<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:41.060> then<00:00:44.210> there's<00:00:45.210> another<00:00:45.510> classic

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
good and then there's another classic

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.340 
good and then there's another classic
Albert<00:00:46.620> King<00:00:46.770> style<00:00:47.100> look<00:00:47.900> it's<00:00:48.900> sort<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Albert King style look it's sort of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
Albert King style look it's sort of

while<00:01:03.630> is<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.320> or<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.129> notes<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.550> make

reference<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.330> major<00:01:06.630> pentatonic<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
reference to major pentatonic this is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.600 
reference to major pentatonic this is
one<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.770> those<00:01:07.860> examples

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
one of those examples

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.649 
one of those examples
so<00:01:09.510> I'm<00:01:09.930> hammering<00:01:10.500> from<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.220> fifth<00:01:11.520> D<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.570> e

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.840 

but<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.260> back<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.620> minor<00:01:19.890> flat<00:01:20.790> three

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
but then right back to minor flat three

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.260 
but then right back to minor flat three
to<00:01:21.240> root

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.300 

said<00:01:25.270> seven<00:01:25.780> bar<00:01:25.990> eight<00:01:26.260> is<00:01:26.560> mostly<00:01:26.860> resting

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
said seven bar eight is mostly resting

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.230 
said seven bar eight is mostly resting
one<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:28.620> three<00:01:29.620> coming<00:01:29.980> on<00:01:30.160> beat<00:01:30.370> four<00:01:33.240> bar

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
one two three coming on beat four bar

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.340 
one two three coming on beat four bar
nine<00:01:34.540> on<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.380> five<00:01:35.740> chord<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.200> is

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
nine on the five chord so this is

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.810 
nine on the five chord so this is
interesting<00:01:41.560> because<00:01:41.860> we're<00:01:42.250> banning<00:01:42.460> up<00:01:42.700> to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
interesting because we're banning up to

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.109 
interesting because we're banning up to
the<00:01:42.910> root<00:01:43.090> note

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.120 

going<00:01:48.119> down<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.479> scale<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:49.110> using<00:01:49.770> two

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
going down the scale with using two

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.810 
going down the scale with using two
bends<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.890> said<00:01:56.130> before<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.700> know

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
bends and as I said before you know

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.420 
bends and as I said before you know
Albert<00:01:57.350> wouldn't<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.500> fur<00:01:58.710> edited<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.220> this

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
Albert wouldn't have fur edited in this

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.850 
Albert wouldn't have fur edited in this
way<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.390> we're<00:02:00.630> coming<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.590> do

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
way so we're coming up with a way to do

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.030 
way so we're coming up with a way to do
it<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> standard<00:02:02.520> tune<00:02:02.700> guitar<00:02:03.440> that<00:02:04.440> falls

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
it on a standard tune guitar that falls

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.160 
it on a standard tune guitar that falls
in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.850> most<00:02:06.119> logical<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.720> comfortable<00:02:07.110> way

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
in the most logical and comfortable way

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.260 
in the most logical and comfortable way
but<00:02:10.170> because<00:02:10.319> he<00:02:10.619> played<00:02:10.890> differently

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
but because he played differently

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.059 
but because he played differently
it<00:02:12.720> does<00:02:13.020> make<00:02:13.290> licks<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.770> were<00:02:15.739> easier<00:02:16.739> for

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
it does make licks that were easier for

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.040 
it does make licks that were easier for
him<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.580> way<00:02:17.760> because<00:02:18.120> they<00:02:18.300> fall<00:02:18.600> with<00:02:18.840> his

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
him in a way because they fall with his

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.229 
him in a way because they fall with his
strings<00:02:19.860> being<00:02:20.100> backwards<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.760> tuning<00:02:21.060> down

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
strings being backwards and tuning down

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.690 
strings being backwards and tuning down
and<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.110> know<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.950> was<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.100> logic<00:02:23.670> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and just you know there was a logic to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.990 
and just you know there was a logic to
it<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.930> playing<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.410> way<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.890> does<00:02:26.130> seem

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
it in playing that way it does seem

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.250 
it in playing that way it does seem
different<00:02:27.480> or<00:02:27.600> make<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.900> more<00:02:28.050> difficult

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
different or make it more difficult

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.330 
different or make it more difficult
trying<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.980> recreate<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.790> way<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:34.340> now

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
trying to recreate it this way I now

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:45.740 
trying to recreate it this way I now
right<00:02:35.610> here<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:37.800> bar<00:02:38.100> ten<00:02:44.269> so<00:02:45.269> this<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.600> an

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
right here in bar ten so this is an

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.250 
right here in bar ten so this is an
example<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.440> using<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.220> B<00:02:47.430> string<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.690> wind

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
example of using the B string to wind

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.220 
example of using the B string to wind
the<00:02:49.500> string<00:02:49.560> up<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.480> one<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.630> half<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.019> two

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the string up to one and a half and two

the string up to one and a half and two
whole<00:02:52.890> step<00:02:53.220> bends<00:02:53.790> because<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:54.720> too

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
whole step bends because it's too

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.410 
whole step bends because it's too
difficult<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.920> get<00:02:56.160> there<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.209> high<00:02:57.390> E

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
difficult to to get there on the high E

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.300 
difficult to to get there on the high E
string<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.989> could<00:02:58.140> try<00:02:58.320> using<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.709> very<00:02:59.010> light

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
string you could try using a very light

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.930 
string you could try using a very light
string<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.500> an<00:03:01.829> 11<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.519> it's<00:03:02.730> difficult

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
string this is an 11 so it's difficult

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.550 
string this is an 11 so it's difficult
to<00:03:03.299> do<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:05.780> he<00:03:06.780> used<00:03:06.959> lighter<00:03:07.260> strings

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
to do but and he used lighter strings

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.410 
to do but and he used lighter strings
and<00:03:07.890> even<00:03:08.850> then<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.299> had<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> nine<00:03:09.870> on<00:03:09.900> there

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
and even then if you had a nine on there

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.970 
and even then if you had a nine on there
banning<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.540> two<00:03:12.690> whole<00:03:12.930> steps<00:03:13.079> repeatedly

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
banning it two whole steps repeatedly

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.479 
banning it two whole steps repeatedly
you<00:03:14.640> run<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.970> risk<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.299> breaking<00:03:15.750> string<00:03:16.079> so

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
you run the risk of breaking string so

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.039 
you run the risk of breaking string so
you<00:03:17.489> know<00:03:17.790> all<00:03:18.030> night<00:03:18.329> long<00:03:18.540> which<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.930> not

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
you know all night long which is not

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.060 
you know all night long which is not
something<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.440> want<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.650> do<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:19.920> move

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
something you want to do if you move

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.009 
something you want to do if you move
over<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.519> B<00:03:20.670> string<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:21.359> can<00:03:21.540> handle<00:03:21.750> those

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
over to the B string it can handle those

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:31.590 
over to the B string it can handle those
bends<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.380> lot<00:03:22.560> better<00:03:22.829> so<00:03:23.400> again<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.510> got<00:03:24.660> one

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.120 

so<00:03:32.600> I'm<00:03:32.720> coming<00:03:33.140> in<00:03:33.320> on<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.590> upbeat<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.010> beat

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
so I'm coming in on the upbeat of beat

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.510 
so I'm coming in on the upbeat of beat
one<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:35.360> have<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.770> triplet<00:03:37.190> feel<00:03:37.340> we're

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
one you have a it's a triplet feel we're

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.770 
one you have a it's a triplet feel we're
in<00:03:37.550> twelve<00:03:37.880> eight<00:03:38.090> shows<00:03:38.360> three<00:03:38.600> eighth<00:03:38.750> notes

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
in twelve eight shows three eighth notes

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.900 
in twelve eight shows three eighth notes
for<00:03:39.260> each<00:03:39.380> beat<00:03:39.650> one<00:03:39.950> two<00:03:40.220> three<00:03:40.640> two<00:03:40.880> two

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
for each beat one two three two two

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:49.560 
for each beat one two three two two
three<00:03:41.210> so<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.750> got<00:03:41.960> one<00:03:42.440> two

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.320 

some<00:03:50.570> using<00:03:51.530> one<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.490> half<00:03:52.670> step<00:03:52.940> bends<00:03:53.180> or

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
some using one and a half step bends or

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.520 
some using one and a half step bends or
I<00:03:53.360> start<00:03:53.570> with<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.780> full<00:03:53.990> step<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.500> release

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
I start with a full step and release

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.450 
I start with a full step and release
followed<00:03:57.530> by<00:03:57.710> one<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.250> half<00:03:59.050> full<00:04:00.050> and<00:04:00.620> then

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
followed by one and a half full and then

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.950 
followed by one and a half full and then
two<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.620> there's<00:04:03.830> all<00:04:03.980> those<00:04:04.100> different

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
two so there's all those different

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.660 
two so there's all those different
amounts<00:04:05.960> of<00:04:06.020> bending<00:04:06.500> which<00:04:06.980> is<00:04:07.160> very<00:04:07.430> vocal

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
amounts of bending which is very vocal

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.920 
amounts of bending which is very vocal
like<00:04:13.030> ending<00:04:14.030> with<00:04:14.150> those<00:04:14.330> little<00:04:14.510> half<00:04:14.690> step

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
like ending with those little half step

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.670 
like ending with those little half step
Bend<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:18.830> is<00:04:18.980> nice<00:04:19.870> sliding<00:04:20.870> down<00:04:21.230> or

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
Bend and this is nice sliding down or

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.030 
Bend and this is nice sliding down or
the<00:04:21.830> minor<00:04:22.520> third<00:04:22.910> B<00:04:23.660> flat<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.530> half<00:04:24.680> flat<00:04:25.010> 7

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
the minor third B flat and a half flat 7

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.250 
the minor third B flat and a half flat 7
and<00:04:28.040> then<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:28.970> phrase<00:04:29.360> wraps<00:04:29.780> up<00:04:30.020> with<00:04:30.200> a

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
and then the phrase wraps up with a

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:39.899 
and then the phrase wraps up with a
classic<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:31.010> bird<00:04:31.250> style<00:04:31.910> wrap<00:04:32.330> up

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:45.990 

so<00:04:40.909> moving<00:04:41.360> back<00:04:41.509> down<00:04:41.539> a<00:04:41.719> third<00:04:41.989> position

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.610 

pull<00:04:47.000> off<00:04:47.180> from<00:04:47.480> 6:00<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.140> 3:00<00:04:48.170> on<00:04:48.530> the

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
pull off from 6:00 to 3:00 on the

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.720 
pull off from 6:00 to 3:00 on the
b-string<00:04:50.320> land<00:04:51.320> on<00:04:51.500> that<00:04:51.530> fifth<00:04:51.980> fret<00:04:52.220> see<00:04:52.520> and

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
b-string land on that fifth fret see and

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:03.400 
b-string land on that fifth fret see and
vibrato<00:04:52.880> it

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.790 

and<00:05:04.410> then<00:05:04.800> moving<00:05:05.069> up<00:05:05.340> here<00:05:06.350> using<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:07.470> flat

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
and then moving up here using that flat

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.409 
and then moving up here using that flat
five<00:05:08.069> to<00:05:08.400> five<00:05:08.610> we<00:05:08.940> do<00:05:09.210> flat<00:05:09.479> to<00:05:09.630> D<00:05:10.520> in<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:12.060> F<00:05:12.210> on

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
five to five we do flat to D in the F on

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.879 
five to five we do flat to D in the F on
top<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:12.870> I<00:05:12.930> have<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.080> double<00:05:13.470> step<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:13.830> I'm

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
top so I have a double step and I'm

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.100 
top so I have a double step and I'm
allowing<00:05:14.069> both<00:05:14.610> notes<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:15.180> rain

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
allowing both notes to rain

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.310 
allowing both notes to rain
together<00:05:18.100> while<00:05:18.730> I<00:05:18.760> vibrato<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.600> so<00:05:20.140> when<00:05:20.230> you

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
together while I vibrato it so when you

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.100 
together while I vibrato it so when you
put<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:20.620> whole<00:05:20.650> chorus<00:05:21.040> together<00:05:21.390> it's<00:05:22.390> got<00:05:23.080> a

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
put the whole chorus together it's got a

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.530 
put the whole chorus together it's got a
