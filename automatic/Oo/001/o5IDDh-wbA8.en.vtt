00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
probably would have been going faster

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.630 
probably would have been going faster
because<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:01.129> know<00:01:01.250> its<00:01:01.400> pretty<00:01:01.580> long

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640

welly but i did anyway I don't know what
speed<00:01:09.320> I<00:01:09.350> was<00:01:09.560> doing<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:09.920> probably<00:01:10.130> was

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
speed I was doing but I probably was

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.620 
speed I was doing but I probably was
doing<00:01:10.550> over<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.880> speed<00:01:11.119> limit<00:01:11.149> which<00:01:11.450> i<00:01:11.570> think

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
doing over the speed limit which i think

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.850 
doing over the speed limit which i think
is<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.680> 40<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.610> road<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:15.110> might<00:01:15.289> be<00:01:15.410> 30<00:01:15.649> i'm

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
is a 40 on that road it might be 30 i'm

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.080 
is a 40 on that road it might be 30 i'm
not<00:01:16.009> sure<00:01:16.190> whose<00:01:17.180> looks<00:01:17.479> at<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.660> speed<00:01:17.899> limit

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
not sure whose looks at a speed limit

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.590 
not sure whose looks at a speed limit
but<00:01:20.090> anyways<00:01:20.479> still

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.990 

it<00:01:26.470> doesn't<00:01:26.680> matter<00:01:26.799> what<00:01:26.890> speedos<00:01:27.340> do<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.729> the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
it doesn't matter what speedos do it the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.880 
it doesn't matter what speedos do it the
fact<00:01:28.270> is<00:01:28.479> that<00:01:28.509> he<00:01:29.729> pulls<00:01:30.729> out<00:01:31.060> without<00:01:31.390> even

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
fact is that he pulls out without even

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.710 
fact is that he pulls out without even
even<00:01:32.890> peer<00:01:33.220> in<00:01:33.430> like<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.759> know<00:01:33.790> if<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.630> was
