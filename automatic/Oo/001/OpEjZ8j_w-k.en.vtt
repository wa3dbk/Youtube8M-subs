we<00:00:10.419> were<00:00:10.570> working<00:00:10.839> on<00:00:11.019> our<00:00:11.110> Star<00:00:11.289> Wars<00:00:11.440> 12<00:00:11.650> inch

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:11.799 
we were working on our Star Wars 12 inch

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.470 
we were working on our Star Wars 12 inch
line<00:00:11.949> and<00:00:12.219> one<00:00:12.699> of<00:00:12.759> the<00:00:12.820> figures<00:00:12.969> we<00:00:13.240> had<00:00:13.359> been

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
line and one of the figures we had been

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.089 
line and one of the figures we had been
putting<00:00:13.690> off<00:00:13.750> for<00:00:13.959> a<00:00:14.019> while<00:00:14.199> because<00:00:14.529> he<00:00:14.889> was<00:00:15.070> a

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
putting off for a while because he was a

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.560 
putting off for a while because he was a
different<00:00:15.549> scale<00:00:15.730> or<00:00:16.000> size<00:00:16.209> than<00:00:16.419> everybody

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
different scale or size than everybody

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.019 
different scale or size than everybody
else<00:00:16.810> was<00:00:16.990> Yoda<00:00:17.199> and<00:00:17.470> we<00:00:18.160> decided<00:00:18.400> to<00:00:18.610> hit<00:00:18.759> Yoda

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
else was Yoda and we decided to hit Yoda

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.450 
else was Yoda and we decided to hit Yoda
and<00:00:19.300> hit<00:00:20.289> the<00:00:20.410> first<00:00:20.590> incarnation<00:00:20.919> of<00:00:21.220> Yoda

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
and hit the first incarnation of Yoda

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.859 
and hit the first incarnation of Yoda
you<00:00:21.610> see<00:00:21.789> which<00:00:21.939> is<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.180> Empire<00:00:22.449> Strikes<00:00:22.660> Back

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
you see which is the Empire Strikes Back

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.290 
you see which is the Empire Strikes Back
so<00:00:23.680> we<00:00:23.949> had<00:00:24.070> to<00:00:24.129> create<00:00:24.279> a<00:00:24.369> whole<00:00:24.610> new<00:00:24.640> body<00:00:25.029> for

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
so we had to create a whole new body for

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.819 
so we had to create a whole new body for
the<00:00:25.570> 12<00:00:25.750> inch<00:00:25.840> figure<00:00:26.140> obviously<00:00:26.529> because

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
the 12 inch figure obviously because

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.280 
the 12 inch figure obviously because
he's<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.009> short<00:00:27.369> little<00:00:27.520> 3-foot<00:00:27.939> guy<00:00:28.119> so<00:00:28.840> we

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
he's a short little 3-foot guy so we

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.929 
he's a short little 3-foot guy so we
created<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.710> brand-new<00:00:29.980> body<00:00:30.189> based<00:00:30.640> off<00:00:30.910> of

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
created a brand-new body based off of

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.970 
created a brand-new body based off of
our<00:00:31.270> other<00:00:31.660> 12<00:00:31.989> inch<00:00:32.110> body<00:00:32.320> so<00:00:32.619> we<00:00:32.710> gave<00:00:32.860> him<00:00:32.950> a

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
our other 12 inch body so we gave him a

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.319 
our other 12 inch body so we gave him a
lot<00:00:33.129> of<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.280> same<00:00:33.399> articulations<00:00:34.120> he's

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
lot of the same articulations he's

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.940 
lot of the same articulations he's
really<00:00:34.780> hyper<00:00:34.989> articulated<00:00:35.680> underneath

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
really hyper articulated underneath

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.889 
really hyper articulated underneath
those<00:00:36.100> robes<00:00:36.430> he<00:00:37.239> could<00:00:37.390> really<00:00:37.510> kick<00:00:37.690> some

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
those robes he could really kick some

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.779 
those robes he could really kick some
butt<00:00:38.110> even<00:00:38.410> though<00:00:38.559> he's<00:00:38.739> a<00:00:39.010> little<00:00:39.340> aged<00:00:39.550> at

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
butt even though he's a little aged at

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.250 
butt even though he's a little aged at
this<00:00:39.910> time<00:00:40.120> he's<00:00:40.360> not<00:00:40.420> doing<00:00:40.750> so<00:00:40.810> much<00:00:41.050> action

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
this time he's not doing so much action

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.050 
this time he's not doing so much action
he<00:00:41.590> could<00:00:41.800> technically<00:00:42.250> on<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:42.700> body<00:00:42.910> that

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
he could technically on that body that

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.550 
he could technically on that body that
we<00:00:43.300> gave<00:00:43.510> him<00:00:43.660> he<00:00:43.780> could<00:00:43.900> really<00:00:44.140> still<00:00:44.380> kick

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
we gave him he could really still kick

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.100 
we gave him he could really still kick
some<00:00:44.739> some<00:00:45.280> sif<00:00:45.489> but<00:00:45.730> so<00:00:46.450> while<00:00:46.930> we<00:00:47.050> were

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
some some sif but so while we were

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.380 
some some sif but so while we were
working<00:00:47.230> on<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.590> figure<00:00:48.210> we've<00:00:49.210> been

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
working on the figure we've been

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.150 
working on the figure we've been
inspired<00:00:49.750> lately<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.200> do<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.320> lot<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.560> the<00:00:50.829> 12

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
inspired lately to do a lot of the 12

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.760 
inspired lately to do a lot of the 12
inch<00:00:51.280> or<00:00:51.640> six<00:00:52.060> scale<00:00:52.239> environments<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:52.989> we

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
inch or six scale environments and we

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.380 
inch or six scale environments and we
just<00:00:53.980> thought<00:00:54.130> how<00:00:54.340> cool<00:00:54.579> would<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:54.820> be<00:00:54.880> to<00:00:55.180> do

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
just thought how cool would it be to do

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.510 
just thought how cool would it be to do
Yoda's<00:00:55.720> hunt<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.110> at<00:00:56.680> first<00:00:56.710> it<00:00:57.070> seemed<00:00:57.309> like

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
Yoda's hunt and at first it seemed like

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.920 
Yoda's hunt and at first it seemed like
it<00:00:57.670> was<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:57.820> bit<00:00:58.000> out<00:00:58.059> of<00:00:58.120> question<00:00:58.540> because<00:00:58.809> it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
it was a bit out of question because it

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.860 
it was a bit out of question because it
would<00:00:59.079> just<00:00:59.200> be<00:00:59.410> so<00:00:59.680> huge<00:01:00.040> in<00:01:00.340> sixth<00:01:00.760> scale<00:01:00.969> but

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
would just be so huge in sixth scale but

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.450 
would just be so huge in sixth scale but
we<00:01:02.230> figured<00:01:02.380> out<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.620> way<00:01:02.800> I<00:01:02.950> work<00:01:03.160> on<00:01:03.309> some

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
we figured out a way I work on some

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.799 
we figured out a way I work on some
designs<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:04.000> we<00:01:04.059> figured<00:01:04.299> out<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.420> way<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.629> kind

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
designs and we figured out a way to kind

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.260 
designs and we figured out a way to kind
of<00:01:04.960> shrink<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.290> down<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.799> still<00:01:06.549> let<00:01:06.759> it<00:01:06.880> be<00:01:07.030> in

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
of shrink it down and still let it be in

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.230 
of shrink it down and still let it be in
true<00:01:07.810> six<00:01:08.110> scale<00:01:08.560> yet<00:01:09.490> not<00:01:09.759> include<00:01:10.090> the

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
true six scale yet not include the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.940 
true six scale yet not include the
entire<00:01:10.329> hut<00:01:10.810> we've<00:01:11.140> kind<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.469> cut<00:01:11.649> off<00:01:11.770> the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
entire hut we've kind of cut off the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.739 
entire hut we've kind of cut off the
back<00:01:12.100> room<00:01:12.340> of<00:01:12.429> the<00:01:12.490> hut<00:01:12.729> if<00:01:12.909> you<00:01:13.329> look<00:01:13.509> at<00:01:13.719> it

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
back room of the hut if you look at it

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:15.690 
back room of the hut if you look at it
it<00:01:14.590> looks<00:01:14.649> like<00:01:14.859> it's<00:01:15.100> all<00:01:15.219> there<00:01:15.399> but<00:01:15.520> there's

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
it looks like it's all there but there's

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.099 
it looks like it's all there but there's
actually<00:01:15.789> a<00:01:15.999> whole<00:01:16.209> nother<00:01:16.359> room<00:01:16.630> that's

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
actually a whole nother room that's

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.989 
actually a whole nother room that's
missing<00:01:17.469> that<00:01:17.619> you<00:01:17.709> can<00:01:17.829> see<00:01:18.069> in<00:01:18.609> the<00:01:18.729> movie

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
missing that you can see in the movie

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:20.910 
missing that you can see in the movie
that<00:01:19.149> it's<00:01:19.270> there<00:01:19.539> so<00:01:20.200> what<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:20.499> did<00:01:20.649> was<00:01:20.709> we

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
that it's there so what we did was we

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.669 
that it's there so what we did was we
took<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.999> most<00:01:22.270> iconic<00:01:22.420> part<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.350> hut<00:01:23.529> and

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
took the most iconic part of the hut and

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.859 
took the most iconic part of the hut and
we<00:01:24.130> made<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.759> outside<00:01:25.270> feature<00:01:25.539> and

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
we made that the outside feature and

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.050 
we made that the outside feature and
then<00:01:26.350> we<00:01:26.499> cut<00:01:26.709> away<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.130> side<00:01:27.399> so<00:01:27.429> that<00:01:27.909> you

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
then we cut away this side so that you

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.039 
then we cut away this side so that you
can<00:01:28.179> go<00:01:28.299> ahead<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.659> can<00:01:28.689> take<00:01:28.929> your

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
can go ahead and you can take your

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.480 
can go ahead and you can take your
figures<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:29.649> you<00:01:29.709> can<00:01:29.829> place<00:01:30.039> them<00:01:30.189> in<00:01:30.310> there

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
figures and you can place them in there

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.129 
figures and you can place them in there
and<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.850> can<00:01:30.999> recreate<00:01:31.359> the<00:01:31.600> scenes<00:01:31.840> from
