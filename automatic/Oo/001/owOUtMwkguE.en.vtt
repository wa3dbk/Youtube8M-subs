00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi I'm can feel it is the video you are about to see hair result of 15 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.580
 years of research 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.390
 so my laser sailing colleagues developed the first helmet in the world 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.660
 against rotational shock reviews devaluation very important in the case 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.599
 of a brain injury because any amount the head causes 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.039
 its rotation and this causes irreversible damage to the blood vessels to the 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.710
 neurons in the brain 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.919
 so far no helmet has been designed to counteract the effects of force 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.499
 of twist but superski nose 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.699
 it is covered on the outside of the shell by a lubricating membrane 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.140
 helmet slips at the moment of impact when it reduces the rotation are made 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.550
 tests on helmets letting them fall from a few meters on a tilted anvil 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.150
 Oh God, the best way to simulate an impact on the head in an accident 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.220
 and the rotation that follows 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.630
 youtube video you will see the comparison between a conventional lazer helmet without 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.160
 membrane and the same lazer helmet with the superski membrane thanks to which the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.310
 greatly reduced rotation 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.350
 who is this image you see the base of the helmet that falls of Latin with one 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.100
 artificial head inside news 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.010
 then you think about it and on the place of the base of the helmet with the artificial head is going to 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.530
 be left on the ass in fact, the green cross on the base of the helmet and the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.760
 neck allows to clearly examine the rotation of the axes 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 it is with conventional helmet without adherent membrane when pouring pour 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.860
 useful links look at the rotation even after bouncing on the anvil allo 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.310
 the same way the head bounces after the impact against his 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.370
 no iveco now a superskin tube helmet look like rotation strongly 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.370
 reduced 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.550
 all the files even more noticeable difference when comparing helmets 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550
 blue next to each other 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.539
 must be even more obvious with lines on the image 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.769
 the effects on the brain are represented on these diagrams 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.029
 observe the homology and discomfort to the neurons struck on the left image 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.179
 phenomenon of me existed on the image on the right 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:38.769
 cnrs english professor at strasbourg university analyzed 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.369
 so text and certify the super skinny lazer helmets reduce the rotation of the 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:48.579
 60% cough also increases the protection your head of our brain of 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.769
 almost 70% respect the mention of the first shock helmet in the world 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.539
 rotational 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.539
 there is a reason for not another postponed 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.619
