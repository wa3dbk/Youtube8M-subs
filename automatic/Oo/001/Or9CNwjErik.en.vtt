 people here are the hearing aids we are going to 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.110
 take it out of its packaging 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.650

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.720

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.860
 characteristics of him 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:11.160
 and well as the cable had told them 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.730
 is 2 meters and less the tip is 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.270
 golden this makes the reception of 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.080

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.300
 it's like 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.920
 they are conditioned things very good in 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.920
 this part says this ere 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.490
 in this I really like the design of this 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.490
 part is like skin 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.400
 and you can 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.799
 adjust to the ear 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.069
 really to your heads better said 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:03.209
 it really is very good 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:07.980
 then this I'm going to try 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:12.239
 logically we went back I tried it and I 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.280
 it was excellent the audio people to islands 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:19.489
 with everything isolates all outside noise 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.980
 provides many genres of electronics 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.780
 this rock 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.819
 to 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:32.009
 of all genres the low ones 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:35.909
 sharp but the treble is excellent 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:40.550
 they know is a good hearing aid and its price 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:45.110
 it also cost 270 pesos 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.610
 really cheap as you see 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.610
 from cables 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.710
 all right 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.200
 for people who like to bring one 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:13.419
 some study or something like that can serve 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:17.770
 these trips as if it's a cable is 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:20.699
 clear and I like the thickness 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.699
 of its streets 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.370
 is very good 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.280

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.650
