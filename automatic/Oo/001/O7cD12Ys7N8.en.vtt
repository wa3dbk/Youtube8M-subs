00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.540 

you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.720> see<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.140> Z<00:01:04.440> is<00:01:04.680> pretty<00:01:05.100> quick<00:01:05.370> I

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
you can see the Z is pretty quick I

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.250 
you can see the Z is pretty quick I
could<00:01:05.700> probably<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.120> lot<00:01:06.390> quicker<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:07.050> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
could probably go a lot quicker on it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.120 
could probably go a lot quicker on it
but<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:09.060> more<00:01:09.270> than<00:01:09.630> adequate<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.800> here<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
but it's more than adequate and here is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.680 
but it's more than adequate and here is
that<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.850> z<00:01:12.210> axis<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> feed<00:01:13.170> mode<00:01:14.690> you're

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
that the z axis in the feed mode you're

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.020 
that the z axis in the feed mode you're
wondering<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.200> white<00:01:16.530> thing<00:01:16.800> is<00:01:17.070> on

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
wondering what that white thing is on

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
wondering what that white thing is on
the<00:01:18.330> quill<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.340> quill<00:01:20.340> light<00:01:21.619> through

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the quill that's of quill light through

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.280 
the quill that's of quill light through
the<00:01:22.830> x-axis<00:01:24.229> rapidly<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.440> 150<00:01:27.290> rapidly

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the x-axis rapidly now 150 rapidly

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.250 
the x-axis rapidly now 150 rapidly
Brewers<00:01:29.270> another<00:01:30.270> rung<00:01:30.950> 10<00:01:31.950> inches<00:01:33.260> down

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
Brewers another rung 10 inches down

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.219 
Brewers another rung 10 inches down
another<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> first

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
another of the first

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.289 
another of the first
and<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.469> will<00:01:37.680> see<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.729> feed<00:01:39.000> rate<00:01:39.270> mode

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
and I will see it in the feed rate mode

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.569 
and I will see it in the feed rate mode
those<00:01:42.299> motors<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> direct<00:01:43.439> drive

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
those motors in the direct drive

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.209 
those motors in the direct drive
configuration<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:45.060> awesome<00:01:46.219> that

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
configuration are really awesome that

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.510 
configuration are really awesome that
coupled<00:01:48.119> with<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.740> direct<00:01:49.740> drive<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.460> you

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
coupled with the direct drive and you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.539 
coupled with the direct drive and you
get<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> lot<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.030> power<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.869> -<00:01:52.469> there<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
get a lot of power and - there is the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.660 
get a lot of power and - there is the
y-axis<00:01:54.299> also<00:01:54.960> running<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.409> 150<00:01:56.189> inches<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
y-axis also running that 150 inches in

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:09.430 
y-axis also running that 150 inches in
it<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.799> in<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> feed<00:01:59.220> mode

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.200 

and<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:10.649> all<00:02:10.890> three<00:02:11.100> axis<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.790> moving

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
and now all three axis is moving

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.790 
and now all three axis is moving
simultaneously

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.240 

Mach<00:02:16.430> 3<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.880> set<00:02:17.210> up<00:02:17.330> for<00:02:17.620> 45,000<00:02:18.620> steps<00:02:18.950> per

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
Mach 3 is set up for 45,000 steps per

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.450 
Mach 3 is set up for 45,000 steps per
minute<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:22.120> think<00:02:23.120> it's<00:02:23.240> pretty<00:02:23.390> cool

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
minute and I think it's pretty cool

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.150 
minute and I think it's pretty cool
thank<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:25.520> for<00:02:25.760> watching
