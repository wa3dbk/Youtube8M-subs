00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
got four inches here now when he gets up

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.399 
got four inches here now when he gets up
the<00:01:08.210> belly<00:01:08.390> eight<00:01:08.570> inches<00:01:08.870> over<00:01:09.110> start

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
the belly eight inches over start

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.069 
the belly eight inches over start
grazing<00:01:09.650> it<00:01:11.200> if<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.350> weather<00:01:12.560> gets<00:01:13.780> is<00:01:14.780> bad

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
grazing it if the weather gets is bad

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.840 
grazing it if the weather gets is bad
well<00:01:15.500> I'll<00:01:15.680> slow<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:15.950> down<00:01:16.159> a<00:01:16.250> little<00:01:16.340> bit<00:01:16.670> but

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
well I'll slow it down a little bit but

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.819 
well I'll slow it down a little bit but
I'm<00:01:17.030> thinking<00:01:17.509> first<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.380> May<00:01:18.500> that's

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
I'm thinking first of May that's

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.510 
I'm thinking first of May that's
definitely<00:01:19.280> gonna<00:01:19.430> be<00:01:19.610> ready<00:01:20.590> if<00:01:21.590> not<00:01:21.890> before

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.590 

and<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:25.640> see<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.939> difference<00:01:26.270> between<00:01:26.390> this

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
and you see the difference between this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.480 
and you see the difference between this
field<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:28.250> any<00:01:28.850> other<00:01:29.060> pasture<00:01:29.390> field<00:01:30.490> it's

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
field in any other pasture field it's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:02:45.390 
field in any other pasture field it's
very<00:01:31.549> early

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.309 

we<00:02:46.400> played<00:02:46.640> this<00:02:46.819> field<00:02:47.120> last<00:02:47.390> fall<00:02:47.780> with<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
we played this field last fall with the

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.320 
we played this field last fall with the
intention<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:48.950> greasing<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.880> spring<00:02:50.150> we

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
intention of greasing it to spring we

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.150 
intention of greasing it to spring we
planted<00:02:50.720> triticale<00:02:51.230> because<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.799> wanted<00:02:52.069> to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
planted triticale because I wanted to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.870 
planted triticale because I wanted to
reseed<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:54.200> it's<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.830> sod<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.430> difficult

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
reseed it and it's in sod it's difficult

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.059 
reseed it and it's in sod it's difficult
to<00:02:56.090> reseed<00:02:56.630> without<00:02:56.959> at<00:02:57.560> least<00:02:57.620> having<00:02:57.830> a

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
to reseed without at least having a

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.300 
to reseed without at least having a
couple<00:02:58.370> crops<00:02:58.670> on<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.350> so<00:03:00.350> we<00:03:00.620> did<00:03:00.860> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
couple crops on it so we did the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.589 
couple crops on it so we did the
triticale<00:03:02.299> last<00:03:02.599> fall<00:03:03.970> raised<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.269> spring

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
triticale last fall raised this spring

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.270 
triticale last fall raised this spring
we<00:03:05.959> ran<00:03:06.170> into<00:03:06.349> a<00:03:06.470> few<00:03:06.530> problems<00:03:06.709> with<00:03:07.099> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
we ran into a few problems with the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.530 
we ran into a few problems with the
weather<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:07.760> we're<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> little<00:03:08.030> later<00:03:08.330> than

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
weather so we're a little later than

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.259 
weather so we're a little later than
what<00:03:08.660> we<00:03:08.780> wanted<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.260> be<00:03:09.880> but<00:03:10.880> we<00:03:10.970> did<00:03:11.120> have<00:03:11.209> a

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
what we wanted to be but we did have a

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.229 
what we wanted to be but we did have a
very<00:03:11.480> good<00:03:11.630> crop<00:03:12.250> after<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.640> kale<00:03:13.819> finished

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
very good crop after the kale finished

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.320 
very good crop after the kale finished
raising<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.750> we<00:03:15.530> seeded<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.400> back<00:03:16.580> down

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
raising it we seeded it back down

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.490 
raising it we seeded it back down
use<00:03:17.690> an<00:03:17.840> earth<00:03:17.989> crop<00:03:18.319> of<00:03:18.590> oats<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:18.950> peas<00:03:19.220> and

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
use an earth crop of oats and peas and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.729 
use an earth crop of oats and peas and
alfalfa<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.010> red<00:03:22.190> clover<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:23.650> Ladino<00:03:24.650> clover

alfalfa and red clover and Ladino clover

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.430 
alfalfa and red clover and Ladino clover
and<00:03:25.400> three<00:03:26.299> different<00:03:26.480> varieties<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:27.109> rye

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
and three different varieties of rye

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.190 
and three different varieties of rye
grass<00:03:28.120> because<00:03:29.120> we<00:03:29.239> do<00:03:29.359> plan<00:03:29.570> on<00:03:29.630> graze<00:03:30.019> in

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
grass because we do plan on graze in

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.150 
grass because we do plan on graze in
this<00:03:30.320> field<00:03:30.590> probably<00:03:31.549> later<00:03:31.880> this<00:03:32.120> summer

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
this field probably later this summer

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.830 
this field probably later this summer
this<00:03:34.160> fall<00:03:34.400> for<00:03:34.670> sure<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.390> then<00:03:35.600> in<00:03:35.720> the

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
this fall for sure and then in the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.410 
this fall for sure and then in the
following<00:03:36.260> years<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:37.700> that's<00:03:37.940> why<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.120> wanted

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
following years and that's why I wanted

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.360 
following years and that's why I wanted
to<00:03:38.480> get<00:03:38.569> more<00:03:38.900> clover<00:03:39.140> more<00:03:39.560> rye<00:03:39.739> grass<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.250> it

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
to get more clover more rye grass in it

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.099 
to get more clover more rye grass in it
because<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.850> was<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:40.970> stand<00:03:41.329> that<00:03:41.450> was<00:03:41.720> fairly

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
because it was a stand that was fairly

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.580
