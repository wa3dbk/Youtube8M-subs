00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:07.250
 on twitter they are telling us that in 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.440
 curicó falls the sky that is a deluge 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.200
 they say and therefore they ask what is going to 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.030
 happen in the coming days 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.789
 but how is predicted 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.250
 frontal system as we can see here 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.619
 today in the morning and part of the afternoon 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.800
 kept with presentations exactly 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.559
 from chillán to the south and in the sector of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.149
 Here we see the frontal system arriving 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:33.300
 in its weakest part a of santiago and 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.699
 generating rainfall from curicó 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.399
 to the south now well rainfall 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.790
 we are waiting are they kind of squall what 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.519
 which means that it has a marked 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.890
 variability is easy is because of something of such 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.430
 way that the showers are going to be more 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.050
 intense in the southern limit of the seventh 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.410
 region and eighth region 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.670
 and there sorry for santiago then it 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.350
 advertise 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.640
 of what characteristics was strong in 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.000
 some time they go until reaching 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 feel 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.470
 very well now I plan it from 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.540
 this midnight should begin the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.490
 squalls and graphic legio understood 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.300
 from this midnight onwards 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.420
 and until the last hour of the morning the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.090
 judge will be between the fifth and the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.550
 the bio region with presentations of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.140
 intensity variety in one word let's 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.960
 to have a couple of days of rain in the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.210
 exactly the center-south 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.820
 presentations are going to stay up 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.430
 Thursday morning from the region of 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.340
 maule to the south and here in the regions 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.920
 fifth metropolitan and sixth durán until 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.990
 the morning until sorry all day 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.759
 Wednesday only now when 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.530
 we talk about squalls does not associate that is 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.720
 little water but I understand that it is rather 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.399
 a way to precipitate the water not 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.750
 necessarily have to with quantity 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.160
 we are talking in any case about 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.320
 significant amounts in the area 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.890
 central or will it be like this deluge of 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.060
 that tell us by curicó 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.990
 in the central area we expect quantity of 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.509
 accumulated between 15 to 20 millimeters and such 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.450
 as I said the most intense is going to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.420
 experiment in the sectors of the upl and 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.340
 mountain range of the seventh and 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.950
 eighth now this comes with 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.660
 also louis from a cold situation 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.430
 because of course that nuclear would be 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.290
 less this experience of santiago but 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.440
 it was not cold you could tell we were in 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.450
 another station 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.390
 Of course what happened that we had been 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.410
 accustomed these last three years 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.930
 we were under the rule of the phenomenon 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.260
 of the girl who produces cold winter and 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.320
 dry and one step without transition to a 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.360
 hot summer instead this year is 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.690
 different because we have a spring 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.970
 variable and wet and with events of 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.980
 true precipitation that they could even 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.980
 be present in the summer
