00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.479 
with dot BMP files so what you gonna do
this<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.610> here's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.210> bump<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.230> bitmap<00:00:43.739> image

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
this so here's a bump or a bitmap image

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
this so here's a bump or a bitmap image
here<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:45.059> go<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> image<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> top<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
here we go to image at the top in a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.810 
here we go to image at the top in a
toolbar<00:00:47.690> attributes<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.920> normal<00:00:50.340> icon

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
toolbar attributes now the normal icon

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.560 
toolbar attributes now the normal icon
size<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.360> 32<00:00:51.719> pixels<00:00:52.079> by<00:00:52.469> 32<00:00:53.100> pixels<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.300> let's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
size is 32 pixels by 32 pixels so let's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.479 
size is 32 pixels by 32 pixels so let's
go<00:00:54.660> ahead<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.899> fill<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.289> information

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
go ahead and fill in that information

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.010 
go ahead and fill in that information
and<00:00:56.489> then<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.670> argue<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> information<00:00:57.899> we

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and then I argue with the information we

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.869 
and then I argue with the information we
want<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> width<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.010> height<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.460> 32

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
want the width and the height to be 32

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.529 
want the width and the height to be 32
pixels<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> make<00:01:01.109> sure<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.620> got<00:01:02.300> pixels<00:01:03.300> here

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
pixels and make sure you got pixels here

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.939 
pixels and make sure you got pixels here
because<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.019> interested<00:01:04.470> me<00:01:04.589> too<00:01:04.739> long
