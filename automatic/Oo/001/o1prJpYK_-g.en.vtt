where<00:05:38.460> I<00:05:38.490> can<00:05:38.669> spin<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.270> move<00:05:39.659> at<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:39.870> same

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
where I can spin and move at the same

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.019 
where I can spin and move at the same
time<00:05:40.259> but<00:05:40.529> he's<00:05:40.620> pretty<00:05:40.770> slow<00:05:41.069> so<00:05:41.789> it's<00:05:42.000> not

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.029 
time but he's pretty slow so it's not

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:43.339 
time but he's pretty slow so it's not
really<00:05:42.150> very<00:05:42.389> aggressive<00:05:42.840> I<00:05:42.900> just<00:05:43.050> wait<00:05:43.229> it

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
really very aggressive I just wait it

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.510 
really very aggressive I just wait it
out<00:05:43.440> for<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.770> chance<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.069> get<00:05:44.190> in<00:05:44.310> and<00:05:44.400> push

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
out for the chance to get in and push

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.219 
out for the chance to get in and push
him<00:05:44.580> around<00:05:44.699> I'll<00:05:45.419> see<00:05:45.569> you<00:05:45.599> the<00:05:45.719> semi-finals
