00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
it's just so frustrating and a nice

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
think that's really bothering me in

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
think that's really bothering me in
modern<00:01:27.360> warfare<00:01:27.540> 2<00:01:27.720> which<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.740> oh<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> guess<00:01:29.520> it's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
modern warfare 2 which I oh I guess it's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.999 
modern warfare 2 which I oh I guess it's
also<00:01:29.820> good<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.630> also<00:01:30.780> bothers<00:01:31.229> me<00:01:31.409> it's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
also good if but it also bothers me it's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.960 
also good if but it also bothers me it's
that<00:01:32.280> when<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.640> are<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.540> injured<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.259> hurt

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
that when you are like injured or hurt

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
that when you are like injured or hurt
you<00:01:35.970> can't<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.390> hear<00:01:36.659> anything<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.439> it's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
you can't really hear anything and it's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.270 
you can't really hear anything and it's
like<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> gets<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:39.350> like<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.680> can't<00:01:40.950> hear

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
like it gets really like you can't hear

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.069 
like it gets really like you can't hear
the<00:01:41.460> enemy<00:01:41.850> or<00:01:41.939> anything<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.630> that's<00:01:42.869> really

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
the enemy or anything and that's really

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.499 
the enemy or anything and that's really
frustrating<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.340> want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.820> hang

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
frustrating if you want to like hang

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.960 
frustrating if you want to like hang
back<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:45.990> regen<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.460> can't<00:01:47.700> hear<00:01:47.939> what

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
back your regen and you can't hear what

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.020 
back your regen and you can't hear what
the<00:01:48.240> enemies<00:01:48.750> start<00:01:48.899> coming<00:01:49.409> from<00:01:49.970> but<00:01:50.970> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the enemies start coming from but I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300 
the enemies start coming from but I
guess<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:53.189> bit

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
guess that that is like a little bit

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.709 
guess that that is like a little bit
more<00:01:53.490> realistic<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:56.240> yeah<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> got<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> lot<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
more realistic and yeah I got a lot of

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.240 
more realistic and yeah I got a lot of
talk<00:01:57.869> about<00:01:57.990> Tommy's<00:01:58.380> gonna<00:01:58.560> ramble<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.979> here

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
talk about Tommy's gonna ramble on here

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.670

and<00:01:59.750> besides<00:02:00.750> stopping<00:02:01.020> power<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.619> will

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and besides stopping power I will

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.789 
and besides stopping power I will
definitely<00:02:02.520> recommend<00:02:02.759> steady<00:02:03.509> aim<00:02:03.689> pro<00:02:04.020> or

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
definitely recommend steady aim pro or

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.920 
definitely recommend steady aim pro or
steady<00:02:05.159> aim<00:02:05.340> basically<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.060> look<00:02:06.719> at<00:02:06.840> those

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
steady aim basically just look at those

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.529 
steady aim basically just look at those
noscope<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.770> pretty<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.250> sweet

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
noscope so it's pretty pretty sweet

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.890 
noscope so it's pretty pretty sweet
steady<00:02:09.539> aim<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:11.030> no<00:02:12.030> scoping<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.690> this

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
steady aim because no scoping in this

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.760 
steady aim because no scoping in this

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
rifles in this game it's a little bit

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.600 
rifles in this game it's a little bit
sad<00:05:09.240> that<00:05:09.420> they'd<00:05:09.600> only<00:05:09.780> have<00:05:09.990> one<00:05:10.610> vault

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610

rifle<00:05:12.120> a<00:05:12.150> sniper<00:05:13.020> but<00:05:13.730> it's<00:05:14.730> okay<00:05:15.090> basically

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
rifle a sniper but it's okay basically

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.110 
rifle a sniper but it's okay basically
because<00:05:15.900> in<00:05:16.170> Call<00:05:16.500> of<00:05:16.530> Duty<00:05:16.770> 4<00:05:17.010> you<00:05:17.370> only<00:05:17.640> use

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
because in Call of Duty 4 you only use

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.650 
because in Call of Duty 4 you only use
the<00:05:18.420> m40a3<00:05:19.640> so<00:05:20.640> I<00:05:20.670> don't<00:05:21.060> think<00:05:21.210> anybody's

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
the m40a3 so I don't think anybody's

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.380 
the m40a3 so I don't think anybody's
really<00:05:21.690> missing<00:05:22.590> like<00:05:23.220> two<00:05:23.580> bolt-action

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
really missing like two bolt-action

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.070 
really missing like two bolt-action
rifles<00:05:25.430> so<00:05:26.430> nobody<00:05:27.120> needs<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.450> be<00:05:27.630> complaining

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
rifles so nobody needs to be complaining

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.630 
rifles so nobody needs to be complaining
y'all<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.930> tried<00:05:31.290> using<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:32.070> thermal

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
y'all and I tried using the thermal

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.610 
y'all and I tried using the thermal
scope<00:05:32.760> but<00:05:33.150> I'm<00:05:33.300> not<00:05:33.480> exactly<00:05:33.870> a<00:05:34.080> big<00:05:34.320> fan<00:05:34.590> of

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
scope but I'm not exactly a big fan of

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.760 
scope but I'm not exactly a big fan of
that<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:35.670> don't<00:05:36.450> know<00:05:36.750> why<00:05:36.960> really<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:37.410> guess

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
that I don't know why really I guess

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.260 
that I don't know why really I guess
it's<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:38.070> good<00:05:38.280> idea

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
it's a good idea

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.480 
it's a good idea
the<00:05:39.720> this<00:05:40.200> thermal<00:05:40.680> scope<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.070> everything

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
the this thermal scope and everything

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.660 
the this thermal scope and everything
but<00:05:42.480> I<00:05:42.540> never<00:05:42.840> really<00:05:43.230> get<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:43.890> same<00:05:44.130> feeling

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
but I never really get the same feeling

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.740 
but I never really get the same feeling
as<00:05:44.820> with<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.120> regular<00:05:45.540> scope<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:47.580> here<00:05:48.570> I'm<00:05:48.630> is
