okay<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.530> the<00:00:07.730> this<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.910> standard

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
okay this is the this is the standard

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.629 
okay this is the this is the standard
the<00:00:10.170> short<00:00:10.440> wing<00:00:10.620> configuration<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:13.639> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the short wing configuration and the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.000 
the short wing configuration and the
this<00:00:15.270> is<00:00:15.420> actually<00:00:15.840> a<00:00:15.870> pre<00:00:16.110> serious<00:00:16.500> prototype

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
this is actually a pre serious prototype

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.120 
this is actually a pre serious prototype
but<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.460> doesn't<00:00:17.820> really<00:00:18.000> differ<00:00:18.300> anything

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
but it doesn't really differ anything

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.730 
but it doesn't really differ anything
the<00:00:20.130> prototype<00:00:20.369> series<00:00:21.120> are<00:00:21.810> possible<00:00:22.440> to<00:00:22.590> buy

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the prototype series are possible to buy

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.640 
the prototype series are possible to buy
they<00:00:23.040> have<00:00:23.190> a<00:00:23.220> loophole<00:00:23.730> before<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.410> that's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
they have a loophole before so that's

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.930 
they have a loophole before so that's
that's<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.970> difference<00:00:27.210> they're<00:00:27.600> also<00:00:27.780> tiny

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
that's the difference they're also tiny

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.240 
that's the difference they're also tiny
improvements<00:00:29.940> made<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> production<00:00:31.250> but

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
improvements made in the production but

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.520 
improvements made in the production but
yes<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.149> wonder<00:00:33.629> why<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.200> not

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
yes so if you wonder why is that not

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:48.770 
yes so if you wonder why is that not
there<00:00:34.770> or<00:00:34.980> something<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:47.089> yes<00:00:48.089> this<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.749> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
there or something it's yes this is the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.880 
there or something it's yes this is the
short<00:00:49.079> wing<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.870> wing<00:00:51.870> mouths<00:00:52.199> that's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> big

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
short wing and wing mouths that's a big

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.669 
short wing and wing mouths that's a big
question<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.760> doesn't<00:00:54.089> include<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.449> wing<00:00:54.629> box

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679

yeah you're free to choose some view

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.569 
yeah you're free to choose some view
their<00:01:00.539> wings<00:01:00.749> together<00:01:01.309> everything<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.429> make

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
their wings together everything to make

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.200 
their wings together everything to make
it<00:01:02.609> rigid<00:01:02.819> wing<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.809> starting<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.820> this

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it rigid wing and starting this is this

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
channels for with CF tube so he has

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.080 
channels for with CF tube so he has
pushed<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.519> wings<00:02:46.000> together<00:02:46.209> using<00:02:46.950> friction

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
pushed the wings together using friction

pushed the wings together using friction
nothing<00:02:49.090> else<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.540> worked<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:50.230> could

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
nothing else and it worked that could

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.009 
nothing else and it worked that could
probably<00:02:50.650> be<00:02:50.940> made<00:02:51.940> work<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.390> way<00:02:52.630> off<00:02:52.780> if

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
probably be made work this way off if

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.420 
probably be made work this way off if
you<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.230> strong<00:02:53.380> enough<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.680> magnets<00:02:54.220> it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
you have strong enough that magnets it

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.240 
you have strong enough that magnets it
would<00:02:54.670> work<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.690> way<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.260> reason<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.799> like<00:02:57.010> oh

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
would work the way the reason I like oh

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.090 
would work the way the reason I like oh
rings<00:02:57.549> is<00:02:57.790> because<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:59.590> has<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.799> physical

don't use the stock location for the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
location for GPS which is here because I

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.730 
location for GPS which is here because I
thought<00:04:54.950> this<00:04:55.280> wasn't<00:04:55.550> look<00:04:55.790> better<00:04:56.060> so<00:04:56.740> we

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
thought this wasn't look better so we

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.770 
thought this wasn't look better so we
have<00:04:57.890> used<00:04:58.130> lab<00:04:58.630> successfully<00:04:59.630> in<00:04:59.720> the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
have used lab successfully in the

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.490 
have used lab successfully in the
prototype<00:04:59.990> but<00:05:00.590> I<00:05:00.620> thought<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:02.300> also<00:05:03.290> have<00:05:03.470> to

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
prototype but I thought I also have to

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.810 
prototype but I thought I also have to
make<00:05:03.800> any<00:05:04.040> move<00:05:04.220> cut<00:05:04.880> out<00:05:05.030> in<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.450> match<00:05:06.820> the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
make any move cut out in the match the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.580 
make any move cut out in the match the
hatch<00:05:09.220> it's<00:05:11.740> it's<00:05:12.740> held<00:05:13.340> by<00:05:13.550> magnets<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:15.440> can

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
hatch it's it's held by magnets you can

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.960 
hatch it's it's held by magnets you can
mount<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.890> magnets<00:05:16.250> in<00:05:16.370> two<00:05:16.490> ways<00:05:16.700> either

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
mount the magnets in two ways either

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.350 
mount the magnets in two ways either
vertical<00:05:17.630> or<00:05:18.040> horizontal<00:05:19.040> like<00:05:19.730> I<00:05:19.850> have<00:05:20.060> of

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
vertical or horizontal like I have of

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.000 
vertical or horizontal like I have of
course<00:05:20.630> if<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:20.900> Mountain<00:05:21.260> vertical<00:05:21.680> it<00:05:21.830> will

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
course if you Mountain vertical it will

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.240 
course if you Mountain vertical it will
be<00:05:22.280> much<00:05:22.640> less<00:05:22.960> force<00:05:25.210> when<00:05:26.210> we<00:05:26.480> designed<00:05:26.900> this

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
be much less force when we designed this

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.220 
be much less force when we designed this
first<00:05:28.250> I<00:05:28.490> didn't<00:05:28.850> know<00:05:28.880> how<00:05:29.120> strong<00:05:29.720> magnets

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
first I didn't know how strong magnets

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.090 
first I didn't know how strong magnets
will<00:05:30.410> begin<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.919> production<00:05:31.220> so<00:05:31.580> we<00:05:32.830> made<00:05:33.830> two

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
will begin to production so we made two

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.290 
will begin to production so we made two
versions<00:05:34.520> this<00:05:35.480> mount<00:05:35.780> versions<00:05:36.350> possible

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
in the production there's two tabs on

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.620 
in the production there's two tabs on
the<00:05:54.410> side<00:05:54.590> here<00:05:54.620> that<00:05:55.900> makes<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.350> hat

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
settling better I made a prototype we

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.520 
settling better I made a prototype we
noticed<00:06:02.460> after<00:06:02.580> the<00:06:02.970> hatch<00:06:03.200> pulling<00:06:04.200> down<00:06:04.350> in

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530
