00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.430
 pets 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.950
 today we arrived at the nursery 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.640
 Central Asian Shepherd to talk 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.490
 about this interesting breed 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.050
 the dog is strong independent of them 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.540
 should have been 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.050
 to survive in the wild in general they 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.040
 and compare hatch for guarding sheep 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.010
 to guard the home but mostly now 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.320
 i use to guard the house me too 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.930
 I heard that Central Asian 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.880
 shepherd dogs are uniquely intelligent but sometimes you know 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.160
 so dignified he doesn't even know what 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.840
 do them but because they are not always 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.170
 obey the master consider some 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.210
 teams are not the most important necessarily 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.080
 must be in contact between the dog and 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.490
 the owner and the owner must show that 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.550
 he is the boss here 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.190
 And the dog him groups but not give 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.590
 command the dog and say they are from 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.440
 its very big mind 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.100
 clearly capture the emotions of their master to 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.619
 the truth is yes and when they see that they 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.930
 pleased the owner they themselves are very happy and 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.899
 try to make more pleasant 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.390
 the owner won another race and the rest is right 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.880
 from our dogs already fewer natives and 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.600
 more domesticated dogs but there 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.819
 bathory 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.860
 but nobody trains them and therefore 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.750
 before you execute the host command 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.789
 they will think whether it is necessary dogs 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.009
 Central Asian Shepherd Practically 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.899
 never are sofas dogs this 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.910
 curve what's best they themselves 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.429
 feel outdoors 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.520
 and if all the same people want to start them 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.310
 flat how are they big and strong 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.780
 they need a place territory and how can 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.229
 more time to move 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.230
 principle in the apartment asians also take 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.569
 because they have 6 not so long not 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.280
 so troublesome just motive 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.530
 the mode then you need to just more 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.170
 walking is important in general where you take 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.540

 big powerful plus 7 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.810
 so and for guarding the evil ones too 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.000
 genetics and if you buy a dog 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.469
 from under the fight champion naturally you 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.560
 will have problems 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:41.049
 sometime if you take a show dog they already 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.389
