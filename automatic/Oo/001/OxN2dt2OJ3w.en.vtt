third-person shooting action which was
pretty<00:06:20.370> good<00:06:20.610> back<00:06:21.000> in<00:06:21.030> its<00:06:21.330> day<00:06:21.569> it<00:06:21.810> does<00:06:22.710> have

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
pretty good back in its day it does have

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.770 
pretty good back in its day it does have
some<00:06:23.039> extremely<00:06:23.759> annoying<00:06:24.000> parts<00:06:24.389> later<00:06:24.539> on

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
some extremely annoying parts later on

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:33.969 
some extremely annoying parts later on
but<00:06:25.020> for<00:06:25.650> the<00:06:25.740> most<00:06:25.889> part<00:06:26.039> it's<00:06:26.460> pretty<00:06:27.060> good

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.600 

sucks<00:06:34.550> for<00:06:34.639> that<00:06:34.849> guy<00:06:36.189> betrayed<00:06:37.189> lit<00:06:37.460> up<00:06:37.580> like

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
sucks for that guy betrayed lit up like

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.779 
sucks for that guy betrayed lit up like
a<00:06:37.909> Christmas<00:06:38.360> tree

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
a Christmas tree

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.179 
a Christmas tree
alright<00:06:41.379> now<00:06:42.379> what<00:06:42.499> I<00:06:42.560> was<00:06:42.680> saying<00:06:42.830> about<00:06:42.889> like

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 
alright now what I was saying about like

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:45.100 
alright now what I was saying about like
abusing<00:06:43.699> quick<00:06:44.090> saves<00:06:44.389> all<00:06:44.689> you<00:06:44.779> do<00:06:44.870> is<00:06:44.990> hit

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
abusing quick saves all you do is hit

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.290 
abusing quick saves all you do is hit
starts<00:06:45.560> and<00:06:45.740> then<00:06:45.830> you<00:06:45.860> basically<00:06:46.580> quote<00:06:47.060> save

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
starts and then you basically quote save

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.300 
starts and then you basically quote save
and<00:06:47.539> it<00:06:47.629> acts<00:06:47.810> as<00:06:48.020> a<00:06:48.050> safe<00:06:48.650> space<00:06:48.949> so<00:06:49.159> if<00:06:49.219> you

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
and it acts as a safe space so if you

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.179 
and it acts as a safe space so if you
die<00:06:49.460> real<00:06:49.789> O's<00:06:49.939> from<00:06:50.150> there<00:06:50.330> I<00:06:50.680> will<00:06:51.680> be<00:06:51.860> kind

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:52.189 
die real O's from there I will be kind

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:54.189 
die real O's from there I will be kind
of<00:06:52.370> abusing<00:06:52.819> that<00:06:52.939> later<00:06:53.150> on<00:06:53.240> but<00:06:53.629> hopefully

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
of abusing that later on but hopefully

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.899 
of abusing that later on but hopefully
that's<00:06:54.409> the<00:06:54.469> only<00:06:54.889> place<00:06:55.069> I<00:06:55.189> really<00:06:55.219> have<00:06:55.669> to

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:55.909 
that's the only place I really have to

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.629 
that's the only place I really have to
and<00:06:56.779> it's<00:06:56.960> a<00:06:57.050> really<00:06:57.439> crappy<00:06:58.159> part<00:06:58.490> of<00:06:58.550> the

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
and it's a really crappy part of the

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:00.700 
and it's a really crappy part of the
game<00:06:58.789> like<00:06:59.150> it's<00:06:59.360> probably<00:07:00.199> the<00:07:00.259> worst<00:07:00.409> part

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
game like it's probably the worst part

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.140 
game like it's probably the worst part
of<00:07:00.740> the<00:07:00.830> game<00:07:00.860> that<00:07:01.219> I'm<00:07:01.310> had<00:07:01.460> to<00:07:01.580> use<00:07:01.729> it<00:07:01.879> on<00:07:01.999> I

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
of the game that I'm had to use it on I

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.999 
of the game that I'm had to use it on I
think<00:07:02.240> it<00:07:02.479> happens<00:07:02.749> twice<00:07:05.469> but<00:07:06.469> yeah<00:07:06.800> I<00:07:06.830> threw

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:07.009 
think it happens twice but yeah I threw

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.100 
think it happens twice but yeah I threw
my<00:07:07.159> last<00:07:07.400> the<00:07:08.000> first<00:07:08.180> time<00:07:08.449> I<00:07:08.479> tried<00:07:08.779> to<00:07:08.810> record

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
my last the first time I tried to record

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.140 
my last the first time I tried to record
this<00:07:09.199> I<00:07:09.409> kept<00:07:09.590> you<00:07:10.009> know<00:07:10.099> using<00:07:10.430> the<00:07:10.639> COI<00:07:10.819> saves

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
this I kept you know using the COI saves

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.610 
this I kept you know using the COI saves
because<00:07:11.360> I<00:07:11.569> would<00:07:11.689> always<00:07:11.719> die<00:07:12.110> because<00:07:12.349> I<00:07:12.500> was

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
because I would always die because I was

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.080 
because I would always die because I was
playing<00:07:12.800> on<00:07:12.889> a<00:07:12.919> harder<00:07:13.219> difficulty<00:07:16.090> but

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090 
playing on a harder difficulty but

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.499 
playing on a harder difficulty but
hopefully<00:07:17.919> not<00:07:18.919> this<00:07:19.129> time<00:07:19.430> I<00:07:19.669> need<00:07:19.879> to<00:07:20.150> drop

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:20.509 
hopefully not this time I need to drop

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:35.720 
hopefully not this time I need to drop
that<00:07:20.750> habit

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:35.730 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.470 

so<00:07:36.420> much<00:07:36.660> for<00:07:36.870> being<00:07:37.020> subtle
