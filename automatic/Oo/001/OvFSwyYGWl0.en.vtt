00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.600
 tests out of ascari today on the track 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.680
 the boom m3 from the 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.680
 Rundstrecken-Challenge NÃ¼rburgring 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.279
 Even if it's not that anymore 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.390
 youngest model it's half mad 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.840
 balances engine forward 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.420
 differential drive behind the power 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.010
 the car eerily balances nearly 50 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.050
 50 weight distribution 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 As a result , he is missing for sure so long 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.120
 and it's so much fun 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.940
 also the soundtrack to the fun factor 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.960
 Everyone at Markus Daily knows all about it 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.960
 Strengthen the m3 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.180
 he is fine but not overwhelming 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.659
 In addition, three has 343 ps 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.979
 if there is a thriving exemplars 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.079
 now do not quarrel about the performance 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.840
 from the stool but that's no matter the fun 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:17.479
 I come from the performance but outside 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.770
 Handling side can be about the corners 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.770
 throw in the finest 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.860
 in the 3rd author of the narrator and 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.970
 lazy driving is therefore a real thing 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.580
 competitive car with safety cell 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.480
 sensible sit in the big one 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.300
 braking system 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.000
 there is of course all property of the 3 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.380
 for the angled course of ascari 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 the bmw like made 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.500
 Of course, a thoroughbred runs 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.679
 drive in that you feel that has the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.320
 is direct and it is crazy at the same time 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.119
 good possible forgive every mistake 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.560
 you can not get it out of the box so fast 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.220
 rest even if this is not very 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.220
 strain 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.200
 As Marie has such a short straight herself 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.700
 this again interrupted by briefly here 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.400
 you just need the fours 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.079
 winding speed 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.280
 it almost goes like the thing on the garden 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.170
 no matter 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.640
 if you take a car under something 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.770
 Tax takes over the front wheels 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.290
 You always push the slow one 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.020
 Turning speed up to the example 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.910
 Sometimes front-wheel drive happens too 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.490
 in the porsche sitting behind the motor 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.319
 has very light front that has a 3 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.930
 just not through the 50 50th 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.819
 weight distribution is called rhine 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.610
 borders in the cure you have your group 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.270
 enough to accelerate out the front 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.130
 print 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.110
 so the faction points and both 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.300
 Together the suite stayed in the crew 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.300
 ready and out the curve out 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.280
 The greatest strength of the m3 is that it is 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.780
 no weaknesses 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.650
 try if the porsche in front of us 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.740
 can follow 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.400
 that's at least gt3 rs with 420 ps 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.340
 just a bit away 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.910
 Do you want that after the meta 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.209
 the ex major one again and already are 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.209
 we turn 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.230
 in the curve I play with the porsche 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.430
 I can choose more where I am 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.579
 racer of the world was faster 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.409
 but hangman speed me up but 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.129
 The acceleration pieces are so short 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.220
 jens bald 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.230
 Here comes the next group 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.740
 and I'm back to it again I have 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.600
 almost 100 ps less than the porsche 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.380
 just for this good handling with the 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.820
 super weight distribution 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.820
 next self to recover 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.349
 lap time at 54 kilometers ascari 2 35 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.409
 08 and by the way a gt3 rs 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.900
 snorted circling concept would be accurate 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.519
 the right car cheaper you can 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.970
 do not have fun on the race track 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.919
 but 346 manageable of the cost 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.729
 make loosely as much fun as one 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.729
 current porsche
