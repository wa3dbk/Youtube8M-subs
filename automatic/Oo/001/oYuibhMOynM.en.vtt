ATC system which is an ankle anti
snaking<00:01:02.070> device<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:03.270> be

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
snaking device so that will be

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.260 
snaking device so that will be
disengaged<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.680> won't<00:01:04.890> operate<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.519> again<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
disengaged it won't operate so again the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
disengaged it won't operate so again the
car<00:01:06.540> will<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.780> no<00:01:06.990> assistance<00:01:07.560> during<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
car will get no assistance during the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.560 
car will get no assistance during the
towing<00:01:08.790> process

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
towing process

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.090 
towing process
so<00:01:09.780> therefore<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.229> judges<00:01:10.560> will<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> far

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
so therefore the judges will get a far

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
so therefore the judges will get a far
more<00:01:11.189> accurate<00:01:11.430> impression<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.479> how<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> car

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
more accurate impression of how the car

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.770 
more accurate impression of how the car
performs<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> track<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:15.180> various

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
performs on the track and at various

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.000 
performs on the track and at various
speeds

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
speeds

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.480 
speeds
so<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:18.940> tried<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.600> simulate<00:01:20.080> an<00:01:20.560> average

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
so we tried to simulate an average

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.480 
so we tried to simulate an average
family<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:23.470> they<00:01:23.620> would<00:01:23.740> be<00:01:23.890> taking<00:01:24.220> so<00:01:24.400> the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
family what they would be taking so the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.300 
family what they would be taking so the
ballasted<00:01:25.000> so<00:01:25.210> it's<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.570> wave<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.200> same<00:01:26.530> as<00:01:26.800> an

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
ballasted so it's a wave the same as an

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.820 
ballasted so it's a wave the same as an
average<00:01:27.490> family<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.750> luggage<00:01:29.500> they'd<00:01:29.680> be

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
average family the luggage they'd be

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.950 
average family the luggage they'd be
taking<00:01:30.250> we<00:01:30.820> also<00:01:30.970> check<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.300> tire<00:01:31.510> pressures

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
taking we also check the tire pressures

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.750 
taking we also check the tire pressures
we<00:01:32.950> check<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:35.320> wing<00:01:35.530> mirrors<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.370> we've<00:01:36.520> not

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
we check the wing mirrors so we've not

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.610 
we check the wing mirrors so we've not
in<00:01:36.910> I<00:01:37.120> checked<00:01:37.690> with<00:01:37.870> most<00:01:38.080> but<00:01:38.200> also<00:01:38.350> put

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
in I checked with most but also put

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.590 
in I checked with most but also put
Tonio's<00:01:39.190> on<00:01:39.310> there<00:01:39.490> as<00:01:39.580> well<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.790> my<00:01:42.970> babies

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
distance Alan take to stop right or to

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.800 
distance Alan take to stop right or to
reach<00:01:54.400> back<00:01:54.670> support<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.240> reach<00:01:55.390> back<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.780> the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
reach back support to reach back to the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.600 
reach back support to reach back to the
slides<00:01:56.110> yet<00:01:56.440> now<00:01:56.950> then<00:01:57.130> we've<00:01:57.250> got<00:01:57.370> a<00:01:57.400> nice

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
slides yet now then we've got a nice

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.609 
slides yet now then we've got a nice
beat<00:01:57.880> bowl<00:01:58.090> as<00:01:58.300> well

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.450 

what<00:02:04.619> we're<00:02:04.740> trying<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.100> trying<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
what we're trying to do trying to

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.350 
what we're trying to do trying to
simulate<00:02:05.790> an<00:02:06.210> emergency<00:02:06.780> braking<00:02:07.079> situation

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
simulate an emergency braking situation

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.889 
simulate an emergency braking situation
sometimes<00:02:09.360> gets<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.630> little<00:02:09.660> bit

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
sometimes gets a little bit

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.839 
sometimes gets a little bit
uncomfortable<00:02:10.319> because<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.130> caravan<00:02:11.580> can

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
uncomfortable because the caravan can

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:27.020 
uncomfortable because the caravan can
skew<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.239> little<00:02:12.480> bit<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:26.130> we'll<00:02:26.280> stop<00:02:26.550> here<00:02:26.790> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
skew a little bit so we'll stop here and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.660 
skew a little bit so we'll stop here and
then<00:02:27.239> work<00:02:27.390> set<00:02:27.750> our<00:02:28.380> Campbell's<00:02:29.190> oil<00:02:29.519> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670

the<00:02:33.840> back<00:02:34.019> cover<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.650> thought<00:02:35.400> about<00:02:35.640> yeah<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.870> a

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
the back cover I thought about yeah of a

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.870 
the back cover I thought about yeah of a
car<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.709> driving<00:02:38.130> domain<00:02:38.430> has<00:02:38.549> changed

car the driving domain has changed

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:52.460 
car the driving domain has changed
completely<00:02:50.989> will<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.080> have<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> care

availability team and their job is to
see<00:02:55.440> how<00:02:55.680> adaptable<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.430> storage<00:02:56.790> space<00:02:57.000> is

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
see how adaptable the storage space is

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.589 
see how adaptable the storage space is
where<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.599> they<00:02:57.720> come<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:03.150> year<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
where do they come this year is the

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.300 
where do they come this year is the
first<00:03:03.780> year<00:03:03.959> we've<00:03:04.230> reduced<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.799> reversing

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
first year we've reduced the reversing

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.509 
first year we've reduced the reversing
manoeuvre<00:03:05.870> why<00:03:06.870> don't<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.079> have<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> go<00:03:07.519> so

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
manoeuvre why don't you have a go so

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.610 
manoeuvre why don't you have a go so
it's<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.510> opposite<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.170> how<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.410> would

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
it's the opposite to how you would

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.380 
it's the opposite to how you would
normally<00:03:11.310> go<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:12.060> feels<00:03:12.299> very

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
normally go so it feels very

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.300 
normally go so it feels very
counterintuitive<00:03:12.930> right<00:03:13.829> I'm<00:03:14.010> going<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.190> try

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
counterintuitive right I'm going to try

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.720 
counterintuitive right I'm going to try
going<00:03:14.730> close<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.630> some<00:03:16.220> cone<00:03:17.220> that's<00:03:17.459> it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
going close to that some cone that's it

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.160 
going close to that some cone that's it
so<00:03:17.910> she<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:18.930> small<00:03:19.590> it's<00:03:20.310> small

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
so she this is small it's small

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.620 
so she this is small it's small
maneuvers<00:03:22.170> more<00:03:22.380> than<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.940> want<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.180> go<00:03:24.359> that

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
maneuvers more than I want it to go that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.849 
maneuvers more than I want it to go that
way<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:24.989> I'm<00:03:25.170> gonna<00:03:25.260> go<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.650> way

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
way it's I'm gonna go that way

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:40.809 
way it's I'm gonna go that way
yeah<00:03:26.900> now<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.200> go<00:03:28.290> forward<00:03:28.650> again

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.309 

there<00:03:41.819> are<00:03:41.879> many<00:03:42.060> elements<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:42.749> make<00:03:43.109> up

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
there are many elements that make up

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.500 
there are many elements that make up
real<00:03:43.709> Toronto<00:03:44.189> Car<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.609> Year<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.389> they're

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
real Toronto Car of the Year and they're

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.569 
real Toronto Car of the Year and they're
all<00:03:45.659> different<00:03:45.900> ingredients<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.859> when<00:03:47.459> they

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
all different ingredients that when they

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.699 
all different ingredients that when they
all<00:03:47.670> come<00:03:47.939> together<00:03:48.359> and<00:03:48.870> they're<00:03:49.319> all<00:03:49.349> right

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
all come together and they're all right

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.759 
all come together and they're all right
that's<00:03:50.340> how<00:03:50.609> we<00:03:50.670> get<00:03:51.060> our<00:03:51.420> ultimate<00:03:52.349> tow<00:03:52.530> car

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
that's how we get our ultimate tow car

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.879 
that's how we get our ultimate tow car
here<00:03:53.099> so<00:03:53.659> we're<00:03:54.659> looking<00:03:54.900> for<00:03:55.109> obviously<00:03:55.650> how

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
here so we're looking for obviously how

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.679 
here so we're looking for obviously how
well<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.219> toes<00:03:56.459> but<00:03:57.180> we're<00:03:57.299> looking<00:03:57.540> for

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
well it toes but we're looking for

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.990 
well it toes but we're looking for
everyday<00:03:58.109> practicality<00:03:58.560> we're<00:03:59.430> looking<00:03:59.700> for

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
everyday practicality we're looking for

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.179 
everyday practicality we're looking for
the<00:04:00.480> scale<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.930> economics<00:04:01.469> how<00:04:01.769> much<00:04:01.980> does<00:04:02.159> it

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
the scale of economics how much does it

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.729 
the scale of economics how much does it
cost<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.670> run<00:04:02.849> each<00:04:03.000> year<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:03.629> they're<00:04:04.500> just

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
cost to run each year and they're just

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.259 
cost to run each year and they're just
some<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.159> elements<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:05.969> when<00:04:06.150> they're

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
some of the elements but when they're

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.170 
some of the elements but when they're
all<00:04:06.359> put<00:04:06.540> together<00:04:06.889> and<00:04:07.889> it's<00:04:08.040> done<00:04:08.250> well<00:04:08.519> that

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
all put together and it's done well that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.459 
all put together and it's done well that
is<00:04:09.419> how<00:04:09.689> we<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.739> judges<00:04:11.189> get<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.450> tow<00:04:13.139> car<00:04:13.409> of

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:13.469 
is how we the judges get to tow car of

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.830 
is how we the judges get to tow car of
the<00:04:13.590> year<00:04:13.819> so<00:04:14.819> somebody<00:04:15.090> who<00:04:15.209> has<00:04:15.239> had<00:04:15.389> one<00:04:15.810> for

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
the year so somebody who has had one for

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.569 
the year so somebody who has had one for
a<00:04:15.989> long<00:04:16.139> long<00:04:16.289> time<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.829> means<00:04:16.949> to<00:04:17.160> keep<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.489> and

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
a long long time it means to keep it and

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.520 
a long long time it means to keep it and
not<00:04:17.669> switch<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.180> caravan<00:04:18.570> but<00:04:19.109> wants<00:04:19.380> to

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
not switch to the caravan but wants to

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.129 
not switch to the caravan but wants to
change<00:04:19.739> their<00:04:19.949> car<00:04:20.299> they<00:04:21.299> don't<00:04:21.509> just<00:04:21.840> change

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
change their car they don't just change

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.080 
change their car they don't just change
the<00:04:22.349> car<00:04:22.560> without<00:04:22.800> finding<00:04:23.310> out<00:04:23.610> it's

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
the car without finding out it's

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.640 
the car without finding out it's
suitable<00:04:24.330> for<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.870> particular<00:04:25.320> Caravan

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
suitable for that particular Caravan

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.939 
suitable for that particular Caravan
that's<00:04:25.949> absolutely<00:04:26.460> right<00:04:26.699> but<00:04:27.740> we<00:04:28.740> do<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.889> lot

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
that's absolutely right but we do a lot

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.770 
that's absolutely right but we do a lot
of<00:04:29.070> research<00:04:29.490> before<00:04:29.759> they<00:04:30.150> buy<00:04:30.330> clean<00:04:30.660> you

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
of research before they buy clean you

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.060 
of research before they buy clean you
can<00:04:30.990> event<00:04:31.259> to<00:04:31.349> make<00:04:31.500> sure<00:04:31.680> it's<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.919> right

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070
