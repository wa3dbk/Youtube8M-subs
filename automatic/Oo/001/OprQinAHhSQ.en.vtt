 the problem of gangrene your heart is detections and the mortality rate 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.600
 it was increasing in an amazing way

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.500
 min the American civil war is a classic example of why its consumption 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 warns against going to war in the first place 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.880
 but other principles of the art of war 'would prove to be instrumental 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.950
 in the way the war ended

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.290
 those skilled in the art of war 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.299
 attract the enemy to the battlefield are not attracted to him 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.910
 Pennsylvania 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.140
 1863 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 the civil war is a dead end and bloody 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.340
 by the end of June of that year the Confederate General Robert Verdi in a 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.270
 daring movement mobilize his army of almost 60 thousand men in the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.050
 territory of the union 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.340
 even though many of the battles of the American civil war have been 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.480
 fought in the south 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.950
 clyde side that the moment is appropriate to invade the floor of the union the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.780
 campus and is to destroy as many military detachments as possible 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.550
 measure the intensity 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.700
 while the armies of the union defend washington dc 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.600
 one of the key objectives is car field 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.810
 on the outskirts of johannesburg the largest military supply depot in the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.649
 north 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.039
 the strategy of the attack of the day in the north is not primarily military as 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.240
 it is political 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.870
 for what he will try is essentially to defeat lincoln in the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.870
 golijov political terrain what he hopes is that a massive defeat of the north 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.059
 Encourage people to lose faith in war 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.389
 the daring delhi military action to achieve a political victory 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:34.230
 responds more to a cook strategy than to a chess strategy 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.480
 exactly the kind of plan that is a suv 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.090
 you would have looked but as the main force of the and moves towards 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.080
 the north a skirmish arise from duisburg between two units of 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.209
 chivalry 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.269
 the confederate general people had a division embedded hunt 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.689
 mobilize until that according to ccoo to get shoes in a factory 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:53.519
 from haiti 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.079
 that was the only reason why he went and in this way he moved without 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.359
 no understanding of what awaited him in the process sparked the 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.819
 greatest war ever equaled in the Western Hemisphere 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.659
 Ali is warned of the skirmish and they tell him that a great strength of the union 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.989
 they are found since it is pure 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.779
 instead of sending a cavalry unit to do the 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:22.430
 recognition li order the mobilization of his entire army 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:26.279
 it is a colossal mistake 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.220
 and decides to abandon the original plan 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.670
 and denounces what we would call strategic focus and makes the mistake of 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.380
 allow operational development and in the current strategy ended 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.259
 he orders that all his forces with force meanwhile 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:47.109
 a small village at 11 kilometers that facebook or your second would like 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.769
 this election since every state has not been fully explored and robert and I 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.419
 I would have read your business 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.999
 I would have known that it was better to use resources to find out what really 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.429
 it was happening you have to proceed to act on the basis of what was thought 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.699
 It was happening 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.269
 your supplies 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.949
 Move only when you see an advantage and when there is something to gain 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.599
 only in struggle so a position is critical 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:17.819
 about 60 thousand Confederate soldiers begin to appear from the nearby 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.370
 caste or woman speaks 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.870
 three thousand soldiers of the union take position on the hill of more clear 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.800
 there they will try to contain the onslaught of enemy soldiers until the 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.050
 help 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.360
 but the forces of the union are many kilometers away 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.729
 dc washington 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.460
 so the soldiers of the union retreat to the southeast to the mountains 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.740
 that gets here 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.500
 a mountain range east of the village that has the shape of a fishhook 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.590
 fishing 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.920
 the mountains to subdue and provides a strong defensive advantage 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.620
 the terrain is so obviously in favor of the defense that I guess almost all 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.050
 the alternates of west point would have chosen that terrain would have been had 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.759
 the opportunity 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.460
 when the general of the union of holy blind faith declares that it is the best 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.849
 natural position you have never seen 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.199
 immediately li the danger of union position 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.719
 but because the union troops are still lagging behind he 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.629
 believe they are funeral 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.510
 lida an order of the Confederate General Lugo 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.680
 that many believe that it is not really an order 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.510
 pili and says to attack when you think it is practical and does not order it to concern 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.220
 no dilute then in the field did not know what the hell was happening 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.219
 so he decided not to attack 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.110
 He gave a decided that it was not practical because his troops were tired 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.139
 exhausted and he wanted to rest in the nba the same place 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.840
 Although some criticize the humor for not following the order 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.840
 the words of his in his home and to the responsible ali 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.860
 if we go back to the famous meeting between the front of it from buck said 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.860
 input during the incident in the palace of the concubines 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:08.639
 it is your 26 at that time that they arrive if the orders are clear mexico df 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.460
 in a recent speech 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.220
 We ask the day given by Cristina very unclear and very ambiguous to her 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.220
 subordinates unlike previous occasions 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.860
 the reinforcements of the union soon arrive and strengthen their position 

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:31.159
 lilly now faces like an uphill battle that almost certainly goes to 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:32.650
 to lose 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.219
 according to sutiss 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.580
 when the enemy occupies high lands 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.180
 not only with borders if you attack downhill do not make opposition 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.569
 when night falls during the first day of the battle that he ordered 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:52.210
 li meets as another Confederate general yen-hsun auschwitz a man 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.210
 that addresses the situation from the disused perspective 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:56.960
 the weekly 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.190
 despite the fact that he abandoned the idea of ​​attacking the union in the highlands 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.310
 instead of that 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.740
 wants to march south to the semester mountains and then east to 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.080
 dc washington 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.160
 the triquis c this will force the army of the union to come up the mountains 

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:17.099
 I saw them and attacked them where we are 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:21.560
 and if they attack us, we will win, he died, which was precisely what a suv 

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:23.619
 I would have recommended 

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:26.080
 but the index that does not 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.029
 points to the mountains to subdue and says 

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.059
 the enemy is like that and I will attack him there 

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:36.989
 lilita completely abandoned her strategy of ccoo el atleti arte al 

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.479
 Chess 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.399
 - today he is surprised 

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:44.479
 he sees the union army entrenched in the hills and they know that 

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:48.849
 should not attack them is a suv would have warned against this would have 

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:49.340
 saying 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.949
 evaluate the situation it was not fair that his forces find another way to 

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:53.490
 attack the enemy
