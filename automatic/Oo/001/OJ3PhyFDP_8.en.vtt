gravity<00:02:06.969> which<00:02:07.179> is<00:02:07.209> helping<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.779> blood<00:02:07.989> to

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
gravity which is helping the blood to

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.529 
gravity which is helping the blood to
run<00:02:08.319> out<00:02:08.470> as<00:02:08.679> well<00:02:08.920> if<00:02:09.130> you<00:02:09.700> elevate<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.360> limb

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
run out as well if you elevate the limb

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.470 
run out as well if you elevate the limb
then<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.929> will<00:02:11.110> directly<00:02:11.500> reduce<00:02:11.890> bleeding

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
then you will directly reduce bleeding

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.640 
then you will directly reduce bleeding
blood<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:13.750> other<00:02:13.959> things<00:02:14.260> rolls<00:02:14.590> downhill

you go an inch below and an inch lateral

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.570 
you go an inch below and an inch lateral
to<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.870> bone<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.440> if<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.680> push<00:03:05.920> very<00:03:05.950> hard<00:03:06.280> in

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
to the bone and if you push very hard in

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.580 
to the bone and if you push very hard in
your<00:03:06.670> groin<00:03:06.940> right<00:03:07.239> there<00:03:07.510> you'll<00:03:08.049> be<00:03:08.170> able<00:03:08.350> to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
your groin right there you'll be able to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.229 
your groin right there you'll be able to
feel<00:03:08.799> another<00:03:09.040> pulse<00:03:09.430> that's<00:03:09.730> your<00:03:09.940> femoral

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
feel another pulse that's your femoral

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.020 
feel another pulse that's your femoral
artery<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.860> can<00:03:12.040> compress<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.610> femoral

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
artery you can compress the femoral

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.320 
artery you can compress the femoral
artery<00:03:13.390> against<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> bone<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:16.120> way

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
artery against the bone that that way

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.910 
artery against the bone that that way
you<00:03:16.390> can<00:03:16.720> prevent<00:03:17.019> any<00:03:17.319> bleeding<00:03:17.650> that's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
you can prevent any bleeding that's

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.390 
you can prevent any bleeding that's
occurring<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.819> in<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.090> leg<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.890> brachial

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
occurring in the in the leg the brachial

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.090 
occurring in the in the leg the brachial
artery<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.380> there<00:03:26.380> will<00:03:26.500> be<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.590> slide<00:03:26.890> for

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
artery and there will be a slide for

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.599 
artery and there will be a slide for
that<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:29.170> this<00:03:29.410> basically<00:03:29.650> summarizes<00:03:30.459> what

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
that so this basically summarizes what

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.750 
that so this basically summarizes what
we<00:03:30.880> just<00:03:31.090> talked<00:03:31.420> about<00:03:31.540> direct<00:03:32.200> pressure

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
we just talked about direct pressure

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.229 
we just talked about direct pressure
elevation<00:03:33.760> pressure<00:03:34.600> points<00:03:35.970> how<00:03:36.970> should<00:03:37.180> you

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
elevation pressure points how should you

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.660 
elevation pressure points how should you
do<00:03:37.480> direct<00:03:37.840> how<00:03:38.440> should<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.680> do<00:03:38.980> direct

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
do direct how should you do direct

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.770 
do direct how should you do direct
pressure<00:03:39.940> if<00:03:40.239> you're<00:03:40.359> going<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.630> put<00:03:40.750> a

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
pressure if you're going to put a

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.050 
pressure if you're going to put a
bandage<00:03:41.230> on<00:03:41.440> tie<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.769> bow<00:03:42.100> why<00:03:42.519> do<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.760> tie<00:03:43.030> a

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
bandage on tie a bow why do you tie a

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.849 
bandage on tie a bow why do you tie a
bow<00:03:45.269> right<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.510> can<00:03:46.690> get<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:46.959> undone<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.680> can

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
bow right you can get it undone you can

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.069 
bow right you can get it undone you can
relieve<00:03:48.250> pressure<00:03:48.579> from<00:03:49.120> time<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.540> time<00:03:49.570> let's

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
relieve pressure from time to time let's

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.990 
relieve pressure from time to time let's
say<00:03:50.230> there's<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.470> very<00:03:50.709> delayed<00:03:51.130> rescue<00:03:51.730> and

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
say there's a very delayed rescue and

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.160 
say there's a very delayed rescue and
you've<00:03:52.750> tied<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.160> bandage<00:03:54.160> or<00:03:54.600> put<00:03:55.600> pressure<00:03:55.959> on

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
you've tied a bandage or put pressure on

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.780 
you've tied a bandage or put pressure on
someone's<00:03:56.530> artery<00:03:56.890> in<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.010> leg<00:03:57.100> starts<00:03:57.640> to

someone's artery in the leg starts to

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.880 
someone's artery in the leg starts to
blanch<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:59.079> victim<00:03:59.380> tells<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.769> it's

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
blanch and the victim tells you it's

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.130 
blanch and the victim tells you it's
becoming<00:04:00.190> very<00:04:00.310> painful<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.299> it's<00:04:01.420> cold<00:04:01.810> to

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
becoming very painful and it's cold to

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.470 
becoming very painful and it's cold to
the<00:04:02.170> touch<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:02.920> not<00:04:03.130> able<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.579> move<00:04:03.790> now

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
the touch and it's not able to move now

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.210 
the touch and it's not able to move now
you've<00:04:04.720> deprived<00:04:05.200> circulation<00:04:05.950> very

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
you've deprived circulation very

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.970 
you've deprived circulation very
effectively<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:07.000> control<00:04:07.780> bleeding<00:04:08.049> but<00:04:08.799> now

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
effectively to control bleeding but now

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.259 
effectively to control bleeding but now
you've<00:04:09.190> entered<00:04:09.489> into<00:04:09.700> this<00:04:09.819> stage<00:04:10.120> of

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
you've entered into this stage of

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.300 
you've entered into this stage of
causing<00:04:10.720> loss<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.140> circulation<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.950> loss<00:04:12.130> of

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
causing loss of circulation and loss of

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.430 
causing loss of circulation and loss of
limb<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:13.180> want<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.450> relieve<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.930> pressure<00:04:14.079> at

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
limb you want to relieve the pressure at

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.620 
limb you want to relieve the pressure at
that<00:04:14.470> stage<00:04:14.980> so<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:15.340> just<00:04:15.549> undo<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.180> bow<00:04:16.359> long

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
that stage so you just undo the bow long

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.050 
that stage so you just undo the bow long
enough<00:04:16.930> for<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.289> color<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.859> return<00:04:18.190> for<00:04:18.940> the

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
enough for the color to return for the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.969 
enough for the color to return for the
pain<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.329> go<00:04:19.479> away<00:04:19.630> for<00:04:20.049> some<00:04:20.289> circulation<00:04:20.769> to

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
pain to go away for some circulation to

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.279 
pain to go away for some circulation to
be<00:04:21.370> restored<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.210> if<00:04:22.510> you<00:04:22.630> see<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.960> bleeding

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
be restored and if you see the bleeding

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.960 
be restored and if you see the bleeding
and<00:04:23.350> still<00:04:23.620> occurring<00:04:24.100> then<00:04:24.550> go<00:04:24.760> ahead<00:04:24.850> and

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
and still occurring then go ahead and

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.000 
and still occurring then go ahead and
put<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.360> on<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.750> bleeding<00:04:26.200> may<00:04:26.500> have<00:04:26.620> stopped

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
put it on the bleeding may have stopped

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.680 
put it on the bleeding may have stopped
the<00:04:27.250> blood<00:04:27.490> may<00:04:27.669> have<00:04:27.789> clotted<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.389> injury

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
may have been very small then don't

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.880 
may have been very small then don't
reapply<00:04:31.000> it<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.390> may<00:04:31.840> resume<00:04:32.229> again<00:04:32.560> as<00:04:32.770> the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.580 
pressure starts to go back up the injury
may<00:04:35.530> reoccur<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.159> they<00:04:36.220> missed

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
may reoccur and they missed

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.230 
may reoccur and they missed
bleeding<00:04:36.890> then<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.190> can<00:04:37.340> go<00:04:37.460> ahead<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:37.640> reuse

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
bleeding then you can go ahead and reuse

and<00:04:54.650> you<00:04:55.220> can<00:04:55.430> control<00:04:55.790> bleeding<00:04:56.590> can<00:04:57.590> we

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
and you can control bleeding can we

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.470 
and you can control bleeding can we
demonstrate<00:04:57.890> on<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.520> skeleton<00:04:59.030> where<00:04:59.300> those

so push down through the skin push down

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.630 
so push down through the skin push down
through<00:05:33.170> the<00:05:33.470> muscles<00:05:33.860> until<00:05:34.100> you<00:05:34.220> can<00:05:34.400> feel

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
the pulse against the bone and then just

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.040 
the pulse against the bone and then just
compress<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:37.670> artery<00:05:38.030> against<00:05:38.420> the<00:05:38.510> bone<00:05:38.720> any
