00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.230
 I hope stress right out and that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.179
 Is it such a kind of review on me 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.770
 every case and a gift tip i know 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.630
 Christmas is still a little way 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
 although, frankly, I already have one 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.080
 But I'm a bit in the mood for Christmas 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.359
 I can not say that too loud 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.099
 and yes I hope you like this 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.570
 video is interested in you and then 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.510
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.059
 what is clementi this is 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.969
 around lipsticks you yourselves 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.920
 create could I have since papa the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.390
 gewinnspiel however, has won up 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.670
 now nothing to do with youtube but 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.200
 I have that with my private one 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.730
 won facebook account and I wanted 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.260
 but I really want to introduce myself 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.270
 do not get anything for that you do not even know 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.710
 I, the video rotating but I wanted 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.690
 In any case introduce myself because I 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 the idea in itself just really great 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.020
 find if you somehow a great 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.239
 Have a sweater or a great one 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.579
 garment or something and just that 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.469
 have matching lipstick color for it 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.059
 if you want you can do it yourself 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.519
 I think the idea is simple 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.180
 really great, first of all it comes in 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.939
 very nice packaging and find that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.369
 I already very much out so it is 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.900
 really great looks really nice and 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.610
 really makes something 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.390
 then every lipstick is again 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.450
 individually packed in a box and so on 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.060
 you have the good pieces of it you 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.079
 a mystery site and you have one 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.490
 website the crime site like you already 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.670
 says is shiny and so nurturing that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.110
 should your lips really be cared for 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.159
 they should not shine beautifully 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.140
 dry out 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.960
 the website is for the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.579
 strong color in charge and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.229
 Accordingly, it should also be first 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.659
 Apply color and then the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.119
 Apply shiny color so you have 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.100
 just a nice blanket of the best 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.799
 Result on the lips that is now 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.240
 as I said so is a purple color 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.060
 Of course, very very blatant 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.130
 then I have a lime green colors here 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.489
 a 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.959
 yellow color a blue color and one 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.060
 Red color 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.950
 this is now this pastel collection 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.450
 So it's been months since that 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.950
 was sent with us 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.599
 I guess maybe it will 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.069
 do not give anymore but there is 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.230
 always very beautiful others 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.880
 collections and I blind you now 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.099
 Here are some pictures 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.290
 how the whole looks worn are 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.519
 maybe not now 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.440
 suitable for everyday use but as I said there 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.510
 you put together that you want 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.860
 I'll show you this very briefly 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.790
 Principle and although you are pinching 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.700
 energy.com 1 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.260
 then you end up here on the home page 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.660
 on the homepage you can see too 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.880
 So the concept will also be one 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.010
 bit explains how it works 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.890
 then here is also a guide 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.330
 how this works and are below 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.090
 current news 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.880
 you can also buy brushes here and 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.799
 a transparent contour pencil because 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.870
 In any case, you know, I preach 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.530
 use always use lipliner 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.180
 use 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.489
 and there you can have one 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.329
 Obtain it transparent for each one 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:17.150
 color good start is here up here 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.220
 on lipstick and here you see 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.890
 you can all be under these colors 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.380
 So choose 30 pieces and then will 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.090
 below you can see the price 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.810
 I'll just take it 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.630
 the color then you see here and still 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.060
 threatens for example and then you look in 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.600
 the middle as the two colors mixed 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.670
 look and you see the price below 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.069
 24 eur 90 that's right now 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.019
 Lipstick There is also lip gloss there 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.630
 the principle works the same way 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.880
 you will take a color out of you 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.540
 then another one and see 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.540
 the middle of your final result and what until 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.010
 then 18 99 for example what costs 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.190
 you could do that too 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.540
 Now say my materials have now 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.150
 Of course you can still be in gold 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.829
 silver or gold silver float 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.030
 you can choose that as well 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.440
 choose 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.080
 and yes I just think it's a nice one 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.600
 idea 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.370
 and I think it's worth it 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.049
 every case over look if you 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.420
 a nice and personal gift 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.160
 For example , I'm looking for a girlfriend 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.750
 can you also now like a spot 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.640
 already with that now also times 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.650
 see and that this is now the time 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.540
 Crime side of this red so little 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.940
 For example, really nice so think so 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.820
 was one of the absolute everyday life 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.460
 is wearable for me at least so that 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.470
 was now a time this color here as 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.790
 said very nice I've got it, too 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.350
 Of course already worn 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.960
 they finally crawl into the 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.240
 lips wrinkles they are very good of 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.300
 Durability than I like you 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.070
 Personally, and I thought so 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.500
 I'll just pass it on to you 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.000
 without obligation, of course, and me 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.440
 I hope I liked it again 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.330
 Let me know how he finds it 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.680
 and then I wish you one more 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.970
