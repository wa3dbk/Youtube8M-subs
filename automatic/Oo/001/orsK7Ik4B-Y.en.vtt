00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.159
 why pay instead cosmetic surgery 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.449
 cosmetic surgery involves an individual who is not 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:12.309
 sick 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.639
 that it is complex 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.890
 and wish to change his body from his face 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:18.829
 for that 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.029
 he has to really think 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.210
 a new villain who was my boss 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.789
 ten of those words which in my opinion is very fair 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.919
 the last thing to think about is having to pay 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.530
 the money therefore produces a distance between the surgeons and his 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.580
 patient 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.890
 and in this act 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.240
 the patient will suddenly surrender 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.510
 he has to invest ten fingers to invest himself 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.430
 this is very important 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.700
 before there was no formality 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.140
 what is done like that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.260
 now it takes the surgeon to face with life 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.410
 where he mentions the amount of the transaction, the cost of which 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.680
 clinical anesthesia 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 why not recover for free 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.110
 Does Social Security have to take over the operations of 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.370
 plastic surgery 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.190
 it was easy enough 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.340
 a woman who had a belly damaged by two or three pregnancies 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.490
 and enumerate turin games a belly and muscles that are so not 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.240
 tolerable for her 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.010
 was very easily supported by social security under the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.230
 repair after pregnancy 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.260
 This is no longer the case today 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.510
 the society become harder social security at less than under 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.390
 to diderot madam if you wish that perez is possible but only 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.600
 in case you belly skin december in front of the publicist 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.990
 which is quite reductive in the number of operations that can be 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.040
 supported 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.390
 and for that taking care of this holiday 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.810
 the surgeon must apply for a kallas loan with a form that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.870
 We fill up 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.460
 and which is given to the patient she even brought to social security 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.540
 she will be summoned by the medical adviser 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.289
 who publishes will decide 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.190
 if the community supports us this operation 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.700
 so the question arises where and how to get surgery for me dear 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.750
 eventually 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.789
 does tourism resume cosmetic surgery is something of 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.349
 suspicious valid 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.349
 it's clever enough to pay less it can be interesting 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:18.949
 but this is the denial of the relationship between insurgents to his patient 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.590
 an operation is not a pan flute that one buys in a combrit - dish 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.869
 berber bought in tunisia 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:30.679
 there are human contacts that should not be limited to the operation and or 10 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:31.939
 next days 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.719
 the surgeon held to reassure his patient the reach a presence that that 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:37.489
 logic 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.679
 to be there in case of glitch 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.279
 but this is priceless 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.649
 that's what's important in an operation 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:47.439
 it's not that the initial gesture of cutting in the bike to add 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.519
 who does it 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.189
 in what conditions 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.809
 and with all the support moira psychology the ogm butcher we must 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.329
 to bring to our patients
