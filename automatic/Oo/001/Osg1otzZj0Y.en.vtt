a bit it's anyone deep so that's quite
nice<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> getting<00:01:12.150> waterfall<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.229> yes<00:01:13.380> it's

nice to getting waterfall but yes it's
going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:13.979> Pacey<00:01:14.250> straight<00:01:14.790> diagonal<00:01:15.030> from

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
going to go Pacey straight diagonal from

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.940 
going to go Pacey straight diagonal from
so<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:16.729> Northwest<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.240> way<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.890> i'll<00:01:19.890> show

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you in my coordinates I think it's minus

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410 
you in my coordinates I think it's minus
80<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.130> pyramid<00:01:23.460> by<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> wave<00:01:23.790> minus<00:01:24.180> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
80 for the pyramid by the wave minus you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420 
80 for the pyramid by the wave minus you
I'll<00:01:24.780> tell<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.080> ok<00:01:25.409> keep<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.040> along<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
I'll tell you ok keep going along and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.070 
I'll tell you ok keep going along and
you<00:01:26.520> find<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.820> sand<00:01:27.030> bit<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.570> when<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.900> find

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you find this sand bit so when you find

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.390 
you find this sand bit so when you find
the<00:01:28.140> sound<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.439> you're<00:01:28.650> right<00:01:28.979> next<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the sound of it you're right next to it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
the sound of it you're right next to it
so<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.450> fire<00:01:30.630> would<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.930> seen<00:01:31.079> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
so if I was on fire would have seen it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.649 
so if I was on fire would have seen it
so<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.040> corners<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.000> around<00:01:33.329> minus<00:01:34.610> minus

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
so the corners are around minus minus

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.190 
so the corners are around minus minus
190<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.930> z<00:01:37.320> 1<00:01:37.950> 30<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:39.060> around<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.570> i<00:01:39.960> will

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
190 and z 1 30 so around that i will

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.390 
190 and z 1 30 so around that i will
have<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.320> coordinates<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> description

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
have the coordinates in the description

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.679 
have the coordinates in the description
if<00:01:41.490> i<00:01:41.610> remember<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.659> find

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
if i remember and there you can find

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.929 
if i remember and there you can find

made sure no I just destroyed the
spawner<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:55.870> it's<00:04:55.990> just<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.380> cobblestones

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
spawner so it's just the cobblestones

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.060 
spawner so it's just the cobblestones
down<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.430> spawner<00:04:57.670> anyway<00:04:58.540> so<00:04:58.830> yeah<00:04:59.830> if<00:04:59.950> you

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
down the spawner anyway so yeah if you

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.500 
down the spawner anyway so yeah if you
guys<00:05:00.190> number<00:05:00.550> spider<00:05:00.850> spawn<00:05:01.120> it's<00:05:01.240> not<00:05:01.360> too

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
guys number spider spawn it's not too

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.820 
guys number spider spawn it's not too
great<00:05:01.660> but<00:05:01.720> you<00:05:01.900> can<00:05:02.050> make<00:05:02.230> some<00:05:02.350> ladders<00:05:02.680> down

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
great but you can make some ladders down

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.190 
great but you can make some ladders down
maybe<00:05:03.160> down<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.550> down<00:05:04.180> there<00:05:04.390> and<00:05:04.600> then<00:05:04.660> you

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
maybe down like down there and then you

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.960 
maybe down like down there and then you
can<00:05:05.350> come<00:05:05.590> do<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.830> same<00:05:05.980> thing<00:05:06.160> making<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.460> trap

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
can come do the same thing making a trap

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.520 
can come do the same thing making a trap
but<00:05:07.240> it's<00:05:07.390> quite<00:05:07.600> cool<00:05:07.750> battle<00:05:08.140> next<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.470> this

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
but it's quite cool battle next to this

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.620 
but it's quite cool battle next to this
temple<00:05:08.920> you<00:05:09.640> probably<00:05:09.820> can<00:05:10.030> find<00:05:10.300> some<00:05:10.480> more

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
temple you probably can find some more

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.120 
temple you probably can find some more
dungeons<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.350> stuff<00:05:11.500> but<00:05:11.590> I<00:05:11.680> haven't<00:05:11.800> checked

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
dungeons and stuff but I haven't checked

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.920 
dungeons and stuff but I haven't checked
that<00:05:12.430> for<00:05:12.910> you<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.090> check<00:05:13.210> by<00:05:13.390> yourself<00:05:13.750> so<00:05:13.840> you

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
that for you to check by yourself so you

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.150 
that for you to check by yourself so you
obviously<00:05:14.050> got<00:05:14.410> some<00:05:14.530> more<00:05:14.650> bread<00:05:14.860> another

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
obviously got some more bread another

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.700 
obviously got some more bread another
saddle<00:05:15.430> more<00:05:16.240> string<00:05:16.570> some<00:05:16.810> redstone<00:05:17.020> more

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
saddle more string some redstone more

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.850 
saddle more string some redstone more
iron<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.280> some<00:05:18.430> cocoa<00:05:18.790> beans<00:05:19.320> even<00:05:20.320> more<00:05:20.560> sad

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
iron and some cocoa beans even more sad

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.530 
iron and some cocoa beans even more sad
oh<00:05:20.890> so<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:21.190> think<00:05:21.280> that's<00:05:21.430> five<00:05:21.730> sales<00:05:22.030> total<00:05:22.450> is

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
oh so I think that's five sales total is

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.110 
oh so I think that's five sales total is
it<00:05:22.740> some<00:05:23.740> more<00:05:23.770> weight<00:05:24.040> some<00:05:24.730> more<00:05:24.910> gunpowder

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
it some more weight some more gunpowder

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.240 
it some more weight some more gunpowder
another<00:05:25.690> piece<00:05:25.870> of<00:05:25.990> bread<00:05:26.230> and<00:05:26.410> another<00:05:27.010> piece

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
another piece of bread and another piece

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.370 
another piece of bread and another piece
of<00:05:27.400> cocoa<00:05:27.610> beans<00:05:27.880> so<00:05:28.540> obviously<00:05:29.080> this<00:05:29.200> is<00:05:29.350> a

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
of cocoa beans so obviously this is a

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.220 
of cocoa beans so obviously this is a
really<00:05:29.710> nice<00:05:30.450> seed<00:05:31.450> obviously<00:05:31.810> just<00:05:32.020> for<00:05:32.140> the

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
really nice seed obviously just for the

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.990 
really nice seed obviously just for the
amazement<00:05:32.830> that<00:05:33.160> there's<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.460> dungeon<00:05:33.850> in<00:05:33.940> the

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
amazement that there's a dungeon in the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.210 
amazement that there's a dungeon in the
pyramid<00:05:34.390> but<00:05:35.140> overall<00:05:35.590> this<00:05:35.770> is<00:05:35.830> really<00:05:36.070> cool

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
pyramid but overall this is really cool

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.410 
pyramid but overall this is really cool
