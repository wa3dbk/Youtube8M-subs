 3 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.630
 hello very good to all people to youtube 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.189
 here we are one more day in the worst channel 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.410
 of the story to this day 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.619
 tomÃ¡s gamer and in this video we are going to 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.450
 play the wii a mario kart 8 I 'm going to 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.009
 teach career mode versus for 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.169
 Who does not know what it is so let's see it 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.730
 I'm clearly going to get my money 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.680
 redundancy 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.420
 and he's not watching let's play with 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.920
 extra cars for my stuff lips myself 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.540
 I want to show you this combination that 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.370
 he liked it very much and the truth is that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.199
 I'm using it a lot today 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.199
 very useful that I'm leaving the branches 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.039
 where are you my friend yes without any 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.899
 doubt that state is the configuration 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.570
 I love this old love 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.379
 it will be colder than satan but the truth 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.570
 is that it does not run much, that is, not very 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.950
 fast but it will be so fast that it's a 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.380
 I'm going to put in real barbarity 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.420
 150 and just so you can see it 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.670
 where it does not have much race mystery 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.670
 versus ok let's see the versus 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.670
 you are loading loading 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.549
 loading 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.549
 It's costing to load more than usual 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.549
 Hello 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.350
 race versus stadium mario kart 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.350
 first race 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.039
 what is this mode you will ask then 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.049
 well this mode is what has been in 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.500
 any other mario kart the race 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.990
 quick not just one single 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.969
 race you choose the stadium you choose or 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.159
 be the track inside the cup that you 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.869
 you want and you play what is being that 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.000
 career you do not have to swallow a 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.390
 entire stadium or be a whole glass ni 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.250
 make history not all a career with 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.500
 the rules you hell you want if 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.260
 with objects that are objects that too 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.420
 the truth that I like for because the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.620
 time to make series oo whatever 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.599
 you can have a lot of inventiveness and 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.610
 even say well I want to make a 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.780
 racing series without objects or a 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.730
 series where you can only use 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.680
 bananas or where you can only use 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.930
 such then for when to do 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.430
 challenges or do any little thing like that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.469
 to record 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.390
 It is very interesting because I like 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.300
 that 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.860
 what is said simple and effective not the race 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.240
 quick of all mario karts 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.640
 simply that it is much more 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.080
 configurable because it lets you choose what 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.569
 that is being all options 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.610
 who have shown you at the beginning if the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.580
 you want with equipment without certain equipment 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.310
 objects or even none at 50 100 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.310
 150 you choose to play and fast and simple 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.750
 the pampero potatoes 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.230
 since we are 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.650
 we do a magic skid 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.200
 and in curved sections 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.319
 peace 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.980
 if we do not support the man of all 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.980
 the perfect load 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.430
 which I already say this combination of cart 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.010
 I love 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.939
 not in aesthetics but in operation the 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.939
 performance is formidable 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.060
 since this can either better 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.720
 moments or next career 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.819
 and that's as simple as you do not play anything 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.819
 will unlock anything this is 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.360
 you choose your stadium jode with stadium 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.640
 you choose another glass another map another track 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.580
 and to run this is what has been 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.290
 career mode versus so nothing 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.940
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.079
 I have that I have served you for 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.660
 learn what career mode is 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.970
 versus and already in the next video we're going to 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.560
 teach what is the battle mode so 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.120
 Thank you very much for having seen 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.170

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.520
 we see until the next
