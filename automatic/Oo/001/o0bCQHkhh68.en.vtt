sense<00:05:38.130> freezes<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.310> action<00:05:39.880> in<00:05:39.969> the<00:05:40.090> very

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
sense freezes the action in the very

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.420 
sense freezes the action in the very
short<00:05:40.360> term<00:05:40.900> I<00:05:41.139> think<00:05:41.590> if<00:05:41.680> there<00:05:41.710> are<00:05:41.979> massive

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
short term I think if there are massive

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.519 
short term I think if there are massive
cleanup<00:05:42.729> efforts<00:05:43.240> particularly<00:05:43.990> in<00:05:44.229> swing

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:44.529 
cleanup efforts particularly in swing

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.559 
cleanup efforts particularly in swing
states<00:05:44.560> you'll<00:05:45.340> see<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.639> president<00:05:46.150> go<00:05:46.330> there

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:46.569 
states you'll see the president go there

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:48.990 
states you'll see the president go there
to<00:05:46.990> try<00:05:47.229> to<00:05:47.259> aid<00:05:47.529> his<00:05:47.710> campaign<00:05:48.190> ultimately
