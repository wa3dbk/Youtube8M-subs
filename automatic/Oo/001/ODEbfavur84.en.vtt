something like that because that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.819 
something like that because that

inside Jupiter the metallic liquid

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
hydrogen is different from the regular

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.510 
hydrogen is different from the regular
liquid<00:03:04.970> hydrogen<00:03:05.660> because<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:06.890> conducting

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
liquid hydrogen because it's conducting

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.210 
liquid hydrogen because it's conducting
electricity<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.470> fact<00:03:09.740> that<00:03:09.890> the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
electricity so the fact that the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.640 
electricity so the fact that the
electrons<00:03:10.700> are<00:03:10.850> able<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.120> flow<00:03:11.240> freely<00:03:11.900> inside

electrons are able to flow freely inside

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.740 
electrons are able to flow freely inside
means<00:03:13.490> that<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.880> have<00:03:14.000> strong<00:03:14.300> electric

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
means that you can have strong electric

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.380 
means that you can have strong electric
currents<00:03:15.110> in<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.860> interior<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:16.460> Jupiter<00:03:16.610> and

currents in the interior of Jupiter and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.449 
currents in the interior of Jupiter and
whenever<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:18.080> have<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.350> fluid<00:03:18.800> that<00:03:19.190> has

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
whenever you have a fluid that has

whenever you have a fluid that has
strong<00:03:19.940> like<00:03:20.240> your<00:03:20.390> parents<00:03:20.870> then<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.680> will

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
strong like your parents then it will

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:30.850 
strong like your parents then it will
create<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.580> magnetic<00:03:23.420> field

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860
