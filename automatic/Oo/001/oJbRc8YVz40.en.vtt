and then I'm going to cut the other way
to<00:04:04.890> give<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> crisscross<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:07.739> now<00:04:07.920> take<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.580> away

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
to give a crisscross so now take it away

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.210 
to give a crisscross so now take it away
from<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.209> backing<00:04:09.569> paper<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:12.980> then<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.010> want

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
from the backing paper and then I want

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.509 
from the backing paper and then I want
to<00:04:14.370> lift<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:14.819> over<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.420> top<00:04:15.599> of<00:04:15.629> the<00:04:15.840> pie

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
to lift it over the top of the pie

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.189 
to lift it over the top of the pie
taking<00:04:17.519> care<00:04:17.729> not<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.970> stretch<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:18.690> too<00:04:18.930> much

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
taking care not to stretch it too much

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.159 
taking care not to stretch it too much
if<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.310> stretch<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.639> a<00:04:21.090> lot<00:04:21.329> then<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.079> will

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
if you stretch it a lot then it will

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.060 
if you stretch it a lot then it will
shrink<00:04:22.410> back<00:04:22.710> as<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.460> pie<00:04:23.639> is<00:04:23.699> cooking<00:04:24.979> so<00:04:25.979> I'm

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
shrink back as the pie is cooking so I'm

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.550 
shrink back as the pie is cooking so I'm
going<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.340> press<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.610> firmly<00:04:27.320> around<00:04:28.320> the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
going to press that firmly around the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.469 
going to press that firmly around the
edge<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:31.010> then<00:04:32.010> I<00:04:32.039> find<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.490> easiest<00:04:32.850> way<00:04:33.150> to

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
edge and then I find the easiest way to

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.990 
edge and then I find the easiest way to
get<00:04:33.930> rid<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.320> excess<00:04:34.740> is<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.310> cut<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.729> with

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
get rid of the excess is to cut it with

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.180 
get rid of the excess is to cut it with
a<00:04:36.060> pair<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.360> scissors<00:04:39.320> now<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.380> pass<00:04:40.860> from<00:04:41.039> the

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
a pair of scissors now to pass from the

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.890 
a pair of scissors now to pass from the
edge<00:04:41.310> I'm<00:04:41.550> going<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.760> press<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.030> on<00:04:42.270> my<00:04:42.389> finger

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
edge I'm going to press it on my finger

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.020 
edge I'm going to press it on my finger
and<00:04:43.250> use<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:45.180> knife

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
and use the knife

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:56.110 
and use the knife
just<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.990> cut<00:04:48.200> into<00:04:48.710> it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.090 

so<00:04:56.690> once<00:04:56.900> I've<00:04:57.139> gone<00:04:57.320> all<00:04:57.500> around<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.980> edge

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
so once I've gone all around the edge

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.790 
so once I've gone all around the edge
I'm<00:04:58.639> going<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.090> glaze<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.570> top<00:04:59.780> of<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.110> with

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
I'm going to glaze the top of it with

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.570 
I'm going to glaze the top of it with
some<00:05:01.010> beaten<00:05:01.370> egg<00:05:01.520> then<00:05:03.100> once<00:05:04.100> you've<00:05:04.280> glazed

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
some beaten egg then once you've glazed

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.460 
some beaten egg then once you've glazed
it<00:05:04.910> you<00:05:05.660> cut<00:05:05.900> two<00:05:06.169> holes<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.740> top<00:05:07.010> of<00:05:07.220> it

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
it you cut two holes in the top of it

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.780 
it you cut two holes in the top of it
and<00:05:09.470> these<00:05:09.680> allow<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.070> steam<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.729> escape

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
and these allow the steam to escape

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.240 
and these allow the steam to escape
while<00:05:11.330> it's<00:05:11.479> cooking<00:05:11.690> otherwise<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:13.010> might

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
while it's cooking otherwise you might

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.120 
while it's cooking otherwise you might
find<00:05:13.430> the<00:05:13.580> pastry<00:05:14.000> goes<00:05:14.180> soggy<00:05:14.830> so<00:05:15.830> I'm<00:05:15.919> going

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
find the pastry goes soggy so I'm going

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.439 
find the pastry goes soggy so I'm going
to<00:05:16.160> put<00:05:16.400> that<00:05:16.639> onto<00:05:17.600> a<00:05:18.110> baking<00:05:18.350> tray<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.449> into

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
to put that onto a baking tray and into

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.029 
to put that onto a baking tray and into
the<00:05:20.600> oven

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.629 

and<00:05:24.369> the<00:05:25.119> oven<00:05:25.389> is<00:05:25.539> fairly<00:05:25.839> hot<00:05:26.169> it's<00:05:26.639> 220

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
and the oven is fairly hot it's 220

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.299 
and the oven is fairly hot it's 220
degrees<00:05:27.969> centigrade<00:05:28.629> and<00:05:28.900> this<00:05:29.680> is<00:05:29.860> probably

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:30.309 
degrees centigrade and this is probably

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:34.109 
degrees centigrade and this is probably
going<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.580> take<00:05:30.759> about<00:05:30.789> 35<00:05:31.689> to<00:05:32.020> 45<00:05:32.529> minutes<00:05:33.119> so

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:34.119 
going to take about 35 to 45 minutes so

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:36.260 
going to take about 35 to 45 minutes so
that<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.419> pastry<00:05:34.629> is<00:05:35.020> nice<00:05:35.169> and<00:05:35.469> golden<00:05:35.949> and

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
that the pastry is nice and golden and

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.679 
that the pastry is nice and golden and
that<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.389> filling<00:05:37.689> is<00:05:37.809> bubbling<00:05:38.139> hot<00:05:39.569> so<00:05:40.569> the

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:40.689 
that the filling is bubbling hot so the

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:43.170 
that the filling is bubbling hot so the
fish<00:05:40.869> pie<00:05:41.139> is<00:05:41.199> ready<00:05:41.589> when<00:05:42.219> the<00:05:42.339> pastry<00:05:42.939> is

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
fish pie is ready when the pastry is

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.609 
fish pie is ready when the pastry is
nice<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.629> golden<00:05:45.869> so<00:05:46.869> I'm<00:05:46.960> going<00:05:47.139> to<00:05:47.229> take<00:05:47.439> it

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:47.619 
nice and golden so I'm going to take it

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:58.170 
nice and golden so I'm going to take it
out<00:05:47.740> of<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.159> oven<00:05:49.559> and<00:05:51.059> turn<00:05:52.059> the<00:05:52.240> oven<00:05:52.330> off

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.850 

and<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.300> serve<00:05:59.539> it<00:05:59.750> I<00:05:59.840> find<00:06:00.080> it's<00:06:00.229> easier<00:06:00.620> to

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
and to serve it I find it's easier to

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.620 
and to serve it I find it's easier to
use<00:06:00.889> a<00:06:01.460> knife<00:06:02.199> to<00:06:03.199> cut<00:06:03.229> through<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.800> pastry<00:06:07.630> to

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
use a knife to cut through the pastry to

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.320 
use a knife to cut through the pastry to
ease<00:06:08.810> it<00:06:09.050> off

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.999 

and<00:06:13.870> then<00:06:13.990> I'm<00:06:14.110> going<00:06:14.199> to<00:06:14.259> put<00:06:14.470> that<00:06:14.680> on<00:06:14.860> the

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
and then I'm going to put that on the

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:24.270 
and then I'm going to put that on the
plate<00:06:21.090> and<00:06:22.090> lift<00:06:22.360> it<00:06:22.539> up<00:06:22.830> while<00:06:23.830> I<00:06:23.860> put<00:06:24.159> the

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
plate and lift it up while I put the

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.700 
plate and lift it up while I put the
filling<00:06:24.580> underneath<00:06:25.000> it<00:06:25.300> so<00:06:26.229> this<00:06:26.379> is<00:06:26.530> nice

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
filling underneath it so this is nice

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.279
