00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the one thing I noticed about this this

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.710 
the one thing I noticed about this this
band<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> doesn't<00:01:35.939> move<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.299> lot<00:01:36.479> it's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
band is that it doesn't move a lot it's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.440 
band is that it doesn't move a lot it's
very<00:01:37.220> stationary<00:01:38.220> which<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.000> didn't<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.360> if

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
very stationary which I didn't know if

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.300 
very stationary which I didn't know if
i'd<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.869> first<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.770> seems

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
i'd like it first but it actually seems

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.440 
i'd like it first but it actually seems
like<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.820> tracks<00:01:42.689> better<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.290> steps<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
like it tracks better on steps and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.910 
like it tracks better on steps and
movement<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.810> moving<00:01:46.140> around<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.770> it's

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
movement it's not moving around so it's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.889 
movement it's not moving around so it's
able<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.159> track<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> lot<00:01:47.700> better<00:01:47.820> also<00:01:48.119> it

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
able to track a lot better also it

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.200 
able to track a lot better also it
doesn't<00:01:49.409> come<00:01:49.950> undone<00:01:50.280> one<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.610> my<00:01:50.700> things<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
