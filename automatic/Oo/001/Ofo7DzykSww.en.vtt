00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
remake of the GameCube game which

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.029 
remake of the GameCube game which
honestly<00:00:20.600> didn't<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:22.050> need<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.740> don't

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
honestly didn't really need it I don't

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.279 
honestly didn't really need it I don't
really<00:00:23.250> see<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> differences<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.019> think

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
really see the differences but I think

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.720 
really see the differences but I think
the<00:00:25.380> game<00:00:25.560> looked<00:00:25.830> fantastic<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the game looked fantastic on the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.689 
the game looked fantastic on the
GameCube<00:00:27.330> when<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.840> say<00:00:27.990> HD<00:00:28.529> remake<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.369> don't

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
GameCube when they say HD remake I don't

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.130 
GameCube when they say HD remake I don't
really<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> differences<00:00:30.660> other<00:00:30.929> than

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
really see the differences other than

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.830 
really see the differences other than
like<00:00:31.289> shading<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.090> grass<00:00:33.420> looks<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
like shading and like the grass looks a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600 
like shading and like the grass looks a
little<00:00:33.989> better<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.590> overall<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.340> doesn't

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
little better but overall it doesn't

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.280 
little better but overall it doesn't
really<00:00:35.820> feel<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.510> needed<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.989> updated

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
really feel like it needed to be updated

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.110 
really feel like it needed to be updated
but<00:00:37.770> there<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> noticeable<00:00:38.940> difference

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
but there is a noticeable difference

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.959 
but there is a noticeable difference
even<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.800> slight<00:00:41.250> would<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.850> be

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
even if it is very slight would you be

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.160 
even if it is very slight would you be
surprised<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.540> told<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:42.989> whole

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
surprised if I told you this whole

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
surprised if I told you this whole

Zelda<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.549> one<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.790> those<00:01:05.909> games<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.299> are

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
Zelda is one of those games that are

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
Zelda is one of those games that are
very<00:01:06.479> similar<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> previous<00:01:07.650> games<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
very similar to the previous games and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
very similar to the previous games and
overall<00:01:08.549> tone<00:01:08.850> yet<00:01:09.330> could<00:01:09.479> look<00:01:09.659> really

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
overall tone yet could look really

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.719 
overall tone yet could look really
different<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> best<00:01:11.280> things<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.640> I

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
different one of the best things that I

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.070 
different one of the best things that I
like<00:01:11.880> about<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.240> game<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> has

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
like about this game is that it has

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
like about this game is that it has
cel-shaded<00:01:13.860> graphics<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.700> only<00:01:15.000> does<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
cel-shaded graphics not only does it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120 
cel-shaded graphics not only does it
give<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.630> cartoonish<00:01:16.229> look<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.950> lets

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
give it a cartoonish look but it lets

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
give it a cartoonish look but it lets
Linc<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.640> expressions<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.509> mannerisms<00:01:18.689> we

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
Linc have expressions and mannerisms we

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.960 
Linc have expressions and mannerisms we
normally<00:01:19.680> don't<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.820> when

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
normally don't get to see you see when

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.789 
normally don't get to see you see when

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
versions but if I was to choose I would

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.520 
versions but if I was to choose I would
pick<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:48.970> HD<00:04:49.270> version<00:04:49.720> it's<00:04:49.930> an<00:04:50.050> improvement

over<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.280> original<00:04:51.340> game<00:04:51.910> definitely

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
over the original game definitely

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.659 
over the original game definitely
there's<00:04:52.870> no<00:04:53.050> doubts<00:04:53.380> about<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.370> think

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
there's no doubts about that so I think

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.760 
there's no doubts about that so I think
you<00:04:55.000> should<00:04:55.180> definitely<00:04:55.449> buy<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:56.080> now
