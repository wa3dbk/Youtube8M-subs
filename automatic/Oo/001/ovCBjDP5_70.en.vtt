00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 well u have the oldest let me remind in 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.680
 in a nutshell what is happening here 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.769
 here we are recording the series 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.440
 which I explain which models 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.930
 women's behavior leads them to 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.699
 undesirable results such 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 natural automatic models 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.439
 behaviors lead to success and how to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.279
 consciously influence people they need 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.369
 replace 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.460
 by some unnatural models 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.100
 then life will start immediately get me 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.860
 Now I list all the moments there 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.870
 models that you need to change means 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.440
 before you talked about the area 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.219
 relationship with a man but actually living 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.739
 it works on any level i have 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.079
 you are probably also interested in the topic of money 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.149
 and went talk about it in any 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 the absolute area is what you do on 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.149
 the machine can not lead you just by 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.729
 the definition of a feeling that 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.030
 man we have built with you 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.250
 some systems that keep us 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.040
 he is successful that is in ours with you 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.890
 the nervous system in the mental system 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.200
 here is the emotional system of protection 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.869
 nature i don't know works often say 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.320
 but this is a bunch of questions but it feels like 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.020
 there are certain reasons in us are sewn in 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.710
 our devices that do not allow 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.140
 us be successful if we could all 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.909
 on the machine will be successful all with you 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.110
 were successful but practice shows 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.250
 which is 97 percent 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.050
 live too after either three percent 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.090
 OK 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.800
 apparently us life universe nature us 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.710
 keeps from this apparently 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.870
 no matter how stressful we are 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.790
 allow to live 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.460
 relaxed life as if lazy 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.140
 work a little bad i don't know 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.810
 as arranged in general, then if you will 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.210
 Interestingly we with you then rummage 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.720
 and now we are with you Let us examine also still 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.730
 one model that leads us all to them 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.540
 first this model is related to money on 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.620
 all missing 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.610
 day we all have a terrible day 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.440
 natural behavior pattern which 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:31.870
 This model leads us to this 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:34.810
 spend all the money at once most 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.350
 people are completely natural to get 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:43.049
 money and quickly pull it all down 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:56.440
 somewhere to eat break through 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:59.530
 enjoy all the money well 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.030
 it is different to say this model 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.160
 may sound like spending more than 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.709
 you earn is equal from the mistakes 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.630
 which I constantly see people living 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.750
 seek to spend more than they 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.080
 have earned 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.350
 people tend to get more out of life 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.630
 than they invested in it that is a person 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.550
 again strive for more 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.730
 it turns out 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.070
 bring it to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.740
 concentrate on getting people 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:35.780
 check it out sit it all problems all of them 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:39.750
 grow from one grow from human 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.200
 that is, the natural and erroneous model 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.310
 behavior is also not immediately 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:50.180
 unnatural and correct model 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.180
 behaviors and it is competently managed 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:04:05.070
 you can control the microphone correctly 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.470
 photograph this is the devil with your brain 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.250
 either write down drilling payout understand 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.230
 that all of us are sewn up 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.090
 Naturally this is our sewn composition 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.239
 this is naturally our product 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.790
 thinking of doing this on the machine up 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.770
 this you think of we understand that 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:29.900
 it's right to do it yourself so 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:33.330
 Natural and need to think in order to 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.700
 unsuccessfully here these visions are successful if 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.000
 everything is clear to you then until the next 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.000
 video
