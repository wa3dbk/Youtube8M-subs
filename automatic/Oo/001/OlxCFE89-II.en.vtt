lot let's cover some of the advantages

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.500 
lot let's cover some of the advantages
of<00:05:07.950> wordpress<00:05:08.760> org<00:05:10.490> one<00:05:11.490> there's<00:05:11.790> no<00:05:12.060> limits

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
of wordpress org one there's no limits

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.090 
of wordpress org one there's no limits
it's<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:12.990> nice<00:05:13.490> big<00:05:14.490> advantage<00:05:15.450> and<00:05:16.080> by<00:05:17.040> no

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
it's a nice big advantage and by no

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.920 
it's a nice big advantage and by no
limits<00:05:17.640> I<00:05:17.760> mean<00:05:17.940> there's<00:05:18.120> no<00:05:18.330> limits<00:05:18.720> in<00:05:18.870> the

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
limits I mean there's no limits in the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.410 
limits I mean there's no limits in the
design<00:05:19.680> or<00:05:20.570> function<00:05:21.570> of<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:22.500> site<00:05:23.420> that's

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
design or function of the site that's

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.450 
design or function of the site that's
basically<00:05:24.840> because<00:05:25.290> for<00:05:25.530> design<00:05:25.860> WordPress

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
basically because for design WordPress

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.600 
basically because for design WordPress
uses<00:05:26.880> themes<00:05:27.480> and<00:05:27.900> for<00:05:28.830> functions<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.460> use

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
uses themes and for functions that use

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.390 
uses themes and for functions that use
plugins<00:05:30.000> which<00:05:30.510> we<00:05:30.690> will<00:05:30.810> cover<00:05:30.990> later<00:05:31.400> but

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
plugins which we will cover later but

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.250 
plugins which we will cover later but
there<00:05:32.640> are<00:05:32.670> thousands<00:05:33.420> of<00:05:33.480> these<00:05:33.660> out<00:05:33.960> there

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
there are thousands of these out there

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.380 
there are thousands of these out there
for<00:05:34.500> completely<00:05:34.920> free<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.550> they're<00:05:35.940> easy<00:05:36.180> to

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
for completely free and they're easy to

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.330 
for completely free and they're easy to
upload<00:05:36.600> so<00:05:37.020> it's<00:05:37.140> very<00:05:37.380> easy<00:05:37.590> to<00:05:37.740> change<00:05:38.040> the

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
upload so it's very easy to change the

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.370 
upload so it's very easy to change the
look<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.850> function<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:39.930> your<00:05:40.110> site
