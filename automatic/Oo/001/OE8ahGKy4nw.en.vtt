00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 

I<00:00:00.329> think<00:00:00.870> it's<00:00:01.020> taking<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> little<00:00:01.439> longer<00:00:01.560> than

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
I think it's taking a little longer than

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.619 
I think it's taking a little longer than
I<00:00:02.100> thought<00:00:02.129> it<00:00:02.370> was<00:00:02.639> I<00:00:02.879> didn't<00:00:03.090> realize<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.570> was

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
I thought it was I didn't realize I was

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.590 
I thought it was I didn't realize I was
getting<00:00:03.870> so<00:00:03.990> close<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.380> forward<00:00:04.710> here<00:00:05.040> so

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
getting so close to the forward here so

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.639 
getting so close to the forward here so
think<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.720> might<00:00:06.930> have<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.170> move<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.470> up<00:00:07.529> a

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
think I might have to move it up a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.799

I<00:02:55.900> can<00:02:56.110> get<00:02:56.290> open<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.890> might<00:02:57.220> be<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> little

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
I can get open that might be a little

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.800 
I can get open that might be a little
bit<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.970> challenge<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.690> know<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.319> I<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:01.720> I

look<00:03:50.680> at<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.920> -<00:03:50.950> but<00:03:51.600> this<00:03:52.600> thing<00:03:52.840> could<00:03:53.019> do

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
look at it - but this thing could do

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.210 
look at it - but this thing could do
with<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.350> nice<00:03:53.560> coat<00:03:53.950> of<00:03:53.980> oh<00:03:55.350> Anderson<00:03:56.350> for<00:03:56.739> 15
