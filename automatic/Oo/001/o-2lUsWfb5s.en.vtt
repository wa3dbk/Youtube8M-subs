00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hi to all to the room in this video 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.580
 we continue the series you are a real 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.259
 gta 5 player if you know you're a 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.700
 true gta player 5 if you know 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 the anecdote that follows the three 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.990
 main characters of gt5 michael 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.910
 franklin and trevor were first 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.920
 drawn for the story mode of GTA 5 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.330
 and it is only afterwards that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 rockstar had to find actors in 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.939
 the real life that looks like the three 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.320
 protagonists 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.820
 that's why michael 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.130
 franklin and dreamer does not look like 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.529
 perfectly to the three actors is to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.170
 the udc playing michael sharon fantino 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.059
 who plays franklin and steven masters who 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.350
 plays trevor so rockstar had first 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.239
 found the three characters in the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.070
 real life before drawing them for the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.809
 game it would look like them like two 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 drops of water so after having them 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.840
 drawn they had to find three guys 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.370
 they look like them I tell you 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.289
 not misery to find three actors 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.700
 who look like them who agree to 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.530
 play these roles and especially that they are 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.730
 good in these roles so why 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.770
 rockstar decided to choose them 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.030
 looks simply for that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.010
 the voices of the characters in the game 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 be the most authentic possible 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 I find that they have rather succeeded on 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.899
 this shot there the tracks correspond 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.489
 rather well to the three characters by 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.070
 against i have a little trouble with michael 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.049
 who I find does not really look like 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.189
 for franklin traver is already a small 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.630
 little more tunes of resemblance 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.430
 even if we are not in 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.020
 total authenticity 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.369
 but from a general point of view when they 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.470
 met all three together it 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.820
 recognizes them well so it goes from one 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.100
 true gta players 5 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.390
 if you know the before gta 5 ie 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.200
 during the three years that preceded 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.909
 the output of gta 5 on ps3 and xbox 360 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.979
 michael franklin and trevor finally born of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.439
 luxury lime-bottoms barrels and steven 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.479
 org created the scenes of gta 5 during 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.799
 three years in fact for three years they 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.270
 had to play the roles of 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.100
 michael franklin and very much for 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.200
 each story mode scene in 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.329
 which characters appear and 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.460
 all thanks to the help of motion capture 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.140
 that they actually had all over the body 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.390
 they had to reproduce the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.780
 cascades the dialogues the behaviors 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.970
 of each one 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.890
 but all that without going into excess 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.600
 when he throws a plane for example and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.159
 which is an explosion they appeal to 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.479
 special effects he does not really know 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.950
 thrown from the plane in full flight 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.180
 but you understood all the scenes 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.829
 were made by the three actors 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.570
 in real life I show you a 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.189
 example with this scene that me 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.689
 will chain for the 3rd later 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.729
 real gta 5 players if you know of 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.140
 this episode looks at this scene I you 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.410
 does not put it in full but only the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.120
 mans 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.950
 what interests us is a real 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.110
 gta 5 player if you know the anecdote 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.120
 this scene actually would trevor 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.860
 not had stumbled on the barrier he 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.080
 should not have fallen all was 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.910
 improvised during this scene steven 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.020
 mastiffs who embodied anticipate had to pass 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.380
 above the barrier but it is 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.900
 falls 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.480
 suddenly franklin aka sharon fonteneau 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.520
 split his mouth and stephen hough 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.110
 improvised a scene of nervousness then 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.030
 they have resumed dialogue where he 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.980
 had to start at the base everything was 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.660
 kept the Seine was deemed perfect for 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.970
 the scenario even though it was not planned 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.830
 it's really nice to see that kind of 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.120
 things that allows us to see that 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.100
 I was at 5.1 not been done so 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.480
 robotic but we can see that the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.340
 actors took pleasure in doing it 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.870
 with natural reactions that have 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.790
 surely allowed to make the game more 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.230
 Really it's a pity that rockstar is 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.910
 not create a little movie or a simple 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.110
 video to show us the scenes 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.460
 missed but in real life or even 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.170
 the scenes have failed so we have a 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.670
 idea of ​​how it's going in the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.080
 recording studios 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.730
 this is the end of this episode we are 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.800
 find again very quickly for another episode 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.360
 2 is a real player throw to 5 if you 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.160
 know I still have things to you 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.990
 to discover available in English only 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.740
 that's all for this video and I 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.370
 tell you just now 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.370
