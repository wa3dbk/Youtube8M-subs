00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
look look at the quality of them and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.680 
look look at the quality of them and
start<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.769> choose<00:02:28.069> which<00:02:28.940> ones<00:02:29.209> we<00:02:29.360> want<00:02:29.390> for

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
start to choose which ones we want for

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.199 
start to choose which ones we want for
the<00:02:29.750> feature<00:02:30.489> that's<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.580> particularly<00:02:31.940> nice

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
the feature that's a particularly nice

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.940 
the feature that's a particularly nice
picture<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.930> use<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.260> features<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
picture to use the features in the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.129 
picture to use the features in the
countryside<00:02:34.480> that's<00:02:35.480> another<00:02:35.689> scenic

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
countryside that's another scenic

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.349 
countryside that's another scenic
picture<00:02:36.650> with<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> nice<00:02:37.549> waiting<00:02:37.999> room<00:02:38.180> on

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
picture with the nice waiting room on

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.160 
picture with the nice waiting room on
the<00:02:38.450> right<00:02:38.569> hand<00:02:38.779> side<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the right hand side and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
the right hand side and
is<00:02:40.200> another<00:02:40.440> important<00:02:41.010> shot<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:41.370> need<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.640> use

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
is another important shot we need to use

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.190 
is another important shot we need to use
because<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.510> end<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.750> line<00:02:42.900> however

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
because this is the end of line however

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.920 
because this is the end of line however
it's<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.770> little<00:02:44.010> bit<00:02:44.130> dark<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.300> right-hand

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
it's a little bit dark on the right-hand

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.870 
it's a little bit dark on the right-hand
side<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.770> what<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.040> will<00:02:47.099> do<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.400> get<00:02:47.610> one<00:02:47.730> of

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
side so what we will do is get one of

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.800 
side so what we will do is get one of
the<00:02:48.060> three<00:02:48.870> protein<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.500> actually<00:02:49.830> adjust<00:02:50.130> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
the three protein to actually adjust the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.180 
the three protein to actually adjust the
levels<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.989> contrast<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.800> get<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> better

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
levels and the contrast to get a better

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.059 
levels and the contrast to get a better
balance<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.940> picture<00:02:54.920> what's<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.010> best

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
balance of a picture what's the best

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.770 
balance of a picture what's the best
thing<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.400> do<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.760> one<00:02:56.940> magazine<00:02:57.150> okay

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
thing to do on this one magazine okay

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.809 
thing to do on this one magazine okay
sometimes<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.860> can<00:02:58.980> actually<00:02:59.069> isolate<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
sometimes you can actually isolate the

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.600 
sometimes you can actually isolate the
areas<00:03:00.180> who<00:03:00.330> actually<00:03:00.540> want<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.319> change<00:03:02.100> but<00:03:02.459> in

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
areas who actually want to change but in

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.949 
areas who actually want to change but in
this<00:03:02.730> case<00:03:03.000> because<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.420> whole<00:03:03.569> picture<00:03:03.780> is

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
this case because the whole picture is

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.540 
this case because the whole picture is
quite<00:03:04.230> dark<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.739> shadow<00:03:04.950> area<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.430> can

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
quite dark in the shadow area you can

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.509 
quite dark in the shadow area you can
use<00:03:05.670> shadow<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.120> highlight<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.370> bring<00:03:08.370> that

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
use shadow and highlight and bring that

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.520 
use shadow and highlight and bring that
out<00:03:08.610> quite<00:03:09.090> substantially<00:03:09.840> as<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.230> can<00:03:10.349> see

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
out quite substantially as you can see

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.440 
out quite substantially as you can see
there<00:03:10.769> yeah<00:03:11.280> yeah<00:03:11.819> that's<00:03:12.000> going<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.300> it

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
there yeah yeah that's going to it

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.300 
there yeah yeah that's going to it
that's<00:03:12.870> not<00:03:13.019> been<00:03:13.170> over<00:03:13.380> exposed<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.069> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
that's not been over exposed to that the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.729 
that's not been over exposed to that the
left-hand<00:03:14.850> side<00:03:14.940> though<00:03:15.180> oh<00:03:15.750> no<00:03:16.019> it'll<00:03:16.440> I

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
left-hand side though oh no it'll I

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.130 
left-hand side though oh no it'll I
select<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.340> highlighted<00:03:17.670> areas<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.420> G<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:18.959> as

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
select the highlighted areas in G but as

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.890 
select the highlighted areas in G but as
it<00:03:19.500> was<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.069> you're<00:03:20.610> jumping<00:03:21.000> from<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.420> to

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
it was so you're jumping from that to

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.870 
it was so you're jumping from that to
that<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.350> can't<00:03:23.010> go<00:03:23.100> into<00:03:23.220> more<00:03:23.430> detail<00:03:23.760> and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
that I can't go into more detail and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.789 
that I can't go into more detail and
bring<00:03:24.030> out<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.239> front<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.569> Train<00:03:25.019> yeah<00:03:25.560> a

shadows and sunlight just to make them

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.229 
shadows and sunlight just to make them
easier<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.720> look<00:03:36.959> at<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:38.370> previous<00:03:38.700> programs

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239

something<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> little<00:03:44.760> different<00:03:45.150> we<00:03:46.079> thought

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
something a little different we thought

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.720 
something a little different we thought
it'd<00:03:46.380> be<00:03:46.440> nice<00:03:46.650> idea<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.220> feature<00:03:47.549> the
