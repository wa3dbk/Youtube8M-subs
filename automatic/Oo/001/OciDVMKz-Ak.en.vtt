power base except you you don't want the

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.630 
power base except you you don't want the
feet<00:03:04.560> too<00:03:04.769> wide<00:03:04.980> because<00:03:05.220> it's<00:03:05.489> going<00:03:05.579> to

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.670 
feet too wide because it's going to
minimize<00:03:06.060> all<00:03:06.720> right<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.049> explosiveness<00:03:07.560> of

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
minimize all right the explosiveness of

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.199 
minimize all right the explosiveness of
power<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.099> can<00:03:08.340> generate<00:03:08.700> from<00:03:08.909> your<00:03:09.060> hips
