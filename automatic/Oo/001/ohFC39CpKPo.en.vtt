00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
what can you was there a sense of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.680 
what can you was there a sense of
urgency<00:00:41.430> from<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> beginning<00:00:42.149> from<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
urgency from the beginning from the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.910 
urgency from the beginning from the
outset<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.770> that's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
outset is that you think that that's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.040 
outset is that you think that that's
what<00:00:44.129> Kerry<00:00:44.370> carried<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.270> team<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.870> know<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
what Kerry carried the team you know you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
what Kerry carried the team you know you
went<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.289> 14<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> start<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.430> biscuit<00:00:47.760> kick

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
went out 14 for to start a biscuit kick

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.549 
went out 14 for to start a biscuit kick
home<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:48.390> there<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.320> needed

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
home from there I just think we needed

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.650 
home from there I just think we needed
to<00:00:49.710> execute<00:00:50.010> playoff<00:00:50.910> Stella<00:00:51.180> basketball

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to execute playoff Stella basketball

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.580 
to execute playoff Stella basketball
defend<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.289> rebound<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.640> box<00:00:53.879> out<00:00:54.590> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
defend and rebound you know box out and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.750 
defend and rebound you know box out and
everything<00:00:56.010> else<00:00:56.160> will<00:00:56.280> take<00:00:56.309> care<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.610> itself

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
everything else will take care of itself

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.540 
everything else will take care of itself
I<00:00:57.059> mean<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.870> held<00:00:58.050> them<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
I mean I think we held them to a

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.529 
I mean I think we held them to a
percentage<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.789> were<00:00:59.910> happy<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
percentage that we were happy with this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.680 
percentage that we were happy with this
is<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.379> second<00:01:01.739> chance<00:01:01.949> points<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.690> you

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
is that the second chance points and you

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
is that the second chance points and you
know<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.140> offensive<00:01:04.530> rebounders<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.309> that

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
know the offensive rebounders was that

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.740 
know the offensive rebounders was that
really<00:01:05.640> harvest<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.600> tonight

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
really harvest and I think tonight

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.080 
really harvest and I think tonight
energy<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.770> effort<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.159> mean<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.760> crowd<00:01:08.970> was

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
energy and effort I mean the crowd was

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.950 
energy and effort I mean the crowd was
phenomenal<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.810> us<00:01:09.900> tonight<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.950> really

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
phenomenal for us tonight so we really

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.270 
phenomenal for us tonight so we really
fed<00:01:12.960> off<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> beginning<00:01:13.830> room

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
fed off of that in the beginning room

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.300 
fed off of that in the beginning room
and<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:15.390> were<00:01:15.479> able<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> sustain<00:01:15.900> their<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:17.040> run

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and we were able to sustain their to run

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.649
