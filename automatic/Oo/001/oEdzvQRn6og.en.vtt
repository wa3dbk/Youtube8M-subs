00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.390
 think yourself seven weeks without wrong 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.560
 certainties 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.620
 fast action 7 weeks without 2014 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.300
 How stupid can you be if 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.040
 My fast action calls itself thinking 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.439
 you are starving yourself 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.410
 Drink less alcohol that is 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.970
 how do you think yourself well? 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.009
 Protestant fast action is one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.180
 evangelical fast action starts from 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.370
 fasting the word 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.350
 that is a kind of high german word and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239
 means to close 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.789
 decide to meet us in the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.949
 English almost news items close 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.739
 please their god airborne for so 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.930
 this time these 40 days the jesus 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.670
 used in the desert too 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 But consider the difficult way 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.989
 his father reminds him of or 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.969
 but that can be trusted if that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.920
 can fold 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.829
 These 40 days we use today 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.559
 this is what the fast action looks like to people 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.170
 check which nonsense weakness 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.120
 weaken which strange sides themselves 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.200
 to creep into our lives and what we do 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.810
 should change urgently 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.479
 we noticed that many of us 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.689
 People say what's right and what's wrong 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.310
 is counselor banks parties all say 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.390
 That's the way to go and go away 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 that we always with and we should 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.820
 but think about it a bit 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.409
 the great figures of christianity 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.350
 also made martin luther among others 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.649
 have you used your head yourself 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.070
 and have asked can it be because it is 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.640
 it looked like that and then it 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.500
 in fact a certainty is the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.270
 For example , it is justified in the word 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.750
 founded by faith hope love 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.200
 or if it is a baggy and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.060
 urgently the criticism below demand 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.740
 is a needy story and there it can 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.560
 Of course, that one still says yes 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.229
 We are from the story 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.000
 convinced it is so we go with it 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.530
 But may be from a season only friends 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.620
 we would have to go alone 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.390
 other way this question to each other 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.160
 discussing with each other discussing 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.830
 also in fasting circle with 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.620
 church communities this is the project 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.269
 seven weeks without 20 14 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.549
 is a suggestion you can also do something 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.239
 completely different make yourself think yourself 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.040
 decide 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.330
 but we are happy if you look for 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.330
 decide our fast action
