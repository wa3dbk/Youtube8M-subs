 Hello, how am I similar this time? 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 I bring what I like to call mini 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.300
 tutorials that are small functions 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.770
 useful of our device the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.349
 following tutorials are not compatible 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.590
 with the version of samsung galaxy ace 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.899
 s5830 let's start number 1 take captures 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 The method is very simple 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.559
 for this we will use the home button and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.559
 the power button 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.790
 now to make the capture we press 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.790
 the home button and immediately 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.489
 we press the power button we will listen 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.050
 this sound which tells us that it has 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.520
 captured 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.520
 here another example 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.809
 again to make the capture 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.760
 we press the home button and 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.760
 we immediately press power 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.009
 you can find the catches in the 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.009
 multimedia gallery 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 who believe capture 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.480
 inside you will find all the captures 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.480
 what do you do 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.770
 number 2 reset factory data is 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.290
 a process by which we will perform 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.240
 a general erasure and a restoration to 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.760
 the factory settings of the device 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.730
 that means we will lose all 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.850
 the installed applications for it 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.170
 we must access the recovery mode we leave 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.170

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.560
 power 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.050
 and home 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 without letting go, we hope that you enter 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.920
 recovery mode 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.380
 already within the recovery we select 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.450

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.739
 we press home 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.650

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.459
 and ready will come data uip complete as 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.150
