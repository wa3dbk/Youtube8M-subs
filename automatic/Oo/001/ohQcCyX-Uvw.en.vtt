well at the end of the summer the manure

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.769 
well at the end of the summer the manure
lagoons<00:00:05.160> are<00:00:05.609> starting<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.970> fill<00:00:06.180> up<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.509> can't

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
lagoons are starting to fill up I can't

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.280 
lagoons are starting to fill up I can't
wait<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.020> get<00:00:07.109> started<00:00:07.290> oh<00:00:08.269> it's<00:00:09.269> too<00:00:09.690> early<00:00:09.719> to

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
wait to get started oh it's too early to

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.830 
wait to get started oh it's too early to
spread<00:00:10.740> manure<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.340> fall<00:00:11.610> well<00:00:12.030> it's<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
spread manure this fall well it's a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.169 
spread manure this fall well it's a
little<00:00:13.049> bit<00:00:13.290> early<00:00:13.620> yet<00:00:13.799> but<00:00:14.009> there's<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> lot

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
little bit early yet but there's a lot

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.060 
little bit early yet but there's a lot
to<00:00:15.360> get<00:00:15.509> done<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.440> might<00:00:16.619> have<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.890> get

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
to get done so you might have to get

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.460 
to get done so you might have to get
started<00:00:17.430> pretty<00:00:17.970> quick<00:00:18.359> well<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
started pretty quick well this is the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.109 
started pretty quick well this is the
whole<00:00:19.650> thing<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.250> comes<00:00:20.460> down<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.910> there

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
whole thing that it comes down to there

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.880 
whole thing that it comes down to there
are<00:00:21.330> manure<00:00:21.810> lagoons<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.380> are<00:00:22.470> starting<00:00:22.800> to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
are manure lagoons that are starting to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.290 
are manure lagoons that are starting to
fill<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.400> people<00:00:23.640> want<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> get<00:00:24.150> going

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
fill up and people want to get going

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.880 
fill up and people want to get going
spreading<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.930> manure<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.439> today<00:00:25.680> we're

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
spreading that manure but today we're

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.980 
spreading that manure but today we're
going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> discuss<00:00:26.580> how<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.000> minimize<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
going to discuss how to minimize the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
going to discuss how to minimize the
smell<00:00:28.439> from<00:00:28.740> your<00:00:28.830> manure<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.519> how<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
smell from your manure and how to

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.240 
smell from your manure and how to
maximize<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.810> nutrient<00:00:31.380> gain<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
maximize the nutrient gain and the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.280 
maximize the nutrient gain and the
overall<00:00:32.550> yield<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.600> you're<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.110> have

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
overall yield that you're going to have

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.810 
overall yield that you're going to have
on<00:00:34.559> your<00:00:34.950> farm<00:00:35.190> when<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.610> talk<00:00:35.790> about

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
on your farm when you talk about

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.180 
on your farm when you talk about
minimizing<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.780> smell<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> little<00:00:37.710> bit<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
minimizing that smell a little bit you

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.680 
minimizing that smell a little bit you
may<00:00:38.309> think<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.059> about<00:00:39.329> neighbor

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
may think this is all about neighbor

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.690 
may think this is all about neighbor
relations<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.399> big

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
relations and that is a really big

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310 
relations and that is a really big
important<00:00:42.420> thing<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.899> don't<00:00:42.989> want<00:00:43.200> your

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
important thing you don't want your

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.229 
important thing you don't want your
neighbors<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:44.040> upset<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:44.430> you're

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
neighbors to be all upset because you're

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.639 
neighbors to be all upset because you're
spreading<00:00:45.629> manure<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.050> stinking<00:00:46.530> up

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
spreading manure and it's stinking up

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.190 
spreading manure and it's stinking up
the<00:00:46.860> area<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> long<00:00:47.879> period<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.539> time<00:00:48.780> but

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the area for a long period of time but

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900 
the area for a long period of time but
what<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.680> concerned<00:00:49.920> about<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.700> in

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
what I'm really concerned about and in

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790 
what I'm really concerned about and in
addition<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.840> keeping<00:00:52.680> those

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
addition to that is keeping those

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.920 
addition to that is keeping those
nutrients<00:00:53.370> where<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.850> want<00:00:54.090> them<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.510> your

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
nutrients where we want them in your

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.810 
nutrients where we want them in your
soils<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.070> about<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.460> smell

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
soils when you think about the smell

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.209 
soils when you think about the smell
from<00:00:57.149> manure<00:00:57.480> you're<00:00:57.899> smelling<00:00:58.230> ammonia<00:00:59.070> in

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
from manure you're smelling ammonia in

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.490 
from manure you're smelling ammonia in
most<00:00:59.430> cases<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.449> nitrogen<00:01:00.989> that's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
most cases that is nitrogen that's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.680 
most cases that is nitrogen that's
leaving<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.370> ground<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.090> don't<00:01:03.120> want<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
leaving your ground you don't want that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.969 
leaving your ground you don't want that
that's<00:01:03.960> why<00:01:04.110> we're<00:01:04.290> spreading<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> manure

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that's why we're spreading the manure

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.980 
that's why we're spreading the manure
out<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> field<00:01:05.640> anyway<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.600> want<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> keep

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
out in the field anyway we want to keep

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
out in the field anyway we want to keep
as<00:01:07.140> much<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> nitrogen<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> soil<00:01:08.549> as

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
as much of that nitrogen in the soil as

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.510 
as much of that nitrogen in the soil as
we<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> timing<00:01:10.229> plays<00:01:10.619> into<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.010> big

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
we can and timing plays into that big

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.190 
we can and timing plays into that big
time<00:01:11.760> when<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.210> talking<00:01:12.540> about<00:01:12.570> spreading

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
time when you're talking about spreading

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.160 
time when you're talking about spreading
manure<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.860> late<00:01:14.640> August<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.570> still<00:01:15.900> pretty

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
manure in late August it's still pretty

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
manure in late August it's still pretty
warm<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:17.070> still<00:01:17.369> humid<00:01:17.880> you're<00:01:18.060> still

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
warm it's still humid you're still

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330 
warm it's still humid you're still
getting<00:01:18.450> rains<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.259> soil<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.799> really<00:01:19.979> warm

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
getting rains the soil is really warm

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.880 
getting rains the soil is really warm
that<00:01:20.790> fertility<00:01:21.150> some<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> be

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that fertility some of it is going to be

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800 
that fertility some of it is going to be
lost<00:01:23.130> by<00:01:23.700> putting<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.450> early

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
lost by putting it out this early

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.359 
lost by putting it out this early
that's<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.200> Branton<00:01:25.500> gives<00:01:25.680> me<00:01:25.860> such<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> hard

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that's what Branton gives me such a hard

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.830 
that's what Branton gives me such a hard
time<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.030> too<00:01:27.210> excited<00:01:27.780> about

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
time not to get too excited about

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.730 
time not to get too excited about
spreading<00:01:28.290> manure

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
spreading manure

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.130 
spreading manure
well<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.430> we're<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
well what we're really going for here is

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.469 
well what we're really going for here is
it's<00:01:31.920> nice<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.549> spread<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> manure<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
it's nice to spread the manure and you

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.090 
it's nice to spread the manure and you
can<00:01:33.630> look<00:01:33.810> at<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> waste<00:01:34.500> product<00:01:34.829> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
can look at it as a waste product and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.010 
can look at it as a waste product and
maybe<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.700> your<00:01:35.820> farm<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> look<00:01:36.900> at

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
maybe you do on your farm but I look at

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469 
maybe you do on your farm but I look at
manure<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.799> best<00:01:38.130> fertilizer<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.060> there

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
manure is the best fertilizer that there

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.960 
manure is the best fertilizer that there
is<00:01:39.659> we've<00:01:40.020> tried<00:01:40.320> many<00:01:40.710> times<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.250> match<00:01:41.670> up

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
is we've tried many times to match up

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.319 
is we've tried many times to match up
exactly<00:01:42.869> what's<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.649> manure<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.700> commercial

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
exactly what's in manure with commercial

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.639 
exactly what's in manure with commercial
fertilizer<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.020> mean<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
fertilizer I mean with the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.130 
fertilizer I mean with the
micronutrients<00:01:47.189> sulfur<00:01:47.970> everything<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.930> we

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
micronutrients sulfur everything and we

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.139 
micronutrients sulfur everything and we
just<00:01:49.170> can't<00:01:49.619> equal<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> yield<00:01:50.490> gains<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.030> we

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
just can't equal the yield gains that we

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.999 
just can't equal the yield gains that we
can<00:01:51.390> when<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.899> manure<00:01:52.229> because<00:01:52.829> there

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
can when we have manure because there

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.440 
can when we have manure because there
are<00:01:53.130> other<00:01:53.280> things<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> just

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
are other things in there that I just

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.300 
are other things in there that I just
don't<00:01:54.780> think<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> great<00:01:56.040> grasp

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
don't think we really have a great grasp

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.060 
don't think we really have a great grasp
on<00:01:56.610> things<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.000> bacteria<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.960> fungi<00:01:58.829> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
on things like bacteria and fungi a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.490 
on things like bacteria and fungi a
number<00:01:59.790> of<00:02:00.090> things<00:02:00.360> including<00:02:00.659> organic

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
number of things including organic

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
number of things including organic
matter<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.399> really<00:02:02.729> help<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> crop

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
matter that can really help out a crop

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.020 
matter that can really help out a crop
so<00:02:03.960> what<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> comes<00:02:04.740> down<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.700> Darin

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
so what it comes down to and what Darin

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.059 
so what it comes down to and what Darin
was<00:02:06.180> getting<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.860> this

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
was getting at here is with this

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.249 
was getting at here is with this
nitrogen<00:02:08.879> that's<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> manure<00:02:09.690> talking

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
nitrogen that's in the manure talking

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.320 
nitrogen that's in the manure talking
about<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.679> one<00:02:11.069> nutrient<00:02:11.670> specifically

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
about that one nutrient specifically

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.890 
about that one nutrient specifically
nitrogen<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.319> pretty

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
nitrogen is pretty

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.390 
nitrogen is pretty
Chabot<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.439> other<00:02:14.560> words<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:14.890> can<00:02:14.980> move<00:02:15.189> down

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
Chabot in other words it can move down

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.390 
Chabot in other words it can move down
in<00:02:15.670> soil<00:02:15.939> with<00:02:16.150> water<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.750> also<00:02:16.959> can<00:02:17.560> denied

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
in soil with water it also can denied

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.699 
in soil with water it also can denied
Rifai<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.030> go<00:02:19.180> up<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.689> air<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.230> can<00:02:20.500> be

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
Rifai and go up in the air it can be

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.920 
Rifai and go up in the air it can be
ammonia<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.700> when<00:02:21.939> it's<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.239> form<00:02:22.420> it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
ammonia and when it's in that form it

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.199 
ammonia and when it's in that form it
does<00:02:23.230> have<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> tremendous<00:02:24.459> smell<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.030> we

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
does have a tremendous smell and we

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.270 
does have a tremendous smell and we
don't<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:25.569> that<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.110> what<00:02:26.409> we<00:02:26.439> suggest<00:02:26.769> to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
don't like that so what we suggest to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.000 
don't like that so what we suggest to
farmers<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.970> getting<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.629> manure<00:02:28.989> down<00:02:29.260> deep

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
farmers is getting that manure down deep

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.580 
farmers is getting that manure down deep
injecting<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.909> into<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.540> soil<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.230> let's<00:02:32.439> talk

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
injecting it into the soil so let's talk

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.050 
injecting it into the soil so let's talk
about<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.159> a<00:02:33.310> little<00:02:33.430> bit<00:02:33.549> so<00:02:33.939> we're

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
about that just a little bit so we're

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.270 
about that just a little bit so we're
talking<00:02:34.239> about<00:02:34.540> using<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.109> liquid<00:02:35.590> manure<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.189> a

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
talking about using a liquid manure in a

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.460 
talking about using a liquid manure in a
field<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.180> best<00:02:37.510> way<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.780> do<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.200> rather

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
field and the best way to do that rather

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.289 
field and the best way to do that rather
than<00:02:38.769> spreading<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.400> top<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.670> then<00:02:39.970> trying

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
than spreading it on top and then trying

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.839 
than spreading it on top and then trying
to<00:02:40.390> till<00:02:40.659> it<00:02:40.689> in<00:02:40.930> later<00:02:41.290> or<00:02:41.590> even<00:02:41.890> spreading<00:02:42.760> it

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
to till it in later or even spreading it

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.819 
to till it in later or even spreading it
on<00:02:42.939> top<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.239> trying<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.109> be<00:02:44.230> right<00:02:44.590> behind

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
on top and trying to be right behind

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.680 
on top and trying to be right behind
with<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> tillage<00:02:45.760> tool<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:46.359> the<00:02:46.420> best

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
with the tillage tool for the best

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.410 
with the tillage tool for the best
utilization<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.819> fertilizer<00:02:48.819> manure

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
utilization of that fertilizer manure

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.020 
utilization of that fertilizer manure
you<00:02:49.840> want<00:02:50.109> to<00:02:50.200> deep<00:02:50.409> inject<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.099> product<00:02:51.579> say

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
you want to deep inject that product say

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.750 
you want to deep inject that product say
6<00:02:52.420> inches<00:02:52.810> 8<00:02:53.049> inches<00:02:53.500> 12<00:02:53.829> inches<00:02:54.010> down<00:02:54.459> we've

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
6 inches 8 inches 12 inches down we've

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.479 
6 inches 8 inches 12 inches down we've
even<00:02:55.060> done<00:02:55.180> some<00:02:55.510> 24<00:02:56.260> inches<00:02:56.709> deep<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:57.159> said

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
even done some 24 inches deep I said

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.280 
even done some 24 inches deep I said
wait<00:02:57.609> a<00:02:57.700> minute<00:02:57.730> 24<00:02:58.329> that's<00:02:58.569> kind<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.870> crazy

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
wait a minute 24 that's kind of crazy

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.500 
wait a minute 24 that's kind of crazy
yeah<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.859> is<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.010> little<00:03:00.189> bit<00:03:00.430> deep<00:03:00.700> but<00:03:01.329> what

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
yeah that is a little bit deep but what

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.149 
yeah that is a little bit deep but what
we're<00:03:01.689> mainly<00:03:02.079> trying<00:03:02.349> to<00:03:02.439> do<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.769> get<00:03:02.920> some

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
we're mainly trying to do is get some

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.280 
we're mainly trying to do is get some
soil<00:03:03.400> over<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.150> top<00:03:04.389> of<00:03:04.599> where<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.930> manure

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
soil over the top of where that manure

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.460 
soil over the top of where that manure
is<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.760> we've<00:03:06.939> got<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.209> barrier<00:03:07.840> there<00:03:08.230> so

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
is so that we've got a barrier there so

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.649 
is so that we've got a barrier there so
the<00:03:08.620> fertility<00:03:08.950> doesn't<00:03:09.549> leave<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:10.090> nitrogen

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
the fertility doesn't leave a nitrogen

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.089 
the fertility doesn't leave a nitrogen
will<00:03:10.870> move<00:03:11.079> around<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.620> soil<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:11.980> little

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
will move around in the soil a little

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.429 
will move around in the soil a little
bit<00:03:12.340> but<00:03:12.639> with<00:03:12.879> a<00:03:12.909> protective<00:03:13.629> cover<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:14.139> soil

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
bit but with a protective cover of soil

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.199 
bit but with a protective cover of soil
over<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.769> top<00:03:15.069> you'll<00:03:15.519> contain<00:03:15.909> the<00:03:16.030> smell

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
over the top you'll contain the smell

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.569 
over the top you'll contain the smell
and<00:03:16.659> you'll<00:03:16.959> contain<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.470> fertility<00:03:17.949> value

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
and you'll contain the fertility value

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.490 
and you'll contain the fertility value
of<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:19.000> manure<00:03:19.359> and<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:19.629> reason<00:03:20.169> why<00:03:20.260> we

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
of that manure and the reason why we

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.220 
of that manure and the reason why we
want<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:20.980> deep<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.400> not<00:03:21.639> just<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.780> have<00:03:23.169> a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
want it so deep is not just to have a

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.960 
want it so deep is not just to have a
covering<00:03:23.829> over<00:03:23.949> the<00:03:24.160> top<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.609> it's<00:03:24.760> also

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
covering over the top of it it's also

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.930 
covering over the top of it it's also
because<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:25.989> want<00:03:26.199> to<00:03:26.290> have<00:03:26.500> roots<00:03:27.010> moving

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
because we want to have roots moving

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.059 
because we want to have roots moving
down<00:03:28.180> further<00:03:28.629> in<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:28.989> soil<00:03:29.290> what<00:03:29.680> we<00:03:29.799> find

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
down further in the soil what we find

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.099 
down further in the soil what we find
very<00:03:30.310> often<00:03:30.549> throughout<00:03:31.090> our<00:03:31.329> entire<00:03:31.480> country

very often throughout our entire country

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.080 
very often throughout our entire country
is<00:03:32.349> we've<00:03:32.769> got<00:03:33.040> pretty<00:03:33.340> good<00:03:33.459> fertility

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
is we've got pretty good fertility

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.970 
is we've got pretty good fertility

the next 6 inches deep it's may be
marginal<00:03:38.889> you<00:03:39.159> get<00:03:39.340> down<00:03:39.519> from<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.209> 12<00:03:40.569> inch

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.159 
lousy we don't have a lot of nutrients
there<00:03:45.430> which<00:03:45.909> means<00:03:46.239> we're<00:03:46.540> not<00:03:46.720> gonna<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:47.139> a

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
there which means we're not gonna have a

lot of root growth down there either

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.490 
lot of root growth down there either
well<00:03:49.120> if<00:03:49.389> we're<00:03:49.629> gonna<00:03:49.690> get<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.049> very<00:03:50.379> most

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
well if we're gonna get the very most

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.559 
well if we're gonna get the very most
out<00:03:51.099> of<00:03:51.159> every<00:03:51.459> acre<00:03:51.609> we've<00:03:51.879> got<00:03:52.090> we've<00:03:52.329> got<00:03:52.479> to

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
out of every acre we've got we've got to

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.539

have a lot of root growth down deep in

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.219 
have a lot of root growth down deep in
the<00:03:54.639> soil<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:55.060> also<00:03:55.209> just<00:03:55.479> think<00:03:55.720> about<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.049> if

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
the soil and also just think about it if

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.099 
the soil and also just think about it if
we've<00:03:56.440> got<00:03:56.650> water<00:03:57.430> late<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.359> season<00:03:58.569> that

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
we've got water late in the season that

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.759 
we've got water late in the season that
we<00:03:59.260> can<00:03:59.409> access<00:03:59.979> down<00:04:00.280> 12<00:04:00.699> to<00:04:00.819> 24<00:04:01.209> inches<00:04:01.419> deep

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
we can access down 12 to 24 inches deep

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.839 
we can access down 12 to 24 inches deep
once<00:04:02.769> it'd<00:04:02.889> been<00:04:03.040> kind<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.400> nice<00:04:03.549> if<00:04:03.729> we<00:04:03.819> had

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
once it'd been kind of nice if we had

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.729 
once it'd been kind of nice if we had
some<00:04:03.940> plant<00:04:04.389> food<00:04:04.659> to<00:04:04.870> go<00:04:05.079> along<00:04:05.319> with<00:04:05.560> that

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
some plant food to go along with that

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.830 
some plant food to go along with that
you'll<00:04:06.250> have<00:04:06.519> better<00:04:06.879> yields<00:04:07.329> on<00:04:07.419> your<00:04:07.569> farm

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
you'll have better yields on your farm

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.899 
you'll have better yields on your farm
I'll<00:04:08.049> absolutely<00:04:08.500> guarantee<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.760> other

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
I'll absolutely guarantee you the other

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.409 
I'll absolutely guarantee you the other
thing<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.389> you<00:04:10.659> can<00:04:10.870> build<00:04:11.260> new<00:04:11.919> topsoil<00:04:12.609> down

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
thing is you can build new topsoil down

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.569 
thing is you can build new topsoil down
a<00:04:13.449> little<00:04:13.959> bit<00:04:14.079> deeper<00:04:14.319> in<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.859> soil<00:04:15.040> if<00:04:15.400> you

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
a little bit deeper in the soil if you

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.399 
a little bit deeper in the soil if you
deep<00:04:15.790> inject<00:04:16.209> your<00:04:16.299> manure<00:04:16.659> you<00:04:16.870> get<00:04:17.109> roots

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
deep inject your manure you get roots

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.170 
deep inject your manure you get roots
going<00:04:17.769> down<00:04:17.949> there<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.430> then<00:04:18.729> those<00:04:18.880> risks

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
going down there and then those risks

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.909 
going down there and then those risks
decay<00:04:19.479> over<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.810> period<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.169> time<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:20.709> it's<00:04:20.859> a

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
decay over a period of time so it's a

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.580 
decay over a period of time so it's a
good<00:04:21.099> thing<00:04:21.159> all<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:22.000> way<00:04:22.150> around<00:04:22.539> and<00:04:22.840> one<00:04:23.500> of

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
good thing all the way around and one of

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.019 
good thing all the way around and one of
the<00:04:23.680> other<00:04:23.860> things<00:04:24.279> that<00:04:24.430> comes<00:04:24.820> up<00:04:25.000> quite

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:25.029 
the other things that comes up quite

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.879 
the other things that comes up quite
often<00:04:25.419> when<00:04:25.690> we<00:04:25.779> talk<00:04:25.930> about<00:04:25.960> manure<00:04:26.500> and

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
often when we talk about manure and

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.709 
often when we talk about manure and
if<00:04:26.949> you<00:04:27.129> are<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.460> livestock<00:04:28.150> producer<00:04:28.569> you

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.719 
if you are a livestock producer you

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:32.040 
if you are a livestock producer you
probably<00:04:29.259> know<00:04:29.499> that<00:04:29.860> mener<00:04:30.699> contains<00:04:31.599> a<00:04:31.840> lot

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
probably know that mener contains a lot

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.379 
probably know that mener contains a lot
of<00:04:32.080> phosphorus<00:04:32.439> and<00:04:33.009> phosphorus<00:04:33.430> is<00:04:33.969> the<00:04:34.120> big

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
of phosphorus and phosphorus is the big

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.179 
of phosphorus and phosphorus is the big
thing<00:04:34.689> when<00:04:34.870> you're<00:04:34.990> talking<00:04:35.319> to<00:04:35.409> any<00:04:35.590> state

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 
thing when you're talking to any state

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.029 
thing when you're talking to any state
agency<00:04:36.969> in<00:04:37.210> terms<00:04:37.569> of<00:04:37.870> how<00:04:38.259> much<00:04:38.499> manure<00:04:38.919> you

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
agency in terms of how much manure you

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.649 
agency in terms of how much manure you
can<00:04:39.340> apply<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.669> get<00:04:40.029> worried<00:04:40.449> about

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
can apply to get worried about

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.070 
can apply to get worried about
phosphorus<00:04:41.020> moving<00:04:41.949> offsite<00:04:42.789> and

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
phosphorus moving offsite and

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.360 
phosphorus moving offsite and
contaminating<00:04:44.080> waters<00:04:44.469> that's<00:04:45.039> another

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
contaminating waters that's another

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.040 
contaminating waters that's another
reason<00:04:45.580> why<00:04:45.819> we<00:04:45.939> want<00:04:46.120> that<00:04:46.300> manner<00:04:46.509> injected

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
reason why we want that manner injected

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.659 
reason why we want that manner injected
beep<00:04:47.259> well<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.680> big<00:04:47.830> thing<00:04:47.860> with<00:04:48.159> phosphorus

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
beep well the big thing with phosphorus

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.149 
beep well the big thing with phosphorus
is<00:04:48.849> it's<00:04:49.090> usually<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:50.050> limiting<00:04:50.499> factor<00:04:50.979> for

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
is it's usually the limiting factor for

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.580 
is it's usually the limiting factor for
algae<00:04:51.610> growth<00:04:51.879> in<00:04:52.180> rivers<00:04:52.599> and<00:04:52.900> streams<00:04:53.259> and

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
algae growth in rivers and streams and

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.010 
algae growth in rivers and streams and
lakes<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.099> if<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.639> add<00:04:54.879> some<00:04:55.240> phosphorus<00:04:55.810> to

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
lakes so if you add some phosphorus to

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.110 
lakes so if you add some phosphorus to
that<00:04:56.229> freshwater<00:04:56.830> all<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.610> a<00:04:57.639> sudden<00:04:57.909> you<00:04:57.999> end

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
that freshwater all of a sudden you end

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.570 
that freshwater all of a sudden you end
up<00:04:58.240> with<00:04:58.419> algae<00:04:58.900> blooms<00:04:59.169> well<00:04:59.500> we<00:05:00.219> don't<00:05:00.370> want

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
up with algae blooms well we don't want

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.100 
up with algae blooms well we don't want
to<00:05:00.669> see<00:05:00.789> algae<00:05:01.360> out<00:05:01.479> there<00:05:01.719> we<00:05:01.810> don't<00:05:01.870> want<00:05:02.050> to

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
to see algae out there we don't want to

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.260 
to see algae out there we don't want to
see<00:05:02.199> a<00:05:02.229> green<00:05:02.560> scum<00:05:03.099> layer<00:05:03.400> on<00:05:03.699> top<00:05:03.909> of<00:05:03.969> our

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
see a green scum layer on top of our

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.269 
see a green scum layer on top of our
freshwater<00:05:04.719> so<00:05:05.469> that's<00:05:05.889> why<00:05:06.099> we're<00:05:06.250> very

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:06.279 
freshwater so that's why we're very

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.429 
freshwater so that's why we're very
concerned<00:05:06.849> about<00:05:07.029> phosphorus<00:05:07.449> the<00:05:07.990> only<00:05:08.319> way

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:08.439 
concerned about phosphorus the only way

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.170 
concerned about phosphorus the only way
we're<00:05:08.590> gonna<00:05:08.650> get<00:05:08.889> phosphorus<00:05:09.460> into<00:05:09.969> those

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
we're gonna get phosphorus into those

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.830 
we're gonna get phosphorus into those
waters<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:11.110> by<00:05:11.650> soil<00:05:12.069> runoff<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:13.090> surface

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
waters is by soil runoff and surface

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.800 
waters is by soil runoff and surface
water<00:05:14.139> pushing<00:05:15.009> soil<00:05:15.340> into<00:05:15.909> streams<00:05:16.479> and

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
water pushing soil into streams and

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.439 
water pushing soil into streams and
rivers<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.529> if<00:05:17.770> our<00:05:17.949> soil<00:05:18.250> up<00:05:18.669> in<00:05:18.939> the<00:05:19.029> top<00:05:19.240> few

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
rivers so if our soil up in the top few

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.079 
rivers so if our soil up in the top few
inches<00:05:19.509> has<00:05:19.990> all<00:05:20.349> our<00:05:20.379> phosphorus<00:05:21.129> our<00:05:21.639> risks

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.089 
inches has all our phosphorus our risks

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.570 
inches has all our phosphorus our risks
of<00:05:22.210> having<00:05:22.389> issues<00:05:23.050> are<00:05:23.409> much<00:05:23.620> greater<00:05:23.949> if<00:05:24.370> we

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
of having issues are much greater if we

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.249 
of having issues are much greater if we
can<00:05:24.699> get<00:05:24.819> that<00:05:24.939> phosphorus<00:05:25.539> down<00:05:25.719> deep<00:05:26.020> in<00:05:26.229> the

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
can get that phosphorus down deep in the

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.079 
can get that phosphorus down deep in the
soil<00:05:26.499> by<00:05:26.770> deep<00:05:26.979> injecting<00:05:27.610> as<00:05:27.729> much<00:05:27.939> as

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:28.089 
soil by deep injecting as much as

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.929 
soil by deep injecting as much as
possible<00:05:28.529> that<00:05:29.529> changes<00:05:30.099> the<00:05:30.249> game<00:05:30.279> because

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:30.939 
possible that changes the game because

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.999 
possible that changes the game because
now<00:05:30.969> our<00:05:31.330> soil<00:05:31.659> at<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:31.900> top<00:05:32.199> doesn't<00:05:32.889> have

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
now our soil at the top doesn't have

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.249 
now our soil at the top doesn't have
very<00:05:33.189> much<00:05:33.310> phosphorous<00:05:33.909> also<00:05:34.479> by<00:05:34.960> deep

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
very much phosphorous also by deep

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.409 
very much phosphorous also by deep
injecting<00:05:36.009> we<00:05:36.279> can<00:05:36.430> leave<00:05:36.729> that<00:05:36.969> fertilizer

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
injecting we can leave that fertilizer

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.360 
injecting we can leave that fertilizer
down<00:05:37.719> deep<00:05:38.020> we<00:05:38.229> can<00:05:38.349> put<00:05:38.529> it<00:05:38.620> out<00:05:38.770> for<00:05:39.009> a<00:05:39.039> year

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
down deep we can put it out for a year

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.920 
down deep we can put it out for a year
or<00:05:39.550> twos<00:05:39.759> worth<00:05:40.029> of<00:05:40.240> crop<00:05:40.599> and<00:05:40.900> that

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
or twos worth of crop and that

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.899 
or twos worth of crop and that
phosphorous<00:05:41.680> doesn't<00:05:42.129> move<00:05:42.339> around<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.819> the

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909 
phosphorous doesn't move around in the

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.339 
phosphorous doesn't move around in the
soil<00:05:43.149> so<00:05:43.270> it's<00:05:43.569> protecting<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.199> environment

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
soil so it's protecting the environment

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.740 
soil so it's protecting the environment
as<00:05:44.889> well<00:05:45.069> by<00:05:45.490> putting<00:05:45.699> that<00:05:46.000> phosphorous<00:05:46.539> down

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
as well by putting that phosphorous down

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.689 
as well by putting that phosphorous down
deep<00:05:47.020> ok<00:05:47.409> one<00:05:47.589> of<00:05:47.620> the<00:05:47.740> last<00:05:48.009> things<00:05:48.339> I<00:05:48.490> wanted

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
deep ok one of the last things I wanted

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.070 
deep ok one of the last things I wanted
to<00:05:48.759> bring<00:05:48.849> up<00:05:49.120> with<00:05:49.300> this<00:05:49.449> whole<00:05:49.659> mannered

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
to bring up with this whole mannered

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.050 
to bring up with this whole mannered
discussion<00:05:50.680> is<00:05:50.949> you've<00:05:51.310> got<00:05:51.550> to<00:05:51.669> take<00:05:51.819> a<00:05:51.849> look

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
discussion is you've got to take a look

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.149 
discussion is you've got to take a look
at<00:05:52.210> what<00:05:52.539> the<00:05:52.719> nutrients<00:05:53.349> are<00:05:53.469> in<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:53.889> manure

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
at what the nutrients are in the manure

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.679 
at what the nutrients are in the manure
make<00:05:54.339> sure<00:05:54.550> that<00:05:54.729> you're<00:05:54.879> having<00:05:55.240> your<00:05:55.360> manure

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:55.689 
make sure that you're having your manure

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.110 
make sure that you're having your manure
analyzed<00:05:56.229> it's<00:05:56.500> obviously<00:05:57.099> pretty<00:05:57.370> easy<00:05:57.729> when

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
analyzed it's obviously pretty easy when

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.490 
analyzed it's obviously pretty easy when
it's<00:05:58.240> liquid<00:05:58.599> manure<00:05:58.870> as<00:05:59.110> long<00:05:59.259> as<00:05:59.379> you're

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
it's liquid manure as long as you're

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.200 
it's liquid manure as long as you're
stirring<00:05:59.710> your<00:05:59.919> pit<00:06:00.159> now<00:06:00.520> in<00:06:00.580> our<00:06:00.639> farm<00:06:01.029> what

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
stirring your pit now in our farm what

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.110 
stirring your pit now in our farm what
we'll<00:06:01.360> typically<00:06:01.719> do<00:06:01.960> is<00:06:02.169> we'll<00:06:02.860> go<00:06:03.039> with<00:06:03.339> some

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
we'll typically do is we'll go with some

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.540 
we'll typically do is we'll go with some
manure<00:06:04.509> and<00:06:04.750> some<00:06:05.439> commercial<00:06:05.979> fertilizers

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
manure and some commercial fertilizers

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.309 
manure and some commercial fertilizers
so<00:06:06.699> we<00:06:06.819> can<00:06:06.969> spread<00:06:07.270> that<00:06:07.479> manure<00:06:07.839> out<00:06:07.870> over

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
so we can spread that manure out over

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.559 
so we can spread that manure out over
more<00:06:08.560> acres<00:06:09.009> we<00:06:09.339> have<00:06:09.370> less<00:06:09.849> issue<00:06:10.180> with

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:10.569 
more acres we have less issue with

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.200 
more acres we have less issue with
potentially<00:06:11.289> overdoing<00:06:12.189> it<00:06:12.490> on<00:06:12.639> fertilizer

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
potentially overdoing it on fertilizer

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.969 
potentially overdoing it on fertilizer
and<00:06:13.539> on<00:06:13.659> nutrients<00:06:14.199> and<00:06:14.319> we<00:06:14.560> end<00:06:14.710> up<00:06:14.800> with

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
and on nutrients and we end up with

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.290 
and on nutrients and we end up with
better<00:06:15.189> yields<00:06:15.610> because<00:06:15.729> we<00:06:15.969> can<00:06:16.060> get<00:06:16.180> the

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
better yields because we can get the

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.659 
better yields because we can get the
manure<00:06:16.599> at<00:06:16.870> least<00:06:17.139> to<00:06:17.379> some<00:06:17.710> degree<00:06:17.770> on<00:06:18.279> quite

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
manure at least to some degree on quite

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.639 
manure at least to some degree on quite
a<00:06:18.699> few<00:06:18.759> more<00:06:19.089> acres<00:06:19.449> so<00:06:19.810> with<00:06:19.960> manure<00:06:20.319> we<00:06:20.469> want

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:20.649 
a few more acres so with manure we want

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:22.079 
a few more acres so with manure we want
to<00:06:20.740> wait<00:06:20.889> until<00:06:21.039> the<00:06:21.250> ground<00:06:21.460> cools<00:06:21.729> down<00:06:21.909> a

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
to wait until the ground cools down a

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:24.389 
to wait until the ground cools down a
little<00:06:22.210> bit<00:06:22.599> deep<00:06:23.139> injected<00:06:23.800> as<00:06:23.919> much<00:06:24.189> as

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:24.399 
little bit deep injected as much as

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:26.490 
little bit deep injected as much as
possible<00:06:24.639> and<00:06:25.180> then<00:06:25.719> that<00:06:26.020> way<00:06:26.169> you<00:06:26.199> can

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
possible and then that way you can

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.559 
possible and then that way you can
maximize<00:06:27.009> the<00:06:27.399> fertility<00:06:27.699> value<00:06:28.240> and<00:06:28.419> also

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:28.569 
maximize the fertility value and also

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:31.439 
maximize the fertility value and also
minimize<00:06:29.349> the<00:06:29.680> smell<00:06:30.069> and<00:06:30.430> the<00:06:30.669> other

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
minimize the smell and the other

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.029 
minimize the smell and the other
problems<00:06:31.930> associated<00:06:32.259> with<00:06:32.589> manure

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
problems associated with manure

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.559 
problems associated with manure
well<00:06:33.129> one<00:06:33.370> of<00:06:33.399> the<00:06:33.520> problems<00:06:33.969> that<00:06:34.029> could<00:06:34.360> show

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:34.569 
well one of the problems that could show

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:36.209 
well one of the problems that could show
up<00:06:34.689> with<00:06:34.839> manure<00:06:35.139> is<00:06:35.229> you<00:06:35.379> might<00:06:35.560> have<00:06:35.800> a<00:06:35.830> few

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
up with manure is you might have a few

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:37.439 
up with manure is you might have a few
more<00:06:36.399> weeds<00:06:36.699> because<00:06:36.909> of<00:06:37.149> that<00:06:37.240> good

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
more weeds because of that good

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:39.600 
more weeds because of that good
fertility<00:06:38.019> in<00:06:38.139> your<00:06:38.319> soil<00:06:38.589> and<00:06:38.800> this

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
fertility in your soil and this

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.700 
fertility in your soil and this
we'd<00:06:39.729> may<00:06:40.090> show<00:06:40.389> up<00:06:40.599> quite<00:06:40.780> often<00:06:41.110> we'll<00:06:41.560> talk

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
we'd may show up quite often we'll talk

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.320 
we'd may show up quite often we'll talk
about<00:06:41.860> how<00:06:42.039> to<00:06:42.069> control<00:06:42.490> it<00:06:42.639> coming<00:06:42.759> up<00:06:43.030> later

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
about how to control it coming up later

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.470 
about how to control it coming up later
in<00:06:43.509> the<00:06:43.599> show

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480
