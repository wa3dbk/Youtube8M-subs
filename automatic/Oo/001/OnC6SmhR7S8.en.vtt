00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.680
 so the personal and civic that I am 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.649
 doing is to show how it can 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.349
 enter the test mode of the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.019
 ford ka 2012 2015 on the spot but no 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.269
 achieved now is what is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.250
 We can see some of the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.600
 car diagnostic tools 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.550
 we can get a training of the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.070
 electronic central office that are not 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.189
 available in the same source 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.090
 panel at that point of each 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.040
 2015 newest it in three versions ks is 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.750
 plus andr 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.329
 mine in case s is plus in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.790
 the intermediate board computer only 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.210
 exists in the sl version that can be turned 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.520
 the instantaneous consumption and the average 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.059
 consumption and how politicians traveled in 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.590
 your car even increase in the test of the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.289
 the car dashboard we can see the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.550
 average consumption information you can not 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.890
 consumption but you can see the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.190
 average consumption or is able to access 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.989
 on-board computer resources that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.820
 has the most complete version even you 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.379
 not having the full version in the case of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.189
 my centuries to mediate believe 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.189
 sr 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.030
 it's the version is simple to do too 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.420
 that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.350
 The following procedure will 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.840
 button to reset the stopwatch 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 kilometers counter according to him 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.650
 the car key just turn the car on. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.280
 car do not just turn the key to shoot 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.770
 battery also procedure I did 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.009
 also in focus mk1 né 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.930
 an old focus had in 2000 and 2005 only 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.670
 that he did not see the same things that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.979
 You see in the cac in case you can see 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.689
 consumption will allow consultation of 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.310
 information also interesting let's 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.930
 make a plan for you to see 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.750
 How does it work? 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.290
 I'll hold the button and I'll roll it rain 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.290
 is ensured 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.909
 there will be the test test can vote today 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.820
 is in the panel test 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.000
 maybe they give the button a go 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.670
 change the option only the option eg of 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.459
 agena that would come from the gaucho English test 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.580
 in that case we could be testing the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.980
 time the pointers and test the leds né 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.989
 and if you press and will change the option 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.060
 has several options and starts for example 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.470
 that I practically do not know what 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.000
 means I think we give a 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.060
 force on the internet can find some 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.290
 So let's see what's on. 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.290
 interesting here right? 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.720
 a surplus there imagine a kick 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.549
 that the date of assembly of the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.190
 panel I dunno panel manufacturing in 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.650
 local scope in the cinema company in 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.510
 December against the car on December 5 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.209
 and may actually have been the date of a 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:48.000
 Car pass of the panel which is to 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.709
 cdc makes its error choices from the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.840
 atomic center who is far from you 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.879
 they have no could in the car right? 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.920
 also in the new car you would expect 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.950
 will be bad if I had a code was 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.480
 in this plan and if this option is another 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.250
 false that I had an error school 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.680
 for example I had a problem in 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.540
 speedometer maybe to demarcate 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.750
 speed that is actually the sensor of 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.829
 speed in the 3rd option and showed 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.510
 how wrong 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.370
 I searched the internet is precisely 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.609
 indicating that the location is defective 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.230
 if you have dtc and some humor in low 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.730
 that is, they have some error in the central 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.169
 electronics you may need for squid 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.459
 passing here is this sp going to show 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.290
 car speed the signal was 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.190
 round here you see a campus of its own 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.609
 speed in digital form in almost 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:44.970
 of the cisco 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:46.910
 I did not see any more that this option I like 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.099
 quite what do you think of the quality? 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.700
 new ford ka has no 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.739
 temperature 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.079
 I think the team also had no such 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.450
 option and look will show 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.739
 the radiator liquid temperature of the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.169
 English cupulante 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.709
 I do not understand that degree, Celso. 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:06.750
 arriving driving arrived to score 8738 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.859
 coming to this adventure was 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.900
 low the battery and do not hit it 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.090
 I do not know if it 's 12 volts and a half is 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.120
 marking the gutters some code in the 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.079
 focus will be code does not give advantage is exact 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.510
 of the United Nations document contained a 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.789
 pdf that said the will that equals 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.900
 each team in the case does not seem to be 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.340
 voted exact 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.400
 twelve of you volts but I do not have 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.400
 assurance 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.930
 this detail then she does not neglect that 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.699
 It does, but I kick the field. 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.970
 observed that it is the autonomy of the car 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.610
 you cut off the name 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.560
 I believe he is saying that I do not 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.560
 I can run 201 kilometers to the 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.620
 made the capital finished because 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.070
 I say that because she's seeing 22 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.870
 thousand for 223 and poets and 5 you want 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.639
 I drive and will bring together in one only has 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.740
 to make a supply to be able to 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.380
 take a walk around to see if 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:10.250
 really means that anyway it 's just a 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:14.600
 kick in itaqui I talked to the aaa 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:21.990
 average car consumption is this hi fi rf 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:31.169
 internet means this is an economy 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:33.930
 I think it was residual of the economy is 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.099
 marking 8.4 command with that né 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.240
 the thieves then I think I even managed to 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.250
 my penis is not there 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.409
 then this person can see the 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.720
 Instant I can not see I searched 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.520
 everything here but it does not appear 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:53.699
 if you keep tightening there were two options 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.900
 There are some strange ones here that follow until 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:59.729
 the moment he will put it back into 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:03.240
 risk the top test of antennas 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:08.039
 he is going to have a loop right 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.590
 a circus in the end getting out of the way you 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:14.310
 You have two options you turn the key 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:17.220
 car it erases on or else you hold 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:21.300
 content until you exit the 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.199
 test where to leave then how to explain 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.610
 nor doing 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.120
 following this procedure and from the northeast 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.419
 the country by various car options yet 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.940
 clinton on something else only 111 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.260
 our position as he has already seen that all 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.979
 the sanctions also the electronic central 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.380
 including display have all to all 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.340
 well needed to show the coffin of 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.470
 consumption 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.270
 I think if we could 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.240
 grown thing if you disassemble this panel 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.780
 is the one that has some good connection there 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.449
 inside it it can connect a wiring 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.120
 put a button and hit that button 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.139
 trip of the board board model 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.870
 complete 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.900
 in the complete model the button here 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.150
 in this part of the world that works 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:11.490
 the tribes button is pressed the trip button 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:12.840
 it goes there and changes it's the numbering of the 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.660
 panel to show consumption 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.960
 snapshot and myself then imagine 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:22.020
 here you have some connection of this 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.060
 electronic central panel here we 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.950
 could connect a wire and it is this button 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.710
 I think it already comes built-in and only comes out 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.500
 No way to talk to us, huh? 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.660
 so I see neither who likes a 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.820
 young I'm going from the initiative is more 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.760
 new information on whether or not the 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:43.160
 What is this car's coffin, can I? 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.160
 Can you guys English youtube said
