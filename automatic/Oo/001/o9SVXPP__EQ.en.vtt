00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.729 
just the green laser now the green laser
is<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> predominant<00:00:40.290> effect<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.489> light

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
is the predominant effect in this light

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
you can't even get all of it it's going

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.130 
you can't even get all of it it's going
all<00:00:45.270> over<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.539> place<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.530> tap<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> light

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
all over the place if I tap the light

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.850 
all over the place if I tap the light
we've<00:00:49.140> got<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.620> blue<00:00:50.510> LED<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:52.230> came<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
we've got the blue LED just came on and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.799 
we've got the blue LED just came on and
the<00:00:52.949> red<00:00:53.129> laser<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.879> kind<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the red laser is kind of in the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.229 
the red laser is kind of in the
background<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.910> it's<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> little<00:00:57.149> bit

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
background there it's a little bit

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
background there it's a little bit
harder<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.320> lot<00:00:58.500> easier<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.010> see

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
harder to see it's a lot easier to see

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.189 
harder to see it's a lot easier to see
here<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.699> person<00:01:00.149> than<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> camera

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
here in person than it is on the camera

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.609 
here in person than it is on the camera
but<00:01:01.440> I'll<00:01:02.219> tap<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.699> again<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:04.019> there's<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
but I'll tap it again and there's the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.450 
but I'll tap it again and there's the
h2o<00:01:05.129> effect<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:11.090> little<00:01:12.090> faster<00:01:13.189> that<00:01:14.189> green

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
h2o effect a little faster that green

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.170 
h2o effect a little faster that green
laser<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.740> however<00:01:17.130> cool<00:01:17.430> looks<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.030> on

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
laser go and however cool looks here on

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.350 
laser go and however cool looks here on
the<00:01:18.750> video<00:01:18.900> imagine<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> looks<00:01:20.060> ten<00:01:21.060> times

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the video imagine it looks ten times

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.039 
the video imagine it looks ten times
cooler<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.930> person<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.659> think<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.900> looks

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
cooler in person so I think it looks

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.380 
cooler in person so I think it looks
kind<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:25.470> lightning<00:01:25.979> sometimes

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.820 

so<00:01:30.840> I'm<00:01:30.900> gonna<00:01:31.050> go<00:01:31.140> ahead<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.320> turn<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> light

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
so I'm gonna go ahead and turn the light

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.560 
so I'm gonna go ahead and turn the light
off<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.880> how<00:01:35.570> there's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
off and then you can see how there's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.500 
off and then you can see how there's
just<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> red<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.200> green<00:01:37.410> laser<00:01:38.390> right<00:01:39.390> now

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
just the red and green laser right now

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:54.640 
just the red and green laser right now
it's<00:01:39.660> just<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:40.020> sound<00:01:40.320> active<00:01:40.770> mode

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.300 

that's<00:01:55.220> just<00:01:55.520> wicked

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.370 

now<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:01.850> opted<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.300> get<00:02:02.510> this<00:02:02.690> one<00:02:02.900> instead<00:02:03.260> of

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
now I opted to get this one instead of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.940 
now I opted to get this one instead of
the<00:02:03.470> hypnotic<00:02:03.770> because<00:02:05.710> basically<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.740> could

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
the hypnotic because basically I could

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.620 
the hypnotic because basically I could
get<00:02:07.100> two<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.340> these<00:02:07.640> for<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.030> same<00:02:08.060> price<00:02:08.450> is

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
get two of these for the same price is

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.650 
get two of these for the same price is
one<00:02:08.929> hypnotic<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:10.970> was<00:02:11.090> very<00:02:11.150> appealing

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
one hypnotic and that was very appealing

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.540 
one hypnotic and that was very appealing
