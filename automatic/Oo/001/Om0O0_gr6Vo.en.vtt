perfect<00:01:38.370> hit<00:01:38.750> here<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.220> football<00:01:41.220> field<00:01:41.430> and

perfect hit here in a football field and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.480 
perfect hit here in a football field and

over that goal there

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.140 
over that goal there
so<00:01:47.900> if<00:01:48.900> this<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.380> shoot<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.979> far<00:01:50.010> that<00:01:50.910> it's

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
so if this can shoot so far that it's

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.980 
so if this can shoot so far that it's
longer<00:01:51.660> than<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.900> entire<00:01:52.020> field
