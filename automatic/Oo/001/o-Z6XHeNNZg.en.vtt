00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
this is a tutorial for how to do the

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:13.490 
this is a tutorial for how to do the
Faro<00:00:05.310> shuffle<00:00:05.480> which<00:00:06.480> looks<00:00:07.250> like<00:00:08.250> this<00:00:12.500> right

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
Faro shuffle which looks like this right

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.259 
Faro shuffle which looks like this right
and<00:00:13.710> then<00:00:13.860> once<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.070> have<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> cards<00:00:14.610> set<00:00:15.150> up

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
and then once you have the cards set up

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.550 
and then once you have the cards set up
like<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.839> can<00:00:15.990> just<00:00:16.139> complete<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
like that you can just complete the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.019 
like that you can just complete the
shuffle<00:00:16.920> like<00:00:17.900> so<00:00:18.900> okay<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.430> tricky<00:00:20.820> part

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
shuffle like so okay so the tricky part

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.609 
shuffle like so okay so the tricky part
is<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.390> course<00:00:21.600> getting<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> cards<00:00:22.410> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
is of course getting the cards to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.150 
is of course getting the cards to
interleave<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.810> first<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.830> thing<00:00:26.010> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
interleave like that first the thing is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.070 
interleave like that first the thing is
you<00:00:26.340> want<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.670> cut<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.029> deck<00:00:27.210> exactly<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.869> half

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.389 

like<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.679> if<00:00:31.800> you're<00:00:31.920> off<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.250> can

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
like that so if you're off you can

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.740 
like that so if you're off you can
adjust<00:00:32.730> by<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> couple<00:00:33.180> cards<00:00:35.360> then<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.390> want

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
adjust by a couple cards then you want

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
adjust by a couple cards then you want
the<00:00:36.870> edges<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.440> nice<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.010> flat<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.280> so

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the edges to be nice and flat like so

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910 
the edges to be nice and flat like so
you<00:00:39.480> don't<00:00:39.629> want<00:00:39.750> them<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.710> like

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
you don't want them like this or like

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.709 
you don't want them like this or like
that<00:00:42.800> flat<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.090> other<00:00:45.180> thing<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.390> helps

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
that flat and the other thing that helps

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.380 
that flat and the other thing that helps
is<00:00:45.899> having<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.350> finger<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.680> top<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.820> your

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
is having your finger on top and your

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.660 
is having your finger on top and your
pinky<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> bottom<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:50.340> help<00:00:50.489> keep

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
pinky on the bottom here to help keep

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.580 
pinky on the bottom here to help keep
those<00:00:50.850> ideas<00:00:51.000> applied<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.199> knock<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
those ideas applied so you knock them a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.049 
those ideas applied so you knock them a
little<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> side<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
little here on the side like this and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.610 
little here on the side like this and
then<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.710> come<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.430> you're<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.090> push

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
then you come in and you're gonna push
these<00:00:58.620> two<00:00:58.890> edges<00:00:59.219> right<00:00:59.370> here

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
these two edges right here

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.619 
these two edges right here
I<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:01.680> push<00:01:01.980> flat<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.270> kind<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
I don't push flat like this I kind of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.870 
I don't push flat like this I kind of
push<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.439> some<00:01:05.339> people<00:01:05.549> say<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> can

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
even put your pinky in there to help you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.310 
even put your pinky in there to help you
get<00:01:07.350> started<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.990> another

get started if you like and another

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
get started if you like and another
thing<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.369> addition<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.570> haven't

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
thing I do in addition what you haven't

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
thing I do in addition what you haven't
really<00:01:12.990> seen<00:01:13.200> anywhere<00:01:13.530> before<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:15.150> I'm

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
really seen anywhere before is as I'm

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.170 
really seen anywhere before is as I'm
pushing<00:01:15.630> them<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.280> kind<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.400> slide<00:01:17.850> this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
pushing them in I kind of slide this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
pushing them in I kind of slide this
direction<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.430> guess<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.549> could<00:01:20.670> really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
direction here I guess you could really

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.260 
direction here I guess you could really
go<00:01:21.030> either<00:01:21.060> way<00:01:22.369> but<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.430> kind<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.759> travel

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
go either way but I kind of travel

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.410 
go either way but I kind of travel
across<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.110> push<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:27.000> important

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
across as I push in and it's important

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.539 
across as I push in and it's important
that<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.750> your<00:01:27.869> finger<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.549> pushing

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that you have your finger here pushing

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.319 
that you have your finger here pushing
because<00:01:30.299> see<00:01:30.600> how<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.610> gets<00:01:32.610> rid<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> any<00:01:33.030> air

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
because see how that gets rid of any air

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.370 
because see how that gets rid of any air
between<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.320> cards<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:37.140> just

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
between the cards and then you can just

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.250 
between the cards and then you can just
go<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
go like that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.150 
go like that
see<00:01:41.130> how<00:01:41.910> travelled<00:01:42.450> forward<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:42.930> bit

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
see how travelled forward a little bit

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.370 
see how travelled forward a little bit
once<00:01:44.160> you<00:01:44.250> got<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.550> corner<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.930> easy

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
once you got the corner and it's easy

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.720 
once you got the corner and it's easy
enough<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.830> push<00:01:47.160> them<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> rest<00:01:47.580> the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
enough to just push them the rest the

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.320 
enough to just push them the rest the
way<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:50.100> at<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.400> point<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.120> take

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
way in and at that point you just take

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.590 
way in and at that point you just take
the<00:01:51.450> cards<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:53.180> grab<00:01:54.180> them<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.480> other

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the cards here grab them with your other

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.160 
the cards here grab them with your other
hand<00:01:57.320> shuffle<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.530> cards<00:01:58.830> I<00:01:59.990> hope<00:02:00.990> that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
hand shuffle the cards I hope that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.440 
hand shuffle the cards I hope that
helped
