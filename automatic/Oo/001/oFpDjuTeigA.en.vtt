00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
left side is a cage heats up instantly

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:59.049 
left side is a cage heats up instantly
like<00:00:49.770> less<00:00:50.730> than<00:00:51.329> 30<00:00:51.660> seconds<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.649> fast

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.729 

what's<00:01:00.059> great<00:01:00.300> about<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.809> flat<00:01:01.199> iron<00:01:01.469> in

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
what's great about this flat iron in

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.469 
what's great about this flat iron in
particular<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.960> turns<00:01:04.530> off<00:01:05.010> after<00:01:05.790> 30

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
particular is that it turns off after 30

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.840 
particular is that it turns off after 30
minutes<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.860> you're<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> those<00:01:08.369> girls

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
minutes so if you're one of those girls

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.890 
minutes so if you're one of those girls
that<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:12.000> often<00:01:12.450> are

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that are on the go and you often are

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.670 
that are on the go and you often are
driving<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.710> work<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.250> you're<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.640> shoot

driving to work and you're like shoot

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.679 
driving to work and you're like shoot
Flatiron<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.040> turns<00:01:17.939> off<00:01:18.090> automatically

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
Flatiron it turns off automatically

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.490 
Flatiron it turns off automatically
after<00:01:18.930> half<00:01:19.590> an<00:01:19.740> hour<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.549> dual<00:01:21.270> voltage<00:01:21.500> so

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
after half an hour it is dual voltage so

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.810 
after half an hour it is dual voltage so
if<00:01:22.619> you're<00:01:22.799> traveling<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.640> lot
