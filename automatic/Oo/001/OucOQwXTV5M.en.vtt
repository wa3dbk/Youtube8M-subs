00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
coffee is percolating let's look at the

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.460 
coffee is percolating let's look at the
different<00:02:35.230> range<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.859> flames<00:02:37.200> available<00:02:38.200> from

different range of flames available from

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.069 
different range of flames available from
the<00:02:38.680> Kimberly<00:02:40.109> we<00:02:41.109> can<00:02:41.290> give<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:42.030> way<00:02:43.030> more

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
the Kimberly we can give it way more

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.870 
the Kimberly we can give it way more
intake<00:02:44.079> air<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.639> primary<00:02:46.180> fire<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:48.670> the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
intake air to the primary fire with the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.860 
intake air to the primary fire with the
handle<00:02:49.329> here<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.410> left<00:02:51.150> then<00:02:52.150> gradually

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
handle here to the left then gradually

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.000 
handle here to the left then gradually
turn<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.380> down<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.660> actually<00:02:55.959> what<00:02:56.500> happens

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
turn it down and actually what happens

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.390 
turn it down and actually what happens
when<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.459> turn<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.910> primary<00:02:58.480> fire<00:02:58.810> down<00:02:59.400> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
when you turn the primary fire down the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.030 
when you turn the primary fire down the
heat<00:03:00.700> from<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.569> Kimberly<00:03:02.049> RV<00:03:02.500> wood<00:03:02.709> stove

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
heat from the Kimberly RV wood stove

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.479 
heat from the Kimberly RV wood stove
actually<00:03:03.400> becomes<00:03:04.090> greater<00:03:05.160> because<00:03:06.160> the

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
actually becomes greater because the

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.759 
actually becomes greater because the
secondary<00:03:07.239> burn<00:03:07.650> starts<00:03:08.650> igniting<00:03:10.350> up<00:03:11.350> in<00:03:11.620> the

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
secondary burn starts igniting up in the

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.059 
secondary burn starts igniting up in the
combustor<00:03:12.430> packs<00:03:12.730> let's<00:03:13.600> see<00:03:13.810> if<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.859> will

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
combustor packs let's see if this will

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.850 
combustor packs let's see if this will
show<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.579> I<00:03:15.910> don't<00:03:16.329> want<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.569> get

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
show it I don't want to get

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.289 
show it I don't want to get
camera<00:03:18.860> too<00:03:19.129> close<00:03:19.489> because<00:03:19.790> there's<00:03:20.120> an

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
camera too close because there's an

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.559 
camera too close because there's an
intense<00:03:20.810> amount<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.349> heat<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:23.120> look<00:03:23.360> up

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
intense amount of heat you can look up

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.890 
intense amount of heat you can look up
in<00:03:23.780> there<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:26.180> see<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.780> secondary<00:03:27.470> burn

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
in there and see the secondary burn

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.240 
in there and see the secondary burn
which<00:03:29.900> really<00:03:30.230> has<00:03:30.470> some<00:03:30.739> beautiful<00:03:31.040> flames

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.759 

like<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.400> say<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:38.329> is<00:03:38.599> an<00:03:38.810> intense<00:03:39.290> heat<00:03:39.560> I

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
like I say that is an intense heat I

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.770 
like I say that is an intense heat I
don't<00:03:40.040> want<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.250> melt<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.700> video<00:03:41.000> camera<00:03:41.540> okay

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
don't want to melt the video camera okay

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.869 
don't want to melt the video camera okay
and<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.989> camera<00:03:46.629> is<00:03:47.629> cooler<00:03:48.319> now<00:03:48.560> back<00:03:48.980> off<00:03:49.430> a

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
and the camera is cooler now back off a

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.740 
and the camera is cooler now back off a
bit<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.980> would<00:03:51.980> say<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.579> cooktop<00:03:53.090> is<00:03:53.150> probably

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
bit I would say the cooktop is probably

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.640 
bit I would say the cooktop is probably
about<00:03:53.900> 900<00:03:54.769> degrees<00:03:55.629> and<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:57.170> coffee<00:03:57.440> is

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
about 900 degrees and the coffee is

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.069 
about 900 degrees and the coffee is
percolating<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:59.150> think<00:03:59.420> we<00:03:59.720> shall<00:04:00.019> have

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
percolating and I think we shall have

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.910 
percolating and I think we shall have
some<00:04:00.349> here<00:04:00.950> in<00:04:00.980> just<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.579> minute<00:04:01.700> or<00:04:02.030> two<00:04:02.889> have<00:04:03.889> a

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
some here in just a minute or two have a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.459
