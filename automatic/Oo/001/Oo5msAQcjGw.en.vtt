 Kukayev guys with you resman and today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.099
 I will tell you about such a mechanism 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.200
 minecraft which adds escalators 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.870
 that is, without any pistons all 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.460
 done on command blocks that is, we 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.850
 come to the escalator that goes up 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.740
 put here and start to move 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.080
 up when we reached the top called 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.510
 throw out on the platform itself 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.650
 maybe there is a floor already 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.300
 apply for any there 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.360
 building a supermarket on the server or 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.010
 other things and also you can go down then 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.309
 have we get up and start going down 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.309
 way down 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 let me show you how it looks 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.590
 From the side, that is, the 3d mode, that is, 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.629
 yourself ladder 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.579
 the steps themselves don't move that is in 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.090
 basically our body moves that is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.059
 there is no animation as such but the system 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.239
 does not work so here we go down 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.239
 way down 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.770
 the scheme is simple enough but however for 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.460
 building will take a little patience 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.590
 and not to bathe not to explain to you here 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.990
 that's all what's needed here as 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.479
 it is correct to build I most likely 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.810
 just leave you a download link 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.760
 This card download and you can quickly 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.190
 total on my public page 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.750
 Well, I think we'll figure it out. 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.890
 let's explain briefly that yes here 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.750
 what do the main blocks mean 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.399
 responsible for the escalator just for the most 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.649
 our movement is these six 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.820
 blocks they are also divided into two sections 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.320
 the blocks that push us up that is 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.930
 rock so which goes up and which 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.040
 goes down meaning they are constantly active 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.259
 as you see that is here also they 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.710
 divided into command block which 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.280
 so poison up here is the command team 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.440
 which us 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:06.400
 that is, starts giving us a command 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.070
 top and the team is not for it themselves 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.850
 the effect of moving up the steps is the same 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.580
 the thing with an excavator that goes down 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.790
 well well dear friends on this in 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.530
 In principle, all the link to the card is delivered 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.870
 Under the video just put likes 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.870
 subscribe to the channel all bye
