00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.729
 a friends 

00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:03.430
 pesos a cell phone 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.760
 welcome to this number one tutorial 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.599
 anime facts version 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.599
 this time I will show you how to make the effect 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.039
 from a fund similar to the one used in the trailer number 3 of May Hindu 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.050
 entitled 'the prince' san joaquin 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.720
 an organic farm with movement 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.029
 really easy to work out 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.569
 since there is not much to change in the effect to achieve it 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.470
 here the example 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.599
 let's start then 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.739
 the first step to follow is to go to the composition menu 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.130
 new composition 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.130
 mtss screen name background 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.190
 ten seconds 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.010
 to accept 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.430
 famous to the menu that afa 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 I move 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.870
 solid 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.610
 we call it background 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.020
 to accept 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.410
 to add the missing noise effect is the one that we will use 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.730
 we can choose search engine clubs 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.790
 joining astral noisy 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 and we drag it to the square 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.110
 or we can do it from the same effect menu 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.790
 noise and grain 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.540
 Fractal noise 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.630
 any of the options can be used to choose it 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.759
 Fractal noise has preset settings 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.730
 we will choose one of them 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.730
 called cosmic force 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.960
 and we can see how practically all the work is 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.880
 It is done 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.030
 the detail is that as they see alone and in front they mark the animation 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.080
 they only span up to five seconds 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.960
 which if you want it to last longer 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.350
 you have to move those 15 20 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.600
 to the part where you want 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 or until the end of your house 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.870
 how do you need it 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.280
 his new face to moss with the mouse 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.040
 likewise the option of rotation also move it at the end 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.199
 and there it is 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.589
 I have the factual background 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.589
 Now let's add a color 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.839
 for that is 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.419
 often effect 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:21.219
 color correction 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.989
 tone and saturation 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.979
 in tone and saturation 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.679
 we must add the blue tone that we put in the example 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.059
 check the box color 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.369
 the Kanak turned red 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.519
 is the tone marked at zero 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.859
 the blue tone is 200 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.509
 You can move the mouse and see how the tone changes depending on the number 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.039
 what do you choose 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.359
 Let's leave in 200cc the ones as before I mentioned 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.609
 and saturation is the strength of color 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.389
 you have to put it a little more intense 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:53.989
 in 50 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.249
 ready 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.299
 we already have the background color blue and our clouds finished 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.929
 you can see the animation 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:03.329
 We check a property to verify 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.779
 dragging the four second timeline 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.189
 so as not to make it so extensive 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.419
 It is done 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.419
 Exactly the background they use in the trailer 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.870
 to give some improvements we see a darker tone 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.639
 for this it is 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:24.959
 often effects 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.809
 color correction 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.019
 curves 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.139
 in curves you can move up or down depending if you want more brightness 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.529
 or darker 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.259
 now we look for it to be darker 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.709
 ready 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.899
 you can put more effects 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.079
 to make it more colorful 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.939
 as in the example 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.089
 let's go to the effects menu 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:49.459
 boil 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.459
 the Israeli 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.069
 we move a bit and change the intensity to 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.069
 250 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.349
 quartz weekends 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.019
 we leave it like this 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.159
 and radio we increase or 150 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.809
 very strong better let's leave it there continue 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:16.759
 and we see how each passing cloud will be as if the reflectors were 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.409
 in the back 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:21.269
 increasing the brightness of this 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.090
 we explain the effect of the Israeli 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.499
 avoid 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:26.719
 double 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:28.800
 and we drag it somewhere else 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.059
 arrived for example 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.969
 let's change the intensity to 100 and duplicate it again 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.389
 the new duplicate we put it on the other corner 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.360
 changing the value of siena 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.680
 we leave it like this in 100 better is already 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.680
 we can see the preview now 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.699
 that's it 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.699
 if we want to add a text that this one with the background 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.249
 let's select the text tool 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.379
 then click anywhere on the screen 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.319
 and we write the word that we occupy 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.539
 we activate the option of safe margins 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.240
 this serves to center the word 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.509
 based on the central point 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.979
 we put the word based on that point 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.639
 a rear pan tool 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.719
 we can move the center of our word wherever we want 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.339
 right in its center 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.919
 and we can increase the size of our word will 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:45.499
 we remove the safe margins 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.189
 now we are going to add some effects in our text 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.020
 we open the effect menu 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.370
 we choose the same twitter 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.229
 the Israelites 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.229
 we see that it gives the same touch of reflector to the text 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.490
 to make a movement motion 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.490
 just choose the starting point 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.740
 and here the center we mark the 15 in the beginning 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.030
 and we move in the timeline to where the effect movement 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.080
 it ended 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.450
 marking with the coordinates of xl airways too 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.879
 in this way that the movement of the effect through the 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:25.800
 text 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.990
 let's choose another effect for our text 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.939
 let's go to the effect menu 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:32.449
 stylized 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:33.819
 radiance 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.870
 this gives a touch of light to the text as we can see 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.409
 a much brighter text 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:43.999
 we check the town 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.729
 let's change the insolvency properties 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.270
 lowering the intensity a bit or nothing more 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.899
 and radio also just a little 

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:07.899
 intensity follows something strong 

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:10.199
 that's better 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.249
 this is how the effect called 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:16.529
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.529
 it's simple for those who know the program 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:22.029
 for those who can not 

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:23.899
 you know how to do it 

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:28.990
 this is the first tutorial wants to see several that I have planned for you 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.369
 some may be simpler than others 

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:37.289
 others will be somewhat more complex but I will try to explain Fridays 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.020
 pesos greets him 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.389
 visit sell your animals dot dot punk blocks 

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:47.689
 where soon you will find more structural are showing this 

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:48.409
 fact 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:50.260
 Andean information 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.429
 and the music he used 

00:07:52.429 --> 00:07:53.770
 anyway 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.139
 a greeting 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:55.800
 good luck
