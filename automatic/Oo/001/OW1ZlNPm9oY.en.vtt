00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it's about half my first question is how

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.369 
it's about half my first question is how
can<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.910> souffle<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.660> mousse<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.199> mousse

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
can a souffle be a mousse and a mousse

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.720 
can a souffle be a mousse and a mousse
be<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> super<00:00:55.890> they're<00:00:56.070> two<00:00:56.280> very<00:00:56.309> different

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
be a super they're two very different

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.569 
be a super they're two very different
things<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> cold<00:00:57.899> mousse<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:59.250> looks

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
things so it's a cold mousse that looks

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.430 
things so it's a cold mousse that looks
like<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> souffle<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.449> an<00:01:00.539> illusion<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.289> play

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the egg whites they need to be stiff

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.149 
the egg whites they need to be stiff
peak<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.079> bit<00:01:49.290> takes<00:01:49.500> about<00:01:49.619> three<00:01:50.070> or

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
peak now this bit takes about three or

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.800 
peak now this bit takes about three or
four<00:01:50.369> minutes<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.820> heavily<00:01:51.360> recommend

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
four minutes so I heavily recommend

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.480 
four minutes so I heavily recommend
using<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.079> machine<00:01:52.380> rather<00:01:52.740> than<00:01:53.040> whisking

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
using a machine rather than whisking

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
using a machine rather than whisking

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
look at that that's the consistence you

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.309 
look at that that's the consistence you
want<00:02:09.090> from<00:02:09.300> your<00:02:09.390> egg<00:02:09.569> something<00:02:09.989> that's<00:02:10.140> sort

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
you can draw a figure of eight in and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.400 
you can draw a figure of eight in and
then<00:02:12.090> if<00:02:12.209> you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
then if you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.920 
then if you
wisk<00:02:12.560> as<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.920> hot<00:02:13.160> cherry<00:02:13.850> liquid<00:02:14.180> goes<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.510> to
