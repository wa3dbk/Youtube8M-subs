00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
just for video purpose obviously because

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.609 
just for video purpose obviously because
it<00:01:42.960> looks<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.619> crap<00:01:45.049> ask<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> button<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it looks like crap ask the button to the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:59.090 
it looks like crap ask the button to the
top<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.310> electrode<00:01:49.220> actually

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.070 

these<00:02:00.030> guys<00:02:00.210> look<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.510> they<00:02:00.840> could<00:02:00.900> do<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
these guys look like they could do a

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.770 
these guys look like they could do a
little<00:02:01.320> bit<00:02:01.500> damaged<00:02:01.950> here<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.210> they<00:02:03.330> explode

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
little bit damaged here and they explode

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
little bit damaged here and they explode
so<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.650> can<00:02:04.799> actually<00:02:04.920> damages<00:02:05.520> when<00:02:05.820> they

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.320 
so they can actually damages when they
explode<00:02:06.240> after<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.869> destroy<00:02:07.560> them<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:08.330> these

it<00:03:47.709> turns<00:03:47.860> red<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:49.510> we<00:03:49.599> basically<00:03:49.720> want<00:03:50.170> to

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
it turns red so we basically want to

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.130 
it turns red so we basically want to
attract<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.890> motion<00:03:51.580> sensor<00:03:52.060> so<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:52.840> it

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
attract the motion sensor so that it

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.839 
attract the motion sensor so that it
aims<00:03:53.290> at<00:03:53.590> us<00:03:53.769> while<00:03:54.040> we're<00:03:54.220> standing<00:03:54.459> in<00:03:54.670> front

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
first read now actually did try to

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.210 
first read now actually did try to
destroy<00:03:59.739> this<00:04:00.780> sensor<00:04:01.920> but<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.010> only<00:04:03.130> thing

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
you do is disable it first so you can

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.940
