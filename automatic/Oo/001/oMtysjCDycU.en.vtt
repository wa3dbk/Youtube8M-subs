00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.609
 to all 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:20.189
 mom and dad are cleaning the house mom 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.189
 and I found this box in the attic 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:29.240
 can guess what is inside 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.240
 and it's full of musical instruments 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.870
 they are a little dust sos 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.290
 this is the violin that he played when he was 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.350
 little you can not touch me yet I do not 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.890
 I have played in a long time because love me 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.980
 for his love, I hope I do not have it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.980
 forgotten 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.800
 I can not play the violin I hold like this 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.800
 good mommy 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.970
 and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.140
 heavens I do not think I have to sound if 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.140
 George wants to try they 're in the chair 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.430
 the violin does not sound very well 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.580
 bilin is very difficult to treat 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:41.710
 maybe you can do better with this 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.380
 drum or thanks to you that sounds better to 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.930
 Pepa likes to play the drum and what 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.930
 beautiful if it sounds very good 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.740
 this is dad's accordion played this 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.740
 to mom when we met 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.229
 I do not remember that sound 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.530
 George also wants to play the accordion 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.170
 is sure george the accordion is very 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.260
 hard 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:24.640
 playing the accordion is almost as difficult 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.640
 how to play my drum is fine 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.550
 and 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.170
 maybe george is too small to touch 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:40.500
 the accordion to you or others 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:44.880
 instruments in the box just this horn 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.880
 you have to blow very hard 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:55.390
 that does not sound very good is impossible I think 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.390
 I remember how to touch it 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.569
 that really does not sound very good maybe 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.720
 you need someone big and strong like 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.720
 I 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:20.080
 That does not sound very gaffe is 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.620
 impossible to touch it does not matter dad just 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.250
 play the accordion that you do very well 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.069
 if the truth I play it really well and it's not 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.730
 because what I say and I will play in my 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.430
 violin and I will play meet and war mom 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.380

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.610

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.610
 for the love 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.560
 but what instrument will touch george 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:02.430
 because he is blowing the horn mom not 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.330

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.780
