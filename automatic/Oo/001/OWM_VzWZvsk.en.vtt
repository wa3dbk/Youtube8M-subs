wouldn't it is a wonderful time to take
hardwood<00:00:04.680> cuttings<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.310> they<00:00:05.520> are<00:00:05.640> probably

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
hardwood cuttings and they are probably

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.059 
hardwood cuttings and they are probably
the<00:00:06.180> easiest<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.839> all<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.290> cuttings<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.830> you

the easiest of all the cuttings that you
could<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:09.360> normally<00:00:09.510> use<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.960> for

how to do it this is a red dogwood a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.170 
how to do it this is a red dogwood a
corner<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> Siberia<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.430> they've<00:00:23.880> got<00:00:24.090> these

lovely red stems and the reason you
would<00:00:27.869> make<00:00:28.170> card<00:00:29.010> wood<00:00:29.189> cuttings<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.730> any

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
would make card wood cuttings of any

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.540 
would make card wood cuttings of any
plant<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.869> could<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.109> roses<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.859> why<00:00:32.009> Julia

over the deciduous fiber gnomes is to
make<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> plant<00:00:36.410> exactly<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.280> plant

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
make a plant exactly like the plant

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.240 
make a plant exactly like the plant
you've<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.320> every<00:00:40.710> way<00:00:40.860> it'll

spread<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.649> replica<00:00:46.890> baby<00:00:47.850> plant<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
spread so it's a replica baby plant and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.860 
spread so it's a replica baby plant and
it's<00:00:49.140> cheap<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.950> fact<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.489> free<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.600> I'm

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
it's cheap in fact it's free so I'm

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.470 
it's cheap in fact it's free so I'm
going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> show<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> how<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:54.360> it's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
going to show you how to do it and it's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.420 
going to show you how to do it and it's
really<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:54.809> useful<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.500> instance<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
really really useful for instance if you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.819 
really really useful for instance if you
can't<00:00:56.640> afford<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> buy<00:00:57.149> lots<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.500> plant

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
can't afford to buy lots more one plant

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.920 
can't afford to buy lots more one plant
that<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.280> make<00:00:59.399> your<00:00:59.550> own<00:00:59.640> plants<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that you can make your own plants and it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.119 
that you can make your own plants and it
really<00:01:01.140> costs<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> nothing

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
really costs you nothing

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.880 
really costs you nothing
so<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.210> hardened<00:01:06.570> cutting<00:01:06.890> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
so to make a hardened cutting you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
so to make a hardened cutting you
normally<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.369> them<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:08.640> November<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
normally do them from November to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.929 
normally do them from November to
February<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.830> easy<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.220> tell<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
February and it's easy to tell when the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.880 
February and it's easy to tell when the
plant<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.299> ready<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> row<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.080> hardwood<00:01:13.560> cutting

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
plant is ready to row a hardwood cutting

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.070 
plant is ready to row a hardwood cutting
because<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.430> don't<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.640> any<00:01:14.880> leaves<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
because they don't have any leaves on so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
because they don't have any leaves on so
here<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.619> winter<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.790> want<00:01:17.939> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
here we are in winter and you want to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.179 
here we are in winter and you want to
choose<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.200> dogwood<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
choose from this dogwood I'm going to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.990 
choose from this dogwood I'm going to
choose<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.729> nice<00:01:22.159> straight<00:01:23.159> stem<00:01:23.820> that's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
choose a nice straight stem that's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.570 
choose a nice straight stem that's
coming<00:01:24.390> off<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.290> bottom<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.890> wouldn't<00:01:26.549> use

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
coming off the bottom I wouldn't use

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
coming off the bottom I wouldn't use
something<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.840> because<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.320> too

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
something like this because it's too

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
something like this because it's too
thin<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.070> whippy<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> top<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
thin and whippy and it's at the top of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
thin and whippy and it's at the top of
the<00:01:30.329> plant<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> growth<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.619> more

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the plant and the growth is more

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.530 
the plant and the growth is more
vigorous<00:01:32.159> from<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> bottom<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.090> you've

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
vigorous from the bottom so you've

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.140 
vigorous from the bottom so you've
chosen<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:34.049> nice<00:01:34.259> long<00:01:34.710> healthy<00:01:35.579> stem<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
chosen a nice long healthy stem and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.830 
chosen a nice long healthy stem and
you're<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> make<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.950> cut<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:39.540> doesn't

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you're going to make a cut it doesn't

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.440 
you're going to make a cut it doesn't
matter<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.820> horizontal<00:01:41.820> cut<00:01:42.210> or<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
matter if it's a horizontal cut or a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.999 
matter if it's a horizontal cut or a
sloping<00:01:42.869> cut<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.200> always<00:01:43.409> tend<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.799> smoking

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
sloping cut I always tend to a smoking

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
sloping cut I always tend to a smoking
cut<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.030> make<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.450> cut

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
cut and you're going to make that cut

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
cut and you're going to make that cut
just<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:47.189> if<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.970> there's

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
just don't if you can see that there's

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.490 
just don't if you can see that there's
the<00:01:48.720> beginnings<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.590> leaf<00:01:49.799> node<00:01:49.829> or<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> bud

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the beginnings of a leaf node or a bud

the beginnings of a leaf node or a bud
just<00:01:52.500> there<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.450> make<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> cut

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
just there and I'm going to make the cut

just there and I'm going to make the cut
just<00:01:55.500> below<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.140> cut<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
just below that and you just cut it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.130 
just below that and you just cut it
through<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> clean<00:01:59.399> pair<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.540> sharp

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140

through with a clean pair of sharp
second<00:02:01.439> shows<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.310> that

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.580 

we<00:02:05.759> took<00:02:05.939> off<00:02:06.090> quite<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> long<00:02:06.570> stem<00:02:06.960> we'll

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
we took off quite a long stem we'll

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.740 
we took off quite a long stem we'll
probably<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:08.220> another<00:02:08.640> two<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:09.450> three

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
probably get another two or three

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.750 
probably get another two or three
cuttings<00:02:10.410> out<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.800> there<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.069> would<00:02:11.250> probably

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
cuttings out of there I would probably

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.270 
cuttings out of there I would probably
take<00:02:12.060> two<00:02:12.510> more<00:02:12.690> cuttings<00:02:13.050> out<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.560> by

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
take two more cuttings out of that by

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.559 
take two more cuttings out of that by

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
can they're not needed so you see we've

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.039 
can they're not needed so you see we've
got<00:02:44.310> two<00:02:44.730> nice<00:02:45.209> healthy<00:02:45.510> cuttings<00:02:45.930> there

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
got two nice healthy cuttings there

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.170 
got two nice healthy cuttings there
about<00:02:46.260> pencil<00:02:46.680> thickness<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.280> they<00:02:47.910> will

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
about pencil thickness and they will

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.809 
about pencil thickness and they will
turn<00:02:48.390> into<00:02:48.660> new<00:02:48.900> ponds<00:02:49.170> for<00:02:49.380> next<00:02:49.650> year<00:02:49.819> and

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
turn into new ponds for next year and

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.160 
turn into new ponds for next year and
they're<00:02:51.030> free<00:02:51.299> now

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
they're free now

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.410 
they're free now
hardwood<00:02:52.890> cuttings<00:02:53.010> are<00:02:53.310> really<00:02:53.640> really<00:02:53.880> easy

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
hardwood cuttings are really really easy

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.620 
hardwood cuttings are really really easy
to<00:02:54.599> put<00:02:54.840> up<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:56.130> would<00:02:56.400> normally<00:02:56.580> take<00:02:57.330> two<00:02:57.569> or

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
to put up I I would normally take two or

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.420 
to put up I I would normally take two or
three<00:02:57.660> stems<00:02:58.110> at<00:02:58.290> once<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.769> make<00:02:59.160> myself

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
three stems at once and make myself

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.979 
three stems at once and make myself
several<00:02:59.880> cuttings<00:03:00.299> like<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.660> all<00:03:00.840> up<00:03:00.959> so

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
several cuttings like this all up so

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.470 
several cuttings like this all up so
this<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.500> sandy<00:03:01.890> soil<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.400> really<00:03:03.090> don't<00:03:03.299> need

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
this is sandy soil you really don't need

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.839 
this is sandy soil you really don't need
to<00:03:03.660> garden<00:03:04.319> compost<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.489> just<00:03:05.700> nice

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
to garden compost this is just nice

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.910 
to garden compost this is just nice
gritty<00:03:06.299> fridrich<00:03:06.959> free<00:03:07.380> draining<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.829> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
gritty fridrich free draining is the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.539 
gritty fridrich free draining is the
main<00:03:08.100> thing

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
main thing

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.420 
main thing
gritty<00:03:08.910> set<00:03:09.239> garden<00:03:10.140> soil<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.799> I've<00:03:11.250> just

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
gritty set garden soil and I've just

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.479 
gritty set garden soil and I've just
popped<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.850> into<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.090> pot<00:03:12.359> boy<00:03:12.989> for<00:03:13.859> my<00:03:14.100> cuttings

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
popped it into a pot boy for my cuttings

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.830 
popped it into a pot boy for my cuttings
now<00:03:15.260> have<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.290> look<00:03:16.470> at<00:03:16.530> your<00:03:16.650> cuttings<00:03:17.040> and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
now have a look at your cuttings and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.539 
now have a look at your cuttings and
remember<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.930> blunt<00:03:19.290> end<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.799> flat<00:03:20.010> end<00:03:20.250> and

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
remember the blunt end the flat end and

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.420 
remember the blunt end the flat end and
then<00:03:21.239> we<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.540> sloping<00:03:21.959> end<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.470> we<00:03:23.250> want

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
then we have the sloping end and we want

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.410 
then we have the sloping end and we want
to<00:03:23.519> put<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.060> flat<00:03:24.329> end<00:03:24.630> into<00:03:25.560> our<00:03:26.420> compost

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
to put the flat end into our compost

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.229 
to put the flat end into our compost
like<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.140> I'd<00:03:28.260> pop<00:03:28.470> them<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.769> here<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.280> I

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
like that so I'd pop them in here and I

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.759 
like that so I'd pop them in here and I
would<00:03:30.450> probably<00:03:30.600> do<00:03:30.870> twelve<00:03:31.170> or<00:03:31.350> fifteen<00:03:31.440> at

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
would probably do twelve or fifteen at

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.920 
would probably do twelve or fifteen at
once<00:03:31.950> put<00:03:32.489> an<00:03:32.579> elastic<00:03:32.970> band<00:03:33.180> around<00:03:33.299> them<00:03:33.720> and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
once put an elastic band around them and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.680 
once put an elastic band around them and
then<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.620> firm<00:03:34.920> your<00:03:35.340> soil<00:03:35.609> back<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.090> around

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
then you firm your soil back in around

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.860 
then you firm your soil back in around
them<00:03:36.959> just<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:38.100> make<00:03:38.280> sure<00:03:38.310> there<00:03:39.209> are<00:03:39.299> no<00:03:39.480> air

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
them just to make sure there are no air

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.220 
them just to make sure there are no air
pockets<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.000> makes<00:03:42.239> sure<00:03:42.329> that<00:03:42.870> they

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
pockets and that makes sure that they

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.620 
pockets and that makes sure that they
root<00:03:43.470> properly<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.790> tuck<00:03:45.329> them<00:03:45.450> in

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
root properly so I just tuck them in

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.440 
root properly so I just tuck them in
like<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.440> nicely<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.190> then<00:03:47.579> I'll<00:03:48.060> get<00:03:48.269> a

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
like that nicely and then I'll get a

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.750 
like that nicely and then I'll get a
plant<00:03:48.750> label<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.440> write<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.280> name<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.579> it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
plant label and write the name of it

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.430
