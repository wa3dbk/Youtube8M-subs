very good it was like a year and a half

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.230 
very good it was like a year and a half
maybe<00:00:21.779> two<00:00:22.080> years<00:00:22.260> ago<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.609> am<00:00:23.880> not

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
feel on it and I still get a lot of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.029 
feel on it and I still get a lot of
questions<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.420> like

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039
