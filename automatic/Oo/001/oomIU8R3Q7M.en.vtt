00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.800
 Hello guys 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.010
 I am jonas barbosa in that through 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.730
 android make a brief brief review 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.210
 summary of samsung galaxy s2 its version 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.500
 android 4.1.2 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.750
 the original version for Brazil speaks a 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.799
 bit of our main screen was little 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.909
 addressed to I think so we have 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:48.320
 now the recourse to reorganize our 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:53.519
 applications within folders 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.839
 one innovation that I could perceive is that 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.000
 in the folders 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.040
 in this main screen we have a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.510
 preview the applications that are there 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.290
 inside 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.040
 with this we can reorganize to 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.190
 have faster access even easier 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.350
 what's inside your folders 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.390
 making it even more sophisticated 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 If you like me I like to organize everything 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.830
 in folders with their respective subjects 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.900
 It's much easier but nice too. 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.050
 and organize a legal part also that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.430
 I found through our native player it 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.860
 has a function called a music room 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.710
 he takes our library that analyzes 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.940
 the songs based on the feeling that 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.610
 you are indisposed 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.340
 so you can choose from one 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 feeling for the other to do on a slide 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.979
 on and he went with it to 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.670
 music of color by the way we 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.110
 We choose to do a test here 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.110
 exciting to merry 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.850
 he pulls the songs through my 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.850
 library 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.680
 well cool, I already use the time and I like 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.680
 enough 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.380
 It's very cool. 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.480
 so people referring to that 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.480
 update is that there are many users of 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.090
 s2 only here on the portal that has 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.260
 enough comment that they do not know this 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.090
 version 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.870
 how official is she is yes official came to 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:52.270
 from samsung itself and what happens 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.620
 is that it is directly from the manufacturer 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.850
 this device was directly purchased 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.760
 from the samsung store and with that he does not 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.570
 was not associated with any 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.720
 operator here in Brazil the largest case 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.989
 of appliances that are sold to large 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.019
 The majority is from operators and 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.080
 operators receive this update 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.870
 is the carrier software to receive the 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.060
 update requires a course of the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.060
 and this does not always happen. 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:32.959
 I do not know or do not 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.850
 update but it is something that is 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:40.610
 carrier discretion 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:46.910
 there is a way for you to get the 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:49.459
 software is unlocked right unhitched the 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.540
 operator so that you can make your 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.190
 update 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.570
 but this I'll address in another post 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.760
 I hope you liked it, you can comment 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.440
 see you next time 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.440
 Many thanks, Tchetcha.
