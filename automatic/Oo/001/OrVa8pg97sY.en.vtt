patchbay<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.200> go<00:03:46.470> ahead<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.890> write<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.160> my

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
patchbay to go ahead and write on my

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.479 
patchbay to go ahead and write on my
audio<00:03:47.870> under<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.050> have<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.380> solid<00:03:50.190> state

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
audio under that I have a solid state

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.260 
audio under that I have a solid state
logic<00:03:51.500> alpha<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:53.010> think<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:53.760> think<00:03:53.970> that's<00:03:54.120> a

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
logic alpha I think I think that's a

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.780 
logic alpha I think I think that's a
Alpha<00:03:54.780> X<00:03:55.489> alpha<00:03:56.489> channel<00:03:58.459> that's<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.580> really

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
Alpha X alpha channel that's a really

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.360 
Alpha X alpha channel that's a really
good<00:03:59.940> tool<00:04:00.090> that's<00:04:00.239> really<00:04:00.510> clean<00:04:01.410> preamp<00:04:02.190> and

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
good tool that's really clean preamp and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.060 
good tool that's really clean preamp and
what<00:04:02.580> I<00:04:02.610> like<00:04:02.790> about<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.380> uh<00:04:04.410> it

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
what I like about it is that it it uh it

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.780 
what I like about it is that it it uh it
has<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.430> EQ<00:04:05.820> section<00:04:06.090> but<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.020> also<00:04:07.170> has<00:04:07.790> sends

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
has the EQ section but it also has sends

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.850 
has the EQ section but it also has sends
and<00:04:08.910> returns<00:04:09.270> that<00:04:10.140> I<00:04:10.170> really<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:10.830> about

basically<00:04:51.750> everything<00:04:52.200> in<00:04:52.350> approach<00:04:52.560> was<00:04:52.800> not

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
basically everything in approach was not

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.430 
basically everything in approach was not
everything<00:04:53.490> because<00:04:53.880> um<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.450> know<00:04:54.930> it's<00:04:55.290> a

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
everything because um you know it's a

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.270 
everything because um you know it's a
it's<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:56.600> it's<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.990> control<00:04:58.410> surface<00:04:58.740> not<00:04:59.010> a<00:04:59.070> work

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
it's a it's a control surface not a work

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.330 
it's a it's a control surface not a work
surface<00:04:59.490> but<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.480> definitely<00:05:00.780> does<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:02.010> does

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
surface but it definitely does that does

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.100 
surface but it definitely does that does
the<00:05:02.520> job<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:04.440> beside<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.490> as<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:05.790> see<00:05:06.060> is<00:05:06.330> that

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
the job and beside it as you see is that

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.470 
the job and beside it as you see is that
Lisa's<00:05:07.710> micron<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.550> really<00:05:09.030> like<00:05:09.150> that<00:05:09.360> because

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
Lisa's micron I really like that because

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.000 
Lisa's micron I really like that because
it<00:05:09.570> gives<00:05:09.750> me<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.960> lot<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.170> extra<00:05:10.560> sounds<00:05:10.890> that<00:05:10.980> I

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
it gives me a lot of extra sounds that I

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.250 
it gives me a lot of extra sounds that I
don't<00:05:11.250> have<00:05:11.460> him<00:05:11.670> any<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.300> my<00:05:12.420> other<00:05:12.540> modules

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
don't have him any of my other modules

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.530 
don't have him any of my other modules
and<00:05:13.620> I<00:05:14.610> mean<00:05:14.790> they<00:05:14.910> got<00:05:15.060> some<00:05:15.180> really<00:05:15.300> cool

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
and I mean they got some really cool

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.570 
and I mean they got some really cool
sense<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.840> don't<00:05:16.020> use<00:05:16.200> it<00:05:16.230> a<00:05:16.410> whole<00:05:16.590> lot<00:05:16.860> but

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
sense I don't use it a whole lot but

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.890 
sense I don't use it a whole lot but
when<00:05:17.730> I<00:05:17.760> do<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:18.060> mean<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:18.420> comes<00:05:18.600> in<00:05:18.720> handy

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
when I do I mean it comes in handy

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.840 
when I do I mean it comes in handy
because<00:05:19.050> like<00:05:19.830> i<00:05:19.950> said<00:05:19.980> it's<00:05:20.220> got<00:05:20.370> some<00:05:20.550> some

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
because like i said it's got some some

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.240 
because like i said it's got some some
crazy<00:05:21.180> sounds<00:05:21.750> on<00:05:21.870> there<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.290> as<00:05:22.950> you<00:05:23.100> can

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
crazy sounds on there and as you can

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.590 
crazy sounds on there and as you can
probably<00:05:23.280> see<00:05:23.610> in<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.820> background<00:05:24.090> over

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
probably see in the background over

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.930 
probably see in the background over
there<00:05:24.750> I<00:05:25.020> got<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:26.480> preamp<00:05:27.480> and<00:05:27.690> another<00:05:28.940> sound

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
module just sitting there not be any use

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.730 
module just sitting there not be any use
that's<00:05:32.040> a<00:05:32.250> that's<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.710> mpa<00:05:34.710> art<00:05:35.130> gold<00:05:36.740> preamp

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
that's a that's a mpa art gold preamp

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.040 
that's a that's a mpa art gold preamp
and<00:05:37.950> on<00:05:38.610> top<00:05:38.880> that's<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.300> there<00:05:39.720> should<00:05:39.900> be<00:05:39.930> a

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
and on top that's a there should be a

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.550 
and on top that's a there should be a
new<00:05:40.890> Proteus<00:05:41.610> one<00:05:41.970> if<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:42.840> like<00:05:42.870> like<00:05:43.410> I<00:05:43.500> said

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
new Proteus one if you like like I said

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.940 
new Proteus one if you like like I said
in<00:05:43.890> my<00:05:43.980> last<00:05:44.220> video<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.669> had<00:05:45.030> one<00:05:45.630> of<00:05:45.750> those<00:05:45.950> so

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
in my last video I had one of those so

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.530 
in my last video I had one of those so
that's<00:05:47.520> why<00:05:47.640> they're<00:05:47.820> not<00:05:47.970> being<00:05:48.210> used<00:05:48.390> right

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
that's why they're not being used right

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.710 
that's why they're not being used right
now<00:05:49.160> but<00:05:50.160> I<00:05:50.250> got<00:05:50.430> a<00:05:50.640> lot<00:05:51.000> of<00:05:51.030> stuff<00:05:51.330> so<00:05:51.510> I<00:05:51.540> just

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
now but I got a lot of stuff so I just

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.710 
now but I got a lot of stuff so I just

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
stick with what I really use right now

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.610 
stick with what I really use right now
