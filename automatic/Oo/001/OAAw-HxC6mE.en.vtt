those really cheesy actors this movie
didn't<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.390> any<00:01:39.540> cheesy<00:01:39.930> acting<00:01:40.460> from<00:01:41.460> all

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
didn't have any cheesy acting from all

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
didn't have any cheesy acting from all
actors<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:42.390> decent<00:01:42.570> Nicolas<00:01:43.380> Cage

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
actors it was pretty decent Nicolas Cage

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.350 
actors it was pretty decent Nicolas Cage
did<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.950> good<00:01:44.100> acting<00:01:44.579> job<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.590> movie<00:01:46.590> but

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
did a good acting job in this movie but

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.120 
did a good acting job in this movie but
overall<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.869> had<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.259> rate<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.560> movie<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
overall if I had to rate this movie I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.969 
overall if I had to rate this movie I
probably<00:01:50.880> give<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.030> two<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.750> half<00:01:51.990> or<00:01:52.380> three

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
probably give it two and a half or three

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.609 
probably give it two and a half or three
stars<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.520> five<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.570> because<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.320> movie

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
stars out of five just because the movie

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.090 
stars out of five just because the movie
storyline<00:01:56.399> wasn't<00:01:56.880> all<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.030> great<00:01:57.530> um<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
storyline wasn't all that great um it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.730 
storyline wasn't all that great um it
was<00:01:59.640> kind<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.939> boring<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.360> some<00:02:00.570> parts<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.320> 3d

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
was kind of boring in some parts the 3d

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.340 
was kind of boring in some parts the 3d
sucked<00:02:02.119> but<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.259> they

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
sucked but you know I think that they

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.690 
sucked but you know I think that they
could<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.590> done<00:02:04.619> more<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> storyline

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
could have done more with the storyline

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
could have done more with the storyline
than<00:02:05.880> they<00:02:06.030> did<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.079> action<00:02:07.560> scenes<00:02:07.799> in

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
than they did but the action scenes in

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.410 
than they did but the action scenes in
the<00:02:08.129> movie<00:02:08.160> were<00:02:08.610> pretty<00:02:08.819> d<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> graphics

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the movie were pretty d and the graphics

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
the movie were pretty d and the graphics
of<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.200> ghost<00:02:10.649> writer<00:02:10.890> was<00:02:11.160> pretty

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
of like the ghost writer was pretty

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.550 
of like the ghost writer was pretty
awesome<00:02:11.540> but<00:02:12.540> other<00:02:12.840> than<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
awesome but other than the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.260 
awesome but other than the
I<00:02:13.620> think<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.550> movie<00:02:14.790> could<00:02:14.910> have<00:02:15.000> been<00:02:15.090> better

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
I think the movie could have been better

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.210 
I think the movie could have been better
