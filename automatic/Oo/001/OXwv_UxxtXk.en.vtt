00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
because of the BPA's in the plastic are

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.380 
because of the BPA's in the plastic are
not<00:00:48.450> good<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:50.100> also<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> put

not good for you and also I like to put
the<00:00:51.600> wrapper<00:00:52.350> from<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.039> butter<00:00:53.250> over<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:56.870> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the wrapper from the butter over the the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
the wrapper from the butter over the the
measuring<00:00:58.289> cup<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.010> butter<00:00:59.190> tends

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
measuring cup because the butter tends

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.000 
measuring cup because the butter tends
to<00:00:59.730> splatter<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.629> being<00:01:00.840> melted<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to splatter up as it's being melted so I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.270 
to splatter up as it's being melted so I
just<00:01:02.219> cook<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.989> 1<00:01:03.989> minute<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.559> 20<00:01:04.710> seconds

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
just cook it for 1 minute and 20 seconds

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.700 
just cook it for 1 minute and 20 seconds
on<00:01:05.519> my<00:01:06.240> microwave<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.439> could<00:01:07.590> be

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
on my microwave but it could be

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.929 
on my microwave but it could be
different<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.310> your<00:01:08.400> microwave

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.700 

so<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.140> minute<00:01:13.469> in<00:01:13.649> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so that was just a minute in the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
so that was just a minute in the
microwave<00:01:13.859> instead<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.789> a<00:01:14.819> minute<00:01:14.999> 20<00:01:15.359> seconds

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
microwave instead of a minute 20 seconds

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.899 
microwave instead of a minute 20 seconds
and<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.710> butter<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.009> pretty<00:01:17.340> hot

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and the butter is pretty hot

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.429 
and the butter is pretty hot
what's<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> learner<00:01:18.569> to<00:01:18.719> be<00:01:18.840> pretty<00:01:19.079> hot<00:01:19.259> when

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
what's the learner to be pretty hot when

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
what's the learner to be pretty hot when
you<00:01:19.560> hear<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.219> pop<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.270> you'll

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you hear kind of pop in there you'll

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
you hear kind of pop in there you'll
feel<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.869> because<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> walk<00:01:22.409> video<00:01:22.710> mooster

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
feel that because the walk video mooster

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.699 
feel that because the walk video mooster
in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> butter<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.240> starting<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.600> top<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.109> you
