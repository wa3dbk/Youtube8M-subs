00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.160
 and 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.430
 everything is so no electric meter passed 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.990
 this station 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.990
 stop ghost station 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.269
 and Muscovites and guests of the capital 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 how it works in normal mode and ready 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.470
 day 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.080
 to listen but 70 thousand passengers 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.430
 new station is really good 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.170
 canned old underground 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.340
 part under the flight field tushinsky 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 the airfield was built in 1975 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.710
 and then Volokolamskaya was called then 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.480
 same in seventy fifth were going 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.910
 build a lobby but plans have changed 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.130
 connection with the cancellation of the decision to build 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.660
 residential complex works were 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.690
 mothballed in the area 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.630
 Tushino aero fields liven up station 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.080
 decided in 2012 when next to the airfield 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.360
 started building a sports arena at the very 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.820
 In fact, the tour of the station must begin 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.910
 from here from the opening stadium 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.500
 arena the fact is that the fate of the stadium 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.220
 no fate station tied directly 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.160
 by the way 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.240
 and their first baptism of fire they too 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:29.060
 got together on September 5th then us on 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.360
 she did not pass the first match Spartak serve 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.390
 at the star and through these doors here 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.520
 the lobby has entered 32 thousand people though 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.940
 if you look at the documents then even 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.789
 rush hour 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.740
 the station is capable of releasing only 7 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.110
 and a half by the way about the door 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.119
 these two are not called summer but 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.800
 these wintry because they are set 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.800
 only for winter for glass 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.620
 ground pavilion is very spacious with 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.050
 reckoning on a large influx of passengers in 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.600
 time sports competitions like all 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.480
 modern stations it is equipped with an elevator 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.090
 and lift for sedentary faces 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.490
 if in the theater it all starts with hanging it 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.920
 in the subway of course you can 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.630
 old-fashioned buy a ticket from the cashier but I 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.010
 I will use 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.760
 modern machine and by the way 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.220
 modern electronic card several 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.260
 words about what you can today in the subway 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.870
 use well of course if you often 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.210
 take advantage of this this ticket 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.670
 monthly that cheapest trip 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.150
 if a little less then you can 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.150
 card 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.560
 Well, cards can be replenished in the subway 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.319
 The feature of these turnstiles is 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.750
 in that they can work not only 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.240
 at the entrance but at the exit and the whole 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.240
 turnstile on i-ruler by vice versa 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.219
 so here with a large gathering of people 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:58.370
 this salvation on weekdays at the station 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:01.489
 little escalator is not the longest of 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.849
 those that I saw station Spartak station 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.540
 low lay just 10 meters from 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.280
 station to the surface 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.620
 when the station was reenergized 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.810
 much had to be done anew for example 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.200
 due to a significant amount of groundwater 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.299
 waters 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.650
 waterproofing had to cover not 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:24.709
 only the ceiling but also the walls and the station 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.650
 because of the abundance of columns of 26 pieces each 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.569
 A number of joke is called 40 legs built 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.519
 them in times of brezhnev when 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.290
 the economy was supposed to be economical so 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.019
 what if they finished it 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.510
 This station as the next Tushino was 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.989
 would be tiled with plain gray tiled 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.290
 tiles 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.500
 but everything turned out differently today Spartak 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.550
 more like a showroom 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.010
 football theme 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.310
 By the way Spartak's open symbolism 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.330
 arena home stadium club Spartak 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.850
 tried to use as much as possible 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.310
 less for the match and fans come 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.790
 different teams and not worth them once again 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.340
 provokes we are closely watching 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.010
 by the passengers themselves flow directly 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.890
 at the time of the event so let's say a wave in 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.890
 online mode is decided 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.600
 to ensure at some point 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.579
 reversing movement of escalators 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.459
 at some point expose extra 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.820
 ticket racks or express 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.820
 braids 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.439
 The main concern of the station factor is 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.759
 passenger safety that's why 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.840
 here on every column 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.189
 installed a video camera of all of them here 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.560
 120 with digital zoom 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:55.050
 arranged so that there are no dead 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.780
 zones for everything that happens at the station 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.860
 the duty officer can observe on the monitors 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.199
 his office room 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.259
 cherished and generally inaccessible to 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:10.490
 ordinary passengers seat passage deep into 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.469

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.840

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.490

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:57.479
