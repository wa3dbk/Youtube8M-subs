00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
this example we're just going to use

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.820 
this example we're just going to use
banjo<00:01:23.549> kazooie<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.380> make<00:01:25.380> sure<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.680> choose

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
banjo kazooie and make sure to choose

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
banjo kazooie and make sure to choose
the<00:01:26.070> save<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.700> actual<00:01:27.060> game<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> I'll

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the save not the actual game and I'll

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
the save not the actual game and I'll
say<00:01:27.840> save<00:01:28.080> game<00:01:28.380> copy<00:01:29.280> that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
say save game copy that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.679 
say save game copy that
to<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.869> cloud<00:01:31.320> saved<00:01:31.979> games<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> I'll<00:01:33.479> just

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
to your cloud saved games so I'll just

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.999 
to your cloud saved games so I'll just
take<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> second<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.560> pretty<00:01:34.799> quick

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
take a second it's pretty quick

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
take a second it's pretty quick
especially<00:01:35.310> since<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.000> saves<00:01:36.329> instead

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
especially since it just saves instead

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.890 
especially since it just saves instead
of<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.900> full<00:01:37.110> game<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.240> then<00:01:39.240> once<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.600> is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
of a full game and then once that is

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.440 
of a full game and then once that is
done<00:01:40.079> press<00:01:40.409> B<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.060> if<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.270> slow

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
done press B and if you have slow

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.700 
done press B and if you have slow
connection<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> might<00:01:43.020> take<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> while<00:01:43.409> I'm

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
connection it might take a while I'm

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.469 
connection it might take a while I'm
just<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> go<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.790> check<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.450> make
