00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 there are very good to all the boys and 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.479
 minecraft guys 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.800
 and this time I bring you how to make a 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:12.870
 series of things a refrigerator how to use 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.379
 the hook and the thread 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.750
 and a house without exit attention that this 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.200
 it's good first everything then we have with 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.590
 the refrigerator is worth seeing first I will do 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.619
 an example I give you how you can see me 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.100
 leaves a baked potato care 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.399
 baked potato to see what comes out now 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.350
 It must have ended this ' do not admire 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:44.620
 chicken chicken chicken chicken plus chicken and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.730
 now here the mechanism the button makes 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.380
 This rest time is already active 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:56.300
 redstone then active to activate him 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.940
 the one of this that would be the dispenser 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.410
 you buy well I put potatoes 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.360
 carrots steaks steaks and fish 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.790
 apple and everything and then when you 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.960
 I understand a lot but 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:20.280
 for learning 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:23.829
 I got it then and again it 's 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.909
 you can see another vein that simply 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.909
 you are also 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.070
 Get out of here 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.070
 here 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:43.680
 naughty but what makes the wool 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:47.070
 drives the objects and good 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.540
 it's already refrigerated it would be then 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.540
 let's go for him 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.530
 the thread hook 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.250
 this surely many people already know 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.250
 this is very simple 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.670
 this came out in the last update or 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.600
 the penultimate not of those and good look 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.600
 subscribe a little 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:18.420
 and he does it as a lever worth 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.810
 so what do you do how is the mechanism 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.640
 that 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.040
 goes around here and to the thread that is the hook 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.340
 activates the restón that goes down here 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.750
 around here around here and activate what 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.510
 that would be the pistones suárez 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.420
 and you can see they are activated when only 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.720
 when he passed over olive 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.319
 the thread would be free of spider also what 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.250
 same vale 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.620
 it has to be in a straight line 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.040
 where if you pass by here it does not do anything 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.410
 good ya 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.360
 we already know 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.360
 then let's put next 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.970
 that is the best way of that 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.930
 to a house with no way out for you 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:12.200
 friends and these people that is a bit troll 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.200
 and you like to troll then look at 10 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.210
 I enter 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.530
 and the boy says and nothing happens 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.720
 and the boy tried to go out and I can not no 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.280
 I can be worth this house because it can not 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.020
 leave because in it 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.030
 susan what would this be 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.380
 to navy of souls 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.140
 when you step, it represents you 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.310
 you get a little below the level 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.250
 normal and then when you try to upload 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.880
 here there is a little the difference and not you 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.090
 leave then that's what he does 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.349
 sa 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.349
 that can not go out and well there again 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:11.310
 I'll be back soon have to report that 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:14.400
 the surprise and thanks for watching the video and 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.049
 here you have a little 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.049
 and until another as always
