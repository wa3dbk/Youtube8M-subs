on the left or the right it doesn't
matter<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:12.420> yeah<00:01:12.840> I'm<00:01:12.960> gonna<00:01:13.080> give<00:01:13.260> an

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
matter but yeah I'm gonna give an

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
matter but yeah I'm gonna give an
example<00:01:13.710> run<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.420> should<00:01:15.450> look<00:01:15.659> like

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
example run of what it should look like

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.390 
example run of what it should look like
right<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.900> yeah<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.290> start<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> back<00:01:20.220> so

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
right now so yeah I start in the back so

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.770 
right now so yeah I start in the back so
I<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.670> mushrooms<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.299> could<00:01:21.479> take<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
I can get mushrooms so I could take the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
I can get mushrooms so I could take the
shortcut<00:01:22.229> because<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.740> across<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.220> dirt

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
shortcut because going across the dirt

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.520 
shortcut because going across the dirt
the<00:01:23.549> beginning<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.290> miserable<00:01:25.290> since

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the beginning would be miserable since

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.039 
the beginning would be miserable since
you<00:01:25.619> can't<00:01:25.830> use<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> bridge<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.900> these<00:01:27.900> are

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you can't use the bridge and these are

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.630 
you can't use the bridge and these are
the<00:01:28.140> only<00:01:28.320> three<00:01:28.680> pillars<00:01:28.890> right<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.400> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the only three pillars right here that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.010 
the only three pillars right here that
fall<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.000> lap<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.600> they're<00:01:30.750> pretty<00:01:30.840> much

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
fall on lap one so they're pretty much

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.190 
fall on lap one so they're pretty much
your<00:01:31.229> only<00:01:31.409> option<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.720> what<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.840> trick<00:01:34.020> off

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
your only option for what to trick off

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.690

little<00:01:43.320> shortcut<00:01:43.619> here<00:01:44.009> because<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> can't<00:01:44.850> do

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
little shortcut here because I can't do

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.580 
little shortcut here because I can't do
the<00:01:45.149> wall<00:01:45.329> glitch<00:01:45.570> since<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> blue<00:01:46.170> panels

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the wall glitch since the blue panels

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260 
the wall glitch since the blue panels
off-limits

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
off-limits

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.150 
off-limits
and<00:01:48.600> yeah<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> use<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.350> three<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.620> my<00:01:49.710> mushrooms

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
and yeah I use all three in my mushrooms

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.570 
and yeah I use all three in my mushrooms
and<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:51.180> go<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.200> side<00:01:52.410> right<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.340> bats

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
and I go on the side right here the bats

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.840 
and I go on the side right here the bats
can<00:01:53.910> be<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> real<00:01:54.330> pain<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.400> avoid

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
can be a real pain and I you know avoid

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.670 
can be a real pain and I you know avoid
hitting<00:01:57.300> both<00:01:57.630> whose<00:01:57.870> panels<00:01:58.170> by<00:01:58.290> doing<00:01:58.530> this

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
hitting both whose panels by doing this

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.310 
hitting both whose panels by doing this
right<00:01:58.980> here<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.550> I<00:02:00.450> only<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.720> one<00:02:00.780> mushroom

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
right here and I only have one mushroom

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.590 
right here and I only have one mushroom
which<00:02:01.440> kind<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.800> sucks<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.450> need

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
which kind of sucks because you need

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.150 
which kind of sucks because you need
like<00:02:03.810> two<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.440> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> dirt<00:02:04.890> when<00:02:05.070> you

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
like two to get out of the dirt when you

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.389 
like two to get out of the dirt when you
do<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.610> around<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:06.090> sign<00:02:06.300> thing<00:02:07.220> but<00:02:08.220> yeah

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
do this around the sign thing but yeah

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.830 
do this around the sign thing but yeah
it's<00:02:08.820> easier<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> hit<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> pillars<00:02:09.690> when

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
it's easier to hit the pillars when

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.750 
it's easier to hit the pillars when
you're<00:02:09.959> going<00:02:10.080> slowly<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.800> you'll<00:02:11.280> see<00:02:11.490> so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you're going slowly as you you'll see so

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.430 
you're going slowly as you you'll see so
these<00:02:12.090> four<00:02:12.390> probably<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.840> hardest<00:02:13.170> four<00:02:13.350> to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
these four probably the hardest four to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.890 
these four probably the hardest four to
hit<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.690> throw<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
hit so I get because they just throw you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.810 
hit so I get because they just throw you
really<00:02:16.320> random<00:02:16.650> directions<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.520> don't<00:02:17.670> do

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
really random directions if you don't do

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.240 
really random directions if you don't do
them<00:02:17.940> right<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:19.290> get<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.770> first<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
them right and I get the first in the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.380 
them right and I get the first in the
fourth<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.610> there<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.970> still<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.300> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
fourth one there so I still have the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.760 
fourth one there so I still have the
second<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.870> third<00:02:21.989> one<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.380> as<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.709> see

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
second and third one and as you can see

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.520 
second and third one and as you can see
I<00:02:22.890> went<00:02:23.100> entirely<00:02:23.489> around<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.150> arch<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.200> then

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
I went entirely around the arch and then

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.440 
I went entirely around the arch and then
I'm<00:02:25.980> getting<00:02:26.160> two<00:02:26.459> more<00:02:26.670> right<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.330> I've

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
I'm getting two more right here so I've

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.330 
I'm getting two more right here so I've
got<00:02:27.480> four<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.230> far<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.590> slap<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.190> get

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
got four so far this slap and then I get

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.550 
got four so far this slap and then I get
the<00:02:29.489> last<00:02:29.700> one<00:02:29.970> right<00:02:30.120> here<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:31.260> took<00:02:31.320> off

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the last one right here and I took off

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.960 
the last one right here and I took off
the<00:02:31.590> side<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.580> item<00:02:32.790> box

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the side of it so I can get the item box

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.229 
the side of it so I can get the item box
so<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> got<00:02:34.170> five<00:02:34.380> for<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.709> slap<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:36.090> can

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
so I got five for the slap and you can

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.670 
so I got five for the slap and you can
trick<00:02:36.420> off<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.690> same<00:02:36.870> ones<00:02:37.050> twice<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.500> you

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
trick off the same ones twice like you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.949 
trick off the same ones twice like you
could<00:02:37.830> trick<00:02:37.980> off<00:02:38.130> those<00:02:38.340> there's<00:02:38.670> no<00:02:38.959> penalty

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
could trick off those there's no penalty

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.860 
could trick off those there's no penalty
for<00:02:39.989> doing<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:41.459> yeah<00:02:42.360> once<00:02:42.600> again<00:02:42.840> I

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
for doing that and yeah once again I

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.770 
for doing that and yeah once again I
just<00:02:43.260> take<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.530> little<00:02:43.950> San<00:02:44.220> shortcut<00:02:44.780> to

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
just take that little San shortcut to

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.670 
just take that little San shortcut to
avoid<00:02:46.670> hitting<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.820> blue<00:02:48.060> panels<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.680> yeah

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
avoid hitting the blue panels and yeah

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.350 
avoid hitting the blue panels and yeah
you<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:49.980> see<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.220> CPU<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.610> already<00:02:51.060> pretty

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
you can see the CPU is already pretty

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360 
you can see the CPU is already pretty
far<00:02:51.570> ahead<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.140> last<00:02:52.440> lap<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.070> go<00:02:53.340> a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
far ahead but this last lap you can go a

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.920 
far ahead but this last lap you can go a
lot<00:02:53.670> quicker<00:02:53.730> since<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.420> don't<00:02:54.570> have<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.810> do

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
lot quicker since you don't have to do

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.670 
lot quicker since you don't have to do
this<00:02:55.110> any<00:02:55.830> like<00:02:56.250> restrictions<00:02:57.060> really

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
this any like restrictions really

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.960 
this any like restrictions really
there's<00:02:58.680> only<00:02:58.860> one<00:02:59.100> thing<00:02:59.250> left<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.519> do

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
there's only one thing left to do

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.460 
there's only one thing left to do
that's<00:03:00.450> like<00:03:00.600> out<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.049> way<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.380> that's

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
that's like out of the way and that's

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.500 
that's like out of the way and that's
hit<00:03:01.739> those<00:03:01.950> middle<00:03:02.459> two<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:03.030> three<00:03:03.269> pillars

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
hit those middle two and three pillars

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.330 
hit those middle two and three pillars
at<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.200> very<00:03:04.380> beginning<00:03:04.799> which<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.070> over<00:03:05.310> here

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
at the very beginning which is over here

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.039 
at the very beginning which is over here
and<00:03:05.760> right<00:03:05.970> here<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.209> could<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.570> chained<00:03:06.900> but

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
and right here I could have chained but

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.930 
and right here I could have chained but
I<00:03:07.110> was<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:07.739> wanted<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.220> make<00:03:08.459> sure<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.730> hit

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
I was I just wanted to make sure I hit

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.930 
I was I just wanted to make sure I hit
both<00:03:09.120> pillars<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.780> as<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.560> can<00:03:10.650> see<00:03:10.860> um<00:03:11.160> they

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
both pillars and as you can see um they

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.130 
both pillars and as you can see um they
could<00:03:12.120> really<00:03:12.330> screw<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.720> off<00:03:12.840> like<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.110> was

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
could really screw you off like I was

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.130 
could really screw you off like I was
barely<00:03:13.530> able<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.980> avoid<00:03:14.600> not<00:03:15.600> getting<00:03:15.959> not
