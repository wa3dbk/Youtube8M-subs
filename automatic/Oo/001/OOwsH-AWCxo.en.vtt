00:00:05.443 --> 00:00:08.906
 In this four-part series, you'll get insight into making one 

00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:13.006
 of the most anticipated titles throughout the game history. 

00:00:19.698 --> 00:00:22.410
 Welcome "Backstage Assassin's Creed III". 

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:25.867
 Episode Three: THE GAME IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE WAR 

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:30.295
 Connor is a brand new hero in the game, a brand new asasin. 

00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:36.115
 He's half a Native American and half European. 

00:00:36.184 --> 00:00:39.161
 We wanted to incorporate this fundamental contradiction into his past. 

00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:43.490
 What are you doing here? 

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:45.678
 And for the first time, he sets out on his journey. 

00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.316
 He has a very developed sense of what is good and what is bad. 

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:54.605
 It is driven by the desire to do good. 

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:56.945
 - Commander. - Connor. 

00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.221
 He fights for freedom and fights against tyranny. 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.933
 As Connor, as an assassin, you are an important part of the American Revolution. 

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:21.199
 We wanted to deal with historical characters to meet them during your pilgrimage. 

00:01:21.272 --> 00:01:24.036
 And in the way that history books usually do not. 

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:33.434
 Many founding fathers were highly argued by the people, many of them could be like modern bullies. 

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:41.120
 Our founding fathers were very disciplined, determined individuals who wanted freedom. 

00:01:41.176 --> 00:01:44.625
 We wanted to express them after theirs and not be limited. 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.894
 These founding fathers were good at war. They were warriors. 

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:52.238
 Do not shoot until you see the white of their eyes. 

00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:58.040
 Connor doesn't know much about European ways first, and then he learns about these people, about these heroic characters. 

00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:03.257
 For example, Washington. Connor sees this strong guy and believes him. 

00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:10.075
 Connor moves on the edge of revolution and the rest of history. Whenever he sees a conflict between two groups, 

00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:12.005
 he joins the better side. 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.989
 CREATING THE HERO 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:25.455
 As for the values ​​and language of the Mohawk, we have worked closely with the Mohawan consultant. 

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:31.435
 We are Kanien'kehá: ka and Kanien'kehá: ka means pauzour. 

00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:35.080
 And our language is called Kanien'kha. 

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:37.680
 The water is well guarded, Ratonhnhaké: tone. 

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:43.135
 Whenever he is with his people or in his village, he speaks this language, which I think is great. 

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.182
 Wait here for me. 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.019
 Connor, as a native American figure, is very close to the war clubs of the American natives, the tomahawk and the bow. 

00:02:55.914 --> 00:03:02.495
 He has a very developed sense of hunting and hitchhiking. He was brought up to be able to move in this environment. 

00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:09.736
 Connor has his power over his Mohawai ancestors. It is strong, agile, can move very fast in the forest. 

00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:11.710
 It is indeed his nature, it is his home. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.095
 We had a lot of different versions of Connor. At first he was very slim, then we inflated him by 

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.950
 that we added fur, cloaks, and so on. 

00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:30.329
 And instead of a slim assassin, we've got a guy done now. He's just a warrior every inch. 

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.358
 MOVEMENTS OF ASASINE 

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:48.484
 The animation team put together just for Connor over an hour of new animations. 

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:55.576
 We began to observe a considerable amount of military movements and traditional moves with the tomahawk. 

00:03:55.641 --> 00:04:02.766
 While watching, we thought it wasn't good enough. So we added brutality, but it wasn't just adding blood. 

00:04:09.692 --> 00:04:12.918
 We have invested a lot of time in movement elements and 

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:17.753
 we've completely redesigned our climbing system. We wanted it to be more organic. 

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:22.056
 It has a wide variety of options in terms of what it can climb and how. 

00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:25.583
 Connor's movements are directly inspired by the show jumping. 

00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:31.298
 The show jumping is basically just about the efficiency of the move, getting from point A to point B as quickly as possible. 

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:39.611
 When you see some show jumping movements, for example, when Connor makes lazy fall or diveral, those moves are very accurate. 

00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:44.054
 Connor moves in the game as I want to move in real life. 

00:04:56.012 --> 00:05:02.414
 We wanted Connor to specialize in two-handed combat. So both hands can use as well. He can fight both. 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.949
 When it runs, the earth shakes, and when it fights, people get wounds from left, right, and middle. He's very brutal. 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:24.907
 She's motivated by battle, she's brutal, and it's the kind of assassin that comes and kills without hesitation and unnecessary questions. 

00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:41.094
 Soldiers can't match Connor. Connor is a murder machine. It's like a ninja in a tank and a wolverine is standing against it. 

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:49.085
 Next time in the series "Behind the Scenes of Assassin's Creed III". 

00:05:49.153 --> 00:05:52.250
 AMERICA, AFTER THE SEA AND AFTER THE SEA 

00:05:54.027 --> 00:05:56.576
 When you have control of the sea, you have control over the entire conflict. 

00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:02.207
 What's new on Assassin's Creed III? Apparently new cities, New York and Boston. 

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:06.515
 It was a gamble. Every year you were at Hranice, whether you were to survive it or not.
