00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
with the shot that's been around for

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.310 
with the shot that's been around for
decades<00:00:12.309> in<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.490> last<00:00:14.169> seven<00:00:15.169> or<00:00:15.200> eight<00:00:15.259> years

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
decades in the last seven or eight years

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.279 
decades in the last seven or eight years
there's<00:00:16.010> been<00:00:16.370> available<00:00:16.640> a<00:00:17.150> new<00:00:17.480> version<00:00:17.990> the

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
there's been available a new version the

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.679 
there's been available a new version the
flu<00:00:18.439> vaccine<00:00:18.890> is<00:00:19.189> very<00:00:19.640> good<00:00:19.970> it's<00:00:20.449> not<00:00:20.630> a

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
flu vaccine is very good it's not a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.330 
flu vaccine is very good it's not a
shock<00:00:20.990> it's<00:00:21.260> not<00:00:21.439> a<00:00:21.470> needle<00:00:21.740> it's<00:00:21.920> just<00:00:22.220> a

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
shock it's not a needle it's just a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.269 
shock it's not a needle it's just a
sprain<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.000> it's<00:00:23.150> not<00:00:23.269> gonna<00:00:23.449> hurt<00:00:23.660> it<00:00:23.949> so<00:00:24.949> we

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
sprain so it's not gonna hurt it so we

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.279 
sprain so it's not gonna hurt it so we
like<00:00:25.519> that<00:00:25.699> virgin<00:00:26.300> vaccine<00:00:26.750> a<00:00:26.840> lot<00:00:27.050> for

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
like that virgin vaccine a lot for

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.140 
like that virgin vaccine a lot for
children<00:00:27.769> because<00:00:28.310> there<00:00:28.580> have<00:00:28.670> been<00:00:28.699> studies

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
children because there have been studies

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.570 
children because there have been studies
showing<00:00:29.179> that<00:00:29.599> actually<00:00:30.320> works<00:00:30.560> better<00:00:30.830> than

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
showing that actually works better than

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.209 
showing that actually works better than
the<00:00:31.880> flu<00:00:32.090> shot<00:00:32.419> for<00:00:33.129> children<00:00:34.129> especially

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
the flu shot for children especially

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.529 
the flu shot for children especially
young<00:00:34.579> children<00:00:35.920> we<00:00:36.920> hope<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.579> we<00:00:37.820> are<00:00:38.210> very

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
young children we hope that we are very

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.200 
young children we hope that we are very
successful<00:00:38.809> again<00:00:39.440> giving<00:00:39.860> out<00:00:40.010> is<00:00:40.430> really

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
successful again giving out is really

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.630 
successful again giving out is really
vaccines<00:00:41.629> we<00:00:41.809> possibly<00:00:42.230> can<00:00:42.469> but<00:00:43.190> we<00:00:43.399> know

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
vaccines we possibly can but we know

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.380 
vaccines we possibly can but we know
that<00:00:44.379> doctors<00:00:45.379> offices<00:00:45.920> can<00:00:46.640> only<00:00:46.820> do<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:47.210> much

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
that doctors offices can only do so much

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.540 
that doctors offices can only do so much
so<00:00:47.930> much<00:00:48.079> in<00:00:48.320> terms<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.829> giving<00:00:49.129> out<00:00:49.250> flu

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
so much in terms of giving out flu

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.660 
so much in terms of giving out flu
vaccine<00:00:50.170> we're<00:00:51.170> gonna<00:00:51.829> definitely<00:00:52.129> be<00:00:52.340> giving

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
vaccine we're gonna definitely be giving

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.279 
vaccine we're gonna definitely be giving
out<00:00:52.789> flu<00:00:52.969> shots<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.750> spray<00:00:53.989> in<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.140> nose

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
out flu shots and the spray in the nose

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.090 
out flu shots and the spray in the nose
version<00:00:54.710> but<00:00:55.399> what<00:00:55.670> what<00:00:56.090> New<00:00:56.600> Mexico<00:00:57.109> I<00:00:57.559> think

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
version but what what New Mexico I think

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.259 
version but what what New Mexico I think

program last year and may have helped
contribute<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.580> reduced<00:01:14.060> numbers

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
contribute to the to the reduced numbers

contribute to the to the reduced numbers
of<00:01:14.690> patients<00:01:15.380> who<00:01:15.950> came<00:01:16.460> out<00:01:16.640> was<00:01:16.790> fluent<00:01:17.180> in

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
of patients who came out was fluent in

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.520 
of patients who came out was fluent in
the<00:01:19.040> spread<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.490> flu<00:01:19.700> is<00:01:20.150> very<00:01:20.420> much

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the spread of flu is very much

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.730 
the spread of flu is very much
influenced<00:01:23.530> by<00:01:24.479> children<00:01:25.479> they<00:01:26.080> are<00:01:26.110> very

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
influenced by children they are very

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.070 
influenced by children they are very
very<00:01:27.040> good<00:01:27.130> at<00:01:27.670> spreading<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.690> influenza

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
very good at spreading the influenza

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.270 
very good at spreading the influenza
virus<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:31.270> community<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:32.710> not<00:01:33.100> only

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
virus to the community and so not only

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.550 
virus to the community and so not only
are<00:01:33.640> we<00:01:33.670> as<00:01:34.000> pediatricians<00:01:34.270> very<00:01:34.900> interested

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
are we as pediatricians very interested

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.920 
are we as pediatricians very interested
in<00:01:35.619> trying<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:36.070> protect<00:01:36.280> children<00:01:36.850> but<00:01:37.720> every

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
in trying to protect children but every

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.640 
in trying to protect children but every
time<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.440> child<00:01:38.770> gets<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.250> vaccine<00:01:39.760> for<00:01:40.650> other

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
time a child gets a vaccine for other

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.550 
time a child gets a vaccine for other
things<00:01:41.800> or<00:01:42.460> flu<00:01:43.000> we<00:01:43.869> know<00:01:44.050> that<00:01:44.380> they<00:01:44.530> are

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
things or flu we know that they are

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.890 
things or flu we know that they are
helping<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.340> prevent<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:46.060> spread<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.450> disease

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
helping to prevent the spread of disease

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.490 
helping to prevent the spread of disease
in<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.320> community<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.390> more<00:01:49.660> children

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
in a community and so the more children

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.580 
in a community and so the more children
get<00:01:50.740> vaccinated<00:01:51.310> for<00:01:51.610> flu<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:53.140> more<00:01:53.350> we're

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
get vaccinated for flu the more we're

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.800 
get vaccinated for flu the more we're
going<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.830> provide<00:01:54.280> protection<00:01:54.970> for<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.539> most

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
going to provide protection for the most

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.779 
going to provide protection for the most
vulnerable<00:01:56.229> in<00:01:56.770> community<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.430> that's<00:01:57.610> the

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
vulnerable in community and that's the

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.499 
vulnerable in community and that's the
elderly<00:01:58.440> course<00:01:59.440> anyone<00:02:00.039> who's<00:02:00.369> has<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.090> health

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
elderly course anyone who's has a health

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.880 
elderly course anyone who's has a health
condition<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:02.080> next<00:02:02.350> time<00:02:02.500> particularly

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
condition the next time particularly

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.520 
condition the next time particularly
vulnerable<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.610> influenza<00:02:03.940> viruses<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:05.289> so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
vulnerable to influenza viruses and so

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.790 
vulnerable to influenza viruses and so
there's<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.830> tremendous<00:02:06.100> reward<00:02:06.970> for<00:02:07.840> children

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
there's a tremendous reward for children

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.660 
there's a tremendous reward for children
getting<00:02:09.009> vaccinated<00:02:09.640> for<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.030> influenza
