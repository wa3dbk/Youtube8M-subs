00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
in the morning and by the afternoon it

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.890 
in the morning and by the afternoon it
was<00:01:38.520> already<00:01:38.700> bubbling<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:39.509> pulling<00:01:39.720> up

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
was already bubbling and then pulling up

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.710 
was already bubbling and then pulling up
at<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> edges<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.820> wanted<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> love

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
at the edges so I really wanted to love

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840 
at the edges so I really wanted to love
the<00:01:42.899> formula<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> product<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the formula and the product but I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
the formula and the product but I
couldn't<00:01:45.240> make<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.360> work<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> ended<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.409> not

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
couldn't make it work so I ended up not

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.340 
couldn't make it work so I ended up not
using<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.310> probably<00:01:47.939> used<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.689> third<00:01:48.990> or

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.100 
the road I just wanted to have a
realistic<00:03:46.190> expectation<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:47.209> how<00:03:47.900> this

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
realistic expectation of how this

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.930 
realistic expectation of how this
product<00:03:48.380> was<00:03:48.650> gonna<00:03:48.770> wear<00:03:48.980> for<00:03:49.190> me<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.520> I'm

product was gonna wear for me and I'm
just<00:03:49.970> super<00:03:50.780> impressed<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:52.370> goes<00:03:52.640> on<00:03:52.970> really

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
just super impressed it goes on really

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.949 
just super impressed it goes on really
smoothly<00:03:54.230> I'm<00:03:54.650> going<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:54.920> show<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.959> brush

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
smoothly I'm going to show you the brush

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.780 
smoothly I'm going to show you the brush
that<00:03:57.230> this<00:03:57.410> comes<00:03:57.650> with<00:03:57.770> so<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.310> little<00:03:58.610> lid

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
that this comes with so the little lid

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.030 
that this comes with so the little lid
just<00:03:59.030> pops<00:03:59.750> up<00:03:59.959> like<00:04:00.320> a<00:04:00.350> coin<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.739> try<00:04:00.920> and

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
just pops up like a coin to try and

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.540 
just pops up like a coin to try and
twist<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.489> off<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.910> have<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.890> see<00:04:04.459> if

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
twist that off and I have it and see if

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.699 
twist that off and I have it and see if
I<00:04:04.610> can<00:04:04.760> do<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:05.120> without<00:04:05.330> getting<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.380> Polish

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
I can do this without getting the Polish

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.070 
I can do this without getting the Polish
all<00:04:06.860> over<00:04:07.040> me<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.489> has<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.730> really<00:04:08.090> nice<00:04:08.450> flat

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
all over me it has a really nice flat

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.100 
all over me it has a really nice flat
and<00:04:09.470> wide<00:04:09.800> brush

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
and wide brush

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.170 
and wide brush
it<00:04:11.740> looks<00:04:11.950> like<00:04:12.130> this<00:04:13.770> so<00:04:14.770> it<00:04:15.370> goes<00:04:15.640> on<00:04:15.880> with

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
it looks like this so it goes on with

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.390 
it looks like this so it goes on with
just<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.540> couple<00:04:16.720> swipes<00:04:17.140> because<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.980> how<00:04:18.160> wide

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
just a couple swipes because of how wide

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.430 
just a couple swipes because of how wide
the<00:04:18.670> brush<00:04:18.850> is<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.299> wasn't<00:04:19.750> sure<00:04:19.900> about<00:04:20.019> this<00:04:20.260> at

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
the brush is I wasn't sure about this at

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.990 
the brush is I wasn't sure about this at
first<00:04:20.590> but<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:20.920> really<00:04:21.430> liked<00:04:21.640> it<00:04:21.670> I've<00:04:21.910> been

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
first but I really liked it I've been

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.550 
first but I really liked it I've been
seeing<00:04:22.300> this<00:04:22.420> a<00:04:22.480> little<00:04:22.780> bit<00:04:22.960> more<00:04:23.080> often<00:04:23.440> in

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
seeing this a little bit more often in

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.490 
seeing this a little bit more often in
different<00:04:23.710> polishes<00:04:24.420> the<00:04:25.420> first<00:04:25.870> coat<00:04:26.170> went

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
different polishes the first coat went

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.330 
different polishes the first coat went
on<00:04:26.590> very<00:04:26.980> shiny<00:04:27.460> very<00:04:27.760> smooth<00:04:28.740> but<00:04:29.740> once<00:04:30.190> it

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
on very shiny very smooth but once it

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.650 
on very shiny very smooth but once it
dries<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.610> it's<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.940> little<00:04:31.120> bit<00:04:31.240> duller<00:04:31.450> you

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
dries it it's a little bit duller you

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.350 
dries it it's a little bit duller you
definitely<00:04:32.200> need<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.470> second<00:04:32.830> coat<00:04:33.040> I<00:04:33.360> didn't

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
definitely need the second coat I didn't

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.030 
definitely need the second coat I didn't
find<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.630> neither<00:04:34.840> three<00:04:35.170> you<00:04:35.560> might<00:04:35.770> want

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
find that neither three you might want

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.490 
find that neither three you might want
to<00:04:36.100> do<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.370> for<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.700> but<00:04:36.910> for<00:04:37.120> for<00:04:37.840> me<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.230> was

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
to do that for you but for for me to was

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.160 
to do that for you but for for me to was
plenty<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.100> like<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.460> said<00:04:39.520> super<00:04:40.420> durable<00:04:40.840> it

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
plenty and like I said super durable it

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.550 
plenty and like I said super durable it
was<00:04:41.290> like<00:04:41.410> a<00:04:41.440> coat<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.710> armor<00:04:42.130> for<00:04:42.340> my<00:04:42.430> nails<00:04:42.640> I

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
was like a coat of armor for my nails I

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.170 
was like a coat of armor for my nails I
took<00:04:44.560> this<00:04:44.680> off<00:04:44.860> last<00:04:45.130> night<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:45.700> reapplied

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
took this off last night and reapplied

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.850 
took this off last night and reapplied
it<00:04:46.300> today<00:04:46.540> because<00:04:46.720> I<00:04:46.960> wanted<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.350> be<00:04:47.470> nice<00:04:47.650> and

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
it today because I wanted to be nice and

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.520 
it today because I wanted to be nice and
fresh<00:04:48.160> for<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.970> video<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.110> was<00:04:50.320> shooting

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
fresh for the video that I was shooting

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.550 
fresh for the video that I was shooting
today<00:04:50.860> but<00:04:51.850> I<00:04:52.030> probably<00:04:52.450> could<00:04:53.080> have<00:04:53.110> skipped

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
today but I probably could have skipped

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.560 
today but I probably could have skipped
that<00:04:53.680> just<00:04:54.460> for<00:04:54.640> purposes<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.419> know<00:04:55.540> a

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
that just for purposes you know a

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.390 
that just for purposes you know a
filming<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.169> how<00:04:56.290> closely<00:04:56.980> you're<00:04:57.100> going<00:04:57.310> to

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
filming and how closely you're going to

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.980 
filming and how closely you're going to
see<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:57.910> you<00:04:58.330> might<00:04:58.510> not<00:04:58.720> have<00:04:58.840> noticed

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
see it and you might not have noticed

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.850 
see it and you might not have noticed
any<00:04:59.290> difference

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
any difference

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.110 
any difference
I<00:04:59.890> definitely<00:05:00.250> felt<00:05:00.640> like<00:05:00.760> I<00:05:00.790> needed<00:05:01.000> a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
I definitely felt like I needed a

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.260 
I definitely felt like I needed a
refresher<00:05:01.270> after<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.200> week<00:05:02.470> but<00:05:02.820> it's<00:05:03.820> just

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
refresher after a week but it's just

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.630 
refresher after a week but it's just
such<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.540> great<00:05:04.750> formula<00:05:05.140> and<00:05:05.650> my<00:05:06.040> nails<00:05:06.310> just

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
such a great formula and my nails just

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.820 
such a great formula and my nails just
feel<00:05:06.820> so<00:05:07.060> protective<00:05:07.630> with<00:05:07.750> this<00:05:07.900> on<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.410> I

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
feel so protective with this on and I

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.710 
feel so protective with this on and I
like<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.220> it<00:05:09.340> just<00:05:09.370> adds<00:05:09.700> a<00:05:09.880> little<00:05:10.090> bit<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:10.630> a

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
like that it just adds a little bit of a

a<00:05:32.620> nail<00:05:33.160> coat<00:05:33.520> let's<00:05:33.760> be<00:05:33.940> honest<00:05:34.270> but<00:05:35.080> the

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
a nail coat let's be honest but the

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.830 
a nail coat let's be honest but the

perfect formula pink gel Cup is $30 and
this<00:05:38.320> was<00:05:38.590> $24<00:05:39.520> so<00:05:40.030> it<00:05:40.150> six<00:05:40.450> dollars<00:05:40.600> less<00:05:41.110> a

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
this was $24 so it six dollars less a

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.550 
this was $24 so it six dollars less a
bottle<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:41.919> in<00:05:42.400> my<00:05:42.580> opinion<00:05:42.729> a<00:05:43.570> far<00:05:44.290> and<00:05:44.470> away

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
bottle and in my opinion a far and away

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.060 
bottle and in my opinion a far and away
better<00:05:45.130> formula<00:05:45.760> so<00:05:46.620> for<00:05:47.620> me<00:05:47.710> it<00:05:47.800> was<00:05:47.890> worth

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
better formula so for me it was worth

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.130
