all right today we're going to do a

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.350 
all right today we're going to do a
wall-mount<00:00:01.740> tutorial<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.120> before

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
wall-mount tutorial this is the before

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.059 
wall-mount tutorial this is the before
shot<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.810> our<00:00:04.049> living<00:00:04.350> room<00:00:04.560> which<00:00:04.740> was<00:00:04.890> rather

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
doing now first start off with the rails

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.190 
doing now first start off with the rails
the<00:00:47.670> rails<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.090> slide<00:00:48.420> guides<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:48.989> right

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the rails have slide guides on the right

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.930 
the rails have slide guides on the right
side<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.860> bolt<00:00:50.100> those<00:00:50.280> down<00:00:50.430> first<00:00:50.700> that

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
side and I bolt those down first that

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
side and I bolt those down first that
allow<00:00:51.120> me<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> adjust<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.230> space<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
allow me to adjust to space out the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.889 
allow me to adjust to space out the
rails<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.730> back<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.120> TV<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.600> make<00:00:54.719> sure

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
rails on the back of the TV to make sure

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.139 
rails on the back of the TV to make sure
it's<00:00:55.050> even<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.190> count<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.489> holes<00:00:56.730> figure<00:00:57.059> out

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
it's even so count your holes figure out

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
it's even so count your holes figure out
where<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.449> Center<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.800> tighten

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
where it's Center and then just tighten

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.520 
where it's Center and then just tighten
them<00:00:59.100> down<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> grab<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.719> articulate<00:01:01.140> arm<00:01:01.320> make

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
them down so grab it articulate arm make

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.470 
them down so grab it articulate arm make
sure<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> hooks<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.250> actually<00:01:02.670> hook<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.300> up

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
sure the hooks that actually hook it up

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.329

hitting<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.880> stud<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:50.170> sometimes<00:01:50.500> that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
hitting a stud because sometimes that

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.710

the hole make sure you then pull out the
piece<00:03:24.599> of<00:03:24.750> drywall<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.739> now<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.189> begin

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
piece of drywall and now we can begin

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.399 
piece of drywall and now we can begin
feeding<00:03:26.819> our<00:03:27.060> cables<00:03:27.420> from<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.659> top<00:03:27.840> down<00:03:28.230> to
