00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:11.350
 Yes Today is this Opinel's 10th 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.680
 I'm going to make this a black past 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.740
 What is black rust processing? 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.910
 This 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:25.970
 It is the opinel this leaves of carbon steel 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:29.070
 Originally , red rust comes out by being wrapped in this black rust 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.029
 It will be something to prevent 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.079
 So immediately Yeah I First, a 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.879
 this 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.810
 I wonder if I say that this lock ring I think let's remove it 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.470
 hey 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:49.390
 Yari spread it while twisting a little way by implanting the door Well, that needle-nose pliers it here 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:53.710
 If you do it while it is like this, it will be second to none 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.040
 That's right I missed it like this 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.370
 Next is this this crimped pin 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.470
 8 people who will try to pull this out 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.290
 I wonder if is better to use Mita 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.290
 I'm open, I'm a little bit more convenient and sander Jackie 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.050
 I think that it is good with some 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.130
 After that, it was difficult to see the border of a little 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.659
 Yeah Monet was shaved 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.710
 And hit it with a hammer 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.620
 I'm going to float the pin 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.710
 It is why are out 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:48.490
 I do not have a little tool money, but it may be a man plus driver 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.490
 I will try to use this pliers for a moment 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.550
 I understand a little bit and pull back a little so it's easy 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.810
 It's here mon 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.290
 In such Fu do it 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 Since the pin will come floating 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.670
 Said it was, but it 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.670
 Place to say 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.980
 this 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.550
 That there is a nipper something with this principle 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.660
 It is not easy to do interest 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.660
 I would say that weaning eat Shon 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.790
 def 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.090

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.730
 I removed a wave 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.909
 I think let's degreased leaves from if you have to do so now 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.720
 Yes, I 'm degreasing, but I also like this brake cleaner 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.260
 I will try to use a parts cleaner 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.020
 Quite powerful 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:01.310
 If you can't finish the soup well here 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.490
 It means that it will be a reorganization
