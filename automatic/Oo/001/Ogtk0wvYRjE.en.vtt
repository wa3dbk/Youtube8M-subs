00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hello everyone today, again talking about 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.099
 Shoe repair more precisely a shoe hook in 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.370
 the process of working hook dumbass it needs 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.760
 tweak tweak and manually 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.640
 but it can be a thankless task 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.539
 laborious so i usually do it on 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.970
 machine for this i have two lo 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.650
 such here circle 1 felt 2 wooden 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.460
 the felt circle is good but it has a pair 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.790
 deficiencies 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.239
 firstly it's pretty soft and when on 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.579
 you rule the hook gradually in it 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.860
 grooves are produced besides because 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.710
 the fact that he is soft, he floods the edge 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.829
 hooks my hooks are sharpened so 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 they mean blades and this blade 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.870
 cuts if the chrome falls down the blade 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.180
 gradually getting dumb already 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.699
 stops cutting so you have to 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.019
 drag all the same on hard circles on 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.820
 plywood but on felt only 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.770
 correct and so I decided to show how 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.200
 plywood circle is made this circle is mine 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.220
 has long been working since my time 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.549
 shoe practice 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:23.070
 Well, yesterday shot the video were pieces 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:26.280
 plywood and from them i make a circle where 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.979
 I will do it a little differently 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.439
 just plywood because on plywood 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.979
 Lent lasts not very good it's hard to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.130
 to put 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.670
 I make a plywood circle which will 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.770
 covered with a thin layer of leather 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.670
 here I already smeared the glue circle itself 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.850
 prepared a leather strip one edge i 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.210
 cut to nothing dumped on granite 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.310
 slab 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.850
 This is done so that the second edge 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 which will overlap 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:02.750
 did not give here a hump now I pasted over 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.750
 this circle is a ribbon of skin 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:19.100
 the main thing is to glue on the rotation 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:21.410
 otherwise it can tear it off today 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.650
 pretty hot on the flight clutches 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.270
 very quickly so with a hairdryer i don't 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.340
 warming up warm up the arm 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.640
 edge 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.940
 here the circle is already ready the seam is trimmed and now 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.450
 left him post fasting 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.380
 State Optical Institute 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.700
 made based on chromium oxide and stearin 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.780
 therefore, it can be applied in two ways 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.459
 either heat or dilute in someone 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.190
 kerosene solvent is easier to heat 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.520
 so I just give her a hairdryer and on 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.520
 corpse 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.410
 here I twist the sharp enough one more 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.570
 more small addition yet 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.500
 I mounted the video here in PM 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.230
 asked questions and one of the questions was 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.100
 about what to do like 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.630
 adaptations needed lathe in 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.490
 I have a lathe I have it 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.710
 use but when i didn't have 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:05.540
 lathe i treated more 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:07.110
 simple simpler methods let's say 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.140
 year and shaft 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.190
 it is good but if it is not possible 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.210
 make you can make wow out of the ordinary 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.620
 studs 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.010
 metric outer diameter i cut out on 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.950
 band saw can be cut out with a jigsaw 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.740
 but after that I grind if not 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.080
 Opportunities can be machined in a circle 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.460
 put on a drilling machine either on 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:40.590
 drill to take a very rough sandpaper 4036 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.680
 grain to nail him on the board and turning 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.650
 at maximum speed 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.860
 drill well or machine grind it 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.820
 sandpaper is the only requirement that 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.260
 the door must be fixed tightly and 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.400
 sandpaper must be on some 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.280
 massive bar 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.680
 so that when you grind it you 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.150
 did not jump and you did not succeed 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.090
 eccentric another option if not 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.210
 I want to bother with sandpaper 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:16.340
 here are the cheap chinese 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:23.160
 crowns here for example here in the set there 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:24.570
 64 she will cut a circle with a diameter of it 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.230
 fifty nine millimeters 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.570
 that is enough 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.630
 and in the blood will immediately hole on 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.960
 6 it will need only a little bit 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:37.900
 increase but before you drill 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.250
 crown in order to oh but not stuck out 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.890
 from this side but if you use 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.550
 the bottom surface needs to be done along the bottom 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.830
 friction it can be done either 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.490
 first drill again cheap 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.990
 in chinese 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.170
 either forstner drill hero advantage 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.960
 of oz a hole is not an end surface 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:03.340
 smooth opera she will be slightly sloping but 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:07.690
 it does not affect absolutely nothing well and after 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.430
 how this circle will be assembled again 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.620
 do put it on 3rd on boring 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:22.210
 machine and twist trim sandpaper 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:25.020
 here perhaps all this addition 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.020
 thanks to all
