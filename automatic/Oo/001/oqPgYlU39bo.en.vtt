fun firebolt so I don't know whether
that's<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.340> even<00:01:27.000> if<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> original<00:01:27.390> ones

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that's just even if the original ones

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.130 
that's just even if the original ones
same<00:01:28.140> size<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:30.150> feet<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.570> same<00:01:30.840> size

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.720 
annoying because my original had that as
well<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.530> one<00:02:22.799> has<00:02:22.980> metal<00:02:23.310> feet<00:02:23.519> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
well so but this one has metal feet and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.520 
well so but this one has metal feet and
my<00:02:23.819> original<00:02:24.180> were<00:02:24.299> near<00:02:24.510> plastic<00:02:25.019> which<00:02:25.349> is<00:02:25.500> a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
my original were near plastic which is a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.270 
my original were near plastic which is a
difference<00:02:27.799> transformation<00:02:28.799> is<00:02:28.830> poor<00:02:29.069> legs

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
difference transformation is poor legs

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280 
difference transformation is poor legs
down<00:02:29.430> z<00:02:29.730> pull<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.060> feet<00:02:30.209> out<00:02:30.450> pull<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.959> arms

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
down z pull the feet out pull the arms

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.470 
down z pull the feet out pull the arms
out<00:02:31.410> twist<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.980> arm<00:02:32.129> round<00:02:32.540> like<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.129> then<00:02:35.129> you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
out twist the arm round like so then you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.360 
out twist the arm round like so then you
have<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.720> lift<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> front<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.069> car

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
have to lift the front and the car

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.869 
have to lift the front and the car
forward<00:02:39.379> rotate<00:02:40.379> then<00:02:40.680> rotate<00:02:41.310> ahead<00:02:41.640> and

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
forward rotate then rotate ahead and

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.860 
forward rotate then rotate ahead and
click<00:02:42.180> then<00:02:43.140> twist<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.620> waist<00:02:43.890> piece<00:02:44.280> around

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
click then twist the waist piece around

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.430 
click then twist the waist piece around
like<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:48.480> then<00:02:49.819> click<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.849> head<00:02:51.440> into

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
like so and then click the head into

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.770 
like so and then click the head into
place<00:02:52.680> pull<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.190> arms<00:02:53.459> forward<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.790> second<00:02:54.180> and

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
place pull the arms forward a second and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.390 
place pull the arms forward a second and
then<00:02:54.810> rotate<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.799> back<00:02:56.150> around<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:58.190> there<00:02:59.190> is

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
then rotate the back around and there is

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.509 
then rotate the back around and there is
hot<00:02:59.819> rod<00:03:00.440> very<00:03:01.440> nice<00:03:01.680> thing<00:03:01.950> I'll<00:03:02.099> just<00:03:02.280> put

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
rod now onto the transformation of shore

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.300 
rod now onto the transformation of shore
shot<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:22.019> know<00:03:22.139> i<00:03:22.169> haven't<00:03:22.620> seen<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:25.310> youtube

pull back the feet and there you have
the<00:03:41.190> first<00:03:41.639> bit<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.359> transformation<00:03:43.109> next

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
the first bit of the transformation next

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.039 
the first bit of the transformation next
you<00:03:43.620> want<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:45.150> want<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:46.370> spin<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.639> right

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
you want to you want to spin the right

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.170 
you want to you want to spin the right
the<00:03:49.049> front<00:03:49.440> feet<00:03:49.739> their<00:03:50.220> wheels<00:03:50.519> backwards

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
the front feet their wheels backwards

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.409 
the front feet their wheels backwards
like<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.280> then<00:03:54.169> then<00:03:55.169> you<00:03:55.319> want<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.560> slide<00:03:55.980> down

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
like so then then you want to slide down

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.020 
like so then then you want to slide down
the<00:03:57.419> whole<00:03:58.019> back<00:03:58.530> piece<00:03:58.560> down<00:03:59.340> about<00:03:59.819> an<00:03:59.940> inch

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.569 
the whole back piece down about an inch
maybe<00:04:00.810> less<00:04:01.790> next<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.030> thing<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.329> do<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.780> you

maybe less next the thing you do is you

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.369 
maybe less next the thing you do is you
rotate<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.730> arms<00:04:06.090> out<00:04:06.269> from<00:04:06.750> behind<00:04:07.049> the

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
rotate the arms out from behind the

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.879 
rotate the arms out from behind the
spoiler<00:04:07.889> like<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.049> pull<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.229> spoiler<00:04:10.680> back

spoiler like so pull the spoiler back
and<00:04:11.220> really<00:04:11.489> reviews<00:04:12.000> head<00:04:12.299> pull<00:04:12.840> down<00:04:13.049> the

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
and really reviews head pull down the

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.900 
and really reviews head pull down the
arms

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
arms

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.280 
arms
and<00:04:15.910> then<00:04:16.480> you<00:04:16.570> have<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.810> pull<00:04:16.989> out<00:04:17.019> their

and then you have to pull out their

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.100 
and then you have to pull out their
hands<00:04:17.709> this<00:04:18.220> most<00:04:18.639> figures<00:04:18.970> dude<00:04:20.549> like<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:22.110> and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
hands this most figures dude like so and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.129 
hands this most figures dude like so and
then<00:04:23.139> I'll<00:04:24.010> just<00:04:24.040> transform<00:04:24.760> firebolt<00:04:25.450> short

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
then I'll just transform firebolt short

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.030 
then I'll just transform firebolt short
