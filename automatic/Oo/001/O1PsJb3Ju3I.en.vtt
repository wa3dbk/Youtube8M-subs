00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
about Manny Machado ericsson because

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.129 
about Manny Machado ericsson because
that's<00:04:06.699> what<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.060> build<00:04:07.419> a<00:04:07.510> team<00:04:07.720> around<00:04:07.810> that

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
that's what I build a team around that

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.470 
that's what I build a team around that
is<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.379> main<00:04:08.590> focus<00:04:08.919> of<00:04:09.220> this<00:04:09.849> entire<00:04:10.209> team

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
is the main focus of this entire team

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.720 
is the main focus of this entire team
and<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:11.019> main<00:04:11.199> bulk<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:11.829> how<00:04:11.980> much<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.400> costs

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
and the main bulk of how much it costs

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.520 
and the main bulk of how much it costs
like<00:04:12.849> stellar<00:04:13.510> under<00:04:13.750> 30k<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.139> think<00:04:14.319> this<00:04:14.440> team

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
like stellar under 30k I think this team

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.640 
like stellar under 30k I think this team
cost<00:04:14.769> about<00:04:14.919> 850<00:04:15.699> so<00:04:16.510> Erickson<00:04:17.079> is<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.229> huge

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
cost about 850 so Erickson is a huge

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.860 
cost about 850 so Erickson is a huge
portion<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:19.000> honestly<00:04:19.389> don't<00:04:19.599> think<00:04:19.660> it's

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
portion and honestly don't think it's

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.110 
portion and honestly don't think it's
that<00:04:19.900> good<00:04:20.139> like<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.590> really<00:04:21.400> wasn't<00:04:21.669> impressed

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
that good like I really wasn't impressed

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.880 
that good like I really wasn't impressed
I'd<00:04:22.330> I'd<00:04:22.630> actually<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.349> used<00:04:23.500> his<00:04:23.620> normal

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
I'd I'd actually just used his normal

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.159 
I'd I'd actually just used his normal
