00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.500
 in this lesson I will talk about the younger merry widow if you followed a 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.820
 sun lesson where the majority is very easy to understand this shot 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.619
 uh i recommend you 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.789
 always learn though if 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.399
 see the route 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.109
 I have constructive say of the scale shell command to where they come from that is 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.109
 where they are generated in some way 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 therefore beyond the importance that is, you are more 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.850
 important 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.710
 the abandonment of walking, I see, greater in terms of use 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.600
 certainly the best in music today that we listen to much more 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.180
 endeavored 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.530
 maria vs logo of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.620
 of origin cell where this scale arrived, in other words, where and how it comes 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.190
 generated 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.360
 is 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.390
 the environment used the women festival under the major scale and for the scale 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.340
 less natural there is relative greater or lesser 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.020
 even I see them I have had sex with her older sister there is a relative 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.100
 minor hunting vice versa 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.460
 make a relative unique and minor sell in tribute 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.270
 I look forward to it now 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.600
 the death of the high dictionary in short on 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.960
 I was on the site 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.220
 there is an explanation that makes us understand 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 as the major scale falls 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.440
 the best good life comes from the greatest memory 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.930
 if this is cold 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.480
 the oc using the relative technique if you don't know what it is to go 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.920
 to see lesson on 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.070
 post on natural 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.070
 What is explained to you about radio is less 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.530
 starting guide to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.930
 but using the same nowtorrents we will have to scale 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.460
 pedophilia in the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.270
 however, essentially stone 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.340
 in short, you want to understand, there is a more empirical way if I do a scale of do 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.050
 pentatonica maggiore paradores mi sol la do do 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.810
 if I do that of wool 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.719
 pentatonic zara a 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.719
 sleep the sun came 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.469
 ss9 but starting from 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.719
 the boxes are the same 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.059
 used 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.269
 for the major pentatonic then 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.829
 comments 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.219
 only the starting point changes 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.529
 from the site you can download 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.009
 in fact the box and that 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:39.509
 you will notice 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.589
 if n9ne are from within a circle they are those of the - league 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.339
 greater if we start instead the small square 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.479
 they are that minor renoir 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.099
 comments 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.099
 I agree. 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.549
 ok if you notice this scale 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:09.389
 still use see we are the boxers and in any case of the major you box 2 level 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.709
 that we got the natural minor 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.439
 so there are always 5 boxers that divide an instrument into 5 parts 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:24.430
 to ... we will take lessons to see how these boxes can be connected 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.219
 among them 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.609
 hote register these two agreements which are the minor 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.609
 rt the only one. 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.039
 and on these the lesser use agreements of the 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.029
 it is a very scale where mortgage installment satan but also in the blus 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.749
 immediately remembers a sub use 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.810
 but we will see the scale used also on 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.310
 so many other agreements and not only in the blue up then 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.779
 a scale in absolutely to study to memorize would accept well i 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.099

 lavender gifts the biggest bib 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.419
 less to memorize 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:09.749
 lido ve starting pentatonic question otherwise it will be difficult to do later 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.749
 more advanced use

 it is also used together with other scales 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.930
 so for now 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.120
 using when I read the boxer you find on the site 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.060
 noel tried in short - ibiza reques hi5 box su then we'll see how it's possible 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.330
