nine times out of ten without any death
but<00:01:37.300> again<00:01:37.930> we're<00:01:38.140> doing<00:01:38.350> this<00:01:38.440> for<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.680> reason

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
but again we're doing this for a reason

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.700 
but again we're doing this for a reason
because<00:01:39.190> this<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.729> something<00:01:39.910> I<00:01:40.240> think<00:01:40.300> that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
because this is something I think that

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.670 
because this is something I think that
well<00:01:41.850> firstly<00:01:42.850> we<00:01:43.030> need<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.300> ability<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.899> deal

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
well firstly we need the ability to deal

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.639 
well firstly we need the ability to deal
with<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.520> problem<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:45.970> FK<00:01:46.569> is<00:01:46.780> if<00:01:46.990> you

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
with the the problem of FK is if you

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.380 
with the the problem of FK is if you
don't<00:01:47.679> know<00:01:47.920> what<00:01:48.069> I<00:01:48.100> mean<00:01:48.340> basically<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.209> lot

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
don't know what I mean basically a lot

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.090 
don't know what I mean basically a lot

they may shoot somebody wants they're
not<00:02:00.429> go<00:02:00.580> FK<00:02:00.819> behind<00:02:01.599> the<00:02:01.720> wall<00:02:01.899> where<00:02:02.170> they

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
not go FK behind the wall where they

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.589 
not go FK behind the wall where they
know<00:02:02.440> they<00:02:02.619> can't<00:02:02.800> be<00:02:02.950> got<00:02:03.130> out<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:04.479> know<00:02:04.569> and

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
know they can't be got out you know and

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.359 
know they can't be got out you know and
it's<00:02:04.990> just<00:02:05.050> very<00:02:05.410> annoying<00:02:05.830> because<00:02:06.069> the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
it's just very annoying because the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.650 
it's just very annoying because the
problem<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:06.910> we<00:02:07.119> just<00:02:07.149> keep<00:02:07.450> losing

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
problem is is that we just keep losing

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.290 
problem is is that we just keep losing
matches<00:02:08.110> because<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:08.770> these<00:02:08.890> people<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
matches because of these people so the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.910 
matches because of these people so the
reason<00:02:10.720> we're<00:02:10.840> doing<00:02:10.959> this<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.530> figure<00:02:11.709> out

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
reason we're doing this is to figure out

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.890 
reason we're doing this is to figure out
a<00:02:11.950> way<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.220> maybe<00:02:12.610> deal<00:02:13.090> with<00:02:13.330> them<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.810> know

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
a way to maybe deal with them now I know

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.660 
a way to maybe deal with them now I know
family<00:02:14.440> Flyers<00:02:14.680> are<00:02:15.010> going<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.400> switched

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670

troll me too much this is really just a
show<00:02:23.740> firstly<00:02:24.700> they're<00:02:24.849> broken<00:02:25.090> mechanic

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
show firstly they're broken mechanic

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.729 
show firstly they're broken mechanic
because<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.020> shouldn't<00:02:26.230> be<00:02:26.380> able<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.620> even

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
because you shouldn't be able to even

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.949 
because you shouldn't be able to even
kill<00:02:27.040> people<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.480> secondly<00:02:28.840> I

kill people like this and secondly I

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.510 
kill people like this and secondly I
think<00:02:28.989> it's<00:02:29.260> also<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.590> experiment<00:02:30.310> with<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
think it's also to experiment with the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.850 
think it's also to experiment with the
mechanics<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.120> explosives<00:02:31.720> because<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.709> know

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
mechanics of explosives because you know

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.350 
mechanics of explosives because you know
when<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.280> kind<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.640> see<00:02:33.880> what<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.120> can<00:02:34.239> do

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
when you kind of see what you can do

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.720 
when you kind of see what you can do
with<00:02:34.480> grenades<00:02:34.870> basically<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.860> know<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.280> would

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
with grenades basically you know I would

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.270 
with grenades basically you know I would
say<00:02:36.940> maybe<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.360> success<00:02:38.349> rate<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.770> maybe<00:02:39.010> one

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
say maybe the success rate is maybe one

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.880 
say maybe the success rate is maybe one
in<00:02:39.430> every<00:02:39.550> five<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.750> may<00:02:41.020> do<00:02:41.080> damage<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.709> your

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
in every five you may do damage to your

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.330 
in every five you may do damage to your
target<00:02:42.360> but<00:02:43.360> again<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:44.110> needs<00:02:44.440> fixing<00:02:45.040> so

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
target but again this needs fixing so
