hi spike Sullivan here again and I've

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.750 
hi spike Sullivan here again and I've
got<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> request<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> half<00:00:23.010> break<00:00:23.400> which

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
got a request to do a half break which

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.269 
got a request to do a half break which
is<00:00:23.939> basically<00:00:24.390> pulling<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.710> top<00:00:25.920> part<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
is basically pulling up the top part of

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.630 
is basically pulling up the top part of
your<00:00:26.340> hair<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:28.070> just<00:00:29.070> braiding<00:00:29.400> half

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
your hair up here and just braiding half

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.150 
your hair up here and just braiding half
of<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:29.970> hair<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.539> guess<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.439> why<00:00:32.130> it's

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
of your hair I guess that's why it's

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.420 
of your hair I guess that's why it's
called<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.579> half<00:00:32.730> break<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:36.050> it's<00:00:37.050> very<00:00:37.680> simple

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
called a half break and it's very simple

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.380 
called a half break and it's very simple
to<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.670> big<00:00:41.670> thing<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:45.239> just

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.650 

just<00:01:34.550> like<00:01:34.730> you<00:01:34.850> do<00:01:35.000> with<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.270> rest<00:01:35.480> of<00:01:35.570> your

now once you get it up like that you can

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.149 
now once you get it up like that you can
pull<00:01:48.390> from<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.510> hair<00:01:49.690> down<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:49.900> little<00:01:50.229> bit<00:01:50.470> so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
pull from the hair down a little bit so

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.440 
pull from the hair down a little bit so
it's<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.400> little<00:01:51.580> bit<00:01:51.670> more<00:01:51.790> comfortable<00:01:52.300> so

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
it's a little bit more comfortable so

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.240 
it's a little bit more comfortable so
it's<00:01:52.600> not<00:01:52.720> too<00:01:52.930> tight

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.249 

and<00:01:57.250> that's<00:01:57.640> pretty<00:01:57.850> much<00:01:57.970> all<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.780> need<00:01:59.020> to

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
and that's pretty much all you need to

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.950 
and that's pretty much all you need to
do<00:01:59.580> in<00:02:00.580> order<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.850> get<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.210> half<00:02:01.420> brain<00:02:01.780> I

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
do in order to get that half brain I

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.070 
do in order to get that half brain I
guess<00:02:02.290> you<00:02:02.590> can<00:02:03.090> braid<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.360> if<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.720> wanted

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
guess you can braid that if you wanted

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.960 
guess you can braid that if you wanted
to<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.429> go<00:02:09.580> that's<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:11.970> that's

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
to but there you go that's the that's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.910 
to but there you go that's the that's
the<00:02:13.060> half<00:02:13.300> braid<00:02:13.600> let<00:02:13.750> me<00:02:13.810> try<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.110> do<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.800> from

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the half braid let me try and do it from

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.210 
the half braid let me try and do it from
the<00:02:15.069> backside<00:02:16.290> let's<00:02:17.290> see<00:02:17.530> if<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.769> helps<00:02:17.950> you

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the backside let's see if that helps you

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.210 
the backside let's see if that helps you
a<00:02:18.280> little<00:02:18.400> bit<00:02:18.610> more

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:43.690 

pull<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.850> up<00:02:25.940> with<00:02:26.150> that

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.630
