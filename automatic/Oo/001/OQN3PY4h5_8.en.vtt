00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.899
 please wise fall 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.179
 your comment i briefly met two 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.130
 leader zone so the match was 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.340
 uncompromising both teams wanted 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.289
 win think that the first half may 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.230
 to be some degree our big 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.210
 advantage bola although initiative 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:26.310
 passed from hand to hand enough 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.539
 not bad and acted top in pressure 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.369
 Generally scored a goal but then unexpected 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.649
 in the locker room to not that he is a little 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.219
 discouraged talents are gone yet in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.440
 themselves came somewhere a sweat falcon pursed 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.660
 from the first minute but then in general 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.640
 playing again leveled to remove a 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.840
 Further, in general, there it is clear to one 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.260
 wicket and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.110
 it is a pity that they realized those moments 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.510
 we had not only that to equalize 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.510
 snatch this match such a comment 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.309
 conscious spa ball here is one or 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.540
 position of central defender period 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.960
 she is the center back 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.810
 Well, of course, consciously in general, how can 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.009
 such steps doing unconscious it were 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:24.659
 the indication they are generally understandable was that 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.970
 need games shock game from the flanks 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.409
 little guys about here did not understand 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.320
 pushing what fought top central 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.570
 defender such was the goal 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.970
 he had a good head to play well there were moments 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.250
 unfortunately or in the rubble there is no ball 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.070
 wandered near the rods everywhere the goalkeeper 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.070
 should highlight your very fishing pole on the lyre 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.439
 I do not want to comment on such matches I 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.659
 I think you need to be sufficiently qualified for 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:01.310
 judge to send so that he does not spoil 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.530
 In general, the drawing and effort of the two teams 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.239
 enough to remember how he almost 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.310
 appointed Neville's free sword goalkeeper 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:12.590
 discouraged i think here just even 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.230
 I do not want to comment on here should be more 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.610
 serious level for such matches 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.610
 forward arbitrators 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.849
 okay coming quite right to say with 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.829
 the parachute was 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.159
 Well, in general, there was a blow on the sly 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:37.120
 and that's all that is our player has risen 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:42.670
 before it was a strike basil after stopping 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.549
 games, I generally have such things that 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.930
 comment but you saw everything with us 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.659
 top near 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.280
 and no one sure shouted anything there the judge 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:58.180
 I saw it myself because it was 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:01.019
 frankly your next opponent 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.019
 Metallurgist Vyksa 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.480
 nothing will be here now 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.480
 about him studying him and preparing for him 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.380
 thank you please
