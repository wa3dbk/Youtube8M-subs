00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.900 
it really depends on where you are in
your<00:01:20.530> pregnancy<00:01:20.860> whether<00:01:21.400> you're<00:01:21.580> in<00:01:21.670> first

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910

second<00:01:22.510> or<00:01:22.600> third<00:01:22.660> trimester<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.830> what<00:01:24.460> your

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
second or third trimester and what your

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
weight is prior to pregnancy so you

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.330
