00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.140
Hello, next to us is Billy 
with his Starlet Turbo.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.880
Hello Mano

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.060
Can you tell us a few things 
about your car?

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.100
Its a Starlet EP70

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.060
Its the first FWD Starlet in
production fron Toyota, in 1985.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.440
It now has a 1600cc engine,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.440
It has forged pistons and a 
turbo 2871 from Garrett

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.420
ECU unit and wiring from KMS

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.680
It has 380hp to the wheels.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.630
Very nice..

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.030
So who is responsible for
building this project?

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.870
The car has been built entirely
from Stroked up garage, by Sotiris,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.100
He is known for other projects on Starlets,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.010
He did everything, the engine, the pipes, intercooler, exhaust, everything custom made.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.270
Who tuned the ECU?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.720
It was made by GearTech by mr Zompolas,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.910
he made two configurations,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.670
one as a race use, the car pulls 380whp,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.070
and one for daily usage where 
the car pulls 350whp.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.060
Very nice.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.160
In which class do you compete
on dragster events?

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.000
I compete in class "11sec",

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.670
At a street class, with full interior,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.010
and it did 11.4" despite facing some problems, 
which I believe we can solve next time.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.100
Do you prefer the track or the road?

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.060
Definately the track even
if we all begun from the streets,

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.040
but there are many races nowadays

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.090
and we should race there for our safety.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.240
How long did it take to make this project?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.270
This setup was difficult. The 1600cc 
engine is from a Corolla.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.070
It took three months to built. Its like
a Corolla inside a Starlet.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.020
All the mounts was custom made so everything
could fit inside the car.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.120
Is there someone you want to thank
for this project?

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:13.210
Ofcourse, there is Sotiris from Stroked-Up.gr,
Dimitris Zachos, Nick Mamas, 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.110
Thanasis Oikonomopoulos, Manolis Mpalantinakis,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:25.060
and Paris from Performance parts shop, who have
helped with many spare parts and sponsorships.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.100
Thank you Bill..

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.130
Thank you Manos.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.000
Lets see now what the car can do.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.020
Sure, we will do a run while you guys film it,
but the car will be running at 350whp.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.120
Easy. Ok here we go...
