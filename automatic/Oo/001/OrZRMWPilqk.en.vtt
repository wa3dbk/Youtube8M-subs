00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.030
 we only talk about that 38 million 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.370
 pink paper like these are going soon 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.410
 disappear finally soon little by little 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.900
 stone henry brandet welcome thank you to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.960
 Ministry of the Interior indeed we are going 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.369
 able to throw this old license for the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.350
 new permit you are going to us 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.939
 present them looks like what you 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.340
 have it in your hands so it's a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.769
 new license much more secure 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.710
 than that the three pink shutters 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.980
 currently credit card format and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.530
 it's a unified license in europe it's 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.329
 to say that all drivers will have 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.129
 Europeans will soon have the same license 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.870
 will have a day then it takes everything from 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.520
 not even throw for now m the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.559
 permit says rob howley he's still 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.120
 valid until 2033 it will be done 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.440
 gradually much safer so 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.280
 this new license wholesale that's it 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.530
 easily rim is falsifiable yes it's 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.899
 obvious that the permit three boleros this 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.239
 as we know it is the document 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.340
 perhaps the most easily falsifiable 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.080
 and therefore the most falsified one needed 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.220
 to react it was necessary to react it is beautiful the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.720
 reason why is there is this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.100
 new secure license it's a small 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 technology jewel actually aryan 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.450
 electronic chip there was behind there 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.030
 will have what concretely in this crisis 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.439
 which takes place and who has fed and who 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.780
 feeds a lot of fantasies and but 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.909
 for now this chip 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 yes but I'm going to go there it's 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.240
 for the moment it only contains 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.869
 information that is visible on the front 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.299
 and on the back 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.740
 ie the identity the civil status the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.530
 rights to drive motorcycle converter 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.390
 by public transport wolf or super lot 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.090
 finally the different categories the 15 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.409
 European categories and why a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.850
 chip because we had the choice 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.710
 could have very well not put this 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.090
 chip because well it's a smart 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.100
 which will perhaps integrate tomorrow 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.750
 services anyway a number 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.640
 information or allow the user 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.409
 to consult a number of things 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.270
 so it's also a bet on the future and 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.000
 to say that we make it a flexible tool 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.399
 adaptable that we can precisely 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.430
 still modernize in the future but he 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.350
 we will also be able to 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.820
 number of points then advance them for 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.500
 the moment we could very well imagine 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.730
 finally the driver's life on 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.920
 this chip for now it's not 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.320
 the case with regard to the balance of 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.780
 points either but this permit is going to be 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.360
 sent directly to home 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.910
 so it will take more to go to prefecture 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.890
 to get it delivered and from here on 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.959
 end of the year the new holders 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.030
 of this permit will receive at the same time as 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.430
 the permit a code allowing to 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.470
 view the balance of points on 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.890
 internet so here too an improvement 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.230
 many touts this new license 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.570
 still it's tiny 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.870
 if we compare with m because if we take 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.459
 not lose it much more easily 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.440
 how did it do that decided who has 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.700
 decided on the size that decided we 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.040
 still kept a little hue 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.070
 pink like our old one anyway 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.690
 French then setting up this 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.520
 enabled the answer to a real rebound to 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.670
 the application of a European directive 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.700
 2006 to be applied to the 19 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.200
 January 2013 to January 19th we put in 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.360
 place the new categories 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.190
 European Union we were not able to 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.019
 issue the permit card format 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.660
 credit but it's europe that decided 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.650
 to harmonize and impose the choice of 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.230
 credit card format 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.180
 after there was the declination we go 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.310
 say by country that allowed to have a 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.720
 number of sophistication us that 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.640
 was the choice of chip and countries 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.160
 who did not do it but it's 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.840
 really to answer the application 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.019
 of the European directive and then a 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.940
 strong need to secure this title 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.890
 so concretely how is going to be done 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.600
 the change between our old permits and 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.930
 this new permit a map format of 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.790
 credit 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.610
 so everything that goes on and that goes 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.030
 pass from Monday 16 January 16 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.209
 September the permit will receive this 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.070
 format there all those who are drivers 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.450
 special categories including 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.440
 public transit that have tours 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.959
 regular 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.640
 there too they will see each other at the moment of 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.920
 renewal of the books and the new 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.870
 allowed for those who have had the permit 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.180
 transitional pink trifold there 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.070
 we issued between January 19 the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.360
 September 16 of this year with the 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.310
 new European categories we're going 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.650
 make the changes quietly in 2014 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.620
 and then for the majority 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.890
 of us and our fellow citizens 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.680
 will 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.169
 again from 2015 knowing that the 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.060
 permit is valid for 20 years and so we are going 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.470
 not see disappears when we think about 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.820
 made discount that we can also change 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.889
 the picture that is often a fruit 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.840
 photo 1000 18 years old so then sealed 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.289
 it is also the fashion where we are very beautiful 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.600
 at his 18 years I do not deny but in 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.600
 In any case there will be a period of validity 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.180
 of this permit a renewal 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.310
 it was 5 10 or 15 years old who was 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.600
 proposed by the European Union we 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.680
 has made the choice of a renewal all 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.960
 the fifteen years that will allow particular 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.400
 update at the address is obviously 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.960
 why so these two names back it wants 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.820
 to say that now we had the same 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.590
 allowed a lifetime unless we lost 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.330
 and that is to say like a year every 15 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.550
 years will be forced as papers 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.710
 of identity to renew it without for 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.180
 as much iron google code done 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.900
 proof of your medical visit either 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.910
 for the moment 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.039
 Yet neither of us not 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.780
 visit no medical visit outside 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.490
 medical visits on some on 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.810
 some countries and that on some permits 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.160
 by rows and it continues 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.259
 but in France for the moment no 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.760
 standard is saying that absolutely not be it 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:16.070
 absolutely it has not been 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.440
 decided it will cost really more 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.940
 if we start changing the license all 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.220
 15 years is an expense 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.770
 extra for it's going wilt is already 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.090
 to the used or so it's strictly 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.340
 it costs everyone because 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.020
 it's costing the community but the 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.120
 permit is there as soon as this 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.990
 allowed she and she is free and the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.630
 free but it's true that 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.580
 actually compare to the cost of 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.510
 a few euros from the old permit the 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.979
 three pink shutters 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.010
 we really have a sophisticated product 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.900
 whose production is close to 30 euros 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.789
 so that's really when I said 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.940
 little gem of technology that's when 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.380
 even a title that is every shot of 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.849
 15h to xi cost money 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.159
 yes of course of course in session of 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.010
 Restrictive crisis economy 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.670
 additional tax budget is 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.550
 this good 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.040
 yes but also in these times where there is 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.530
 a documentary fraud that is 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.790
 and the duty of the prices 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.620
 if you really are the priority of 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.780
 spend money on the ground 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.250
 it is not the fact of spending already there is 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.870
 complying with a directive 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.730
 European so it is still 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.630
 something that is imposed on us and 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.550
 then fight against fraud 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.310
 documentary fight against 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.990
 delinquency since stealing the passion wall 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.060
 identity or the theft of a license 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.530
 or the falsification of a permit it can 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.480
 have dramatic consequences for 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.900
 those who are for those who are 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.940
 victims 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.470
 it is also the duty of the 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.450
 public authorities than to put in place 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.940
 tools for our fellow citizens that they 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.860
 are tools that are safe and adapted to the 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.520
 times both at risk and then to 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.560
 the modern era 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.910
 so yes it is an expense that is 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.980
 certainly therefore it costs how much 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:51.000
 of funny states to what at the time then 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.260
 the calculation again is a calculation that 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.430
 it must also take into account the 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.250
 renewal is very difficult 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.240
 because the renewal of the stock is going 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.430
 take time there was a 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.050
 regular renewal of permits 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.670
 three shutters so difficult to a few 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.040
 better calculate and have a figure 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.750

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.230
 expense that is consistent but it's 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.010
 also a tool we needed 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.630

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.910
 discover over the months in our 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.200
