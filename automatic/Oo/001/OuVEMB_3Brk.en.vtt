00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 Sound 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.099
 Let's take a look at the codes that come out of Roy Keim's mind to forget. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.260
 I'll do it 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.330
 Let's take a look at the code from the first part. 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.199
 c6 code 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:29.400
 This way, the flat on line 4 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:35.579
 Grab your fingers and hold your fingers with this line of 3 plus 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:40.380
 And line 6, line 5, with no sound, line 4 to fingering 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 You can hear this sound. 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:49.500
 Next, the Dion f Sharcord is used here with the middle finger 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.460
 Half-off 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.910
 Well, you can press the base. 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.899
 Dion f smaller've played this way 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.860
 Next, this minor seven code 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:10.740
 f # Please hold off the base seam is coming 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.740
 I got coming in this manner 5 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.470
 No rat coded b code 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.250
 Hold your b-base with your forefinger. 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.250
 In this way, I took a look at the Horde . 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.110
 Next, the ca dei code 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:36.580
 This is the kind of thing you have to take care of 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.960
 With support fee, you can go directly to c base 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.960
 I got it. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.710
 Let's take a look at the code that follows. 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:53.800
 Take the next minute cross code as it gives r yesin down daerong 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.870
 Then I know, including Edna d code 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.420
 Catch coming back in the new state 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.420
 You can give me your finger. 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.740
 The key code also appears. 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.970
 The minor chord to the next negative lead 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.540
 Then the c code 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.049
 Next, the b minor code 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.049
 Sound 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.230
 Next is a minor code 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.010
 That concludes the code description. 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.010
 U 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.010
 U 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.010
 U 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.940
 U
