started with the enchantment libraries
so<00:00:11.940> uh<00:00:12.170> now<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.500> chairman<00:00:13.830> libraries<00:00:14.400> only<00:00:14.790> go

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
so uh now in chairman libraries only go

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.480 
so uh now in chairman libraries only go
up<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.120> 30<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.630> level<00:00:16.619> 30<00:00:16.830> will<00:00:17.039> always<00:00:17.279> be<00:00:17.430> at

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
up to 30 and level 30 will always be at

the bottom so you don't like keep like
clicking<00:00:19.680> over<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.100> over<00:00:20.160> again<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.430> that

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
clicking over and over again for that

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.450 
clicking over and over again for that
specific<00:00:20.970> level<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:21.689> um<00:00:21.869> see<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.340> can

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
specific level but um see as you can

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.009 
specific level but um see as you can
take<00:00:23.609> our<00:00:23.760> protection<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.390> from<00:00:24.539> level<00:00:24.810> 30

string when you walk across it creates a
redstone<00:01:19.890> signal<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.880> could<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.060> used<00:01:21.299> open

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
redstone signal so it could be used open

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.350 
redstone signal so it could be used open
a<00:01:21.689> door<00:01:21.960> set<00:01:22.650> off<00:01:22.770> TNT<00:01:23.100> trap<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.970> these<00:01:24.150> will

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
a door set off TNT trap and these will

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.810 
a door set off TNT trap and these will
be<00:01:24.509> found<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.869> jungle<00:01:25.170> temples<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> next

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.130 
like Iron I get an or from iron so I'm
not<00:04:11.080> going<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.320> get<00:04:11.410> XP<00:04:11.800> gold<00:04:12.610> I<00:04:12.940> get<00:04:13.630> an<00:04:13.750> orphan

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
not going to get XP gold I get an orphan

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.650 
not going to get XP gold I get an orphan
gold<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.620> I'm<00:04:14.710> not<00:04:14.830> going<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.070> get<00:04:15.190> XP<00:04:15.570> what<00:04:16.570> if

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
gold so I'm not going to get XP what if

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.420 
gold so I'm not going to get XP what if
I<00:04:16.780> do<00:04:16.840> something<00:04:17.110> like<00:04:17.380> red<00:04:17.739> zone<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.280> just

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
I do something like red zone and just

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.900 
I do something like red zone and just
watch<00:04:18.580> that<00:04:18.790> xt<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.150> are<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:21.280> can<00:04:21.400> see<00:04:21.610> I'm

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
watch that xt you are you can see I'm

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.600 
watch that xt you are you can see I'm
slowly<00:04:22.180> getting<00:04:22.360> XP<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:23.860> think<00:04:23.950> x-rays

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
slowly getting XP so I think x-rays

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.480 
slowly getting XP so I think x-rays
they're<00:04:25.120> just<00:04:25.330> gonna<00:04:25.890> consist<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:27.040> cell<00:04:27.280> yet

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
they're just gonna consist of cell yet

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.280 
they're just gonna consist of cell yet
but<00:04:28.090> as<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.300> can<00:04:28.360> see<00:04:28.570> for<00:04:28.750> stuff<00:04:28.900> like<00:04:28.990> lapis

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
but as you can see for stuff like lapis

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.290 
but as you can see for stuff like lapis
redstone<00:04:29.830> coal<00:04:30.070> yet<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.550> get<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:30.970> like<00:04:31.120> you

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
redstone coal yet to get it like you

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.290 
redstone coal yet to get it like you
don't<00:04:31.420> stop<00:04:31.720> burnt<00:04:32.080> miss<00:04:32.290> smelting<00:04:32.740> furnace

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
don't stop burnt miss smelting furnace

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.290 
don't stop burnt miss smelting furnace
so<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:35.020> works<00:04:35.370> so<00:04:36.370> I'm<00:04:36.430> ready<00:04:36.640> Ike<00:04:36.730> level<00:04:37.060> 4

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
so that works so I'm ready Ike level 4

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.600 
so that works so I'm ready Ike level 4
off<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:37.810> mining<00:04:38.230> a<00:04:38.350> couple<00:04:38.680> stuff<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:41.310> x<00:04:42.310> rays

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
off just mining a couple stuff so x rays

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.460 
off just mining a couple stuff so x rays
yeah<00:04:43.000> they're<00:04:43.450> going<00:04:43.570> to<00:04:43.630> be<00:04:43.720> like<00:04:43.840> level<00:04:44.200> 30

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
yeah they're going to be like level 30

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.370 
yeah they're going to be like level 30
easily<00:04:44.950> that's<00:04:45.940> why<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.180> think<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.750> level<00:04:46.960> 13

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
easily that's why I think the level 13

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.570 
easily that's why I think the level 13
jam<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:47.800> table<00:04:48.100> ideas<00:04:48.340> not<00:04:48.640> so<00:04:49.030> smart

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.480 

but<00:04:53.479> you<00:04:53.569> get<00:04:53.659> the<00:04:53.720> most<00:04:54.199> XP<00:04:54.620> from<00:04:54.800> diamonds<00:04:55.099> I

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
but you get the most XP from diamonds I

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.330 
but you get the most XP from diamonds I
think<00:04:55.819> the<00:04:56.030> second<00:04:56.539> most<00:04:56.830> vile<00:04:57.830> image<00:04:58.099> test

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
think the second most vile image test

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.990 
think the second most vile image test
lapis<00:05:00.069> second<00:05:01.069> most<00:05:01.219> from<00:05:01.400> emeralds<00:05:01.849> and

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
lapis second most from emeralds and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.610 
lapis second most from emeralds and
lapis<00:05:02.509> and<00:05:03.789> reds<00:05:04.789> image<00:05:05.689> test<00:05:05.960> read<00:05:06.139> so<00:05:06.349> DN

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
lapis and reds image test read so DN

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.080 
lapis and reds image test read so DN
then<00:05:07.219> red<00:05:07.430> stone<00:05:07.729> and<00:05:08.259> then<00:05:09.259> pull<00:05:09.909> so<00:05:10.909> the

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
then red stone and then pull so the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.360 
then red stone and then pull so the
diamonds<00:05:11.599> emeralds<00:05:11.810> lapis<00:05:12.439> red<00:05:12.800> stone<00:05:13.039> cold

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370
