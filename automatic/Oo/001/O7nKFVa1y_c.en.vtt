00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:13.009
 since its foundation in 1987 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.609
 has been developing and distributing to several countries the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.159
 most modern systems for light vehicles 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:22.720
 middle 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.029
 and heavy 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.109
 offering a wide range of products to the market 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.689
 premium locators 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.130
 air conditioners 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.269
 automatic balancing 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.269
 and permanently defended 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.490
 right 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.300
 the high-performance tattoo conditioners are designed equipment 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.690
 within the highest quality standards 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.560
 driving comfort, I thought that all 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.740
 category 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.820
 coupled with the most perfect inner nonsense and this year 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.400
 The explanation is simple just watch and take care of some attacks 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.970
 in the truck 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.920
 remove the frame from the cabin sound text carefully 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.860
 so as not to damage the party 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.790
 the truck fire 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.790
 and then pull out your own try to speak 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.250
 the end 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 the rubber and the original sealing will be replaced by the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.300
 fence agreement 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 suitable for receiving the air conditioner 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.760
 7 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.990
 there are beds with opening of the greater home route 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.080
 In these cases 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.150
 we put the plate on hitting 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.750
 adapters 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.530
 the holding stands 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.850
 the original screws previously removed 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.200
 measuring to be in the correct position to receive the air conditioner 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.339
 to agree 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.919
 remove the air conditioner 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.049
 their classics of protection 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.399
 and before being installed I received the logo to agree 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:26.680
 that does not come directly from the factory so as not to disrupt an eventual future 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:33.579
 since all the air conditioners leave the factory the natural white color of the part 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:38.839
 the air conditioner and liquid 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.279
 by the outside and with care 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.369
 if placed on the head 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.969
 not forgetting to be careful with an electric whip in mangos 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.269
 by the inner part 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.200
 the air conditioner to the place where 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.189
 fiction with standby support 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.189
 alternately pressing the prisoners 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.389
 when it is necessary 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.409
 remove the hand grip 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.299
 to fit the opening in the air conditioner 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.310
 refusing to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.310
 after the attacks 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:20.809
 on the outside for better rectangular reservoir attachment 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:25.460
 the best place is sought if it is to be one of the senses, but sÃ£o paulo 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.829
 or vertical 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.340
 still thought of the back ladder of the truck booth 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:37.989
 there is also the reservoir and chassis and affixed to the chassis the car would be 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.149
 truck 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:43.539
 or location defined for the installation of the reservoir and the bar in the 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:44.929
 outside the cabin 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:50.059
 small marks where the pure ones must be redone for the pixar of the 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.739
 reservoir supports 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.059
 time to drill 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.649
 always use the limiter on the drill bit 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:04:01.219
 so that the fire did not hit will be concerned internally and step deep with 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.119
 caution 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:05.119
 not to dry the paint 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:11.849
 for fixing the water tank holder is placed bushels 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.369
 or stairs the Kurds executed 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:16.870
 using the search see magazine 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.290
 then fix the brackets by tightening the screws with the area 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.400
 own gun 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.620
 then the lower end of the holder is placed to be engaged with the reservoir 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.730
 where the hoses are measured 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.719
 on the pump and on the return 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.159
 to be connected with a reservoir 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.879
 as well as the electric water whirl pump pump lead that 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.050
 by its point of the reservoir to receive the return flag 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.900
 then connects blue partners in your industry 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.490
 and the positive wires 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.370
 red 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.289
 and a negative 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.499
 of water pumps 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.270
 the terminals indicated on the pump 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.400
 I can connect the flag of a room in the water pumps 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.020
 So 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.610
 saw its reservoir leaving the seat and securing the upper end of the 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.779
 Support 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:13.749
 after connect return flag 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.860
 and stay without electric lash 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.990
 with decal stickers and clamps I decide I will be posted from the cabin 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.199
 find the right spot to link an educational film 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.419
 the positive pilot must pass through the cabin chassis throughout his or her 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.999
 followed by the chassis 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.889
 together with the truck's electric whip to the battery where you 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.199
 the port can be connected 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.460
 without being able to connect the battery 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.150
 and this collection should always be made with a splice terminal 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.619
 Finally we put the possible in the possible door 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:05.069
 we supply a reservoir with water and test the agreed air conditioner 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:06.319
 in the user's presence
