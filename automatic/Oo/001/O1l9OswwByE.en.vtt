and show you some techniques first we'll
insert<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.810> piece<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.229> cardboard

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
insert this piece of cardboard

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.479 
insert this piece of cardboard
underneath<00:02:05.429> this<00:02:05.729> t-shirt<00:02:07.039> this<00:02:08.039> makes<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
underneath this t-shirt this makes the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.500 
underneath this t-shirt this makes the
surface<00:02:08.940> firm<00:02:09.800> for<00:02:10.800> painting<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:12.180> avoids

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
surface firm for painting and it avoids

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.850 
surface firm for painting and it avoids
bleed<00:02:12.870> through<00:02:13.140> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
bleed through you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.000 
bleed through you
can<00:02:13.920> also<00:02:14.130> use<00:02:14.670> wax<00:02:15.000> paper<00:02:15.390> aluminum<00:02:15.990> foil<00:02:16.530> but

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
can also use wax paper aluminum foil but

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.220 
can also use wax paper aluminum foil but
cardboard<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> perfect<00:02:18.210> medium<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.930> avoid

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
cardboard is the perfect medium to avoid

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.050 
cardboard is the perfect medium to avoid
flee<00:02:19.440> through<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.920> keep<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.460> flat<00:02:20.700> for

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
flee through and keep it flat for

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.950 
flee through and keep it flat for
storing<00:02:21.420> later<00:02:22.910> I'll<00:02:23.910> start<00:02:24.300> our<00:02:24.420> design<00:02:24.750> by

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
storing later I'll start our design by

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.200 
storing later I'll start our design by
using<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.410> Nancy<00:02:25.770> bottle<00:02:28.340> bio<00:02:29.340> color<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.880> so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
using a Nancy bottle bio color is so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.720 
using a Nancy bottle bio color is so
creamy<00:02:30.990> I've<00:02:31.980> got<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> really<00:02:32.430> nice

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
creamy I've got a really nice

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.930 
creamy I've got a really nice
consistency<00:02:33.420> but<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.710> runny<00:02:35.100> so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
consistency but it's not runny so

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.580 
consistency but it's not runny so
children<00:02:36.330> will<00:02:36.540> feel<00:02:36.570> successful<00:02:36.960> when

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
children will feel successful when

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.460 
children will feel successful when
they're<00:02:37.740> using<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.720> I'll<00:02:39.900> use<00:02:39.930> one<00:02:40.440> of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
they're using it and now I'll use one of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:51.430 
they're using it and now I'll use one of
these<00:02:40.800> bottles

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.650 

it<00:02:51.950> squeezes<00:02:52.370> out<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:52.880> brush<00:02:53.150> bottle<00:02:53.480> so

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
it squeezes out of this brush bottle so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.210
