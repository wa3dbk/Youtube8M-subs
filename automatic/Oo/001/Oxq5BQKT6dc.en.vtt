make<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:57.800> work<00:01:58.070> in<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.520> past<00:01:58.759> with<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.240> list

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
make this work in the past with the list

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.410 
make this work in the past with the list
of<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.960> chop<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.590> can<00:02:01.130> just<00:02:01.429> reshape<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.000> top<00:02:02.240> of

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
of a chop I can just reshape the top of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.840 
of a chop I can just reshape the top of
this<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.960> match<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:04.310> can<00:02:04.460> see<00:02:04.640> there

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
this to match that you can see there

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.249 
this to match that you can see there
it's<00:02:05.030> not<00:02:05.149> gonna<00:02:05.330> look<00:02:05.509> good<00:02:05.720> it's<00:02:05.990> gonna<00:02:06.110> be

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
it's not gonna look good it's gonna be

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.009 
it's not gonna look good it's gonna be
too<00:02:06.409> thick<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.490> looks<00:02:07.670> better<00:02:07.780> like<00:02:08.780> that

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
too thick so it looks better like that

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.590 
too thick so it looks better like that
in<00:02:09.350> order<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.649> achieve<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:11.030> I'm<00:02:11.300> gonna<00:02:11.420> have

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
in order to achieve that I'm gonna have

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.100 
in order to achieve that I'm gonna have
to<00:02:11.750> slice<00:02:12.019> this<00:02:12.950> way<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.030> slice<00:02:14.300> out<00:02:14.540> here<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
to slice this way and slice out here and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.100 
to slice this way and slice out here and
bring<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:16.100> reveal<00:02:16.550> ahead<00:02:16.850> until<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.569> matches

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
bring this reveal ahead until it matches

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.320 
bring this reveal ahead until it matches
up<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> little<00:02:20.120> bit<00:02:20.269> more

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
up with that so a little bit more

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.449 
up with that so a little bit more
procedure<00:02:20.900> with<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:23.140> all<00:02:24.140> right<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.680> back

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
procedure with that all right so back

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.190 
procedure with that all right so back
here<00:02:25.700> we<00:02:25.790> got<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.970> pretty<00:02:26.120> good<00:02:26.209> lineup<00:02:26.810> but

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
here we got a pretty good lineup but

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.630 
here we got a pretty good lineup but
we're<00:02:27.350> gonna<00:02:27.440> fly<00:02:27.680> out<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.010> do<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.190> couple

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
we're gonna fly out to do a couple

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.750 
we're gonna fly out to do a couple
little<00:02:28.820> tweaks<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.930> get<00:02:30.079> rid<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.470> little

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
little tweaks to get rid of the little

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.550 
little tweaks to get rid of the little
coming<00:02:31.760> together<00:02:31.880> nests<00:02:32.269> right<00:02:32.510> here<00:02:32.720> but

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
coming together nests right here but

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.840 
coming together nests right here but
outside<00:02:33.980> why<00:02:34.160> it's<00:02:34.370> pretty<00:02:34.820> close<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:36.850> that's

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
outside why it's pretty close so that's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:50.410 
outside why it's pretty close so that's
what<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.209> get<00:02:48.250> as<00:02:49.250> far<00:02:49.310> as<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.910> misalignment

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
what you get as far as the misalignment

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.120 
what you get as far as the misalignment
and<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.019> get<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.380> we're<00:02:51.560> gonna<00:02:51.650> split<00:02:52.010> the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
and to get that we're gonna split the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.300 
and to get that we're gonna split the
top<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.700> split<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.239> down<00:02:53.359> here<00:02:53.720> but<00:02:54.440> there<00:02:54.890> is

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
top and split it down here but there is

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.580 
top and split it down here but there is
about<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.570> lien<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:57.200> going<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.410> change

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
about the lien that it's going to change

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.300 
about the lien that it's going to change
from<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:59.209> door

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
from the door

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.670 
from the door
as<00:03:00.400> up<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:01.690> there<00:03:03.120> with<00:03:04.470> reminiscence<00:03:05.470> of

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
as up to there with reminiscence of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.489 
as up to there with reminiscence of
