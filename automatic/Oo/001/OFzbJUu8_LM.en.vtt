00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
a great way to tweak those images and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.769 
a great way to tweak those images and
making<00:00:17.039> them<00:00:17.189> as<00:00:17.460> real<00:00:18.089> as<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.269> want<00:00:18.359> them<00:00:18.660> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
making them as real as you want them to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.450 
making them as real as you want them to
be<00:00:18.929> so<00:00:19.470> we've<00:00:19.830> got<00:00:19.949> an<00:00:20.039> image<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.249> of<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
be so we've got an image here of a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.489 
be so we've got an image here of a
lightning<00:00:20.669> scene<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.240> I'm<00:00:21.720> incorporating

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:22.499 
lightning scene and I'm incorporating

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.470 
lightning scene and I'm incorporating
nik<00:00:23.339> software<00:00:23.519> which<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.029> what<00:00:24.150> i'm<00:00:24.269> using

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
nik software which is what i'm using

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.109 
nik software which is what i'm using
color<00:00:24.810> FX<00:00:25.230> pro<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.519> actually<00:00:26.699> going

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
color FX pro and it's actually going

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.640 
color FX pro and it's actually going
through<00:00:27.240> photoshop<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.079> it's<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.320> standalone

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
through photoshop so it's a standalone

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.109 
through photoshop so it's a standalone
piece<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.220> software<00:00:29.579> but<00:00:29.909> i<00:00:29.939> actually

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
piece of software but i actually

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.180 
piece of software but i actually
imported<00:00:31.019> through<00:00:31.050> photoshop<00:00:31.949> because

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.190 
imported through photoshop because

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.620 
imported through photoshop because
that's<00:00:32.340> primarily<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:32.910> i'm<00:00:33.030> using<00:00:33.240> most<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that's primarily what i'm using most of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.870 
that's primarily what i'm using most of
the<00:00:33.720> time<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.860> well<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:35.220> lightroom<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.640> i

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the time as as well as lightroom and i

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.280 
the time as as well as lightroom and i
have<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.120> set<00:00:36.240> up<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.750> goes<00:00:36.900> through<00:00:37.080> both

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
have it set up so it goes through both

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.090 
have it set up so it goes through both
so<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.970> wonderful<00:00:39.150> shot<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.560> is<00:00:40.890> an

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
so there's wonderful shot and it is an

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.600 
so there's wonderful shot and it is an
image<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:42.650> natural<00:00:43.650> it's<00:00:43.890> real<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.580> it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
image that is natural it's real as it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.090 
image that is natural it's real as it
can<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.970> I<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.600> come<00:00:45.840> by<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.560> I<00:00:46.740> can<00:00:46.920> make

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
can be I can come by here and I can make

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.340 
can be I can come by here and I can make
this<00:00:47.280> thing<00:00:47.490> as<00:00:48.620> weird<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.830> I<00:00:49.950> want<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.570> but<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
this thing as weird as I want to but the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.540 
this thing as weird as I want to but the
question<00:00:52.680> becomes<00:00:52.800> what's<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.250> end<00:00:53.430> result

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
question becomes what's the end result

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.580 
question becomes what's the end result
if<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.360> were<00:00:54.480> doing<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.750> story<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.080> something<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
if I were doing a story on something and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.990 
if I were doing a story on something and
it<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.950> be<00:00:56.040> are<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.460> storms<00:00:56.730> on

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
it was going to be are there storms on

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.140 
it was going to be are there storms on

sienna<00:01:00.390> would<00:01:00.720> be<00:01:00.840> perfect<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.350> something

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
sienna would be perfect for something

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.710 
sienna would be perfect for something
like<00:01:01.860> that<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.700> my<00:01:02.880> end<00:01:03.060> result<00:01:03.330> in<00:01:03.450> this<00:01:03.570> is

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
like that but my end result in this is

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.179 
like that but my end result in this is
to<00:01:03.840> make<00:01:03.990> it<00:01:04.109> look<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.379> real<00:01:04.679> as<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.979> possibly

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
to make it look as real as I possibly

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.219 
to make it look as real as I possibly
can<00:01:05.609> and<00:01:05.789> so<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.329> actually<00:01:06.509> to<00:01:06.780> come<00:01:06.899> down<00:01:07.079> i'm

can and so I'm actually to come down i'm

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.709 
can and so I'm actually to come down i'm
going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> use<00:01:07.799> graduated<00:01:08.549> neutral<00:01:09.450> density

going to use graduated neutral density
this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> great<00:01:11.219> filter<00:01:11.579> for<00:01:12.030> landscapes

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.730 
just changing the top it's not changing
the<00:01:32.429> bottom<00:01:32.789> so<00:01:32.939> upper<00:01:33.389> tonality<00:01:33.719> I'm<00:01:34.049> able<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the bottom so upper tonality I'm able to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.859 
the bottom so upper tonality I'm able to
actually<00:01:34.889> get<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.460> sky<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.689> where<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
actually get that sky right where I

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.029 
actually get that sky right where I
wanted<00:01:37.109> to<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.259> remembering<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.859> your<00:01:38.009> eye

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
wanted to be remembering that your eye

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.620 
wanted to be remembering that your eye
goes<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> sharpest<00:01:38.969> and<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.210> brightest

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
goes to the sharpest and the brightest

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.660 
goes to the sharpest and the brightest
spots<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.319> every<00:01:40.469> photograph<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
spots and every photograph it's the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.919 
spots and every photograph it's the
lightning<00:01:42.030> bolts<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.600> are<00:01:42.689> really

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
lightning bolts here that are really

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.109 
lightning bolts here that are really
singing<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.469> wonderful<00:01:44.009> cloud<00:01:44.520> that's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
singing in this wonderful cloud that's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.599 
singing in this wonderful cloud that's
branching<00:01:46.020> off<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.499> left<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.159> I've<00:01:47.429> been

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
branching off to the left so I've been

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.309 
branching off to the left so I've been
able<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.909> tweak<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> sky<00:01:48.569> bring<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.990> down<00:01:49.139> but

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
able to tweak that sky bring it down but

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.199 
able to tweak that sky bring it down but
I<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.530> also<00:01:49.679> control<00:01:50.189> look<00:01:50.429> at<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.639> I<00:01:50.850> can

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
I can also control look at this I can

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.569 
I can also control look at this I can
also<00:01:51.420> control<00:01:51.959> the<00:01:52.020> lower<00:01:52.530> density<00:01:53.039> now

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
also control the lower density now

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.069 
also control the lower density now
that's<00:01:53.759> obviously<00:01:54.209> way<00:01:54.389> too<00:01:54.420> bright<00:01:54.689> now<00:01:54.929> but

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
that's obviously way too bright now but

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.209 
that's obviously way too bright now but
one<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.319> things<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.499> I'm<00:01:55.649> missing<00:01:55.920> in

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.709 
one of the things that I'm missing in
this<00:01:56.310> shot<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.579> would<00:01:56.819> be<00:01:56.909> nice<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.450> but

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
where my lightning bolt

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.730 
where my lightning bolt
really<00:02:13.850> pop<00:02:14.090> out<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.540> boom<00:02:15.110> there<00:02:15.440> they<00:02:15.560> are

focus point right to my cloud right to
my<00:02:29.960> lightning<00:02:30.350> bolts<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.770> it's<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.550> easy<00:02:31.730> to

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
my lightning bolts and it's that easy to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.430 
my lightning bolts and it's that easy to
do<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.330> couple<00:02:32.510> clicks<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.960> the<00:02:32.990> buttons<00:02:33.350> a
