00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.029
 hi guys today we make a cream 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.890
 mixed among many suitable for all types 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.740
 of skin even if you have a lot of skin 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.980
 fat because we put lac santana 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.660
 and rich in oils and butters 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.000
 of hyaluronic acid that will make the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.010
 your skin always softer and smoother 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.840
 smooth 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.150
 also to this beautiful consistent 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310
 from thick jar it is dense but it is not 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.410
 we are absolutely heavy 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 finding very well heavy we continue of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.050
 let's leave you the recipe right away is 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.050
 another failure 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.430
 yes all we begin to weigh the phase ha 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.080
 therefore the aqueous phase does not pay attention 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.480
 to the quantities because we are doing 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.360
 a pound of cream and we don't know anymore 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.570
 two measures and inside the water 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.570
 then we go to disperse ours 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.570
 thickener 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.789
 so much that we use today is always the 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.920
 cargo with over 21 that from one 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.390
 very professional consistency 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.880
 cream so we prefer it 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.710
 especially for a face cream and it 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.780
 we think and we go to disperse it to 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.970
 rain above the water that 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.820
 we just used and then leave 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.710
 rest everything and meanwhile there 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.710
 we deal with the fat phase 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.750
 but 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.970
 first of all rice oil a medium oil 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.340
 therefore suitable for all types of creams 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.500
 quite good inside one 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.640
 cascade of fats and that you can buy 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.280
 at the supermarket 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.350
 hence not too high cost then 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:56.300
 we add our beloved oil of 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:58.550
 jojoba which is very light then a new one 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.280
 purchase the goats carbonate 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.250
 which is a very emollient oil that 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.140
 limits all those oils to paraffins 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.140
 very heavy inside 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.500
 of creams never completely echoed 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.260
 therefore compatible with green ball then 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.450
 we add a very light oil that 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.940
 we have already used recipes in the valley 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:29.230
 and that will give a dry touch to ours 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:29.230
 cream then pure shea butter 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:35.340
 new purchase that the apricot butter 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.370
 a wall very suitable for skins 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.099
 thin for damaged skins it has 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.870
 a very soft texture and it is 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.150
 really nutritious is not liked 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.549
 so obviously if you don't have it 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.489
 you can use more cocoa butter or 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.860
 more shea wall and finally also the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:59.489
 cocoa butter then argan oil 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.359
 I want to be very nutritious and very precious 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.310
 inside the face caves we add 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.030
 the vitamin is ours as usual 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.260
 tocopherol we use both as 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.470
 antioxidant that as a nutrient than 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.829
 will avoid iran surrender the bullies now 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.019
 let's move on to the exciting first ilmc il 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.390
 glucose sequestered and functioning 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.180
 hydrophilic which therefore we put in greater 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.010
 amount then to ethyl calcium or 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.019
 emulsifying rest that this time 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.150
 we decided to pair with another 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.720
 exciting that we purchased from 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.540
 recent 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.180
 gentle alcohol stearic too and of 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.150
 pofi gives it a denser texture 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.190
 it is full-bodied to create without weighing it down 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.700
 and makes it a wife ante and agreeable to 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.609
 touch 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.730
 if you don't have it you can do everything 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.989
 this amount of celic alcohol 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.629
 then we add the thrillers 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.629
 to the fat phase and we will have finished 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.440
 we have made a beautiful waterfall of 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.270
 fat is a phase b is very rich in 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.560
 fine ingredients that will make the 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:17.620
 nourishing and touch cream 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:19.600
 professional yes we all complete the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.430
 our phase therefore we have water 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.820
 with the cardo paul casey and hydrated 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.940
 we whisk it all and then swab it with 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.610
 the caustic soda solution to raise 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.650
 the ph as you know because we already have it 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.800
 see this in so many other videos 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.230
 serves to make the carbo gel form with 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.050
 over 21 which is once we get 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.930
 collapsed it will come out as if by magic e 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.970
 it will be a thick and full-bodied gel from the 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.700
 really professional consistency 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.850
 miscio is really beautiful like 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.830
 you see it looks like a very very gel 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.960
 that our cream will stop that 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.790
 beautiful jar texture that 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.060
 we want to help even with the 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.250
 exciting then we warm up phase b is 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.750
 the years phase I recommend you make sure of 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.940
 do not let the water evaporate 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.610
 burn the oils and when everything will be a 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.830
 hot so phase b is dissolved in 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.770
 we will pour half into phase a 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.740
 that will be warm and enjoy and then 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.410
 we will also add the rest of phase b 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.570
 and to blend it will come a consistency 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.570
 really beautiful that will continue to 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.160
 thicken in the hours to come and how there is 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.320
 I showed at the beginning of the video will be 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.780
 really very dense in the days a 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.030
 follow it will be even more and it seems 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.560
 really a whipped cream seems to 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.830
 staying in the pastry shop 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.490
 so now then we'll get ready to do 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.169
 the phase is to be put in cold 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.360
 in a glass or a becker 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.729
 let 's think of the rosehip oil e 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.150
 we disperse the drive inside for 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.560
 give the cream a dry touch 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.960
 stir well and it will melt 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.580
 completely inside the oil up 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.729
 to achieve this consistency that 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.919
 see aside also think acid 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.500
 hyaluronic acid that you can replace with 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.360
 Aloe gel Hyaluronic acid will make the 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.630
 anti age cream giving the skin a 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.720
 aspect of it is bound then add 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.590
 the essential ingredient glycerin 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.930
 moisturizer is protective 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.870
 finally we also add the preservative 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:26.710
 and then I meant everything inside 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:28.750
 of the cooled emulsion I know that 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.030
 cream has cooled we can 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.940
 add our Chilean stage stands 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.280
 phase of prized assets and frulliamo 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.599
 with the blender to make incorporate 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.180
 better the whole 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.949
 and therefore to have a lot of cream 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.349
 homogeneous 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.120
 at the beginning it will seem that the cream becomes 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.599
 much more fluid but don't worry 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.460
 because only a momentary phase with the 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:54.219
 Minutes pass especially after a 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.199
 couple of hours the cream will return very thick 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:58.240
 like at the beginning of the video and after some 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.400
 day if you turn the jar upside down 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.990
 cream will not slip is really one 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.810
 beautiful consistency in case 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.360
 look at the image of before and 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.030
 so you can pack it is a cream 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.909
 beautiful is spread well is absorbed 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.490
 well it looks like it's a cream made of 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:18.130
 beacher and synthetic paraffins instead 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.349
 all natural is truly spectacular 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.150
 it hydrates very well and I like it a lot 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:25.419
 we also adjusted the ph you didn't 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.159
 seen then guys that's it 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:28.990
 we hope this tutorial is there 

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:31.719
 liked if you make the cream let us know 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:35.430
 how you find yourself a kiss to all from 

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:35.430
 gaia and from noemi
