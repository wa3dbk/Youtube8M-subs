Unleashed<00:02:02.890> version<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.520> us<00:02:03.760> begonia<00:02:04.390> and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
Unleashed version of us begonia and

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.530 
Unleashed version of us begonia and
nearly<00:02:04.960> crushed<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.619> course<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.330> we<00:02:07.330> have<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
nearly crushed of course and we have the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.419 
nearly crushed of course and we have the
professor<00:02:07.869> brickell<00:02:08.259> mod<00:02:08.410> which<00:02:08.800> makes<00:02:09.100> sense

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
professor brickell mod which makes sense

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.430 
professor brickell mod which makes sense
because<00:02:09.700> basically<00:02:10.360> leverage<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:11.110> think<00:02:11.350> the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
because basically leverage I think the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.110 
because basically leverage I think the
past<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.770> laboratory<00:02:12.250> somewhere<00:02:12.459> or<00:02:12.910> as

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
past a laboratory somewhere or as

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.300 
past a laboratory somewhere or as
laboratory<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.930> begonia<00:02:14.380> actually<00:02:14.800> so

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
laboratory is this begonia actually so

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.610 
laboratory is this begonia actually so
it<00:02:15.490> makes<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.730> lot<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.910> sense<00:02:16.030> really<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:17.410> um

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
it makes a lot of sense really but um

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.770 
it makes a lot of sense really but um
yeah<00:02:17.950> let's<00:02:18.520> just<00:02:18.610> go<00:02:19.570> oh<00:02:19.900> my<00:02:20.170> god<00:02:21.180> hi<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.239> is
