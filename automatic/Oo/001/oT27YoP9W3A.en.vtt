00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:54.119 
do you get structure through guilt and

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:57.140 
do you get structure through guilt and
debt<00:00:54.839> that's<00:00:55.769> how<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.519> how<00:00:56.729> you<00:00:56.790> get<00:00:57.059> the

of play and so we knew we wanted to have

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.490 
of play and so we knew we wanted to have
some<00:02:59.830> sort<00:02:59.860> of<00:03:00.040> variant<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.760> but<00:03:01.630> not

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
some sort of variant on that but not

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.840 
some sort of variant on that but not
have<00:03:02.740> it<00:03:02.770> be<00:03:02.890> quite<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.340> same<00:03:03.520> how<00:03:03.700> would<00:03:03.820> it

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
have it be quite the same how would it

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.370 
have it be quite the same how would it
be<00:03:03.970> new<00:03:04.180> have<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.690> be<00:03:04.780> something<00:03:04.960> that<00:03:05.110> doesn't

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
be new have it be something that doesn't

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.990 
be new have it be something that doesn't
relate<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.710> combat<00:03:06.220> damaging<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.790> stack

activated for black but the new one

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.890 
activated for black but the new one
their<00:03:44.520> gold<00:03:44.820> meaning<00:03:45.300> you<00:03:45.360> have<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.570> have<00:03:45.660> both

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
their gold meaning you have to have both

their gold meaning you have to have both
to<00:03:45.960> use<00:03:46.320> them<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.740> it<00:03:47.160> has<00:03:47.280> two<00:03:47.430> abilities

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
to use them and it has two abilities

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.090 
to use them and it has two abilities
again<00:03:48.180> but<00:03:48.480> both<00:03:48.750> require<00:03:49.200> both<00:03:49.500> color<00:03:49.800> mana

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
again but both require both color mana

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.310 
again but both require both color mana
and<00:03:50.730> what<00:03:50.880> we<00:03:50.970> did<00:03:51.210> is<00:03:51.420> we<00:03:51.600> made<00:03:51.810> them<00:03:52.080> so<00:03:52.200> they

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
and what we did is we made them so they

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.960 
and what we did is we made them so they
were<00:03:52.410> synergistic<00:03:53.040> one<00:03:53.520> of<00:03:53.640> them<00:03:53.760> for<00:03:53.910> example

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
were synergistic one of them for example

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.250 
were synergistic one of them for example
grants<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.630> lifelink

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
grants to lifelink

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.590 
grants to lifelink
the<00:03:55.590> other<00:03:55.800> whenever<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.610> gain<00:03:56.910> life<00:03:57.150> your

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
the other whenever you gain life your

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.120 
the other whenever you gain life your
opponent<00:03:57.959> loses<00:03:58.170> life<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.770> so<00:03:58.980> they're

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
opponent loses life and so they're

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.280 
opponent loses life and so they're
synergistic<00:03:59.730> so<00:03:59.910> either<00:04:00.270> one<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.720> good<00:04:00.870> or<00:04:01.200> you

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
synergistic so either one is good or you

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.390 
synergistic so either one is good or you
can<00:04:01.410> use<00:04:01.530> them<00:04:01.680> together<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:02.130> make<00:04:02.190> something

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
can use them together to make something

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.850 
can use them together to make something
even<00:04:02.640> more<00:04:02.730> potent<00:04:03.120> one<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.140> interesting

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
even more potent one of the interesting

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.140 
even more potent one of the interesting
things<00:04:05.040> about<00:04:05.160> being<00:04:05.490> on<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:05.640> development

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
things about being on the development

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.550 
things about being on the development
team<00:04:06.180> is<00:04:06.330> that<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> sets<00:04:07.080> already<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.470> a

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
team is that the sets already in a

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.650 
team is that the sets already in a
playable<00:04:07.920> state<00:04:08.190> when<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.430> get<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:09.060> the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
playable state when you get it but the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.470 
playable state when you get it but the
cards<00:04:09.990> are<00:04:10.400> basically<00:04:11.400> white<00:04:12.120> black<00:04:12.450> and

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
cards are basically white black and

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.960 
cards are basically white black and
white<00:04:12.630> stickers<00:04:13.200> stuck<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:14.010> real<00:04:14.310> magic<00:04:14.670> cards

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
white stickers stuck to real magic cards

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.449 
white stickers stuck to real magic cards
and<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:15.420> we<00:04:15.600> play<00:04:15.840> games<00:04:16.410> of<00:04:16.590> magic<00:04:16.950> we<00:04:17.100> draft

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
and so we play games of magic we draft

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.670 
and so we play games of magic we draft
with<00:04:17.790> them<00:04:18.030> but<00:04:18.690> there's<00:04:18.840> no<00:04:18.989> artwork<00:04:19.410> and

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
with them but there's no artwork and

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.289 
with them but there's no artwork and
they're<00:04:19.919> all<00:04:20.070> placeholder<00:04:20.790> names<00:04:21.000> and

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
they're all placeholder names and

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.030 
they're all placeholder names and
sometimes<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.169> placeholder<00:04:22.650> names<00:04:22.830> are

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
sometimes the placeholder names are

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.730 
sometimes the placeholder names are
wacky<00:04:23.660> but<00:04:24.660> sometimes<00:04:25.080> they're<00:04:25.260> incredibly

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
wacky but sometimes they're incredibly

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.260 
wacky but sometimes they're incredibly
flavorful<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.550> really<00:04:26.760> helps<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.120> get
