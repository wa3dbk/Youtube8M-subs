00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.950
 one cried out to his god and they threw into the sea 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.309
 the equipment that had the ship for 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.890

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.729
 and let's draw lots so we know by 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.009

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.710
 jehovah god of heaven who made the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.799
 sea ​​and earth and those men 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.800
 they feared exceedingly and told him why 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.630
 have you done this 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.720
 because they knew he was running away from the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.289
 presence of jehovah because he had 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.959
 declared 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.870
 and they told him that we will do with you to 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.629

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.590
 He was appearing more and more them 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:23.469

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.299
 The sea will be taken away from you because I know that 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.420
 Because of me, this great 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.340
 tempest over you and those 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.349
 men worked to make the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.959
 ship to earth more they could not because the 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.930
 sea ​​they were looking more and more against 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.030
 they 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.420
 so they loved her to jehovah and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.340
 they said we beg you now jehovah not 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.459
 perish us for the life of 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.790
 this man put on us the 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.239
 innocent blood because you have jehovah 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.540
 done as you have wanted and took to jonás 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.700
 and they threw it into the sea and the sea has 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.670
 still where his furor 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.250
 and those men feared to jehová with 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.250
 great fear and offered sacrifice to 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.459
 jehovah and they made vows but that goes 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.300
 I had prepared a big fish to swallow 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.610
 to jonás 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.690
 and it was jonás in the belly of the fish
