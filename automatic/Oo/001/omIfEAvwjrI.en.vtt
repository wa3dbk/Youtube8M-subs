00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
polycarbonate it's very solid you'll

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:27.999

with<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.939> does<00:00:29.239> hurt<00:00:29.649> it's<00:00:30.649> a<00:00:30.710> very<00:00:30.919> solid

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
case if we have a look actually at the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.150 
case if we have a look actually at the
design<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.780> can<00:00:35.960> see<00:00:36.200> it's<00:00:36.410> got<00:00:36.590> these<00:00:36.770> six

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
design you can see it's got these six

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.030 
design you can see it's got these six
very<00:00:37.850> grippy<00:00:38.360> feet<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:38.990> essentially<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:39.800> put

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
very grippy feet so essentially you put

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.490 
very grippy feet so essentially you put
it<00:00:40.160> down<00:00:40.310> on<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:40.490> flat<00:00:40.790> surface<00:00:41.140> it's<00:00:42.140> not<00:00:42.350> going

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
it down on a flat surface it's not going

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.870 
it down on a flat surface it's not going
to<00:00:42.590> move<00:00:42.770> very<00:00:43.010> much<00:00:43.310> it's<00:00:43.550> not<00:00:43.670> going<00:00:43.820> to

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
to move very much it's not going to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.580 
to move very much it's not going to
slide<00:00:44.240> too<00:00:44.630> easily<00:00:44.840> there's<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.410> lot<00:00:45.560> of

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
slide too easily there's a lot of

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.210 
slide too easily there's a lot of
resistance<00:00:46.010> there<00:00:47.380> and<00:00:48.380> these<00:00:48.590> can<00:00:48.800> come<00:00:49.040> out

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
resistance there and these can come out

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.010 
resistance there and these can come out
they're<00:00:49.430> interchangeable<00:00:49.700> now<00:00:50.510> you<00:00:50.570> can<00:00:50.840> get

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
they're interchangeable now you can get

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.530 
they're interchangeable now you can get
different<00:00:51.170> colors<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.790> case<00:00:52.970> itself<00:00:53.330> as

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
different colors and the case itself as

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.540 
different colors and the case itself as
you<00:00:53.660> can<00:00:53.780> see<00:00:54.050> you<00:00:54.650> can<00:00:54.800> see<00:00:54.920> this<00:00:55.040> line<00:00:55.340> that

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
you can see you can see this line that

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.980 
you can see you can see this line that
kind<00:00:55.730> of<00:00:55.790> follows<00:00:56.150> all<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.360> way<00:00:56.540> around<00:00:56.630> here

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
kind of follows all the way around here

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.300 
kind of follows all the way around here
it's<00:00:57.140> made<00:00:57.320> up<00:00:57.470> of<00:00:57.620> two<00:00:57.829> different<00:00:58.160> pieces

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
it's made up of two different pieces

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.970 
it's made up of two different pieces
they're<00:00:59.120> pretty<00:00:59.329> hard<00:00:59.630> to<00:00:59.780> separate<00:01:00.260> but

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
they're pretty hard to separate but

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.380 
they're pretty hard to separate but
actually<00:01:01.400> putting<00:01:01.579> them<00:01:01.730> together<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.150> very

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
actually putting them together is very

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.940 
actually putting them together is very
simple<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.840> just<00:01:02.930> slide<00:01:03.290> it<00:01:03.470> clicks<00:01:03.770> in<00:01:03.920> place

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
simple you just slide it clicks in place

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.280 
simple you just slide it clicks in place
if<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:04.850> saw<00:01:05.030> my<00:01:05.239> unboxing<00:01:05.540> video<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.170> would

if you saw my unboxing video you would
have<00:01:06.409> seen<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.650> happening<00:01:07.189> anyway<00:01:07.630> now<00:01:08.630> you

have seen that happening anyway now you
can<00:01:08.810> see<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.170> cutouts<00:01:09.590> for<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.920> volume<00:01:10.390> mute

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390

there's<00:01:30.259> no<00:01:30.439> danger<00:01:30.770> going<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.219> really<00:01:31.490> come

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
there's no danger going to really come

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.219 
there's no danger going to really come
to<00:01:31.819> your<00:01:31.939> iPad<00:01:32.329> or<00:01:32.359> your<00:01:32.509> speakers<00:01:33.079> or

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
to your iPad or your speakers or

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.949 
to your iPad or your speakers or
anything<00:01:33.560> if<00:01:33.649> you<00:01:33.740> drop<00:01:34.009> this<00:01:34.189> on<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.490> floor

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
anything if you drop this on the floor

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:38.739 
anything if you drop this on the floor
it's<00:01:35.959> a<00:01:36.049> really<00:01:36.319> solid<00:01:36.649> case<00:01:37.039> now<00:01:37.539> some<00:01:38.539> things

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749 
it's a really solid case now some things

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:40.749 
it's a really solid case now some things
I<00:01:38.869> really<00:01:39.139> like<00:01:39.380> about<00:01:39.439> it<00:01:39.979> in<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.340> corner<00:01:40.549> you

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
I really like about it in the corner you

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.239 
I really like about it in the corner you
can<00:01:40.969> see<00:01:41.170> there's<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.259> little<00:01:42.319> bit<00:01:42.679> more<00:01:42.920> bulk

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
can see there's a little bit more bulk

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.459 
can see there's a little bit more bulk
there<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:43.819> you've<00:01:44.060> got<00:01:44.090> extra<00:01:44.869> protection<00:01:45.380> in

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
there so you've got extra protection in

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.739 
there so you've got extra protection in
the<00:01:45.560> corners<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.280> obviously<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.329> can<00:01:47.420> drop<00:01:47.600> it

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
the corners so obviously you can drop it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.480 
the corners so obviously you can drop it
on<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.959> corner<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.469> don't<00:01:48.679> want<00:01:48.889> your<00:01:49.069> iPad

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
on the corner you don't want your iPad

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.330

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
cooking it's a very very useful feature

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.820 
cooking it's a very very useful feature
to<00:04:05.600> have<00:04:05.750> even<00:04:06.170> if<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.290> just<00:04:06.320> want<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.709> watch

to have even if you just want to watch

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.410 
to have even if you just want to watch
videos<00:04:07.280> while<00:04:07.520> you're<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:07.970> kitchen<00:04:08.090> on

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420

your<00:04:08.600> own<00:04:08.720> for<00:04:09.020> instance<00:04:09.459> it's<00:04:10.459> pretty<00:04:10.730> useful

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
your own for instance it's pretty useful

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.650 
your own for instance it's pretty useful
now<00:04:12.680> as<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:12.950> case<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.430> guess<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.760> only<00:04:13.910> issues

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
now as a case I guess the only issues

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.840 
now as a case I guess the only issues
that<00:04:14.989> I've<00:04:15.080> had<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:16.100> guess<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.580> comes<00:04:16.700> with

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
that I've had and I guess it comes with

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.479 
that I've had and I guess it comes with
the<00:04:17.750> territory<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.500> case<00:04:18.739> that's<00:04:18.919> got<00:04:19.250> all

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
the territory of a case that's got all

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.940 
the territory of a case that's got all
these<00:04:20.270> extra<00:04:20.570> features<00:04:20.690> on<00:04:21.200> it<00:04:21.230> is<00:04:21.470> when

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
these extra features on it is when

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.190 
these extra features on it is when
you're<00:04:22.100> holding<00:04:22.490> it<00:04:22.640> it's<00:04:23.419> not<00:04:23.630> entirely

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
you're holding it it's not entirely

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.830 
you're holding it it's not entirely
comfortable<00:04:24.650> it's<00:04:25.250> not<00:04:25.460> like<00:04:25.760> it's<00:04:26.180> it's

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
comfortable it's not like it's it's

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.830 
comfortable it's not like it's it's
implant<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.890> hold<00:04:28.130> it's<00:04:28.460> just<00:04:28.760> that<00:04:28.970> I've<00:04:29.570> held

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
implant to hold it's just that I've held

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.719 
implant to hold it's just that I've held
much<00:04:30.110> nicer<00:04:30.410> cases<00:04:30.950> in<00:04:31.100> my<00:04:31.220> hand

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
much nicer cases in my hand
