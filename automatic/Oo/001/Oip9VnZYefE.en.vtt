00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.119
 While 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.119
 Leveled off in bed 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.329
 Banks lined up 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.310
 eh 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.739
 So far 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.109
 truly 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.489
 There is no one lap 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.359
 Because it really has a meaning 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.150
 Takemori 29 Station 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.500
 this year too 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.700
 I think I'm close and strong to that person 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.980
 To those people 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.350
 How do you get up from the head 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.530
 However, it is the first after revision 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.960
 I said that I thought it was systematic 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.120
 But 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.860
 This is really 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.090
 As a result 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.370
 Of repo interest rate person who is helpless in the year 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.970
 The record is not a supply operation 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.090
 Favorable keylogger height 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.300
 Barry 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.420
 Sometimes it's the first time in the headquarters 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.630
 Is written 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.840
 People who can not usually go up 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.260
 If you wake up in turn, you know what you used 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.770
 A little from the second son 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.790
 It seems that the way of life changes every day 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.550
 I felt like I was able to move 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.550
 I thought I was so concerned about the service 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.200
 I think it would be a fool for yahoo in fanta tennis 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.330
 It was 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.920
 this 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.080
 this 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.189
 Tax not included 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.970
 Introduced by Rakuten 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.180
 And this monte 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.980
 Develop life 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.300
 It is flat with a 4 piece cartoon with things in 2 pages spread 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 Continued 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.870
 Please explain one item 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.180
 I will try this after resistance 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.550
 A good job of only two men 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.870
 I was introduced one by one 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.250
 Try it with the notice to introduce 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.620
 I told you that I would send that runner 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.699
 I got rid of the trash 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.519
 While doing such one thing one by one 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.519
 It was up with Rakuten 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.809
 I stopped for about a week because it happened 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:18.869
 German sap 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.169
 And then gave up 216 points of Hino pornography Rakuten 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:24.289
 Simple possession 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.199
 I did it too 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.839
 ufo comment returned 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.589
 It was unexpected 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:31.639
 This is 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.060
 Even more than 1 million people will break away 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.049
 I made six million yuan 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.090
 I want to use over 1 million copies for this 3 day font 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.449
 How is that 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.449
 What kind of person and many such employment 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.259
 Maybe when I'm 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:51.469
 Such thing is 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.839
 Like the Reading Association 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.289
 Reading the book makes me feel better 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.749
 I think it's a must for a pair or an organization 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:00.609
 age 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.559
 That kind of thing 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:05.159
 Have more people read it 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.669
 I wonder if you are getting well 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.729
 It is heavy and for myself 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.729
 In that sense 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.219
 Reconfirm that the association's role or the legality of the book you want to sell 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:21.499
 I can do it 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.259
 Like that 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.379
 However, I already liked one of the popularization and reinforcement of the spirit 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.919
 not 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.969
 And it's zero because I didn't want it 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.499
 But close 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:36.889
 Yes, if there is such a person, please have them read it 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.309
 When you have rice 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:43.529
 In particular, people in the layer gradually become positive because of something 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.599
 I wonder if it will come with power 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.599
 I went to bed like that 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.809
 It was a person to come
