actually<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.579> sample

actually going to go there and sample
the<00:01:03.359> plasma<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.880> tasting<00:01:05.880> touching

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the plasma it's like tasting touching

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.179 
the plasma it's like tasting touching
smelling<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:09.390> environment<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> Sun<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
smelling the environment of the Sun the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.149 
smelling the environment of the Sun the
line<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.700> sight<00:01:12.000> from<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> Sun<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.619> earth<00:01:13.650> this

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
line of sight from the Sun to earth this

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.440 
line of sight from the Sun to earth this
93<00:01:14.729> million<00:01:14.909> mile

93 million mile

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.140 
93 million mile
so<00:01:15.689> there's<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> stuff<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.009> there<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
so there's lot of stuff in there you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
so there's lot of stuff in there you
have<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> detangle<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.830> Solar<00:01:20.100> Probe

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
have to detangle that with Solar Probe

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.190 
have to detangle that with Solar Probe
we<00:01:20.820> don't<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> detangle<00:01:21.600> anything

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
we don't have to detangle anything

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899 
we don't have to detangle anything
because<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
because it is going to be in that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.450 
because it is going to be in that
environment<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.560> measure<00:01:25.950> this

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
environment and actually measure this

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.450 
environment and actually measure this
with<00:01:27.150> its<00:01:27.360> instrument<00:01:28.049> sensors<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
with its instrument sensors so there is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.940 
with its instrument sensors so there is
a<00:01:29.490> deep<00:01:29.880> connection<00:01:30.689> between<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:31.530> happens

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
a deep connection between what happens

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.420 
a deep connection between what happens
on<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> Sun<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> normal<00:01:33.600> quiet<00:01:34.170> day<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:35.250> what

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
on the Sun on a normal quiet day to what

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.510 
on the Sun on a normal quiet day to what
happens<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> Sun<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.799> active

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
happens on the Sun on a very active

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.690 
happens on the Sun on a very active
stormy<00:01:39.090> day<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.409> directly<00:01:40.950> connected<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
stormy day that is directly connected to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.350 
stormy day that is directly connected to
our<00:01:42.570> lifestyle<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.070> planet<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.000> we

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
our lifestyle here on this planet so we

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.480 
our lifestyle here on this planet so we
really<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> understand<00:01:46.799> what<00:01:46.890> goes<00:01:47.310> on

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
really want to understand what goes on

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.670 
really want to understand what goes on
the<00:01:47.790> Sun<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.299> want<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> understand<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
the Sun we on want to understand the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.399 
the Sun we on want to understand the
physics<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.479> knowledge<00:01:51.780> we

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
physics and with that knowledge we

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.499 
physics and with that knowledge we
expect<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.610> will<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.970> able<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.270> make

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
expect that we will be able to make

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.399 
expect that we will be able to make
better<00:01:54.960> prediction<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:57.000> take

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
better prediction so that we can take

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.260 
better prediction so that we can take
mitigating<00:01:58.409> steps<00:01:58.829> when<00:01:59.610> some<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.090> these

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
mitigating steps when some of these

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.200 
mitigating steps when some of these
storms<00:02:00.630> happen
