00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.990
 Hello, how are you 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.030
 Several people have commented on me here. 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.620
 I do not love makeup how to make 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.750
 to value small ones 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.020
 that's why I invited him to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.090
 larissa all good larissa of the great that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.010
 also have this doubt when they go 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.500
 makeup where what I spend on that alone 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.539
 a normal fault and does not appear 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.210
 in the eye it's a little hide-and- seek 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.809
 The secret to valuing small eyes 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.930
 is to use a medium or dark shadow color 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.750
 so I come with my bristle brush 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.809
 Here beginning at the outer corner withdraws 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.590
 excess of bristles places shade on 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.180
 towards the inner corner and leaves the corner 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.180
 External more sample 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.780
 and to raise even more I go 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.909
 start to finish the same base 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.220
 aimed at preparing the land if 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.220
 put a generous and clean layer 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.390
 because of course I will enter with the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.610
 base brush and my favorite brand 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.320
 apply a good layer on the eyelashes 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.570
 superior 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.149
 do not take a product that I love that 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.060
 eye pencil and eyebrow I go 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:34.550
 give a slight brushstroke on the outer corner 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.210
 the eyes and the button we will be quick 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.210
 so red 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.200
 so very easy 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.420
 You can do it like this, you can wear it black. 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.960
 loaded in the eyes you can use a blue 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.080
 of intense you choose the color but the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.179
 secret of makeup is to practice a lot 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.429
 now it's your turn to try and 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.720
 Then you tell me how it got a 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.720
 Kiss and see you next time
