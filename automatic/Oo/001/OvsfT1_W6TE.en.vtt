00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.170 

one<00:02:22.110> interesting<00:02:22.680> thing<00:02:22.950> about<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.610> lot<00:02:23.910> again

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
one interesting thing about a lot again

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.690 
one interesting thing about a lot again
a<00:02:24.330> tank<00:02:24.599> gun<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.080> these<00:02:25.620> sights<00:02:25.920> are<00:02:26.130> offset

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
a tank gun is these sights are offset

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.420 
a tank gun is these sights are offset
and<00:02:27.390> that's<00:02:27.569> because<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.020> magazine<00:02:28.290> sits<00:02:29.280> in

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and that's because the magazine sits in

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.089 
and that's because the magazine sits in
the<00:02:29.520> middle<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.970> gun<00:02:30.410> which<00:02:31.410> obscures

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
the middle of the gun which obscures

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.970 
the middle of the gun which obscures
your<00:02:32.220> vision<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.590> target<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.830> they

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
your vision of the target so they

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.740 
your vision of the target so they
naturally<00:02:35.489> put<00:02:35.730> these<00:02:35.940> sights<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> side

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
naturally put these sights on the side

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.990 
naturally put these sights on the side
kind<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> Bren<00:02:37.560> gun<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.700> your
