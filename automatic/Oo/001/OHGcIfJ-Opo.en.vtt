can't<00:01:30.600> foresee<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.049> being<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> knife<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
can't foresee this being a knife that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.780 
can't foresee this being a knife that
you're<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> take<00:01:32.189> out<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> woods<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
you're going to take out the woods and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.330 
you're going to take out the woods and
be<00:01:32.880> using<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.810> chop<00:01:34.590> stuff<00:01:34.829> around<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.220> is

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
be using to chop stuff around this is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
be using to chop stuff around this is
more<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> an<00:01:35.759> everyday<00:01:36.000> carrying<00:01:36.450> blade<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
more of an everyday carrying blade and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.660 
more of an everyday carrying blade and
the<00:01:36.930> reason<00:01:37.740> i<00:01:37.829> got<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> serrations<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the reason i got the serrations is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.219 
the reason i got the serrations is
because<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.450> my<00:01:39.630> other<00:01:39.750> blades<00:01:39.990> were

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
because all my other blades were

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.370 
because all my other blades were
straight<00:01:41.100> edge<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.600> looking<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.110> one

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
straight edge so I was looking for one

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
straight edge so I was looking for one
with<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> combo<00:01:43.979> edge<00:01:44.180> but<00:01:45.180> overall<00:01:45.600> they're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
with the combo edge but overall they're

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.050 
with the combo edge but overall they're
pretty<00:01:46.020> sharp<00:01:46.460> they're<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
pretty sharp they're just not going to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.539 
pretty sharp they're just not going to
be<00:01:48.210> heavy<00:01:48.780> use<00:01:49.399> serrations<00:01:50.399> pretty<00:01:51.119> good<00:01:51.270> um

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
be heavy use serrations pretty good um

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.950 
be heavy use serrations pretty good um
so<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.939> deployment<00:01:54.450> hole<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.930> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
so it has the deployment hole like that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.850 
so it has the deployment hole like that
it's<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.040> little<00:01:56.219> tough<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.939> get<00:01:57.180> out<00:01:57.740> as<00:01:58.740> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it's a little tough to get out as you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.940 
it's a little tough to get out as you
can<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.240> one<00:02:00.240> hand<00:02:00.420> opens<00:02:00.689> not<00:02:00.810> bad<00:02:01.020> but

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
can see one hand opens not bad but

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.920 
can see one hand opens not bad but
you're<00:02:02.670> gonna<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.030> put<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> good<00:02:03.869> amount

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you're gonna have to put a good amount

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.289 
you're gonna have to put a good amount
of<00:02:04.170> force<00:02:04.409> ended<00:02:04.680> into<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> flick<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.939> it's

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
of force ended into it to flick it it's

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.540 
of force ended into it to flick it it's
not<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.840> assisted<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> get<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> open

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
not it's not assisted so to get it open

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.080 
not it's not assisted so to get it open
it's<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.300> little<00:02:09.539> bit<00:02:09.660> more<00:02:09.840> than<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> would<00:02:11.129> want

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
it's a little bit more than I would want

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.360 
it's a little bit more than I would want
so<00:02:13.090> because<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.650> haven't<00:02:15.130> found

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
so because of that I haven't found

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.370 
so because of that I haven't found
myself<00:02:15.640> carrying<00:02:16.599> this<00:02:16.750> I've<00:02:16.930> been<00:02:17.080> trying<00:02:17.319> to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
carry as much as possible just to test

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.370 
carry as much as possible just to test
it<00:02:19.330> out<00:02:19.420> but<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:20.130> like<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.340> prefer<00:02:21.819> my<00:02:22.380> assisted

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.809 
it out but I like I prefer my assisted
opening<00:02:23.739> ones<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.890> yeah<00:02:27.480> jimping<00:02:29.190> our<00:02:30.190> grip<00:02:30.670> i

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
opening ones so yeah jimping our grip i

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.340 
opening ones so yeah jimping our grip i
should<00:02:30.970> say<00:02:31.120> these<00:02:31.660> are<00:02:31.690> nylon<00:02:33.720> nylon<00:02:34.720> grips

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
should say these are nylon nylon grips

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.770 
should say these are nylon nylon grips
with<00:02:36.160> glass<00:02:36.700> liners<00:02:37.060> in<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.180> middle<00:02:37.390> but

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
with glass liners in the middle but

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.750 
with glass liners in the middle but
these<00:02:37.870> are<00:02:38.019> not<00:02:38.050> on<00:02:38.260> grips<00:02:38.530> textured<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.280> happen

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
these are not on grips textured I happen

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.550 
these are not on grips textured I happen
to<00:02:39.819> like<00:02:40.000> them<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.269> lot<00:02:40.390> they're<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.290> light

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
to like them a lot they're really light

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.170 
to like them a lot they're really light
weight<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.010> they<00:02:42.400> do<00:02:42.459> provide<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.849> good<00:02:43.000> amount

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
weight and they do provide a good amount

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.360 
weight and they do provide a good amount
of<00:02:43.300> grip<00:02:43.450> there's<00:02:44.319> jimping<00:02:44.680> pretty<00:02:45.190> much

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
of grip there's jimping pretty much

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.809 
of grip there's jimping pretty much
about<00:02:45.550> halfway<00:02:46.920> down<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:47.980> back<00:02:48.310> all<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> way

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
about halfway down the back all the way

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.090 
about halfway down the back all the way
to<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:49.810> front<00:02:50.049> of<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.200> deployment<00:02:50.769> hole<00:02:50.890> and

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
to in front of the deployment hole and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.370 
to in front of the deployment hole and
dipping<00:02:52.060> right<00:02:52.150> here<00:02:52.360> doesn't<00:02:52.660> do<00:02:52.750> anything

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
dipping right here doesn't do anything

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.770 
dipping right here doesn't do anything
I'll<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.799> be<00:02:53.890> honest<00:02:54.190> it's<00:02:54.790> really<00:02:55.330> kind<00:02:55.690> of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
I'll just be honest it's really kind of

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.050 
I'll just be honest it's really kind of
pointless<00:02:56.049> because<00:02:57.040> it's<00:02:57.400> it's<00:02:57.670> lowered

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
pointless because it's it's lowered

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.509 
pointless because it's it's lowered
below<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.540> grips<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.709> don't<00:03:00.130> even<00:03:00.370> really

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
below the grips so you don't even really

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.520 
below the grips so you don't even really
get<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.850> much<00:03:01.390> it's<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:01.900> better<00:03:02.080> than<00:03:02.230> smooth

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
get a much it's it's better than smooth

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.160 
get a much it's it's better than smooth
but<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.980> doesn't<00:03:03.489> do<00:03:03.549> much<00:03:04.000> at<00:03:04.209> all<00:03:04.299> Luke

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
but it doesn't do much at all Luke

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.110 
but it doesn't do much at all Luke
tripping<00:03:05.530> here<00:03:05.769> is<00:03:05.950> effective<00:03:06.730> but<00:03:06.880> it's<00:03:07.030> not

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
tripping here is effective but it's not

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.270 
tripping here is effective but it's not
the<00:03:07.150> best<00:03:07.530> especially<00:03:08.530> because<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.040> kind<00:03:09.250> of

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
the best especially because it's kind of

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.190 
the best especially because it's kind of
still<00:03:10.030> pretty<00:03:10.150> straight<00:03:10.600> there's<00:03:10.959> not<00:03:11.140> a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
still pretty straight there's not a

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.500 
still pretty straight there's not a
whole<00:03:11.380> lot<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.620> there's<00:03:12.580> not<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> lift<00:03:13.239> area

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
whole lot of there's not a lift area

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.750 
whole lot of there's not a lift area
where<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.840> can<00:03:13.930> put<00:03:14.080> your<00:03:14.140> thumb<00:03:14.760> jimping

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
where you can put your thumb jimping

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.900 
where you can put your thumb jimping
down<00:03:16.090> here<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:17.769> works<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.070> little<00:03:18.130> bit<00:03:18.340> but<00:03:18.850> not

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
down here it works a little bit but not

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.420 
down here it works a little bit but not
really<00:03:19.510> necessary<00:03:20.140> because<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.040> shape<00:03:21.280> of

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
really necessary because of the shape of

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.789 
really necessary because of the shape of
the<00:03:21.459> grip<00:03:21.700> for<00:03:22.299> that<00:03:22.390> index<00:03:22.690> finger<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.170> then

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
the grip for that index finger and then

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.220 
the grip for that index finger and then
there's<00:03:24.010> also<00:03:24.160> jumping<00:03:24.640> back<00:03:24.910> here<00:03:25.180> for<00:03:25.989> your

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
there's also jumping back here for your

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.199 
there's also jumping back here for your
pinky<00:03:27.130> finger<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.489> have<00:03:27.609> small<00:03:27.790> hands<00:03:27.970> so

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
pinky finger and I have small hands so

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.330 
pinky finger and I have small hands so
but<00:03:28.959> yeah<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.739> fits<00:03:30.040> pretty<00:03:30.280> well<00:03:30.840> um<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:33.220> know

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
but yeah it fits pretty well um you know

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.590 
but yeah it fits pretty well um you know
the<00:03:33.370> nylon<00:03:33.820> grips<00:03:34.120> aren't<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.420> most

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
the nylon grips aren't the most

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.720 
the nylon grips aren't the most
comfortable<00:03:35.070> but<00:03:36.070> they're<00:03:36.519> really

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
comfortable but they're really

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.240 
comfortable but they're really
lightweight<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:38.590> thing's<00:03:38.859> not<00:03:39.040> going

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
lightweight and this thing's not going

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.390 
lightweight and this thing's not going
anywhere<00:03:39.579> it's<00:03:39.730> really<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.359> prefer<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.400> this

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
anywhere it's really I prefer it to this

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.330 
anywhere it's really I prefer it to this
the<00:03:42.880> smooth<00:03:43.329> handles<00:03:44.130> indefinitely<00:03:45.130> it's

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
the smooth handles indefinitely it's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.449 
the smooth handles indefinitely it's
it's<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:45.700> much<00:03:45.850> better<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:49.420> clip<00:03:50.040> um<00:03:51.040> really

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
it's so much better so clip um really

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.130 
it's so much better so clip um really
good<00:03:51.670> clip<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.150> thing<00:03:52.299> I<00:03:52.390> love<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.720> it's

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
good clip on this thing I love it it's

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.490 
good clip on this thing I love it it's
it's<00:03:53.380> really<00:03:53.739> deep<00:03:54.130> especially<00:03:54.910> when<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.299> do

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
it's really deep especially when you do

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.960 
it's really deep especially when you do
well<00:03:56.500> only<00:03:56.709> when<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.100> do<00:03:57.250> tip<00:03:57.489> down<00:03:57.640> i<00:03:57.700> should

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
well only when you do tip down i should

foresee<00:04:09.069> this<00:04:09.160> thing<00:04:09.340> coming<00:04:09.519> out<00:04:09.639> i<00:04:09.700> haven't

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
foresee this thing coming out i haven't

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.000 
foresee this thing coming out i haven't
had<00:04:10.030> any<00:04:10.180> issues<00:04:10.389> with<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.569> yet<00:04:10.840> but<00:04:11.650> i<00:04:11.709> think

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
had any issues with it yet but i think

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.800 
had any issues with it yet but i think
at<00:04:12.310> some<00:04:12.459> point<00:04:12.519> if<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.209> gets<00:04:13.359> snagged<00:04:13.630> on

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
at some point if it gets snagged on

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.650 
at some point if it gets snagged on
something<00:04:14.880> then<00:04:15.880> it's<00:04:16.060> probably<00:04:16.299> gonna<00:04:16.510> come

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
something then it's probably gonna come

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.560 
something then it's probably gonna come
out<00:04:16.780> it's<00:04:16.989> not<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.320> strongest

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
out it's not the strongest

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.890 
out it's not the strongest

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
my camera all right things I left out it

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.410 
my camera all right things I left out it
has<00:04:52.110> glass<00:04:52.710> liner<00:04:53.040> skeletonized<00:04:53.760> pretty<00:04:54.270> good

leads<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.410> pretty<00:04:55.920> lightweight<00:04:56.190> knife<00:04:56.610> three

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360

and a half inch blade or so but only 3.7
ounces<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.410> think<00:05:02.130> that's<00:05:02.310> pretty<00:05:02.490> good<00:05:04.100> again

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100

ounces I think that's pretty good again
wait<00:05:05.610> it's<00:05:05.880> not<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.030> huge<00:05:06.270> issue<00:05:06.360> for<00:05:06.510> me

wait it's not a huge issue for me

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.980 
wait it's not a huge issue for me
because<00:05:06.990> I<00:05:07.080> don't<00:05:07.260> carry<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.830> firearm<00:05:08.840> not<00:05:09.840> of

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
because I don't carry a firearm not of

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.680 
because I don't carry a firearm not of
age<00:05:10.490> for<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.700> which<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:12.270> retarded<00:05:14.210> but<00:05:15.210> you

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
age for that which is retarded but you

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.750 
age for that which is retarded but you
know<00:05:15.810> gotta<00:05:16.200> do<00:05:16.380> what<00:05:16.500> you<00:05:16.590> gotta<00:05:16.740> do<00:05:16.890> anyway

know gotta do what you gotta do anyway

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.660 
know gotta do what you gotta do anyway
so<00:05:18.510> it<00:05:18.660> weights<00:05:19.020> not<00:05:19.170> huge<00:05:19.410> issue<00:05:19.620> for<00:05:19.650> me<00:05:19.890> but

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
so it weights not huge issue for me but

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.640 
so it weights not huge issue for me but
it's<00:05:20.700> still<00:05:21.030> pretty<00:05:21.090> lightweight<00:05:21.590> 3.7<00:05:22.590> ounces

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
it's still pretty lightweight 3.7 ounces

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.710 
it's still pretty lightweight 3.7 ounces
for<00:05:22.980> something<00:05:23.190> like<00:05:23.250> this<00:05:23.340> so<00:05:24.300> it's

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
for something like this so it's

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.390 
for something like this so it's
excellent<00:05:25.170> I<00:05:25.440> think<00:05:25.770> that's<00:05:25.890> mainly<00:05:26.280> because

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
excellent I think that's mainly because

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.730 
excellent I think that's mainly because
of<00:05:26.730> these<00:05:26.820> really<00:05:27.240> lightweight<00:05:27.450> 9<00:05:27.840> nylon

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.710 
grips and the skeletonized liners and
skeletonize<00:05:35.310> clips<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.820> a<00:05:36.030> deployment<00:05:36.480> home

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
skeletonize clips and a deployment home

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.780 
skeletonize clips and a deployment home
a<00:05:36.990> lot<00:05:37.590> they<00:05:37.830> took<00:05:38.010> a<00:05:38.100> lot<00:05:38.220> out<00:05:38.280> of<00:05:38.460> this<00:05:38.640> thing

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
a lot they took a lot out of this thing

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.770 
a lot they took a lot out of this thing
which<00:05:38.910> is<00:05:39.060> good<00:05:39.240> but<00:05:39.420> it's<00:05:39.570> still<00:05:39.720> really

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
which is good but it's still really

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.360 
which is good but it's still really
sturdy<00:05:40.500> no<00:05:41.280> play<00:05:41.550> in<00:05:41.790> the<00:05:42.480> blade<00:05:42.840> at<00:05:42.990> all

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
sturdy no play in the blade at all

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.670 
sturdy no play in the blade at all
excellent<00:05:44.720> um<00:05:45.720> that<00:05:46.260> was<00:05:46.380> something<00:05:46.560> that

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
excellent um that was something that

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.220 
excellent um that was something that
none<00:05:46.890> fancy<00:05:47.280> was<00:05:47.370> talking<00:05:47.610> about<00:05:47.820> but<00:05:48.240> I<00:05:48.480> guess

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
none fancy was talking about but I guess

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.200 
none fancy was talking about but I guess
they<00:05:49.380> may<00:05:49.560> have<00:05:49.620> upgraded<00:05:50.100> that<00:05:50.370> in<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:51.030> newer

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210

they may have upgraded that in the newer
models<00:05:51.690> there's<00:05:51.930> no<00:05:52.110> play<00:05:52.380> whatsoever

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080

I<00:06:11.490> can't<00:06:11.760> foresee<00:06:12.120> it<00:06:12.240> being<00:06:12.270> one<00:06:12.540> of<00:06:12.570> my

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
I can't foresee it being one of my

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.230 
I can't foresee it being one of my
favorites<00:06:13.110> I<00:06:13.290> think<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.340> main<00:06:14.460> issue<00:06:14.700> here<00:06:14.820> is

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
favorites I think the main issue here is

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.830 
favorites I think the main issue here is
the<00:06:16.110> deployment<00:06:16.890> speed<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:18.330> deployment

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
the deployment speed and the deployment

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.240 
the deployment speed and the deployment
hole<00:06:18.990> I<00:06:19.170> wanted<00:06:19.620> one<00:06:19.830> with<00:06:19.920> the<00:06:20.010> deployment

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
hole I wanted one with the deployment

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.600 
hole I wanted one with the deployment
hole<00:06:20.580> but<00:06:21.420> I<00:06:22.230> just<00:06:23.100> don't<00:06:23.250> think<00:06:23.370> they're

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
hole but I just don't think they're

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.000 
hole but I just don't think they're
going<00:06:23.700> to<00:06:23.760> be<00:06:23.880> my<00:06:24.000> favorite<00:06:24.360> I<00:06:24.510> like<00:06:24.960> the<00:06:25.170> thumb
