00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
hey guys welcome back to the layout once

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.180 
hey guys welcome back to the layout once
again<00:00:03.000> as<00:00:03.899> you<00:00:04.049> can<00:00:04.170> see<00:00:04.290> here<00:00:04.529> we've<00:00:04.859> got<00:00:05.130> a

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
again as you can see here we've got a

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.559 
again as you can see here we've got a
little<00:00:05.400> bit<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.700> upper<00:00:05.970> level<00:00:06.089> bench<00:00:06.390> work

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
little bit of upper level bench work

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.120 
little bit of upper level bench work
done<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.350> that's<00:00:07.529> what<00:00:07.649> we're<00:00:07.740> gonna<00:00:07.830> take<00:00:08.099> a

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
done and that's what we're gonna take a

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.640 
done and that's what we're gonna take a
look<00:00:08.340> at<00:00:08.490> today<00:00:09.150> so<00:00:09.260> this<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.530> be

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
look at today so this is going to be

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.950 
look at today so this is going to be
another<00:00:10.889> construction<00:00:11.340> video<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:12.000> think

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
another construction video I think

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.320 
another construction video I think
really<00:00:13.410> all<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:13.740> got<00:00:13.889> done<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.790> video<00:00:15.120> is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
really all we got done in this video is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.939 
really all we got done in this video is
just<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.630> section<00:00:15.929> above<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.170> yard<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.740> I

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
just the section above the yard so I

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099 
just the section above the yard so I
wanted<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.699> more<00:00:17.910> done<00:00:18.109> but

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
wanted to get a little more done but

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.720 
wanted to get a little more done but
this<00:00:19.830> video<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.189> kind<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.430> all<00:00:20.490> over<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> place

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
this video is kind of all over the place

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.550 
this video is kind of all over the place
I<00:00:21.000> shot<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.270> over<00:00:21.359> multiple<00:00:21.779> days<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.500> took

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
I shot it over multiple days and I took

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.320 
I shot it over multiple days and I took
a<00:00:22.680> little<00:00:22.859> longer<00:00:23.100> explaining<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.850> than

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
a little longer explaining it than

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.769 
a little longer explaining it than
anticipated<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:26.269> we're<00:00:27.269> gonna<00:00:27.359> take<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.599> look

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
anticipated but we're gonna take a look

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.200 
anticipated but we're gonna take a look
at<00:00:27.869> installing<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.439> l-brackets<00:00:29.029> that<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
at installing the l-brackets that is the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.669 
at installing the l-brackets that is the
first<00:00:30.449> thing<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.840> then<00:00:30.929> we'll<00:00:31.080> take<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> look

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
first thing and then we'll take a look

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860 
first thing and then we'll take a look
at<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.160> framework<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
at the framework and some of the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.110 
at the framework and some of the
dimensions<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.640> next<00:00:35.760> video

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
dimensions and then in the next video

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.580 
dimensions and then in the next video
we'll<00:00:36.390> pick<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.690> where<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.899> left<00:00:36.960> off<00:00:37.320> right

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
we'll pick up where we left off right

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.470 
we'll pick up where we left off right
here<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.190> then<00:00:38.340> hopefully<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.879> most<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
here and then hopefully get most of the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.959 
here and then hopefully get most of the
upper<00:00:39.719> level<00:00:39.989> frame<00:00:40.680> work<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.700> least<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
upper level frame work in at least the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.440 
upper level frame work in at least the
remaining<00:00:42.390> framework<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.710> anyway<00:00:44.420> with<00:00:45.420> that

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
remaining framework so anyway with that

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.000 
remaining framework so anyway with that
said<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> guess<00:00:46.200> we'll<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.500> jump<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:46.770> into

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
said I guess we'll just jump right into

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.590 
said I guess we'll just jump right into
it<00:00:47.160> install<00:00:47.760> those<00:00:47.879> L<00:00:48.059> brackets<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.510> then

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it install those L brackets and then

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
it install those L brackets and then
move<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.930> from<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.280> point<00:00:50.579> we're

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
move on from there at this point we're

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.459 
move on from there at this point we're
ready<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.120> attach<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.449> L<00:00:51.960> brackets<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
ready to attach the L brackets to the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.080 
ready to attach the L brackets to the
wall<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.579> I've<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.879> kind

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
wall here so you can see I've just kind

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.880 
wall here so you can see I've just kind
of<00:00:54.149> mocked<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.289> I've<00:00:55.440> got<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> couple

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
of mocked this one up I've got a couple

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.279 
of mocked this one up I've got a couple
of<00:00:56.190> thumb<00:00:56.789> tacks<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.899> I'm<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.140> using

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
of thumb tacks in it and I'm just using

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.310 
of thumb tacks in it and I'm just using
this<00:00:58.500> tee<00:00:59.570> that<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.750> put<00:01:00.899> together<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
this tee that I just put together with a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.569 
this tee that I just put together with a
couple<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.710> by<00:01:01.859> twos<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> use

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
couple of one by twos I'm going to use

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
couple of one by twos I'm going to use
this<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.449> adjust<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.780> height<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.199> I've<00:01:04.290> made<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
this to adjust my height so I've made a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
this to adjust my height so I've made a
mark<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.880> height<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> we

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
mark up here this is the height that we

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.789 
mark up here this is the height that we
want<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> top<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> our<00:01:07.260> bench<00:01:07.409> work<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> be

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
want the top of our bench work to be

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.740 
want the top of our bench work to be
it's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.549> below<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.909> line<00:01:09.270> there<00:01:09.540> cuz

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
it's a little below that line there cuz

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.810 
it's a little below that line there cuz
we<00:01:10.500> we're<00:01:10.830> gonna<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.040> some<00:01:11.220> plywood<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.790> top

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
we we're gonna have some plywood on top

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850 
we we're gonna have some plywood on top
of<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.240> board<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.810> eventually<00:01:13.439> when<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
of this board here eventually when the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.399 
of this board here eventually when the
frames<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.780> using<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.259> brought

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
frames and so using that I just brought

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.200 
frames and so using that I just brought
this<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.920> height<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> was<00:01:17.939> looking

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
this up to the height that I was looking

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
this up to the height that I was looking
for<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:19.110> pinned<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.340> I'm

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
for I just pinned it in and now what I'm

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.600 
for I just pinned it in and now what I'm
gonna<00:01:20.490> go<00:01:20.640> ahead<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.210> go<00:01:22.110> around<00:01:22.610> these

gonna go ahead and do is go around these

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
gonna go ahead and do is go around these
three<00:01:23.970> holes<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.570> there's<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.320> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
three holes here there's one on this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.810 
three holes here there's one on this
side<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.710> well<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.250> I'm<00:01:26.310> gonna<00:01:26.430> screw<00:01:26.700> those

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
side as well and I'm gonna screw those

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
side as well and I'm gonna screw those
in<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:27.630> we'll<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.930> down<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> line

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
in and then we'll go down the line

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.410 
in and then we'll go down the line
get<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> L<00:01:29.460> brackets<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.000> make<00:01:30.270> sure

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
get all the L brackets in make sure

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.609 
get all the L brackets in make sure
they're<00:01:30.540> level<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.200> we'll<00:01:31.290> come<00:01:31.470> back

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
they're level and then we'll come back

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.630 
they're level and then we'll come back
in<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.829> our<00:01:31.950> frame<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.369> I'll<00:01:32.430> kind<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
in with our frame and I'll kind of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.100 
in with our frame and I'll kind of
explain<00:01:32.700> how<00:01:33.119> we're<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> attach<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
explain how we're going to attach the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
explain how we're going to attach the
frame<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:35.189> we're<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.520> not<00:01:35.700> going

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
frame because we're actually not going

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.030 
frame because we're actually not going
to<00:01:35.909> use<00:01:36.000> these<00:01:36.150> two<00:01:36.390> holes<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.049> let<00:01:37.860> me<00:01:37.950> go

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
to use these two holes so let me go

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.740 
to use these two holes so let me go
ahead<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.340> put<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.479> I'll<00:01:39.570> keep

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
ahead and put this one in and I'll keep

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.179 
ahead and put this one in and I'll keep
heading<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.110> way<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.009> our<00:01:41.070> L

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
heading that way with all of our L

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.440 
heading that way with all of our L
brackets<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.490> them<00:01:47.640> spaced<00:01:48.240> about

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
brackets so I have them spaced about

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.219 
brackets so I have them spaced about
every<00:01:48.810> 32<00:01:49.259> inches<00:01:49.700> which<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.729> quite<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> bit<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
every 32 inches which is quite a bit of

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649 
every 32 inches which is quite a bit of
a<00:01:52.290> gap<00:01:52.530> between<00:01:52.770> them<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.240> more

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
a gap between them but I do have more

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.480 
a gap between them but I do have more
over<00:01:54.840> here<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.009> wanted<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.369> these

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
over here so I just wanted to get these

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.609 
over here so I just wanted to get these
main<00:01:56.759> ones<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.240> first<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.469> we're

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
main ones in first and then we're

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.620 
main ones in first and then we're
actually<00:01:58.740> gonna<00:01:58.979> put<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> frame<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.729> see<00:02:00.479> how

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
actually gonna put a frame on it see how

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.240 
actually gonna put a frame on it see how
it<00:02:00.689> stands<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> then<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.860> always<00:02:01.979> go

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it stands up and then we can always go

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.690 
it stands up and then we can always go
in<00:02:02.430> between<00:02:02.789> and<00:02:03.390> had<00:02:03.570> more<00:02:04.560> afterwards<00:02:05.070> but

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
all I did really was mark the center all

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.110 
all I did really was mark the center all
the<00:02:09.030> studs<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.170> stud<00:02:10.380> finder<00:02:10.590> first<00:02:11.120> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the studs with a stud finder first and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240 
the studs with a stud finder first and
then<00:02:12.269> I<00:02:12.300> just<00:02:12.510> came<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.930> well<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.650> set<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> first

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
then I just came in well I set the first

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.190 
then I just came in well I set the first

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
one right so I marked on the wall how

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.960 
one right so I marked on the wall how
high<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.410> wanted<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.800> go<00:02:16.950> 16<00:02:17.400> inches<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:17.849> there

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
high I wanted to go 16 inches in there

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.059 
high I wanted to go 16 inches in there
to<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> level<00:02:18.540> how<00:02:19.319> high<00:02:19.500> should<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.800> be<00:02:19.860> over

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
to the level how high should it be over

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.920 
to the level how high should it be over
here<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.459> set<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.840> just

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
here I set this one and then it just

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.449 
here I set this one and then it just
kept<00:02:22.200> going<00:02:22.349> down<00:02:22.620> what's<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> level

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
kept going down what's the level

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.699 
kept going down what's the level
adjusting<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> next<00:02:24.599> one<00:02:24.780> putting<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.620> over

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
adjusting the next one putting it over

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.530 
adjusting the next one putting it over
some<00:02:25.920> thumbtacks<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:27.030> screwing<00:02:27.420> it

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
with screws so then I go to the next one

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
did that and now this is all set up I'm

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.630 
did that and now this is all set up I'm
gonna<00:02:36.660> go<00:02:36.780> ahead<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.590> our<00:02:37.769> one<00:02:37.980> by<00:02:38.130> twos<00:02:38.370> like

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
gonna go ahead with our one by twos like

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.039 
gonna go ahead with our one by twos like
you<00:02:38.730> see<00:02:38.880> here<00:02:39.090> I'm<00:02:39.420> gonna<00:02:39.599> start<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.840> build

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
you see here I'm gonna start to build

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.479 
you see here I'm gonna start to build
the<00:02:40.170> grid<00:02:40.380> framework<00:02:40.769> it's<00:02:40.980> gonna<00:02:41.099> go<00:02:41.280> along

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
the grid framework it's gonna go along

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.970 
the grid framework it's gonna go along
here<00:02:41.700> kind<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.690> explain<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.110> dimensions<00:02:43.830> and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
here kind of explain the dimensions and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.890 
here kind of explain the dimensions and
what<00:02:44.099> we're<00:02:44.220> doing<00:02:44.250> there<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.780> we'll

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
what we're doing there and then we'll

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.050 
what we're doing there and then we'll
move<00:02:46.019> forward<00:02:46.200> from<00:02:46.380> there<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:46.980> I'm<00:02:47.790> gonna<00:02:47.910> go

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
move forward from there so I'm gonna go

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.280 
move forward from there so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.239> do<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.540> alright<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.019> here's<00:02:49.200> our

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
ahead and do that alright so here's our

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.620 
ahead and do that alright so here's our
first<00:02:49.560> frame<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.430> goes<00:02:50.819> on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.120> upper<00:02:51.360> level

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
first frame that goes on the upper level

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.600 
first frame that goes on the upper level
here<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.590> before<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.920> go<00:02:53.099> any<00:02:53.130> further<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.549> just

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
here and before I go any further I just

here and before I go any further I just
want<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.910> point<00:02:54.090> out<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.239> couple<00:02:54.299> things<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:54.959> I

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.250 
can't remember if I mentioned this
already<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.269> upper<00:02:57.569> level<00:02:57.900> above<00:02:58.200> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
already but the upper level above the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.319 
already but the upper level above the
yard<00:02:58.590> area<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.069> actually<00:02:59.760> 15<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.299> half

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
yard area is actually 15 and a half

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.319 
yard area is actually 15 and a half
inches<00:03:00.600> deep<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.579> reason<00:03:02.850> we<00:03:02.940> chose<00:03:03.150> that

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
inches deep and the reason we chose that

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.420 
inches deep and the reason we chose that
is<00:03:03.390> because<00:03:03.569> we<00:03:03.959> want<00:03:04.109> to<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.890> complete

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
is because we want to have a complete

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.280 
is because we want to have a complete
visibility<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.630> yard<00:03:06.810> below<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.200> if

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
visibility of the yard below so if

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.599 
visibility of the yard below so if
you're<00:03:07.410> an<00:03:07.470> operator<00:03:07.799> working<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.340> yard

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
you're an operator working on the yard

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.099 
you're an operator working on the yard
you<00:03:09.030> want<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.209> make<00:03:09.299> sure<00:03:09.329> you<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.660> see<00:03:09.870> all<00:03:10.079> of

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
you want to make sure you can see all of

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.009 
you want to make sure you can see all of
it<00:03:10.260> even<00:03:10.530> when<00:03:10.650> you're<00:03:10.739> fairly<00:03:10.980> close<00:03:11.370> so

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
it even when you're fairly close so

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.330 
it even when you're fairly close so
shrinking<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.139> upper<00:03:13.410> level<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.829> 15<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
shrinking the upper level to 15 and a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.670 
shrinking the upper level to 15 and a
half<00:03:14.370> inches<00:03:14.609> deep<00:03:15.019> whereas<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.230> lower

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
half inches deep whereas the lower

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.259 
half inches deep whereas the lower
levels<00:03:16.980> 20<00:03:17.190> inches<00:03:17.370> deep<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.760> allows<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.150> to

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
levels 20 inches deep that allows you to

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.479 
levels 20 inches deep that allows you to
see<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.510> entire<00:03:18.720> yard<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.980> fascia<00:03:20.220> on<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
see the entire yard the fascia on the

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.949 
see the entire yard the fascia on the
front<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.910> going<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.299> come<00:03:21.480> down<00:03:21.660> just<00:03:21.840> a

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
front is going to come down just a

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.360 
front is going to come down just a
little<00:03:21.989> bit<00:03:22.260> more<00:03:22.530> but<00:03:22.769> not<00:03:22.920> much<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.280> you

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
little bit more but not much so you

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.759 
little bit more but not much so you
might<00:03:23.519> have<00:03:23.609> two<00:03:23.819> inch<00:03:24.000> fascia<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.420> front

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
might have two inch fascia on the front

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.470 
might have two inch fascia on the front
which<00:03:25.769> again<00:03:26.220> won't<00:03:26.730> conflict<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:27.359> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
which again won't conflict with the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.830 
which again won't conflict with the
lower<00:03:27.630> level<00:03:28.040> visibility<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:30.420> other<00:03:30.569> reason

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
lower level visibility the other reason

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.270 
lower level visibility the other reason
we<00:03:30.930> brought<00:03:31.139> it<00:03:31.230> down<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.440> 15<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.889> half<00:03:31.920> is

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
we brought it down to 15 and a half is

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.340 
we brought it down to 15 and a half is
because<00:03:32.579> these<00:03:32.850> l-brackets<00:03:33.510> are<00:03:33.630> exactly<00:03:33.959> 15

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
because these l-brackets are exactly 15

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.460 
because these l-brackets are exactly 15
and<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.530> half<00:03:34.650> long<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.130> because<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
and a half long and because of the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.660 
and a half long and because of the
placement<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.590> holes<00:03:37.799> here<00:03:38.040> for<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
placement of the holes here for the the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.920 
placement of the holes here for the the
screws<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.269> we<00:03:39.359> could<00:03:39.480> need<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.750> put

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
screws that we could need to put

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.930 
screws that we could need to put
underneath<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:41.010> needed<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> bring<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.670> frame

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
underneath we needed to bring that frame

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.699 
underneath we needed to bring that frame
in<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.329> little<00:03:43.109> bit<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.410> we<00:03:43.500> could<00:03:43.620> actually

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
in a little bit so we could actually

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.690 
in a little bit so we could actually
screw<00:03:44.130> in<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.410> outer<00:03:47.069> piece<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.639> the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
screw in to to the outer piece of the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.610 
screw in to to the outer piece of the
frame<00:03:47.910> here<00:03:48.209> another<00:03:49.049> thing<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.290> want<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.500> point

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
frame here another thing I want to point

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.199 
frame here another thing I want to point
out<00:03:49.799> is<00:03:49.980> we<00:03:50.010> actually<00:03:50.310> offset<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.970> frame

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
out is we actually offset the frame

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.900 
out is we actually offset the frame
because<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:52.920> gap<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.190> we<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:53.519> here<00:03:53.819> in

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
because this gap that we have here in

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.400 
because this gap that we have here in
the<00:03:54.000> L<00:03:54.120> bracket<00:03:54.510> will<00:03:54.720> actually<00:03:55.019> cause<00:03:55.200> this

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
the L bracket will actually cause this

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.890 
the L bracket will actually cause this
crossmember<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:56.040> kind<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.220> sag<00:03:56.519> into<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:57.090> and

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
crossmember to kind of sag into it and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.699 
crossmember to kind of sag into it and
we<00:03:58.019> just<00:03:58.139> want<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.349> make<00:03:58.410> sure<00:03:58.470> we<00:03:58.620> have

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
we just want to make sure we have

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.640 
we just want to make sure we have
maximum<00:03:59.099> support<00:03:59.459> so<00:03:59.639> now<00:03:59.959> each<00:04:00.959> crossmember

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
maximum support so now each crossmember

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.259 
maximum support so now each crossmember
it<00:04:01.859> will<00:04:02.130> not<00:04:02.280> each<00:04:02.459> one<00:04:02.669> we<00:04:02.820> still<00:04:03.000> got<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.180> put

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
it will not each one we still got to put

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.300 
it will not each one we still got to put
a<00:04:03.299> few<00:04:03.660> more<00:04:03.690> L<00:04:03.959> brackets<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.410> but<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:05.100> cross

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
a few more L brackets in but the cross

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.630 
a few more L brackets in but the cross
members<00:04:05.669> sit<00:04:06.600> on<00:04:06.829> this<00:04:07.829> flat

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
members sit on this flat

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.850 
members sit on this flat
flair<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.690> l-bracket<00:04:10.140> giving<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.470> maximum

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
flair of the l-bracket giving it maximum

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.930 
flair of the l-bracket giving it maximum
support<00:04:11.310> also<00:04:12.120> each<00:04:12.930> stud<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:14.280> space<00:04:14.550> 16

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
support also each stud this space 16

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.550 
support also each stud this space 16
inches<00:04:15.120> apart<00:04:15.420> just<00:04:15.630> like<00:04:15.750> our<00:04:15.959> cross<00:04:16.170> members

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
inches apart just like our cross members

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.199 
inches apart just like our cross members
and<00:04:16.829> if<00:04:17.010> we<00:04:17.100> shifted<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.519> frame<00:04:17.790> over<00:04:18.060> we'd

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
and if we shifted the frame over we'd

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.490 
and if we shifted the frame over we'd
actually<00:04:18.329> cover<00:04:18.690> up<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.989> centerline<00:04:19.350> of<00:04:19.380> the

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
actually cover up the centerline of the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.830 
actually cover up the centerline of the
stud<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.890> we<00:04:20.130> need<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:20.730> we<00:04:20.820> can<00:04:20.940> screw

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
stud and we need that so we can screw

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.470 
stud and we need that so we can screw
into<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.109> wall<00:04:22.200> there<00:04:22.500> securing<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.040> frame

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
into the wall there securing the frame

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.930 
into the wall there securing the frame
so<00:04:24.480> anyway<00:04:24.780> we<00:04:25.710> need<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.890> do<00:04:26.580> this<00:04:26.700> little

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
so anyway we need to do this little

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.780 
so anyway we need to do this little
angled<00:04:27.270> frame<00:04:27.450> down<00:04:27.600> here<00:04:27.900> get<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.950> in<00:04:29.130> first

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
angled frame down here get that in first

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.580 
angled frame down here get that in first
I'm<00:04:29.940> going<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.120> secure<00:04:30.240> this<00:04:30.510> frame<00:04:30.810> now<00:04:31.290> once

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
I'm going to secure this frame now once

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.130 
I'm going to secure this frame now once
we<00:04:31.680> get<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:31.980> angled<00:04:32.970> triangle<00:04:33.510> deal<00:04:33.870> down

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
we get that angled triangle deal down

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.350 
we get that angled triangle deal down
there<00:04:34.380> we'll<00:04:35.190> work<00:04:35.370> our<00:04:35.520> way<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.820> way<00:04:35.970> with<00:04:36.330> a

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
there we'll work our way this way with a

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.640 
there we'll work our way this way with a
couple<00:04:36.660> more<00:04:36.780> frames<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.230> then<00:04:37.290> down<00:04:37.500> on<00:04:37.530> the

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
couple more frames and then down on the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.590 
couple more frames and then down on the
corner<00:04:38.070> we're<00:04:38.910> actually<00:04:39.000> going<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.300> bring<00:04:39.480> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
corner we're actually going to bring the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.810 
corner we're actually going to bring the
scene<00:04:39.840> out<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:40.980> corner<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.340> wall<00:04:41.520> just

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
scene out to the corner of the wall just

00:04:41.820 --> 00:06:18.399 
scene out to the corner of the wall just
like<00:04:41.910> we've<00:04:42.120> done<00:04:42.270> below

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.429 

all<00:06:19.249> right<00:06:19.399> so<00:06:19.669> here's<00:06:20.209> our<00:06:20.330> upper-level<00:06:20.809> at

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:21.439 
all right so here's our upper-level at

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:22.869 
all right so here's our upper-level at
least<00:06:21.619> above<00:06:21.800> the<00:06:21.949> yard<00:06:22.189> so<00:06:22.489> this<00:06:22.610> is<00:06:22.729> going<00:06:22.819> to

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:22.879 
least above the yard so this is going to

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.959 
least above the yard so this is going to
be<00:06:23.029> Crawford<00:06:23.569> Nebraska<00:06:24.610> when<00:06:25.610> all<00:06:25.789> is<00:06:25.939> said

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:25.969 
be Crawford Nebraska when all is said

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.659 
be Crawford Nebraska when all is said
and<00:06:26.269> done<00:06:26.619> so<00:06:27.619> helper<00:06:27.919> pockets<00:06:28.249> gonna<00:06:28.369> be<00:06:28.519> down

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
and done so helper pockets gonna be down

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.699 
and done so helper pockets gonna be down
here<00:06:28.939> in<00:06:29.509> case<00:06:29.749> you<00:06:29.809> missed<00:06:30.110> it<00:06:30.259> I<00:06:30.469> think<00:06:30.679> I

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:30.709 
here in case you missed it I think I

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:32.559 
here in case you missed it I think I
already<00:06:30.889> said<00:06:31.069> this<00:06:31.189> but<00:06:31.369> this<00:06:31.580> angle<00:06:32.300> here<00:06:32.479> is

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:32.569 
already said this but this angle here is

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:33.999 
already said this but this angle here is
the<00:06:32.599> same<00:06:32.689> as<00:06:32.869> it<00:06:33.139> is<00:06:33.229> down<00:06:33.379> below<00:06:33.559> so<00:06:33.889> this

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
the same as it is down below so this

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.519 
the same as it is down below so this
angled<00:06:34.309> frame<00:06:34.489> matches<00:06:35.419> the<00:06:36.080> piece<00:06:36.229> below

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
angled frame matches the piece below

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.009 
angled frame matches the piece below
except<00:06:36.830> it<00:06:36.919> cuts<00:06:37.129> them<00:06:37.279> a<00:06:37.309> little<00:06:37.550> sooner

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:38.019 
except it cuts them a little sooner

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:40.989 
except it cuts them a little sooner
because<00:06:39.019> it's<00:06:39.289> a<00:06:39.379> narrower<00:06:39.679> seen<00:06:40.519> here<00:06:40.759> but<00:06:40.879> it

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:40.999 
because it's a narrower seen here but it

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:44.049 
because it's a narrower seen here but it
worked<00:06:41.149> out<00:06:41.300> that<00:06:41.749> this<00:06:42.289> kind<00:06:43.099> of<00:06:43.249> came

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:44.059 
worked out that this kind of came

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:45.639 
worked out that this kind of came
together<00:06:44.209> right<00:06:44.599> on<00:06:44.719> this<00:06:44.809> L<00:06:44.989> bracket<00:06:45.349> I<00:06:45.439> tried

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:45.649 
together right on this L bracket I tried

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:47.649 
together right on this L bracket I tried
to<00:06:45.769> coordinate<00:06:45.949> all<00:06:46.219> the<00:06:46.610> frame<00:06:46.909> joints<00:06:47.479> kind

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
to coordinate all the frame joints kind

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:48.939 
to coordinate all the frame joints kind
of<00:06:47.779> like<00:06:47.869> where<00:06:48.019> they<00:06:48.110> come<00:06:48.139> together<00:06:48.379> over<00:06:48.769> a

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
of like where they come together over a

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:53.229 
of like where they come together over a
bracket<00:06:49.399> so<00:06:49.969> same<00:06:50.509> deal<00:06:50.689> here<00:06:50.719> and<00:06:51.249> then<00:06:52.249> same

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:53.239 
bracket so same deal here and then same

00:06:53.239 --> 00:06:56.709 
bracket so same deal here and then same
deal<00:06:53.449> here<00:06:53.479> as<00:06:53.869> well<00:06:55.209> except<00:06:56.209> for<00:06:56.360> here<00:06:56.509> but

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:56.719 
deal here as well except for here but

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:57.879 
deal here as well except for here but
that's<00:06:56.929> no<00:06:57.050> big<00:06:57.199> deal<00:06:57.229> because<00:06:57.529> it's<00:06:57.769> pretty

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
that's no big deal because it's pretty

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:59.919 
that's no big deal because it's pretty
close<00:06:58.129> to<00:06:58.279> the<00:06:58.369> old<00:06:58.489> racket<00:06:58.729> but<00:06:58.999> this<00:06:59.689> face

00:06:59.919 --> 00:06:59.929 
close to the old racket but this face

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:03.819 
close to the old racket but this face
right<00:07:00.169> here<00:07:00.379> is<00:07:00.649> 12<00:07:01.399> inches<00:07:01.669> wide<00:07:01.899> unlike<00:07:02.899> what

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:03.829 
right here is 12 inches wide unlike what

00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:04.959 
right here is 12 inches wide unlike what
we<00:07:03.889> have<00:07:04.009> here<00:07:04.189> below<00:07:04.459> which<00:07:04.639> is<00:07:04.729> a<00:07:04.759> little

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:04.969 
we have here below which is a little

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:06.819 
we have here below which is a little
wider<00:07:05.149> I<00:07:05.269> think<00:07:05.479> that's<00:07:05.599> 18<00:07:05.929> or<00:07:06.050> 20<00:07:06.289> inches<00:07:06.319> so

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:06.829 
wider I think that's 18 or 20 inches so

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:08.019 
wider I think that's 18 or 20 inches so
we<00:07:06.860> kind<00:07:07.069> of<00:07:07.099> condensed<00:07:07.519> it<00:07:07.639> on<00:07:07.729> the<00:07:07.819> upper

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:08.029 
we kind of condensed it on the upper

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:09.969 
we kind of condensed it on the upper
level<00:07:08.300> and<00:07:09.229> the<00:07:09.319> same<00:07:09.469> will<00:07:09.589> be<00:07:09.619> true<00:07:09.860> over

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979 
level and the same will be true over

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.549 
level and the same will be true over
here<00:07:10.309> I<00:07:10.489> think<00:07:11.269> this<00:07:11.360> is<00:07:11.479> 24<00:07:11.899> inches<00:07:12.019> out<00:07:12.259> from

00:07:12.549 --> 00:07:12.559 
here I think this is 24 inches out from

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:14.799 
here I think this is 24 inches out from
the<00:07:12.919> wall<00:07:13.009> but<00:07:13.969> the<00:07:14.059> upper<00:07:14.360> level<00:07:14.629> is<00:07:14.719> actually

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:14.809 
the wall but the upper level is actually

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.419 
the wall but the upper level is actually
going<00:07:15.050> to<00:07:15.139> be<00:07:15.199> somewhere<00:07:15.469> in<00:07:15.529> the<00:07:15.649> range<00:07:15.739> of<00:07:15.979> 18

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:16.429 
going to be somewhere in the range of 18

00:07:16.429 --> 00:07:19.600 
going to be somewhere in the range of 18
inches<00:07:17.409> but<00:07:18.409> keep<00:07:18.709> in<00:07:18.829> mind<00:07:18.860> that<00:07:19.129> that<00:07:19.339> scene

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 
inches but keep in mind that that scene

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.279 
inches but keep in mind that that scene
up<00:07:19.789> here<00:07:19.999> is<00:07:20.119> also<00:07:20.329> going<00:07:20.479> to<00:07:20.599> sweep<00:07:20.869> out<00:07:21.019> like

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:21.289 
up here is also going to sweep out like

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.079 
up here is also going to sweep out like
the<00:07:21.379> lower<00:07:21.559> level<00:07:21.860> so<00:07:22.519> that'll<00:07:22.759> actually<00:07:22.849> be

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:23.089 
the lower level so that'll actually be

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:25.480 
the lower level so that'll actually be
the<00:07:23.179> narrowest<00:07:23.599> point<00:07:23.949> you'll<00:07:24.949> notice<00:07:25.129> we

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
the narrowest point you'll notice we

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.489 
the narrowest point you'll notice we
don't<00:07:25.729> have<00:07:25.999> this<00:07:26.179> wall<00:07:26.419> portion<00:07:26.809> in<00:07:26.899> yet<00:07:27.110> and

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:27.499 
don't have this wall portion in yet and

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:28.629 
don't have this wall portion in yet and
we'll<00:07:27.589> be<00:07:27.709> working<00:07:27.860> on<00:07:28.099> that<00:07:28.249> in<00:07:28.309> upcoming

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 
we'll be working on that in upcoming

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.459 
we'll be working on that in upcoming
videos<00:07:29.179> but<00:07:29.479> what<00:07:29.599> that<00:07:29.749> means<00:07:29.929> is<00:07:30.169> I<00:07:30.259> can't

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:30.469 
videos but what that means is I can't

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:33.119 
videos but what that means is I can't
really<00:07:30.589> work<00:07:30.829> on<00:07:30.919> this<00:07:31.069> framework<00:07:31.490> here<00:07:32.079> or

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.129 
really work on this framework here or

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:36.999 
really work on this framework here or
here<00:07:34.129> up<00:07:34.490> until<00:07:34.699> where<00:07:35.539> the<00:07:35.689> the<00:07:36.169> wall<00:07:36.379> goes

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:37.009 
here up until where the the wall goes

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:39.279 
here up until where the the wall goes
back<00:07:37.249> up<00:07:37.399> to<00:07:37.429> the<00:07:37.490> ceiling<00:07:37.729> so<00:07:38.089> I<00:07:38.719> actually

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:39.289 
back up to the ceiling so I actually

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:40.809 
back up to the ceiling so I actually
just<00:07:39.559> picked<00:07:39.679> up<00:07:39.740> a<00:07:39.829> bunch<00:07:39.979> of<00:07:40.069> one<00:07:40.219> by<00:07:40.369> four<00:07:40.399> so

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:40.819 
just picked up a bunch of one by four so

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:41.739 
just picked up a bunch of one by four so
we're<00:07:40.939> kind<00:07:41.089> of<00:07:41.149> switching<00:07:41.509> up<00:07:41.599> our

00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:41.749 
we're kind of switching up our

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:42.969 
we're kind of switching up our
construction<00:07:42.169> method<00:07:42.469> and<00:07:42.619> I'll<00:07:42.679> explain

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:42.979 
construction method and I'll explain

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:44.709 
construction method and I'll explain
that<00:07:43.039> in<00:07:43.219> a<00:07:43.279> second<00:07:43.639> but<00:07:44.419> I'm<00:07:44.479> going<00:07:44.599> to<00:07:44.659> go

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:44.719 
that in a second but I'm going to go

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:47.229 
that in a second but I'm going to go
ahead<00:07:44.839> and<00:07:45.050> work<00:07:45.139> on<00:07:45.319> a<00:07:45.379> little<00:07:45.679> more<00:07:46.239> grid

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:47.239 
ahead and work on a little more grid

00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:49.419 
ahead and work on a little more grid
bench<00:07:47.539> work<00:07:47.779> starting<00:07:48.469> about<00:07:48.559> here<00:07:48.979> and<00:07:49.309> then

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:49.429 
bench work starting about here and then

00:07:49.429 --> 00:07:51.669 
bench work starting about here and then
we'll<00:07:49.550> wrap<00:07:49.909> our<00:07:50.119> way<00:07:50.239> around<00:07:50.360> the<00:07:50.629> room<00:07:50.809> along

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:51.679 
we'll wrap our way around the room along

00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:54.009 
we'll wrap our way around the room along
the<00:07:51.860> peninsula
