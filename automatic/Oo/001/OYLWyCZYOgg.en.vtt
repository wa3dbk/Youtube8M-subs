around<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.020> table<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.070> had<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.610> flower

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
petals around it right first off the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.280 
petals around it right first off the
fact<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.549> they<00:01:53.970> weren't<00:01:54.180> real<00:01:54.509> candles<00:01:55.049> was

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
fact that they weren't real candles was

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.480 
fact that they weren't real candles was
a<00:01:55.320> surprise<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> me<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.979> thought<00:01:56.189> they<00:01:56.280> were<00:01:56.369> all

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
a surprise to me I thought they were all

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.980 
a surprise to me I thought they were all
real<00:01:56.700> candle<00:01:57.090> because<00:01:57.509> they've<00:01:57.659> had<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
real candle because they've had that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.899 
real candle because they've had that
flicker<00:01:58.290> effect<00:01:58.409> yeah<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.369> when<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> put<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
flicker effect yeah but when you put the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.530 
flicker effect yeah but when you put the
flower<00:02:00.630> petals

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
flower petals

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.270 
flower petals
