floor plan I'll minimize that bring it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.630 
floor plan I'll minimize that bring it
up<00:00:54.920> good<00:00:55.920> idea<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.370> give<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> name<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:58.640> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
up good idea to give it a name just to
