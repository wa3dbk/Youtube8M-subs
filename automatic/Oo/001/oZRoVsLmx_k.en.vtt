00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
acquisition is something I've been

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.120 
acquisition is something I've been
working<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:51.030> idea<00:00:51.060> is<00:00:51.630> to<00:00:51.870> basically<00:00:52.130> we

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
working on the idea is to basically we

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.610 
working on the idea is to basically we
still<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.730> target<00:00:54.150> and<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> recently

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
still get on target and do it recently

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.050 
still get on target and do it recently
I've<00:00:55.710> been<00:00:55.800> worried<00:00:56.100> about<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:56.520> getting<00:00:56.760> too

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
I've been worried about bit getting too

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060 
I've been worried about bit getting too
fast<00:00:57.450> on<00:00:57.690> target<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.200> just<00:00:58.380> using<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> full

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
fast on target and just using the full

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.700 
fast on target and just using the full
auto<00:00:59.310> too<00:00:59.490> much<00:00:59.900> I'm<00:01:00.900> going<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> more

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
auto too much I'm going back to more

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.260 
auto too much I'm going back to more
burst<00:01:01.950> firing<00:01:02.250> I've<00:01:02.490> slowed<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.850> sensitivity

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
burst firing I've slowed my sensitivity

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.170 
burst firing I've slowed my sensitivity
down<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:03.810> a<00:01:03.870> 925<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.040> actually<00:01:05.790> tried<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
down from a 925 and actually tried to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.520 
down from a 925 and actually tried to
work<00:01:06.329> it<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:06.930> I've<00:01:07.140> got<00:01:07.320> some

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
work it like that and I've got some

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.780 
work it like that and I've got some
pretty<00:01:07.650> good<00:01:07.770> game<00:01:08.100> plays<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.549> got<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
old drone just the other day which I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.840 
old drone just the other day which I
probably<00:01:18.630> ain't<00:01:18.929> show<00:01:19.109> that<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:20.429> because

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
probably ain't show that one but because

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.399 
probably ain't show that one but because
it's<00:01:20.999> 26<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> over<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.020> ten-minute

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
it's 26 and over the ten-minute

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.379 
it's 26 and over the ten-minute
domination<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> fact<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.639> I<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.030> winning

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:24.389 
domination but the fact is I was winning

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:26.569 
domination but the fact is I was winning
my<00:01:24.569> gun<00:01:24.780> fights<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.259> coming<00:01:25.499> through<00:01:25.740> lack

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
my gun fights and coming through lack

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.700 
my gun fights and coming through lack
comp<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.969> still<00:01:27.149> there<00:01:27.329> but<00:01:27.569> I<00:01:27.749> got<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.499> stop

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
comp is still there but I got to stop

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.620 
comp is still there but I got to stop
worrying<00:01:29.100> about<00:01:29.189> lag<00:01:29.639> comp<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.149> much<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.539> just

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
worrying about lag comp so much and just

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.660 
worrying about lag comp so much and just
when<00:01:31.139> what<00:01:31.350> gun<00:01:31.530> fights<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> game<00:01:32.130> allows<00:01:32.429> me

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
when what gun fights the game allows me

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.160 
when what gun fights the game allows me
to<00:01:32.759> win<00:01:32.969> that's<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.389> thing<00:01:33.539> I've<00:01:33.719> got<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.899> do

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
