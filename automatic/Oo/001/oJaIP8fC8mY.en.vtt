specifically<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:03.989> New<00:01:04.470> Jersey<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
specifically for New Jersey and the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.820 
specifically for New Jersey and the
Northeast<00:01:05.670> growers<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.540> concentrated<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.680> our

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
Northeast growers we concentrated in our

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.280 
Northeast growers we concentrated in our
research<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.670> having<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> very<00:01:09.570> best<00:01:09.869> flavor

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
research on having the very best flavor

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.490 
research on having the very best flavor
that<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.159> could<00:01:11.340> develop<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.270> they're<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.720> for

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that we could develop so they're not for

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100 
that we could develop so they're not for
long-distance<00:01:14.159> shipping<00:01:14.850> therefore<00:01:15.479> going

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
long-distance shipping therefore going

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.410 
long-distance shipping therefore going
out<00:01:16.439> picking<00:01:16.860> your<00:01:17.070> own<00:01:17.130> eating<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:17.970> same

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
out picking your own eating in that same

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.570 
out picking your own eating in that same
day<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> next<00:01:19.049> day<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.770> you're<00:01:20.430> gonna

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
day or the next day and you're gonna

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.789 
day or the next day and you're gonna
find<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.570> flavor<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.680> be

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
find that the flavor is just going to be

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.710 
find that the flavor is just going to be
incredible<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.820> fact<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.119> Rutgers<00:01:24.540> is

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
incredible the fact that Rutgers is

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960 
incredible the fact that Rutgers is
focused<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.350> developing<00:01:25.890> varieties<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.790> New

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
focused on developing varieties for New

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.270 
focused on developing varieties for New
Jersey<00:01:27.000> growers<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.590> important<00:01:29.100> in

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
Jersey growers is really important in

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.830 
Jersey growers is really important in
the<00:01:29.579> long<00:01:29.759> run<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> big

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the long run it's going to have a big

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.340 
the long run it's going to have a big
impact<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.189> desire<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.640> buy<00:01:33.000> local<00:01:33.450> and

impact on the desire to buy local and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.810 
impact on the desire to buy local and
that's<00:01:34.470> because<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> consumer<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.670> gonna

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that's because the consumer is gonna

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.550 
that's because the consumer is gonna
realize<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.570> only<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> good<00:01:37.320> value

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
realize that not only is it a good value

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.969 
realize that not only is it a good value
for<00:01:37.770> them<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.310> buy<00:01:38.430> local<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.360> also<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.979> fruit
