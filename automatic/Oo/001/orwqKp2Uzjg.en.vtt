00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.980
 hello everyone welcome and blair and good 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.059
 today there is a new fight in this video 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.270
 I wanted to present you two according to the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.110
 physical for me does not use 21 haul gods 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.550
 fight in a pokémon this generation 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.199
 flying fighter who possesses a skill 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.540
 quite curious of the three that have 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.860
 counting the skill hidden 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.810
 skill is called lightweight this 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.230
 ability makes when we get rid 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.600
 of the object that we carry in combat we 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.969
 doubles the speed by two and most 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.670
 good thing is that the rival does not know 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.789
 like he does not know it very easy with we use 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.289
 that object does not appear on the screen 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.390
 that the pokemon has doubled the 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.339
 speed by two does not appear although what 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.019
 is doing the effect now then 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.399
 when I finish my leader that is less 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.699
 tick to do your job you will see 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.010
 as geo fight goes out and does and does its 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.420
 work and make and use an object and not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 the screen appears as it duplicates the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.100
 speed but exceeded the speed to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.329
 all your rival team pokemon so much 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.489
 of the airplane 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.399
 like the rest you're going to see by the way 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.700
 to a parenthesis I was happy 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.229
 see to see action in combat because it is not 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.640
 a pokémon that only once is always what 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.530
 same is so for me a vote of 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.170
 opinion gives me confidence as 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.330
 go kill me ostick and good here 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.490
 You see wrestle fight as I use attack 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.580
 aerial is an attack that should use it in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.729
 two shifts but thanks to the grass object 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.619
 only I throw it in a turn and I lose the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.869
 object remember guys that to lose at 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.490
 object my speed is doubled by two 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.679
 thanks light ability although not 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.729
 appears on screen vote and declared 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.509
 overcome that attraction because it is 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.399
 paralyzed 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.229
 adra pawn yes obviously because it is 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.240
 paralyzed the first thing I do is used 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.220
 sharpen claws so that if my attack is 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.780
 sum for one and I need for one and 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.299
 can quietly put his second 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.340
 attack that is super high kick without 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.840
 fear that it will fail and hurt me 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.310
 you see me 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.759
 now I kick super high and I do not 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 it failed good I do not think attraction and now 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.450
 you're going to look like the next pokemon that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.950
 be the rival I'm calm because 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.140
 I 'm going to overcome speed thanks to the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.640
 stability is valid then you know what 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.720
 super high leg has a great attack 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.460
 physical 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.740
 is fighting because it 's fight 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.990
 and above I will attack before 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.640
 the rival looks at the look that stings tele 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.320
 I almost got it I do not have it removed 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.030
 still the meno that a little with fire 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.580
 fatuous tried to produce my damage 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.500
 physical half but I do not care no 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.890
 I care that it is one more attack and it is 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.090
 died of good agreement you see what 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.700
 soap fight with life libya not 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.950
 works works very well I get 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.390
 that I like pokemon calmly 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.600
 and now I'm going to talk a little too 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.090
 of the next one that's great 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.620
 first thought the combat more or less 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.870
 how does it work now it will take me out to manex 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.400
 good trick I will speak before being 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.260
 line before it comes out in 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.990
 combat so that you know who are still 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.360
 it is already an evolution of nin every 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.910
 appears when ninjas evolves is 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.710
 say at level 20 or in each evolves 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.040
 ninjas and if you have a hole in the team 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.480
 and a pokemon in the bag appears 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.120
 ezzedin already on your team with the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.850
 same levels and the same ex and icv that 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.610
 never agree 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.950
 ok this pokemon have a skill 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.840
 only one that is super saves no attack 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.880
 It can hurt you except those who 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.120
 weaken him they are ghost bug 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.220
 sinister rock and no fire and no flying 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.010
 I know if I left a good one is already a 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.080
 variety of attacks yes but in this in 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.600
 this generation to signaling an attack 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.730
 very good that the important thing of essence 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.450
 is that they do not hit him then now 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.010
 that good line appears and you'll see it in 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.150
 the tactics I say the first thing that fails 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.100
 I suffocate and that allows me 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.400
 Quietly put a will to fire 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.079
 burn in accordance 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.670
 obviously the object that you have to 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.970
 take that line you're going to see 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.040
 below kg 3 yo when burning it 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.140
 I quietly use protection and I make 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.990
 your burn becomes damaged again 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.940
 according to the rival 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.940
 and so he assured me another problem if another 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.960
 failure of the rival and the attack I get it 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.290
 you are going to see now is new to this 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.900
 generation 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.790
 the rival now hits me and as I have 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.260
 only 1 of life the fire therefore 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.629
 spend my super my super save skill 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.760
 but look, do not look at what object the 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.319
 band focus that makes it possible to go back to 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.320
 do turn and I have used this attack 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.470
 new of that video called hit 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.820
 ghost the rival or I forgive 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.710
 I disappear and immune magician can not 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.870
 give neither earthquake nor comment anything 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.960
 of that in the burn advances to a level 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.280
 more and I gave the fault because they have 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.520
 that fail can not give me anything in 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.240
 that attack and I hit him with this to the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.820
 matrix 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.770
 and ended with him 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.990
 guys, I just introduced you to a swap 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.930
 is that it was totally abandoned that 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.410
 we can work well from year jr 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.660
 burning the rival and above it protects and 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.180
 above has a skill that is hidden 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.790
 and can not hit him is a little watered 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.250
 to draw line yes but as you can see 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.750
 to work guys with this I mean 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.880
 that does not teach with every video that you that 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.670
 I show you I want to show you that you can 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.830
 have another pokemon and try and 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.630
 practice with them and when you have a 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.100
 more or less fixed equipment then it 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.450
 they invented another team we tell you not 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.710
 hard today will approve this pokemon I'm going to 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.720

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.180
 get something out of me look maccabi mentar ajo 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.830
 fight already be said so that you see it for 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.610
 that you see that it is wipers as it is all 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.290
 they can work 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.580
 we do not have to be caught and that in 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.500
 yes thing about those I always say the same 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.090
 but it's really good at least 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.040
 I also flames have seen a lot 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.690
 because it's so good so a flame because 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.760
 they can not gale skill to the rein 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.800
 val etcetera but not because that's why 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.930
 you have to catch it you can catch it if 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.880
 You like it like that but if you do not look I'll make you 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.360
 prove with two pokemon that almost never 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.610
 or practically unused that not 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.040
 they are and that people would abandon them 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.270
 90 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.110
 well I know how to prove that if they go in 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.670
 especially with seville so guys 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.600
 encourage you to try new Pokémon 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.880
 You take it easy to give a vote of confidence 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.110
