00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone here greets you again 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.700
 your friend Lorca and today I am 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.650
 here to show you how to make a 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.830
 islay ntx farm in your world 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.199
 minecraft peron is what is the to 11 and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.009
 yes as loyola had 11 that many have 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.929
 had problems to generate them in order 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.259
 as you can see so they can see that the 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:28.380
 tutorial is 100% legal I will load 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.229
 directly imparted from here the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.480
 fire is in survival mode and 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:37.920
 so they want to play this same seed in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.300
 the 98 728 and I have it in difficulty 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.300
 difficult I will now load the world 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
 we wait 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.030
 today in charge now as you can see 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.489
 we have a slide in front of us 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.079
 I preferred not to kill him so they would see that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.719
 it was 100% true that another data appeared 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.880
 that is that there are two data who knows 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.420
 about the line is that they just 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 appear in a certain area in this 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.880
 case would be the coordinates 336 7 776 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:33.650
 and up to 208 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.650
 and from 320 to 28 to 320 with 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.680
 176 leave and matt stage line to get 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.920
 material that never hurts 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.159
 have them 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.159
 they are never missing these and now to continue 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.939
 order these things 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.290
 already so that I get the materials right 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.950
 and marked pressure finally told them 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.350
 they only appear in certain fixed areas and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.890
 as you can see I'm practically 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.510
 on the blocks of origin for the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.720
 materials that this time is doing 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.610
 the little farm in another data that does not 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.300
 I said is that the leds this line only 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.760
 they appear at night and they do not 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.170
 matter in itself as we illuminate the the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.110
 place only interest them to the location and 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.850
 that we are in the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.130
 now correct for this to come out 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.680
 as you can see this bed is very 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.540
 illuminated and aside there is another one next to 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.280
 it's completely here two earth 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.410
 tall blocks but I will tell you that in 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.650
 this area does not generate any month 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.230
 com line to be able to see is precisely 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.370
 three blocks high our camera 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.230
 to make sure they have mobility 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.780
 this is another farm that they compare see 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.300
 I will tell you right away why I made this and 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.300
 illuminate it with lower blocks 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.680
 originally I was doing I was creating 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:17.019
 my farm in this area as you can see 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.390
 I did not get any this louis louis vuitton 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.989
 at different heights and I do not know why it 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.670
 I generated the grass no longer and if it is tipped 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.159
 because he is so tall and coughs because 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.069
 I started to take out all the materials that 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:34.840
 here they were like for vienna and diamond 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:37.630
 carbon text or flee as you want as 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.530
 want to say 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.600
 I've already started harvard in this area and 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.090
 I discovered this little mine 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.940
 that was the one that gave me the location of 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.480
 the is lines 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.190
 since I was the same 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.830
 checking this area 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.110
 excuse me for leaving suddenly 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.020
 or that he left the fire as retained is 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.560
 that I went to build a small situation 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.560
 in which they spoke to me as I said 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.890
 in this area I found expression 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.170
 I walk the area and I found three slides one 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.350
 it was generated exactly in this area of 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.310
 land that was where I found it 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.720
 the second one generated is generated 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.120
 exactly on this block of land and 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.090
 the third one appeared in this area 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.040
 of the diamond that they will acquire but I arrived 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.500
 just to see the rest as the 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.350
 wash 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.680
 finally based on these areas I started to 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.140
 dig and put that my inspection 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.750
 started with the first slam that what 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.350
 generated here I decided to download as much and 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.960
 comparing appearances of place already 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.160
 after here I went looking and it's against 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.070
 this camera as you can see it is not me 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.660
 generated none is the ignore and is no 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.660
 see each other and we already have one 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.730
 without wanting we have found other lines 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.950
 and this breaks my theory that only 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.750
 appear at night appear at any 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.310
 moment is line in our cameras 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.780
 comparing this if it was generated in the 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.600
 ground area so 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.560
 no matter what size they give their 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.020
 camera, the only thing they should ensure is 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.990
 which must be in a specific area 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.240
 where the line is generated or I chose 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.370
 I myself found this area because it 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.449
 generated me there in the mine you have to leave 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.550
 of being around me 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.710
 but you can see there are times that do not give 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.940
 nothing but it never hurts to have 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.750
 materials 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.800
 in 5 you can see with this tutorial I hope 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.540
 they find their good offices lines 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.510
 Give them an idea pages to their farms 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.970
 of es line just remember the slides 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.360
 they do not care about the type of material with 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.880
 that you believe in the camera we just 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.190
 see that we had a big one just in 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.010
 the land zone and right now in 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.280
 what I went to turn around was generated one 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:19.650
 in the ground zone so with this 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:23.230
 we can say that they do not care 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.530
 that yes the same no matter how they illuminate 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:29.050
 their places can use torches 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.940
 luminous stones or I do not know what or even 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.460
 maybe what is of the lower world 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.980
 work but part problem me 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:40.420
 I would recommend plan for this touches 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:43.870
 in order to avoid that we 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.260
 that prevent them from generating them is nice me 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.900
 That 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.420
 well once done this tutorial I 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.590
 dismissal from all of you so up 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.590
 the next video
