00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.049
 hello you love after it's last 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.570
 cookie recipe was so popular and 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.820
 already over 200 subscribers 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 my channel are available thanks 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.630
 for that I am glad if you have the videos 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.720
 I thought we're doing today 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.700
 again something similar and indeed all 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.180
 cantuccini these are these Italian ones 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.940
 mandl biscuits or almond biscuits 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.210
 they are just like everything 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.339
 here and are super great for 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.219
 give as an example to nikolaus or 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:42.149
 as a small gift for 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.979
 Christmas is really happy for everyone and everyone 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.469
 but also wonderful 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:49.409
 Of course, in the evening with a glass 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.940
 red wine or as dessert I crisp 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.309
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 me if you turn on and if it 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.960
 you liked the conclusion then clicks 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.819
 but I like it and subscribe myself 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.620
 like if you have other videos of me 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.620
 we want to see then we go 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.469
 we need almonds for the nerds 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.360
 among us are still where they with 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.740
 douse hot water but i have 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.939
 It does not have to save me this now 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.990
 Maybe they are a bit pretty 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.220
 but it does not necessarily need it 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.000
 then flour sugar vanilla sugar 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.549
 baking powder two eggs salt a piece 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.110
 butter and bitter almond aroma 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.299
 that gives the whole thing such an easy 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.250
 amaretto note the very exact 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.840
 quantities and the recipe you can find 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.840
 as always in the infobox under the video 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.960
 then put the flour in a bowl 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.710
 to the sugar 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.710
 the manual sugar 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.680
 the baking powder 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.550
 the pinch of salt 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.480
 and stir everything well until it does 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.480
 well mixed 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.590
 then come the two years 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.670
 the mother 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.000
 and half of the bitterman lahore 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.080
 and then you seduce or knead that 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.080
 whole to a right homogeneous 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.100
 to it all the almonds come 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.960
 and are kneaded under that's one 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.319
 Bit difficult because file too busy 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.230
 is 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.720
 but the world a little bit we 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.840
 in addition to that dementia glued and on the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.920
 working surface 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.920
 quite agree 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.590
 if you have finished the dough form 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.879
 a ball winds it in foil and the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.879
 dough for 30 minutes 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.580
 Then he divided the dough into six 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.410
 about easy 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.610
 but could make three big parts 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.610
 made small 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.790
 and then forms it 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.790
 si 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.830
 strict 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.840
 here on a laid out with baking paper 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.840
 sample is lying 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.750
 then come to bake before in the 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:21.459
 preheated oven at 200 degrees above 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.459
 heat for 15 minutes 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.610
 then they go up a bit and 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.470
 go a bit but that is 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.030
 okay and that may look like that 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.249
 if they are baked then leave the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.460
 completely cool 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:40.120
 and then he cuts them because 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.710
 oblique strips as well as yours 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.710
 cantuccini at the end would like 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.610
 and she puts it back with the 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.980
 cut up on one 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.660
 baking tray with baking paper and gives that 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.480
 whole again for about 10 minutes 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.700
 at 200 degrees upper lower heat in the 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.030
 oven 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.030
 That's how they look on the river are very 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.060
 very crispy and have the typical 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.650
 Lack of aroma can be absorbed very well 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.930
 cancel for a longer time because they just 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.050
 pretty dry from home very much 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.490
 crispy and yes I wish you all 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.160
 Have fun while copying and when 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.780
 crisp and on while giving and 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.030
 tell me how it worked 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.860
 I will be very happy if you ask 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.140
 to have comments or suggestions 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.790
 then post under the video 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.820
 otherwise I wish you one 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.260
 continue to be beautiful and before Christmas 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.590
 see you soon 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.590
 See you

 Once here I wanted the butter case and

 The top cake muffins as I am 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.110
