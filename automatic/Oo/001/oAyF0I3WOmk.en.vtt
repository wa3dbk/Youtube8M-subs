00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.740 

but<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.930> ball<00:02:16.640> may<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.879> been<00:02:18.120> sitting<00:02:18.629> on

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750

the dirt

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.640 
the dirt
and<00:02:20.680> everyone<00:02:21.190> picked<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.610> up

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and everyone picked it up

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.559

and<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.010> thing<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.370> allowed<00:02:24.180> them<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
and the thing that allowed them to

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.800 
and the thing that allowed them to
reverse<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.349> call<00:02:25.560> was<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.950> fact<00:02:26.190> that

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
reverse the call was the fact that

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.220 
reverse the call was the fact that
Francisco<00:02:27.810> was<00:02:27.959> across<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.530> back<00:02:28.709> and

Francisco hustled down the line I mean

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.250 
Francisco hustled down the line I mean
he<00:02:32.730> thought<00:02:32.909> he<00:02:33.060> had<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> chance<00:02:33.269> for<00:02:33.690> yeah<00:02:33.959> he

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
hands like it was a bobble and and I

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.920 
hands like it was a bobble and and I
didn't<00:02:41.459> see<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.670> at<00:02:42.000> all<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.150> saw<00:02:42.510> everyone

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
didn't see that at all I saw everyone

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.839 
didn't see that at all I saw everyone
reach<00:02:43.290> out<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.920> ball<00:02:44.129> at<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> ball<00:02:44.489> didn't<00:02:44.730> go

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
reach out the ball at the ball didn't go

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.670 
reach out the ball at the ball didn't go
down<00:02:45.090> into<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> pocket<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.079> was<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
down into the pocket it was in the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.649 
down into the pocket it was in the
webbing<00:02:47.099> but<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.640> think<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> ball<00:02:48.420> was

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
webbing but I think the ball was

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.600 
webbing but I think the ball was
touching<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.200> dirt<00:02:49.620> while<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.069> was<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
touching the dirt while I was in the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.860 
touching the dirt while I was in the
webbing<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.299> how<00:02:51.480> they<00:02:51.659> could

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
webbing and that's how they could

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.220 
webbing and that's how they could
determine<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.500> was<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:53.030> bobble<00:02:54.030> take<00:02:54.930> another

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
determine it was a bobble take another

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.300 
determine it was a bobble take another
