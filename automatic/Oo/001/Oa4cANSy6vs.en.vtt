have a new problem the metal prong on
both<00:00:28.920> sides<00:00:30.199> falls<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.980> short<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.969> opening

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
both sides falls just short the opening

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.750 
both sides falls just short the opening
into<00:00:36.899> which<00:00:37.079> they<00:00:37.350> are<00:00:37.440> supposed<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.950> sit

on<00:00:42.760> both<00:00:43.210> sides<00:00:43.769> so<00:00:45.359> where<00:00:46.359> is<00:00:46.449> it<00:00:46.480> right<00:00:47.260> there

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
on both sides so where is it right there

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.099 
on both sides so where is it right there
instead<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.359> sitting<00:00:49.839> inside<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.769> opening

in such a manner such that it shifts

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.550 
in such a manner such that it shifts
forward<00:01:11.460> by<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.880> half<00:01:13.179> inch<00:01:13.450> or<00:01:13.750> 3/8<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.289> an<00:01:14.440> inch

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
inside their respective slots and I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.749 
inside their respective slots and I
don't<00:01:26.950> know<00:01:27.130> how<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:28.679> don't<00:01:29.679> know<00:01:29.890> what<00:01:30.190> just

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
don't know how to I don't know what just

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.340 
don't know how to I don't know what just
manzara<00:01:31.149> possible<00:01:31.869> or<00:01:33.149> or<00:01:34.149> necessary<00:01:34.899> to<00:01:35.229> do

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
manzara possible or or necessary to do

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:49.260 
manzara possible or or necessary to do
so<00:01:41.009> also<00:01:42.009> just<00:01:42.909> as<00:01:43.090> troubling<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
so also just as troubling is the the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.479 
so also just as troubling is the the
locking<00:01:49.629> mechanism<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:53.140> locking<00:01:53.979> mechanism

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:54.489 
locking mechanism the locking mechanism

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
locking mechanism the locking mechanism
as<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.360> can<00:01:55.509> see<00:01:56.069> it<00:01:57.069> works<00:01:57.550> just<00:01:57.700> fine<00:01:57.970> in

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
as you can see it works just fine in

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:06.630 
as you can see it works just fine in
motion<00:01:59.340> however<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.950> only<00:02:04.920> locks<00:02:05.920> into<00:02:06.280> place

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
motion however it only locks into place

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.100 
motion however it only locks into place
a<00:02:06.879> very<00:02:07.360> short<00:02:07.479> part<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:09.989> bracket<00:02:10.989> right

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
a very short part of this bracket right

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.570 
a very short part of this bracket right
here<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:13.090> locking<00:02:13.780> arm<00:02:14.080> only<00:02:14.680> reaches<00:02:15.310> maybe

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
here the locking arm only reaches maybe

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.930 
here the locking arm only reaches maybe
about<00:02:15.970> 2<00:02:16.330> here<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:18.150> only<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.599> tiny<00:02:20.019> segment

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
about 2 here so only this tiny segment

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.460 
about 2 here so only this tiny segment
of<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.330> entire<00:02:22.810> width<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:24.610> used<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:26.260> lock

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
of this entire width is used to to lock

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.640 
of this entire width is used to to lock
the<00:02:26.650> convertible<00:02:27.190> top<00:02:28.019> in<00:02:29.019> place<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.590> I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
the convertible top in place and I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.399 
the convertible top in place and I
wanted<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.129> know<00:02:30.250> if<00:02:30.400> there's<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.640> way<00:02:30.879> to

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
wanted to know if there's a way to

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:42.660 
wanted to know if there's a way to
adjust<00:02:32.409> these<00:02:33.220> little<00:02:36.300> movable<00:02:39.420> arms<00:02:41.670> such

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
adjust these little movable arms such

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
adjust these little movable arms such
that<00:02:43.000> they<00:02:43.360> fit<00:02:43.989> more<00:02:44.709> deeply<00:02:45.489> into<00:02:45.760> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
that they fit more deeply into the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.959 
that they fit more deeply into the
little<00:02:47.470> wedge<00:02:47.769> right<00:02:48.219> there<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.639> the<00:02:48.760> center

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:48.969 
little wedge right there in the center

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.190 
little wedge right there in the center
of<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.959> screen

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.880 

in<00:02:52.860> order<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:55.490> ensure<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.940> greater<00:02:57.840> locking<00:02:58.500> of

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
in order to ensure a greater locking of

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.979 
in order to ensure a greater locking of
the<00:02:59.600> convertible<00:03:00.600> top<00:03:04.730> here<00:03:05.730> are<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.300> older

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
the convertible top here are the older

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.710 
the convertible top here are the older
original<00:03:08.750> latches<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:11.060> as<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.180> can<00:03:12.300> see<00:03:12.480> they

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
original latches and as you can see they

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.920 
original latches and as you can see they
are<00:03:12.750> quite<00:03:14.959> quite<00:03:15.959> used<00:03:16.410> quite<00:03:16.830> beat<00:03:17.190> up<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:20.930> lot

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
are quite quite used quite beat up a lot

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.100 
are quite quite used quite beat up a lot
of<00:03:22.080> chips<00:03:22.380> taken<00:03:22.800> out<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:22.950> him<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.580> there

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
of chips taken out of him here and there

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.979 
of chips taken out of him here and there
and<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.820> one<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.209> driver's<00:03:27.660> side<00:03:29.959> had<00:03:30.959> a

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
and the one on the driver's side had a

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:38.090 
and the one on the driver's side had a
broken<00:03:31.590> off<00:03:34.519> stub<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:36.530> was<00:03:37.530> supposed<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.010> be

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
broken off stub that was supposed to be

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.120 
broken off stub that was supposed to be
on<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.370> side<00:03:39.830> it's<00:03:40.830> now<00:03:41.040> completely<00:03:41.459> gone

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
on this side it's now completely gone

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.290 
on this side it's now completely gone
so<00:03:44.130> I'm<00:03:44.310> guessing<00:03:44.670> these<00:03:44.790> ones<00:03:45.030> were<00:03:45.150> the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
so I'm guessing these ones were the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.160 
so I'm guessing these ones were the
original<00:03:45.750> ones

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
original ones

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.340 
original ones
they<00:03:46.830> were<00:03:47.030> definitely<00:03:48.030> overdue<00:03:48.810> for<00:03:49.110> being

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
they were definitely overdue for being

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.990 
they were definitely overdue for being
replaced<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.010> now<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.310> got<00:03:50.489> him<00:03:50.610> replaced

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
replaced and now that I got him replaced

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.520 
replaced and now that I got him replaced
I<00:03:51.410> can't<00:03:52.410> get<00:03:52.650> my<00:03:52.800> convertible<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.810> can't<00:03:55.440> get

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530
