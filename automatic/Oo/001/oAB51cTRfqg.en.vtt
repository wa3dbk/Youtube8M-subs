my<00:00:32.910> second<00:00:33.390> life<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.380> think<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.829> goes

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
my second life which I think just goes

my second life which I think just goes
to<00:00:35.160> show<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.550> how<00:00:35.910> powerful<00:00:36.239> rejects<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559

killed you well this kind of shows that
that's<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> case<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.960> makes<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.410> really

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that's not the case it makes it really

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.189 
that's not the case it makes it really
easy<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> high<00:01:00.539> streaks<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.170> my

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
easy to get the high streaks in my

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.349 
easy to get the high streaks in my
opinion<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.829> least<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.250> me<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.640> makes<00:01:03.149> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
opinion at least for me it makes it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.509 
opinion at least for me it makes it
super<00:01:03.840> easy<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.409> high<00:01:04.559> streaks<00:01:04.920> because<00:01:05.309> I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
super easy to get high streaks because I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520 
super easy to get high streaks because I
can<00:01:05.790> die<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> couple<00:01:06.479> times<00:01:06.720> within<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.200> streak

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
can die a couple times within a streak

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.789 
can die a couple times within a streak
and<00:01:07.740> still<00:01:08.460> earn<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> mothership<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:10.260> gets

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and still earn a mothership and it gets

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
and still earn a mothership and it gets
you<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> lot<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:11.369> kills<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> should<00:01:12.570> be

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you a lot more kills or it should be

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.929 
you a lot more kills or it should be
getting<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.020> lot<00:01:13.229> more<00:01:13.409> kills<00:01:13.710> than<00:01:13.939> four

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
getting you a lot more kills than four

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.820 
getting you a lot more kills than four
kills<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.689> would<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.960> from<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
kills that you would get from from a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.230 
kills that you would get from from a
tempest<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.430> something<00:01:17.700> along<00:01:17.790> those<00:01:18.090> lines

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
tempest or something along those lines

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
tempest or something along those lines
so<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.290> kind<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.500> wanted<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> point<00:01:20.009> out

and<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.450> thoughts<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.020> yeah<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.070> had<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and my thoughts on it yeah if I had to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.080 
and my thoughts on it yeah if I had to
describe<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.030> word<00:01:36.829> disappointing

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
describe it in one word disappointing

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.770 
describe it in one word disappointing
this<00:01:39.090> score<00:01:39.420> streak<00:01:39.920> does<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.220> live<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.790> do

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
this score streak does not live up to do

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.359 
this score streak does not live up to do
the<00:01:42.899> score<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.500> takes<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> earn<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the score that it takes to earn it it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.310 
the score that it takes to earn it it
doesn't<00:01:44.579> live<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> hype<00:01:45.540> which<00:01:45.990> I'm

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
doesn't live up to the hype which I'm

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.370 
doesn't live up to the hype which I'm
very<00:01:46.380> very<00:01:47.340> disappointed<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:48.210> when<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.140> earn

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
very very disappointed in when you earn

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
very very disappointed in when you earn
the<00:01:49.710> highest<00:01:49.890> streak<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> game<00:01:50.729> like

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the highest streak in the game like

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.160 
the highest streak in the game like
right<00:01:51.210> now<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.600> considered<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> highest

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
right now it's considered the highest

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.300 
right now it's considered the highest
wreak<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> game<00:01:52.770> there's<00:01:52.979> one<00:01:53.159> more

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
wreak in the game there's one more

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.830 
wreak in the game there's one more
streak<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:53.700> don't<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.060> about<00:01:54.180> which<00:01:54.540> may<00:01:54.810> or

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
streak we don't know about which may or

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.569 
streak we don't know about which may or
may<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.229> higher<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
may not be higher I think it is going to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.639 
may not be higher I think it is going to
be<00:01:56.670> higher<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.030> I'm<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.329> too<00:01:57.540> sure<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
be higher but I'm not too sure when you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.649 
be higher but I'm not too sure when you
earn<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.829> highest<00:01:59.130> streak<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> game<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
earn the highest streak in the game the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.899 
earn the highest streak in the game the
enemy<00:02:00.990> team<00:02:01.170> should<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.740> oh<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.430> god<00:02:02.700> this

is<00:02:03.210> scary<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:04.829> should<00:02:05.040> be<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.340> yes<00:02:05.729> it's

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
is scary and you should be like yes it's

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.850 
is scary and you should be like yes it's
time<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.570> lots<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.960> kills<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.680> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
time to get lots of kills like this is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.070 
time to get lots of kills like this is
awesome<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.569> that's<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> case

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
awesome and that's just not the case

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.350 
awesome and that's just not the case
with<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> mothership<00:02:10.979> with<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> mothership

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
with the mothership with the mothership

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.520 
with the mothership with the mothership
at<00:02:12.540> least<00:02:12.810> based

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
at least based

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.020 
at least based
my<00:02:13.680> experience<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.310> I've<00:02:14.400> heard<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.670> few<00:02:14.700> of

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
my experience and I've heard a few of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.490 
my experience and I've heard a few of
them<00:02:15.150> now<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.630> not<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.080> one<00:02:16.319> I'm

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
them now so it's not just the one I'm

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.680 
them now so it's not just the one I'm
basing<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:16.980> off<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.610> did<00:02:18.120> her<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.390> few<00:02:18.600> of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
basing this off of I did her in a few of

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.980 
basing this off of I did her in a few of
them<00:02:18.810> before<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> beta<00:02:19.770> ended<00:02:20.100> for<00:02:20.280> ps4<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.090> I

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
them before the beta ended for ps4 and I

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.680 
them before the beta ended for ps4 and I
think<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.740> most<00:02:22.980> kills<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.730> personally<00:02:24.240> got

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
think the most kills I personally got

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.670 
think the most kills I personally got
with<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.050> was<00:02:25.230> three<00:02:25.700> maybe<00:02:26.700> four<00:02:27.350> yeah<00:02:28.350> that

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
with it was three maybe four yeah that

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.320 
with it was three maybe four yeah that
that's<00:02:28.920> that's<00:02:29.370> all<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.610> got<00:02:29.910> with<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.209> i<00:02:30.270> think

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that's that's all I got with it i think

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.080 
that's that's all I got with it i think
i<00:02:30.600> could<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:30.900> got<00:02:31.050> more<00:02:31.350> kills<00:02:31.800> with<00:02:32.610> my<00:02:32.819> gun

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
i could have got more kills with my gun

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.360 
i could have got more kills with my gun
on<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.810> ground<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:34.739> i<00:02:34.890> got<00:02:35.069> with<00:02:35.250> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
on the ground then i got with the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.370 
on the ground then i got with the
mothership<00:02:35.819> now<00:02:36.420> my<00:02:36.630> teammates<00:02:37.080> they<00:02:37.319> were

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380

getting more kills in me which is

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.360 
getting more kills in me which is
another<00:02:39.780> big<00:02:40.080> frustration<00:02:40.380> i<00:02:40.860> have<00:02:41.069> with<00:02:41.340> the

another big frustration i have with the
mothership<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.200> might<00:02:43.200> sound<00:02:43.410> selfish<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.040> I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
mothership it might sound selfish but I

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.910 
mothership it might sound selfish but I
worked<00:02:45.480> really<00:02:45.630> hard<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.140> earn<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.320> or<00:02:46.650> I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
worked really hard to earn that or I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.949 
worked really hard to earn that or I
work<00:02:47.370> relatively<00:02:47.760> hard<00:02:48.120> even<00:02:48.480> though<00:02:48.750> i<00:02:48.780> had

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
work relatively hard even though i had

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.600 
work relatively hard even though i had
reject<00:02:49.410> which<00:02:49.590> makes<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.010> whole<00:02:50.250> lot<00:02:50.310> easier

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
reject which makes it a whole lot easier

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.290 
reject which makes it a whole lot easier
but<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.690> earned<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.170> streak<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:53.120> have<00:02:54.120> no

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300

directly<00:03:01.470> taking<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.190> kills<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.640> I'm

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
directly taking the kills that I'm

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.600 
directly taking the kills that I'm
trying<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.269> get<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.830> very<00:03:04.830> frustrating<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.489> me

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
trying to get is very frustrating to me

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.520 
trying to get is very frustrating to me
like<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:06.000> said<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.300> might<00:03:06.420> seem<00:03:06.660> selfish<00:03:07.170> but

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
like I said it might seem selfish but

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.350 
like I said it might seem selfish but
I'm<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.040> one<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:08.280> earned<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.819> that's

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
I'm the one that earned it and that's

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.970 
I'm the one that earned it and that's
really<00:03:09.450> what<00:03:09.900> going<00:03:10.200> for<00:03:10.380> high<00:03:10.500> streets<00:03:10.860> is

when you're going for the high oh streak
in<00:03:17.310> your<00:03:17.370> game<00:03:17.549> it's<00:03:17.579> basically<00:03:18.120> about

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
in your game it's basically about

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.390 
in your game it's basically about
showing<00:03:19.200> your<00:03:19.230> dominance<00:03:19.890> over<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.190> other

showing your dominance over the other
team<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.940> when<00:03:21.810> your<00:03:21.959> teammates<00:03:22.320> are<00:03:22.500> taking

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
team and when your teammates are taking

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.590 
team and when your teammates are taking
all<00:03:22.980> your<00:03:23.250> kills<00:03:23.519> from<00:03:23.730> your<00:03:23.970> most<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.480> your

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
all your kills from your most of your

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.840 
all your kills from your most of your
kills<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:25.829> get<00:03:25.980> really<00:03:26.130> frustrating

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
kills that can get really frustrating

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.630 
kills that can get really frustrating
and<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:28.200> big<00:03:28.590> reason<00:03:28.799> they<00:03:29.070> were<00:03:29.160> taking<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.519> lot

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
and a big reason they were taking a lot

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.300 
and a big reason they were taking a lot
of<00:03:29.760> my<00:03:29.850> kills<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.750> hit<00:03:30.989> detection<00:03:31.140> is<00:03:31.739> just

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
of my kills is the hit detection is just

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.850 
of my kills is the hit detection is just
awful<00:03:32.970> with<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.290> now<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.500> something

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
awful with this now this is something

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.289 
awful with this now this is something
that's<00:03:34.920> probably<00:03:35.310> really<00:03:35.640> connection

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
that's probably really connection

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.060 
that's probably really connection
dependent<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.350> don't<00:03:37.650> want<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.860> say<00:03:38.040> like

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
dependent so I don't want to say like

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.880 
dependent so I don't want to say like
it's<00:03:38.670> always<00:03:38.910> awful<00:03:39.390> but<00:03:40.019> at<00:03:40.200> least<00:03:40.530> for<00:03:40.769> me

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
it's always awful but at least for me

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.680 
it's always awful but at least for me
every<00:03:41.370> mothership<00:03:41.790> I've<00:03:41.910> earned<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:42.299> far<00:03:42.329> I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
every mothership I've earned so far I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.630 
every mothership I've earned so far I
can<00:03:42.750> be<00:03:42.989> shooting<00:03:43.320> directly<00:03:43.799> at<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> guy<00:03:44.459> and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
can be shooting directly at a guy and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.000

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
and then I just watch my teammates as

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.390 
and then I just watch my teammates as
they<00:03:49.140> just<00:03:49.380> wreck<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.859> people<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.310> I'm

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
single hit marker on when this happens

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.509 
single hit marker on when this happens
also<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.079> don't<00:03:55.380> even<00:03:55.530> get<00:03:55.709> any<00:03:55.980> credit<00:03:56.340> for

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
the kills that your teammates are

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.360 
the kills that your teammates are
getting<00:03:58.140> which<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.440> another<00:03:58.829> little

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
getting which is another little

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.849 
getting which is another little
annoyance<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.239> have<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.109> overall<00:04:01.470> I<00:04:01.769> would

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
annoyance that I have so overall I would

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.680 
annoyance that I have so overall I would
like<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.430> see<00:04:02.579> them<00:04:02.730> either<00:04:02.850> ship<00:04:03.120> changed<00:04:03.540> in

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
like to see them either ship changed in

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.920 
like to see them either ship changed in
some<00:04:03.989> ways<00:04:04.230> first<00:04:05.160> off<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.640> don't<00:04:06.269> really<00:04:06.720> mind

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
some ways first off I don't really mind

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.860 
some ways first off I don't really mind
too<00:04:07.290> much<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.739> teammates<00:04:08.100> can<00:04:08.250> join<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.870> feel

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
too much the teammates can join I feel

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.050 
too much the teammates can join I feel
like<00:04:10.140> I<00:04:10.350> should<00:04:10.650> at<00:04:10.739> least<00:04:10.859> get<00:04:11.070> some<00:04:11.340> score<00:04:11.850> if

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
like I should at least get some score if

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.120 
like I should at least get some score if
teammates<00:04:12.630> are<00:04:12.780> earning<00:04:13.079> kills<00:04:13.350> I<00:04:13.650> think

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
teammates are earning kills I think

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.610 
teammates are earning kills I think
that's<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.400> fair<00:04:14.670> balance<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:15.359> should<00:04:16.260> earn<00:04:16.380> some

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
that's a fair balance I should earn some

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.620 
that's a fair balance I should earn some
score<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:16.890> should<00:04:17.220> get<00:04:17.310> some<00:04:17.669> credit<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:18.180> some

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
score I should get some credit in some

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.360 
score I should get some credit in some
way<00:04:18.900> for<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.320> kills<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.680> my<00:04:19.799> teammates<00:04:20.220> are

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
way for the kills that my teammates are

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.250 
way for the kills that my teammates are
getting<00:04:20.609> from<00:04:20.940> my<00:04:21.269> kill<00:04:21.630> streak<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.080> I

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
getting from my kill streak that I

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.980 
getting from my kill streak that I
earned<00:04:23.090> also<00:04:24.090> one<00:04:24.450> thing<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.780> would<00:04:24.900> like

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
mind seeing them have a little bit of an

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.230 
mind seeing them have a little bit of an
area<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.350> effect<00:04:34.620> damage<00:04:34.920> so<00:04:35.520> explosive

area of effect damage so explosive
rounds<00:04:36.780> basically<00:04:37.260> kind<00:04:37.470> of<00:04:37.620> like<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
rounds basically kind of like the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.770 
rounds basically kind of like the
chopper<00:04:38.160> gunner<00:04:38.310> from<00:04:38.520> auto<00:04:38.670> warfare<00:04:39.060> two<00:04:39.270> but

chopper gunner from auto warfare two but
nowhere<00:04:40.320> near<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:40.830> powerful<00:04:41.370> so<00:04:41.520> don't

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
nowhere near that powerful so don't

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.980 
nowhere near that powerful so don't
worry<00:04:41.820> I'm<00:04:42.000> not<00:04:42.150> suggesting<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:42.780> thing

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
worry I'm not suggesting this thing

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.230 
worry I'm not suggesting this thing
should<00:04:43.200> just<00:04:43.440> be<00:04:43.620> a<00:04:43.830> complete<00:04:44.550> spawn<00:04:44.910> kill

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
should just be a complete spawn kill

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.270 
should just be a complete spawn kill
fest<00:04:45.630> where<00:04:45.930> you<00:04:45.960> have<00:04:46.200> absolutely<00:04:46.410> no<00:04:47.040> chance

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
fest where you have absolutely no chance

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.790 
fest where you have absolutely no chance
of<00:04:47.460> escaping<00:04:47.820> it<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.240> just<00:04:49.170> think<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.530> person

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
of escaping it I just think the person

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.530 
of escaping it I just think the person
that's<00:04:50.040> actually<00:04:50.490> earning<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.210> streak

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
that's actually earning the streak

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.840 
that's actually earning the streak
should<00:04:52.260> have<00:04:52.440> more<00:04:52.770> powerful<00:04:53.370> bullets<00:04:53.700> than

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
should have more powerful bullets than

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.190 
should have more powerful bullets than
the<00:04:53.970> other<00:04:54.150> guys<00:04:54.330> like<00:04:54.540> leave<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.050> other

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
the other guys like leave the other

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.010 
the other guys like leave the other
turrets<00:04:55.590> just<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.190> way<00:04:56.310> they<00:04:56.490> are<00:04:56.520> so<00:04:57.020> yes

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
turrets just the way they are so yes

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.870 
turrets just the way they are so yes
they<00:04:58.200> can<00:04:58.260> pick<00:04:58.470> up<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.740> odd<00:04:58.860> kill<00:04:59.190> but<00:04:59.760> the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
they can pick up the odd kill but the

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.430 
they can pick up the odd kill but the
guy<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.210> actually<00:05:00.390> earned<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.170> is

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
guy that actually earned it and is

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.410 
guy that actually earned it and is
controlling<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.310> he<00:05:02.940> should<00:05:03.180> be<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.390> one

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
controlling it he should be the one

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.600 
controlling it he should be the one
earning<00:05:03.840> almost<00:05:04.200> all<00:05:04.590> of<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.010> kills<00:05:05.250> with<00:05:05.460> it

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
earning almost all of the kills with it

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.940 
earning almost all of the kills with it
sure<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.450> do<00:05:06.570> have<00:05:06.720> your<00:05:06.840> rockets<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.620> they

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
sure you do have your rockets and they

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.460 
sure you do have your rockets and they
sometimes<00:05:08.250> get<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.700> killer<00:05:09.000> too<00:05:09.300> but<00:05:10.200> it's

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
sometimes get a killer too but it's

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.830 
sometimes get a killer too but it's
really<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.010> bullet<00:05:11.520> part<00:05:11.790> and<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.600> lack<00:05:12.810> of

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
really the bullet part and the lack of

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.360 
really the bullet part and the lack of
the<00:05:13.110> hit<00:05:13.320> detection<00:05:13.470> that's<00:05:14.070> really

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
the hit detection that's really

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.830 
the hit detection that's really
frustrating<00:05:14.610> so<00:05:15.090> if<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.240> have<00:05:15.390> that<00:05:15.510> the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
frustrating so if you have that the

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.440 
frustrating so if you have that the
explosive<00:05:16.410> rounds<00:05:16.800> I<00:05:16.980> think<00:05:17.790> that<00:05:17.910> would<00:05:18.060> be<00:05:18.240> a

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
explosive rounds I think that would be a

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.950 
explosive rounds I think that would be a
whole<00:05:18.870> lot<00:05:19.640> more<00:05:20.640> rewarding<00:05:21.300> for<00:05:21.540> the<00:05:21.630> person

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
whole lot more rewarding for the person

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.390 
whole lot more rewarding for the person
that<00:05:21.990> actually<00:05:22.200> earned<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.890> street<00:05:23.160> give

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
that actually earned the street give

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.580 
that actually earned the street give
them<00:05:23.669> explosive<00:05:24.210> rounds<00:05:24.570> so<00:05:25.110> they<00:05:25.260> get<00:05:25.380> better

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
them explosive rounds so they get better

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.320 
them explosive rounds so they get better
hit<00:05:25.890> detection<00:05:26.040> and<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:26.640> better<00:05:26.850> chance<00:05:27.150> of

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
hit detection and a better chance of

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.720 
hit detection and a better chance of
earning<00:05:27.540> more<00:05:27.870> kills<00:05:28.260> so<00:05:29.190> I<00:05:29.220> like<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.640> know

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
earning more kills so I like to know

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.830 
earning more kills so I like to know
