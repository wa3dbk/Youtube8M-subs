00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
pooh-poohing it there wasn't the people

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.929 
pooh-poohing it there wasn't the people
weren't<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:16.920> excited<00:01:17.430> about<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.909> all

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
weren't so excited about it they all

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.670

wanted to work on all the animators

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.460 
wanted to work on all the animators
wanted<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> work<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.250> Pocahontas<00:01:21.470> apparently

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
wanted to work on Pocahontas apparently

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.120 
wanted to work on Pocahontas apparently
and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.670> eventually<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.659> movie<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and then and eventually this movie you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.800 
and then and eventually this movie you
know<00:01:26.250> became<00:01:27.380> very<00:01:28.380> interesting<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.640> think

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
know became very interesting and I think

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.149 
know became very interesting and I think
mr.<00:01:30.810> Katzenberg<00:01:31.290> had<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> lot<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
mr. Katzenberg had a lot to do with that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.800 
mr. Katzenberg had a lot to do with that
and<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:33.030> think<00:01:33.270> he<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.689> who

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and and I think he was the one who

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
and and I think he was the one who
really<00:01:34.110> would<00:01:34.380> kept<00:01:34.680> saying<00:01:34.950> you've<00:01:35.549> got<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
really would kept saying you've got to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.330 
really would kept saying you've got to
put<00:01:36.030> more<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.270> these<00:01:36.479> two<00:01:36.890> characters<00:01:37.890> into<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
put more of these two characters into it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.920 
put more of these two characters into it
it's<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:38.790> heavy<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> little

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it's a little heavy it's a little

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.710 
it's a little heavy it's a little
serious<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.680> remember<00:01:41.070> when<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.600> went<00:01:42.600> with

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
serious and I remember when we went with
