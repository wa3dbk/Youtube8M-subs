friend died a few times i died a few
times<00:01:28.710> doing<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> take<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
times doing this so it's going to take a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.480

killing that much right there alright
let's<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.299> ahead<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.680> get<00:01:40.680> through<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
let's go ahead and get through here so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.100 
let's go ahead and get through here so
your<00:01:41.939> ultimate<00:01:42.210> goal<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.840> get

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
your ultimate goal with this is to get

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
your ultimate goal with this is to get
through<00:01:43.350> keep<00:01:43.680> slip<00:01:43.890> depth<00:01:44.130> level<00:01:44.310> 2<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.820> then

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
through keep slip depth level 2 and then

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.460 
through keep slip depth level 2 and then
we're<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.600> move<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> area<00:01:46.200> crater

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
we're going to move on to area crater

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.630 
we're going to move on to area crater
after<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:49.490> all<00:01:50.490> right

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
after that all right

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.200 
after that all right
and<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:54.170> way<00:01:54.320> we<00:01:54.470> do<00:01:54.620> this<00:01:54.650> if<00:01:55.040> we<00:01:55.070> if<00:01:55.580> we<00:01:55.640> are

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
and the way we do this if we if we are

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.850 
and the way we do this if we if we are
running<00:01:56.450> through<00:01:56.810> here<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.260> we<00:01:57.530> happen<00:01:57.830> to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
running through here and we happen to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.440 
running through here and we happen to
run<00:01:57.950> into<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.310> dead<00:01:58.640> end<00:01:58.700> where<00:01:59.120> we're<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.390> to

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
run into a dead end where we're going to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.690 
run into a dead end where we're going to
have<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.659> backtrack<00:01:59.930> a<00:02:00.440> pretty<00:02:00.830> long<00:02:01.100> ways<00:02:01.400> to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
have to backtrack a pretty long ways to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.960 
have to backtrack a pretty long ways to
get<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.200> new<00:02:03.200> areas<00:02:03.440> in<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.220> cube<00:02:04.460> steps<00:02:04.729> that

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
get to new areas in the cube steps that

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.910 
get to new areas in the cube steps that
has<00:02:05.150> more<00:02:05.420> mobs<00:02:05.690> we<00:02:06.170> decided<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.560> go<00:02:06.650> ahead<00:02:06.710> and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
has more mobs we decided to go ahead and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.620 
has more mobs we decided to go ahead and
just<00:02:07.010> leave<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.670> work<00:02:07.820> back<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.060> town<00:02:08.300> at<00:02:08.450> that

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
just leave to work back to town at that

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.600 
just leave to work back to town at that
point<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.080> then<00:02:09.289> go<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.860> area<00:02:10.160> crater<00:02:10.459> it's

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
point and then go to area crater it's

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.660 
point and then go to area crater it's
not<00:02:10.759> worth<00:02:11.060> running<00:02:11.540> all<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.170> way<00:02:12.200> back

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
not worth running all the way back

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.699 
not worth running all the way back
backtracking<00:02:13.670> with<00:02:14.000> no<00:02:14.180> killing<00:02:14.600> just<00:02:15.440> for<00:02:15.680> a

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
backtracking with no killing just for a

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.460 
backtracking with no killing just for a
few<00:02:16.070> extra<00:02:16.370> mobs<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.080> know<00:02:18.200> just

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
few extra mobs but you know just

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.560 
few extra mobs but you know just
something<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.950> keep<00:02:19.070> in<00:02:19.190> mind<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.300> more

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
something to keep in mind the the more

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.600 
something to keep in mind the the more
you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:20.930> stay<00:02:21.320> killing<00:02:21.920> at<00:02:22.040> all<00:02:22.130> times<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
you can stay killing at all times the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.060 
you can stay killing at all times the
better<00:02:22.880> even<00:02:23.300> if<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.510> means<00:02:23.890> missing<00:02:24.890> out<00:02:25.010> a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
better even if it means missing out a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.510 
better even if it means missing out a
little<00:02:25.310> bit<00:02:25.520> on<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.910> run<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.980> still<00:02:28.280> will<00:02:28.400> be

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
little bit on on a run it still will be

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.000 
little bit on on a run it still will be
faster<00:02:29.350> there<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.410> go<00:02:30.500> my<00:02:30.650> friend<00:02:30.680> just

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
of this video is sped up two times and

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.770 
of this video is sped up two times and
we're<00:02:41.060> actually<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.480> go<00:02:41.540> ahead<00:02:41.600> and

we're actually going to go ahead and
skip<00:02:41.989> ahead<00:02:42.140> here<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.650> minute<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.040> end

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
skip ahead here in a minute to the end

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.600 
skip ahead here in a minute to the end
of<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.550> run<00:02:43.870> because<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:46.160> takes<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.519> couple

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
of this run because it takes a couple

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.070 
of this run because it takes a couple
minutes<00:02:46.790> per<00:02:47.150> run<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.810> guys<00:02:47.930> don't

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
minutes per run and you guys don't

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.509 
minutes per run and you guys don't
really<00:02:48.260> need<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.500> see<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.739> all<00:02:48.830> I<00:02:49.070> will<00:02:49.370> show

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
really need to see it all I will show

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.860 
really need to see it all I will show
you<00:02:49.610> what<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.850> end<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.209> level<00:02:50.420> looks<00:02:50.600> like

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
you what the end of the level looks like

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.330 
you what the end of the level looks like
so<00:02:51.050> if<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.680> then<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.980> can<00:02:52.130> know<00:02:52.280> to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
so if you get to it then you can know to

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.930 
so if you get to it then you can know to
go<00:02:53.120> ahead<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.530> teleport<00:02:54.530> out<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:55.519> looks<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
go ahead and teleport out it looks the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.199 
go ahead and teleport out it looks the
same<00:02:56.120> every<00:02:56.510> time<00:02:57.549> I'm<00:02:58.549> going<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.760> skip<00:02:59.030> there

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
same every time I'm going to skip there

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.509 
same every time I'm going to skip there
right<00:02:59.390> now<00:02:59.540> actually<00:03:00.100> alright<00:03:01.100> so<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.370> is

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
right now actually alright so this is

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.620 
right now actually alright so this is
what<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.760> end<00:03:01.910> looks<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.209> when<00:03:02.329> you<00:03:02.420> get<00:03:02.540> to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
what the end looks like when you get to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.759 
what the end looks like when you get to
something<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.049> looks<00:03:03.200> like<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.320> going<00:03:03.650> to

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
something that looks like this going to

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.280 
something that looks like this going to
start<00:03:03.920> teleporting<00:03:04.130> out<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.810> then<00:03:05.810> go<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.079> the

friends look at the experience that we

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.819 
friends look at the experience that we
get<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.380> here<00:03:37.570> it's<00:03:38.570> just<00:03:38.750> climbing<00:03:39.560> by<00:03:39.769> the

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
get in here it's just climbing by the

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.880 
get in here it's just climbing by the
thousands<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:40.930> it's<00:03:41.930> really<00:03:42.140> fast<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.739> mean

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
thousands so it's really fast I mean

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
thousands so it's really fast I mean
look<00:03:43.040> at<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.220> we're<00:03:43.340> already<00:03:43.519> at<00:03:43.670> another

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
look at that we're already at another

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.370 
look at that we're already at another
half<00:03:44.090> level<00:03:44.450> two<00:03:44.600> so<00:03:44.930> it's<00:03:45.620> crazy

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
half level two so it's crazy

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.900 
half level two so it's crazy
of<00:03:48.380> course<00:03:48.710> there<00:03:48.890> were<00:03:48.980> some<00:03:49.160> extra<00:03:49.430> bastions

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
of course there were some extra bastions

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.250 
of course there were some extra bastions
keep<00:03:50.120> in<00:03:50.300> there<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.720> guys<00:03:50.870> didn't<00:03:51.200> get

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
keep in there that you guys didn't get

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.710 
keep in there that you guys didn't get
to<00:03:51.410> see<00:03:51.590> but<00:03:51.860> not<00:03:52.520> not<00:03:52.880> very<00:03:53.090> much<00:03:53.240> really<00:03:53.540> we

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
to see but not not very much really we

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.970 
to see but not not very much really we
were<00:03:53.810> almost<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.260> end<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.590> when<00:03:54.710> I<00:03:54.740> cut

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
were almost to the end of it when I cut

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.830 
were almost to the end of it when I cut
away<00:03:55.190> at<00:03:55.520> to<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.820> end<00:03:58.180> these<00:03:59.180> runs<00:03:59.420> take<00:03:59.660> us

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
away at to the end these runs take us

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.480 
away at to the end these runs take us
anywhere<00:04:00.350> from<00:04:00.620> seven<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.070> ten<00:04:01.220> minutes

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
anywhere from seven to ten minutes

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.850 
anywhere from seven to ten minutes
depending<00:04:01.850> how<00:04:01.940> big<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.240> zone<00:04:02.420> is<00:04:02.630> the

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
depending how big the zone is the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.200 
depending how big the zone is the
specific<00:04:03.860> areas<00:04:04.400> sometimes<00:04:04.790> they're<00:04:04.970> really

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
specific areas sometimes they're really

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.600 
specific areas sometimes they're really
big<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:05.720> takes<00:04:06.410> longer<00:04:06.770> to<00:04:06.860> clear<00:04:06.980> sometimes

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
big and takes longer to clear sometimes

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.200 
big and takes longer to clear sometimes
they're<00:04:07.790> smaller<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.240> really<00:04:08.780> quick<00:04:10.120> like<00:04:11.120> I

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
they're smaller and really quick like I

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.700 
they're smaller and really quick like I
said<00:04:11.270> though<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.780> averages<00:04:12.080> out<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.260> about<00:04:12.410> six

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
said though it averages out to about six

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.140 
said though it averages out to about six
or<00:04:12.800> seven<00:04:12.950> million<00:04:13.250> experience<00:04:13.820> per<00:04:13.970> hour

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
or seven million experience per hour

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.660 
or seven million experience per hour
which<00:04:14.540> from<00:04:15.170> 50<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.470> 60<00:04:15.860> that's<00:04:16.040> really<00:04:16.400> quick

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
which from 50 to 60 that's really quick

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.930 
which from 50 to 60 that's really quick
you<00:04:16.850> can<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.450> can<00:04:17.630> get<00:04:17.810> 50<00:04:18.170> to<00:04:18.290> 60<00:04:18.680> in<00:04:18.940> about

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
you can you can get 50 to 60 in about

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.090 
you can you can get 50 to 60 in about
two<00:04:20.209> hours<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.660> would<00:04:20.810> say<00:04:20.959> maybe<00:04:20.989> three<00:04:21.859> if

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
two hours I would say maybe three if

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.770 
two hours I would say maybe three if
you're<00:04:22.250> not<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.520> fastest<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.120> that's<00:04:23.660> not

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
you're not the fastest and that's not

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.420 
you're not the fastest and that's not
hopefully<00:04:24.200> you<00:04:24.560> guys<00:04:24.680> find<00:04:24.980> some<00:04:25.130> use<00:04:25.250> out<00:04:25.370> of
