00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 good family welcome back to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.250
 channel that you are good like me today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.740
 I bring a makeup tutorial that I know 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.780
 that you like a lot and in this case in 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.920
 this video wanted to highlight two things one 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.320
 I was looking forward to using the pigment 86 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.230
 of English or I do not even know how to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 you because well I hope that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.170
 be in the video you see the light that has 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.730
 the color so impressive that it has and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.359
 I love it so I was wishing 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.519
 doing it is a look with him and 12 that 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.759
 I wanted to make a skin that was quite 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.010
 and bright pretty worked with 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.460
 liquid and powder illuminator and mix 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.460
 a little 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.149
 let's also say of products that to me 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.520
 They go very well for when I need a 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.930
 extra juiciness in which I would like 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 that you will leave comments to me here 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.510
 below that you think of the look if 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 you have the pepper in question and that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.809
 I roll up that I leave you with the step to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.640
 step if you want to see it I 'm going to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.590
 begin by applying a pre-base 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.620
 face in this case is matifying is of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.539
 strawberry but it has me in love this 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.970
 cream because the time is moisturizing but 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.350
 he controls me very well 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.900
 of the brightness and also that holds the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.690
 base many hours without us 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.460
 appear I'm going to start by applying a 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.740
 eye primer in this case is the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.510
 insurance of to face forgiving my voice 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.170
 but I have a tremendous allergy 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.780
 What makes me look like I 'm like that 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.430
 that nothing continuous I will apply in the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.200
 eye socket as you see that shadow is 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.110
 a tad more rise than my skin tone 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.380
 just to mark a little bit my 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.720
 eye socket and facilitate much more the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.720
 blurred at the time of applying shadows 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.859
 then I'm going to take that shadow 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.320
 chocolate color has a reddish dot 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:50.600
 and as you can see with a brush to blur 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.100
 but finished in pen tip I'm going to 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.649
 mark me what is the external ub as 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.210
 You see I'm closing it and especially the 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.460
 Most of the shadow the buoy deposit 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.560
 abroad trying to leave the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.560
 minimal part inside the eye 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.400
 here in the video is not seen but returned to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.790
 use the same color skin umbrella 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.860
 from before and with a clean brush I'll 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.010
 use it to blur cut can 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.600
 that everything is much cleaner and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.840
 simply below with a 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.290
 shadow and call me I'm going to light up the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.290
 eyebrow arch 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.220
 I'm going to move on to what's left of the rest of the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.410
 mobile eyelid like I'm going to use a 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.780
 jumbo cream this is garnet 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.390
 This also kills you but it's not going to 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.860
 come very well for how to test separate 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.110
 the pigment to apply and then 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.540
 so he has them a little bit with a 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.390
 synthetic brush as you see 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.189
 and I'm going to apply the pigment in 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.989
 question is the number Inglott 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:06.560
 86 maybe we could use a prebase 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:09.260
 with glue because this pigment is a 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.879
 a little bit thicker than usual 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.900
 throw a little bit of gitterer and maybe it's 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.939
 a little more expensive than to stick to 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.489
 eyelid but good in this case to have 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.689
 the cream base was holding me pretty 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.099
 well I did not have problems so 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.689
 we just fill in what's left of the 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.689
 Eyelid mobile and ready 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.450
 to blur a little and in case it has 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.160
 lost the color of the shadow I'm going to 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.530
 reuse the same broach in 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.520
 tip of pen and I'm going to mark a little bit 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.280
 for that, review the shadow a little bit and 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.700
 of step blur the pigment to 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.200
 condition of using a be clear of 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.720
 it's because it 's kind of like 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.730
 shadow powder but as in a format 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.700
 of sponge and it's great to do 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.500
 tuxedo and delineated smoked as you see 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.050
 and I'm going to apply it to flush lashes 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.270
 both below and above what I am going to 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.320
 to do is that with a finite brush 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.150
 small I will blur both lines that 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.860
 I've done to learn a little 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.989
 intensity and that stays well 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.250
 blurred but yes that is not marked very 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.780
 well the look down I'm going to do 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.400
 exactly the same so that you miss 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.910
 a little bit of the line and it's not so 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.910
 checked 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.800
 in the video you can not see but as you can see 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.650
 applied in the water line black pencil or 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 any pencil that you have filled the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.410
 lower line and apply mask 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.900
 well abundant lashes let's move on 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.730
 with my face in this case I decided to 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.980
 a pretty and luminous juicy skin like that 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.080
 that he used as evidence and a 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.270
 illuminator in liquid in this case is the 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.640
 copacabana de nash and as you see I apply it 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.050
 in the upper areas of the face as in 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.900
 this case is the cheekbones 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.150
 and I'm going to correct my dark circles and 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.830
 spots of redness and others with the 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.750
 furniture in the beach and I'm going to apply it 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.289
 with this well-covered broach that 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.250
 I like it a lot but as always I finish 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.500
 heating with the fingertips the 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.629
 product and blurring it well because I 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.289
 like and it stays a lot more natural to 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.289
 my way of seeing 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.950
 we review fins of the nose that usually 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.320
 there are many reds in that area the 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.940
 writing of the lips in order where 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.500
 have more problem as you see I am going to 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.140
 apply the base of face and body of mac 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.770
 for the same reason I want a skin 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.930
 juicy and bright and this base gives me everything 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.600
 what I want so he applied it with 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.750
 a kabu kabu kabu key type brush 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.900
 sorry my mother this today and as you see 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.630
 Well, nothing, I'm going to seal the area 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.890
 of the concealer and I apply powder 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.930
 also in the center of the face that is 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.470
 where more fat I usually get out with 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.470
 step of the hours 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.229
 let's outline the face in my case 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.419
 used the nash gaps you know 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.449
 under the bone of the cheekbone I also 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.720
 I do a little bit of contouring 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.720
 temple 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.289
 I'll go with the blusher in this case 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.930
 I continue with a lot the university is the 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.669
 refinement of milan and that you already know that gives 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.740
 a super healthy look to the chairs 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:35.460
 and with an incredible light that has me 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.080
 also crazy but how is it 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.240
 a very luminous skin because I'm going to play 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.039
 with the illuminator also so vicens 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.080
 action to the new liberator of ethnicity that 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.389
 is that it is a real wonder because 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.729
 it seems that the light of your own comes out 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.370
 face is so finite before use that if 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:54.080
 you have the opportunity to see him go through 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.080
 by ethnicity because it's a pass 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.000
 I'm going to finish the look with a lipstick on 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:03.790
 this case one of my favorites that is the 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.500
 302 of the rich color of l'oréal is a 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.230
 roasted pink has a little dot 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.120
 brownish that to my way of seeing remains 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.670
 perfect with any look is super 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.920
 versatile and it suits all 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.900
 skins whatever your tone is 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.240
 very beautiful and as you see then very agreeable 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.440
 to the look so nothing girls this is the 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.350
 result as you see a very skin 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.390
 luminous very juicy very healthy as a 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.520
 I like it very much according to the pigment 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.620
 that as you can see is a shine 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.720
 that has and nothing that if you liked me 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.220
 you say comments down here that you 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.690
 I hope in the next video you want 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.040
 hand up and see you in 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.040
 the next video chao
