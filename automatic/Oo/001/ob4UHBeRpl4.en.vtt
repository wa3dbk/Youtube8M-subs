into the engine compartment you want to
make<00:01:15.600> sure<00:01:15.630> sometimes<00:01:16.440> they<00:01:16.530> could<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.770> very

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
make sure sometimes they could be very

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.940 
make sure sometimes they could be very
difficult<00:01:17.190> to<00:01:17.520> retrieve<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.060> some<00:01:18.240> areas

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
we're gonna disconnect our air intake

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.980 
we're gonna disconnect our air intake
and<00:01:25.220> remove<00:01:26.220> our<00:01:26.340> air<00:01:26.490> cleaner<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> set<00:01:27.900> it

and remove our air cleaner and set it

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.500 
and remove our air cleaner and set it
aside<00:01:28.430> we're<00:01:29.430> gonna<00:01:29.550> replace<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> EGR

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
aside we're gonna replace in the EGR

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.990 
aside we're gonna replace in the EGR
valve<00:01:30.870> which<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.620> located<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.550> next<00:01:32.730> to<00:01:32.880> our

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
valve which is located right next to our

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600 
valve which is located right next to our
throttle<00:01:33.600> body<00:01:33.950> we're<00:01:34.950> gonna<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.220> removing

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
throttle body we're gonna be removing

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.850 
throttle body we're gonna be removing
the<00:01:36.420> electrical<00:01:36.840> connections<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.650> here

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the electrical connections here and here

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.460 
the electrical connections here and here
so<00:01:38.160> we<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.430> gain<00:01:38.580> access<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.120> our<00:01:39.300> bolts<00:01:39.780> we're

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
so we can gain access to our bolts we're

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.650 
so we can gain access to our bolts we're
gonna<00:01:40.620> remove<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.790> vacuum<00:01:42.060> line<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
gonna remove in this vacuum line and

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.650 
gonna remove in this vacuum line and
this<00:01:43.020> vacuum<00:01:43.290> line<00:01:43.700> these<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.940> become<00:01:45.240> very

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
this vacuum line these can become very

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.090 
this vacuum line these can become very
brittle<00:01:46.170> through<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.440> year<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.890> want<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
brittle through the year so you want to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
brittle through the year so you want to
be<00:01:47.160> really<00:01:47.640> careful<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.660> of<00:01:48.690> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
be really careful and that's one of the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.470 
be really careful and that's one of the
reasons<00:01:49.170> why<00:01:49.320> we're<00:01:49.590> removing<00:01:50.250> these<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.210> when

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
reasons why we're removing these so when

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.510 
reasons why we're removing these so when
we're<00:01:51.630> taking<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.080> valve<00:01:52.350> off<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.890> wrench

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
we're taking this valve off a wrench

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
we're taking this valve off a wrench
hits<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.150> we<00:01:54.240> don't<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.630> crack<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:55.050> or

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
hits it and we don't want to crack it or

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.710 
hits it and we don't want to crack it or
break<00:01:55.440> it<00:01:55.730> so<00:01:56.730> let's<00:01:56.910> take<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.600> off

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
break it so let's take this one off

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.640 
break it so let's take this one off
first<00:01:59.630> we're<00:02:00.630> gonna<00:02:00.750> set<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.080> aside<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.560> we

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
first we're gonna set that aside so we

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.100 
first we're gonna set that aside so we
don't<00:02:01.800> lose<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.570> we're<00:02:03.570> gonna<00:02:03.660> take<00:02:03.900> this

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
don't lose it we're gonna take this

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.870 
don't lose it we're gonna take this
connection<00:02:04.590> off<00:02:04.710> right<00:02:04.920> here<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.400> vacuum

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
connection off right here this vacuum

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.440

line

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.910 

and<00:02:10.450> then<00:02:10.869> we're<00:02:10.959> gonna<00:02:11.050> take<00:02:11.290> our<00:02:11.349> electrical

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and then we're gonna take our electrical

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.300 
and then we're gonna take our electrical
connections<00:02:12.400> off<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:14.440> real<00:02:14.680> careful<00:02:14.920> not<00:02:15.099> to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
connections off be real careful not to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.030

it's a good idea to take off the lid and

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:35.290 
it's a good idea to take off the lid and
check<00:06:31.899> the<00:06:32.899> position<00:06:33.999> there's<00:06:34.999> a<00:06:35.089> little

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
check the position there's a little
