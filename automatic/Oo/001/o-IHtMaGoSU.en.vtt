00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
hey guys it's Sam and today we are doing

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.340 
hey guys it's Sam and today we are doing
a<00:00:19.140> comparison<00:00:19.650> video<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:20.190> the<00:00:21.050> Superfly<00:00:22.050> pause

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
a comparison video on the Superfly pause

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.380 
a comparison video on the Superfly pause
and<00:00:22.860> the<00:00:23.700> Superfly<00:00:24.270> cr7<00:00:25.490> there's<00:00:26.490> not<00:00:26.790> massive

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and the Superfly cr7 there's not massive

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.769 
and the Superfly cr7 there's not massive
difference<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.080> these<00:00:28.440> two<00:00:28.650> boots<00:00:28.860> but<00:00:29.550> um

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
difference in these two boots but um

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.480 
difference in these two boots but um
there<00:00:30.779> are<00:00:30.930> some<00:00:31.170> differences<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.860> course<00:00:32.220> the

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 
there are some differences of course the

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.160 
there are some differences of course the
CR<00:00:32.730> sevens<00:00:33.120> do<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> glamour<00:00:33.810> gets<00:00:34.080> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
CR sevens do have the glamour gets a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.720 
CR sevens do have the glamour gets a
glamor<00:00:34.890> glitter<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:36.390> upper<00:00:37.610> but<00:00:38.610> they

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
glamor glitter on the upper but they

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.180 
glamor glitter on the upper but they
both<00:00:38.970> are<00:00:39.560> normally<00:00:40.560> supervised<00:00:40.920> um<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> one

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
both are normally supervised um the one

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.950 
both are normally supervised um the one
big<00:00:44.550> difference<00:00:44.790> between<00:00:45.030> these<00:00:45.450> two<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
big difference between these two is the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.750 
big difference between these two is the
size<00:00:46.790> size<00:00:47.790> difference<00:00:49.220> but<00:00:50.220> everything<00:00:50.610> else

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
size size difference but everything else

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.780 
size size difference but everything else
is<00:00:50.880> very<00:00:51.060> similar<00:00:51.890> these<00:00:52.890> super<00:00:53.190> flies<00:00:53.400> are

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
is very similar these super flies are

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.260 
is very similar these super flies are
the<00:00:54.300> atomic<00:00:54.720> orange<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.560> white<00:00:56.510> Holloway

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
the atomic orange and white Holloway

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.580 
the atomic orange and white Holloway
this<00:01:00.270> calm<00:01:00.720> fibrous<00:01:01.080> top<00:01:01.230> layer<00:01:01.380> is<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
this calm fibrous top layer is the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.210 
this calm fibrous top layer is the
normal<00:01:01.970> carbon<00:01:02.970> fiber<00:01:03.270> color<00:01:03.540> but<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> cr7

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
normal carbon fiber color but on the cr7

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.020 
normal carbon fiber color but on the cr7
it's<00:01:05.489> blue<00:01:06.830> which<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> big<00:01:08.189> difference<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it's blue which is a big difference the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.560 
it's blue which is a big difference the
carbon<00:01:09.420> fiber<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.409> still<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:12.330> same

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
carbon fiber is actually still the same

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.350 
carbon fiber is actually still the same
color<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.009> got<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> blue<00:01:14.610> filter

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
color as this but it's got a blue filter

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.730 
color as this but it's got a blue filter
filter<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> plastic<00:01:16.920> filter<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> top

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
filter like a plastic filter on the top

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.639 
filter like a plastic filter on the top
another<00:01:19.850> difference<00:01:20.850> which<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.439> don't<00:01:22.439> really

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
another difference which I don't really

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.520 
another difference which I don't really
know<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.039> it's<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.520> every<00:01:23.789> super<00:01:24.149> fly<00:01:24.359> my<00:01:25.229> super

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
know if it's on every super fly my super

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.859 
know if it's on every super fly my super
flies<00:01:25.850> like<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:27.030> skin<00:01:27.179> is<00:01:27.329> a<00:01:27.359> lot<00:01:27.539> kind<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
flies like your skin is a lot kind of

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.550 
flies like your skin is a lot kind of
more<00:01:28.020> rubbery<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.319> sevens<00:01:31.319> it's<00:01:31.499> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
more rubbery but with the sevens it's a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.830 
more rubbery but with the sevens it's a
lot<00:01:31.740> more<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.219> of<00:01:33.920> sandpaper<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
lot more kind of sandpaper like it's a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.120 
lot more kind of sandpaper like it's a
lot<00:01:36.990> rougher<00:01:37.439> than<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.280> UM<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:40.130> normal

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
lot rougher than the UM on the normal

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.340 
lot rougher than the UM on the normal
slippers<00:01:41.369> right<00:01:41.450> also<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> normal<00:01:43.140> super

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
slippers right also on the normal super

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.160 
slippers right also on the normal super
fly<00:01:43.499> there<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.859> lot<00:01:44.039> more<00:01:44.869> areas<00:01:45.869> where<00:01:45.899> you

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
fly there are a lot more areas where you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.379 
fly there are a lot more areas where you
can<00:01:46.319> see<00:01:46.560> where<00:01:46.859> it's<00:01:47.009> been<00:01:47.100> knitted<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.270> on

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
can see where it's been knitted but on

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.660 
can see where it's been knitted but on
their<00:01:48.569> cr7<00:01:49.109> maybe<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:49.859> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.069> color<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
their cr7 maybe because of the color and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.059 
their cr7 maybe because of the color and
the<00:01:51.299> glamour<00:01:51.569> get<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:51.929> on<00:01:52.079> top<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.770> can't

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
the glamour get up on top you can't

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:58.940 
the glamour get up on top you can't
really<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.609> that<00:01:53.789> it's<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.060> knitted<00:01:54.420> boot<00:01:57.950> some

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
really see that it's a knitted boot some

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.800 
really see that it's a knitted boot some
other<00:01:59.130> differences<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.789> its<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.539> got

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
other differences is its it's got

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.940 
other differences is its it's got
different<00:02:02.060> lacing<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.299> guess<00:02:03.770> with<00:02:04.770> these

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
different lacing I guess with these

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.880 
different lacing I guess with these
because<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.459> the<00:02:05.549> size<00:02:05.729> difference<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
because of the size difference the the

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.140 
because of the size difference the the
dynamic<00:02:10.890> fit<00:02:11.069> collar<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.490> lot<00:02:11.700> taller<00:02:11.970> than

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
dynamic fit collar is a lot taller than

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.870 
dynamic fit collar is a lot taller than
on<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> other<00:02:12.660> supers<00:02:13.020> right<00:02:13.640> but<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.760> also

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
on the other supers right but it's also

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.820 
on the other supers right but it's also
a<00:02:15.000> lot<00:02:15.180> bigger<00:02:17.150> cycle<00:02:18.150> wise<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.380> way<00:02:22.530> there's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
a lot bigger cycle wise in a way there's

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.399 
a lot bigger cycle wise in a way there's
barely<00:02:23.580> any<00:02:23.909> difference<00:02:24.299> between<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.810> normal

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
barely any difference between the normal

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.170 
barely any difference between the normal
Superfly<00:02:25.860> cr7

Superfly cr7
shooting<00:02:28.180> passing<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.110> very<00:02:29.590> very<00:02:29.890> similar

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
shooting passing it's very very similar

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.589 
shooting passing it's very very similar
the<00:02:30.400> glamour<00:02:30.610> glitter<00:02:30.910> doesn't<00:02:31.180> add<00:02:31.390> any

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
the glamour glitter doesn't add any

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.520 
the glamour glitter doesn't add any
performance<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:34.390> doesn't<00:02:34.599> add<00:02:34.750> performance

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530

on<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> boat<00:02:36.099> it<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.940> makes<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.300> look

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
on to the boat it just it makes it look

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.330 
on to the boat it just it makes it look
kind<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.230> shinier<00:02:38.890> in<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:39.940> way<00:02:42.480> again<00:02:43.480> they're

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
kind of shinier in a way again they're

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.640 
kind of shinier in a way again they're
basically<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.519> same<00:02:45.549> boot<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:46.599> there<00:02:47.500> are<00:02:47.620> a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
basically the same boot but there are a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.190 
basically the same boot but there are a
few<00:02:47.709> minor<00:02:48.160> differences<00:02:48.879> in<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:53.080> know

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
few minor differences in the you know
