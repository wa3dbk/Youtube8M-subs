of hits hit registrations so let's say I
take<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> off<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.439> tried<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.920> shoot

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
somebody across the map I placed my

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.359 
somebody across the map I placed my
crosshairs<00:00:31.199> right<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.679> them<00:00:31.890> while<00:00:32.009> standing

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
crosshairs right on them while standing

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670 
crosshairs right on them while standing
still<00:00:32.430> fired<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> shot<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.559> no

response and that person is still
perfectly<00:00:37.649> alright<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.670> been

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
perfectly alright and then I get been

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.060 
perfectly alright and then I get been
shot<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.120> from<00:00:39.270> around<00:00:39.390> around<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> corner<00:00:40.590> um

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
shot in from around around the corner um

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.750 
shot in from around around the corner um
and<00:00:41.960> this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.230> server-side<00:00:43.710> issue<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.489> even

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and this is a server-side issue so even

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.479 
and this is a server-side issue so even
if<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.030> blood<00:00:45.510> after<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.469> shot

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
if you see blood after your shot

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.010 
if you see blood after your shot
that's<00:00:48.059> client-side<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.530> in

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
that's client-side so it's really in

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.889 
that's client-side so it's really in
tick<00:00:52.020> rate<00:00:52.289> itself<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.449> there<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.629> two<00:00:54.870> kinds

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
tick rate itself is there are two kinds

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.270 
tick rate itself is there are two kinds
of<00:00:55.230> servers<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> competitive

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
do my hands with my hands if so I'm just

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.010 
do my hands with my hands if so I'm just
gonna<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:05.880> gonna<00:01:06.060> improvise<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.900> right

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
gonna I'm just gonna improvise all right

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.679 
gonna I'm just gonna improvise all right
the<00:01:07.439> server's<00:01:07.830> themselves<00:01:07.920> are<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> 64<00:01:09.420> tick

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the server's themselves are a 64 tick

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.880 
the server's themselves are a 64 tick
which<00:01:10.470> means<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:13.020> server<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> updating

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
which means that the server is updating

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
which means that the server is updating
so<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.430> sending<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> client<00:01:15.420> 64<00:01:15.990> times

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
so I'm sending it to the client 64 times

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.010 
so I'm sending it to the client 64 times
a<00:01:16.380> second<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> pros<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.640 
pros plan if you watch streams is on
what<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.950> pros<00:01:23.159> 128<00:01:23.909> tick<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.500> that<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
what are the pros 128 tick and that is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.050 
what are the pros 128 tick and that is
significantly<00:01:26.250> better<00:01:26.460> because<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
significantly better because the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.609 
significantly better because the
server's<00:01:27.390> actually<00:01:27.720> updating<00:01:28.170> itself<00:01:28.380> two

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
server's actually updating itself two

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.100 
server's actually updating itself two
times<00:01:28.650> faster<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.909> will<00:01:30.090> give<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
times faster which will give you a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.429 
times faster which will give you a
greater<00:01:31.560> amount<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> registration<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.439> it'll

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
greater amount of registration so it'll

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.350 
greater amount of registration so it'll
pretty<00:01:34.619> much<00:01:34.710> saw<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.070> repel<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> thing

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
pretty much saw it repel but the thing

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.140 
pretty much saw it repel but the thing
is<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:37.710> let<00:01:38.430> me<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.549> check<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.939> off<00:01:38.970> my

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
is is all let me just check it off my

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.260 
is is all let me just check it off my
less<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.590> thing<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:42.150> are

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
less here the thing is is that there are

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
less here the thing is is that there are
not<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.420> lot<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.630> options<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.290> 128<00:01:43.920> take

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
not a lot of options for 128 take

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.639 
not a lot of options for 128 take
servers<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.939> oh<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:46.110> pretty<00:01:46.290> much<00:01:46.470> he<00:01:46.590> really

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.100 
and but the holy problem that I had with

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
it is that um it doesn't have a ranks so

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.539 
it is that um it doesn't have a ranks so
I<00:02:36.170> mean<00:02:36.379> you<00:02:36.590> don't<00:02:36.739> really<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.129> just<00:02:37.250> kind<00:02:37.489> of

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349

of<00:02:39.530> your<00:02:39.709> skill<00:02:40.040> level<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:41.260> after<00:02:42.260> reading

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
of your skill level but I after reading

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.530 
of your skill level but I after reading
their<00:02:42.620> Twitter<00:02:42.920> page<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:44.019> or<00:02:45.019> their<00:02:45.170> Twitter

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
their Twitter page and or their Twitter

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.020 
their Twitter page and or their Twitter
let's<00:02:47.540> call<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> page<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:48.500> Twitter<00:02:48.769> page<00:02:49.040> they

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
let's call a page the Twitter page they

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.030 
let's call a page the Twitter page they
didn't<00:02:50.599> really<00:02:50.840> have<00:02:51.230> any<00:02:51.590> sort<00:02:51.980> of

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
didn't really have any sort of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.160 
didn't really have any sort of
competitive<00:02:52.579> thing<00:02:53.000> but<00:02:53.659> it<00:02:53.810> seemed<00:02:54.079> like

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
competitive thing but it seemed like

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.809 
competitive thing but it seemed like
they<00:02:54.409> were<00:02:54.470> going<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.980> come<00:02:55.190> out<00:02:55.340> with<00:02:55.519> one<00:02:55.790> and

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
they were going to come out with one and

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.280 
they were going to come out with one and
that's<00:02:56.090> what<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.269> think<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.629> might<00:02:56.780> be<00:02:56.840> big

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
that's what I think this might be big

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.520 
that's what I think this might be big
premium<00:02:57.889> required<00:02:58.430> but<00:02:59.030> I'm<00:02:59.290> obviously<00:03:00.290> you

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
premium required but I'm obviously you

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.369 
premium required but I'm obviously you
can<00:03:00.709> go<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.099> page<00:03:01.519> right<00:03:01.790> here<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.379> where

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
can go to the page right here and where

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.759 
can go to the page right here and where
does<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.709> say<00:03:03.889> they're<00:03:04.400> not<00:03:04.519> offering<00:03:05.060> premium

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
does it say they're not offering premium

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.500 
does it say they're not offering premium
yet<00:03:06.769> it's<00:03:07.129> sort<00:03:07.909> of<00:03:08.000> they're<00:03:08.150> sort<00:03:08.450> of

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
yet it's sort of they're sort of

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.030 
yet it's sort of they're sort of
developing<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.319> think<00:03:09.560> these<00:03:09.650> are<00:03:09.709> codes

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
developing and I think these are codes

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.470 
developing and I think these are codes
given<00:03:10.250> out<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.489> like<00:03:10.730> streamers<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.299> stuff

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
given out to like streamers and stuff

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.869 
given out to like streamers and stuff
not<00:03:11.989> really<00:03:12.170> sure<00:03:12.319> about<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:12.889> yeah<00:03:13.099> so

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
not really sure about that but yeah so

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.000 
not really sure about that but yeah so
um<00:03:14.209> that's<00:03:15.139> pretty<00:03:15.379> much<00:03:15.470> it

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
um that's pretty much it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.170 
um that's pretty much it
Oh<00:03:16.329> what<00:03:17.329> have<00:03:17.449> I<00:03:17.540> personally<00:03:18.109> noticed<00:03:18.290> with

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
Oh what have I personally noticed with

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.979 
Oh what have I personally noticed with
plug<00:03:20.290> 128<00:03:21.290> versus<00:03:21.769> 64<00:03:22.370> tick<00:03:22.579> I<00:03:23.299> noticed<00:03:23.870> that

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
plug 128 versus 64 tick I noticed that

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.099 
plug 128 versus 64 tick I noticed that
my<00:03:24.169> sprays<00:03:24.620> show<00:03:25.250> up<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.489> lot<00:03:25.639> more<00:03:25.849> my<00:03:26.060> my<00:03:26.720> spray

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
my sprays show up a lot more my my spray

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.009 
my sprays show up a lot more my my spray
patterns<00:03:27.560> are<00:03:28.340> pretty<00:03:29.120> much<00:03:29.269> spot-on<00:03:29.599> now

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
patterns are pretty much spot-on now

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.559 
patterns are pretty much spot-on now
everything<00:03:30.709> is<00:03:30.829> good<00:03:31.069> about<00:03:31.849> in<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.389> aspect

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
everything is good about in that aspect

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
it seems like I'm hitting a lot more of

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.000 
it seems like I'm hitting a lot more of
my<00:03:37.310> shots<00:03:37.579> now<00:03:37.879> so<00:03:38.569> yet<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:39.049> definitely<00:03:39.739> can

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
my shots now so yet I definitely can

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.830 
my shots now so yet I definitely can
tell<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.370> difference<00:03:40.489> especially<00:03:41.120> like<00:03:41.690> you

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
tell a difference especially like you

tell a difference especially like you
can<00:03:42.019> already<00:03:43.010> mention<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:43.609> I'm<00:03:43.760> just

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.789 
can already mention this but I'm just
gonna<00:03:44.030> elaborate<00:03:44.840> I'm<00:03:45.049> having<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:45.440> repeat

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
gonna elaborate I'm having to repeat

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.009 
gonna elaborate I'm having to repeat
myself<00:03:45.949> which<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.549> try<00:03:46.819> not<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.150> do<00:03:47.269> what<00:03:47.510> the

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
myself which I try not to do what the

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.949 
myself which I try not to do what the
spray<00:03:48.379> patterns<00:03:48.829> are<00:03:49.099> actually<00:03:49.730> other<00:03:50.480> than

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
spray patterns are actually other than

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.360 
spray patterns are actually other than
the<00:03:51.109> spray<00:03:51.349> pattern<00:03:51.530> themselves<00:03:51.829> but<00:03:52.220> when

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
the spray pattern themselves but when

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.339 
the spray pattern themselves but when
you<00:03:52.519> spray<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:53.120> lot<00:03:53.569> more<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.900> shot<00:03:54.139> will

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
you spray a lot more the shot will
