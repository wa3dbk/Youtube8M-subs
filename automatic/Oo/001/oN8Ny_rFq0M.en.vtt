00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
be like so apparently this is infinite

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
massive in black ops 2 so infinity would

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.309 
massive in black ops 2 so infinity would
want<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.209> play<00:02:21.360> around<00:02:21.480> with<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.959> they<00:02:22.170> want

through the rounds you finish the game
by<00:04:12.239> reaching<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.840> exfil<00:04:13.349> chop<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.829> now<00:04:13.889> the

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
by reaching the exfil chop and now the

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.530 
by reaching the exfil chop and now the
interesting<00:04:14.370> thing<00:04:14.639> is<00:04:14.819> here<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
interesting thing is here on the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.689 
interesting thing is here on the
achievement<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.289> says<00:04:16.500> reach<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.250> exfil

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
achievement it says reach the exfil

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.360 
achievement it says reach the exfil
chopper<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.630> time<00:04:18.930> over<00:04:19.530> 1<00:04:19.769> minute<00:04:19.979> 30

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
chopper and a time over 1 minute 30

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.940 
chopper and a time over 1 minute 30
seconds<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.090> that's<00:04:21.750> extremely<00:04:22.409> quick<00:04:22.800> to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
seconds so that's extremely quick to

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.589 
seconds so that's extremely quick to
actually<00:04:23.219> reach<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.580> apps<00:04:23.729> for<00:04:23.909> reach<00:04:24.270> the

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
actually reach the apps for reach the

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.080 
actually reach the apps for reach the
exfil<00:04:24.990> chopper<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.620> time<00:04:26.070> over<00:04:26.370> 1<00:04:26.550> minute

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
exfil chopper and the time over 1 minute

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.520 
exfil chopper and the time over 1 minute
seconds<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:27.630> means<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.990> could<00:04:28.110> complete

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
seconds that means you could complete

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.680 
seconds that means you could complete
this<00:04:28.620> game<00:04:28.710> mode<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.310> under<00:04:29.970> two<00:04:30.150> minutes<00:04:30.389> or

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
this game mode and under two minutes or

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.000 
this game mode and under two minutes or
something<00:04:30.810> like<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.290> think<00:04:31.350> that's<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.830> bit

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
something like that I think that's a bit

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.920 
something like that I think that's a bit
stupid<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.880> pathetic<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.360> know<00:04:33.389> normally

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
stupid and pathetic you know normally

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.780 
stupid and pathetic you know normally
achievements<00:04:34.470> or<00:04:34.620> Easter<00:04:35.310> Egg<00:04:35.400> sure<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.639> say

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.610 
achievements or Easter Egg sure to say
in<00:04:35.940> zombies<00:04:36.330> takes<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.840> few<00:04:37.050> hours<00:04:37.110> at<00:04:37.590> least

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
in zombies takes a few hours at least

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.680 
in zombies takes a few hours at least
but<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.400> actually<00:04:38.490> complete<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:39.060> in<00:04:39.120> under<00:04:39.180> two

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
but to actually complete it in under two

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.300 
but to actually complete it in under two
minutes<00:04:39.720> would<00:04:40.290> kind<00:04:40.620> of<00:04:40.650> be<00:04:40.800> like<00:04:40.949> kind<00:04:41.250> of

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
minutes would kind of be like kind of

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.280 
minutes would kind of be like kind of
crazy<00:04:41.610> or<00:04:41.820> something<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:42.389> I<00:04:42.570> think<00:04:43.050> that's<00:04:43.169> a

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
crazy or something so I think that's a

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.350 
crazy or something so I think that's a
bit<00:04:43.410> strange<00:04:43.710> but<00:04:43.979> it<00:04:44.400> will<00:04:44.639> have<00:04:44.820> traps<00:04:45.180> for

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
bit strange but it will have traps for

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.700 
bit strange but it will have traps for
the<00:04:45.419> aliens<00:04:45.810> so<00:04:45.990> it's<00:04:46.139> going<00:04:46.229> to<00:04:46.290> have<00:04:46.350> fire

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
the aliens so it's going to have fire

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.379 
the aliens so it's going to have fire
traps<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.340> other<00:04:47.460> traps<00:04:47.820> like<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.210> which<00:04:48.360> is

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
traps and other traps like that which is

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.439 
traps and other traps like that which is
awesome<00:04:48.690> like<00:04:49.050> zombies<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.970> ammo<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.210> gear

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
awesome like zombies and ammo and gear

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.629 
awesome like zombies and ammo and gear
will<00:04:51.990> be<00:04:52.169> just<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:53.010> zombies<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:53.550> I'm

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
will be just like zombies so I'm

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.159 
will be just like zombies so I'm
guessing<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:54.150> buy<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.360> guns<00:04:54.660> off<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.900> walls

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
guessing you buy the guns off the walls

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.719 
guessing you buy the guns off the walls
like<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.650> zombies<00:04:55.979> and<00:04:56.160> just<00:04:56.310> refill<00:04:56.580> your

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.820 
like and zombies and just refill your
ammo<00:04:57.000> by<00:04:57.419> purchasing<00:04:58.050> that<00:04:58.199> gun<00:04:58.410> off<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.560> wall

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
ammo by purchasing that gun off the wall

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.620 
ammo by purchasing that gun off the wall
again<00:04:58.979> maybe<00:04:59.639> you<00:04:59.760> can<00:04:59.880> find<00:05:00.120> them<00:05:00.300> on<00:05:00.479> the
