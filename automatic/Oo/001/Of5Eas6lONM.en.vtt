00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
pages are turning as you see so it works

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.640 
pages are turning as you see so it works
all<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.090> time<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:25.140> just<00:00:25.310> swipe<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:27.500> there<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
all the time you just swipe and there it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.810 
all the time you just swipe and there it
is<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.199> see<00:00:31.470> there's<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.399> different

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
is as you can see there's a different

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.030 
is as you can see there's a different
little<00:00:33.270> bit<00:00:33.390> time<00:00:33.899> difference<00:00:34.200> between<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
little bit time difference between the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.229 
little bit time difference between the
swipe<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:37.110> new<00:00:37.290> page<00:00:37.620> maybe<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:38.969> too

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
swipe and the new page maybe you are too

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.600 
swipe and the new page maybe you are too
impatient<00:00:39.890> maybe<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.070> should<00:00:41.100> give<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
impatient maybe you should give it a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.840 
impatient maybe you should give it a
little<00:00:41.790> more<00:00:42.000> time<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:43.460> basically<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.730> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
little more time but basically it is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.840 
little more time but basically it is
working<00:00:45.149> extremely<00:00:46.020> easy<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.950> extremely

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
working extremely easy and extremely

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.080 
working extremely easy and extremely
accurate<00:00:49.100> maybe<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> easier<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.059> if

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
accurate maybe it is easier for you if

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.790 
accurate maybe it is easier for you if
you<00:00:51.390> start<00:00:51.660> from<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.620> your

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
going you know the movement starts

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
going you know the movement starts
