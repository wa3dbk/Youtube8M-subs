00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.770
 hello friends today we are going to make a 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.190
 escalivada is very simple you need 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.850
 about 3 big peppers one 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.340
 eggplant and 2 onions the tray of 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.960
 oven as you can see is lined 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.930
 completely of aluminum foil like this 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.030
 it will not cost us anything to vary we put the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.690
 tray in the oven in the lower part 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.690
 of this 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:41.500
 at a temperature of about 210 degrees 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.420
 and it will be like that for an hour between 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.750
 we will try to give a room 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.420
 back to all the vegetables and now 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.329
 Now it's ready, we'll take it out of the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.159
 oven and as soon as possible you 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.839
 we will remove the skin to the peppers that 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.629
 It will come out very easy if these are 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.120
 hot the onion we will remove the 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.640
 first layer that will be somewhat parched already 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.330
 the aubergine will remove the skin and everything 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.710
 we will cut it to sheets 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.530
 well this has been an hour 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.750
 and we are going to take it out 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.090
 at 40 minutes 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.610
 the 40 minutes or so I gave him a 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.530
 quarter back to all the vegetable for 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.350
 that he was doing over and over 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.170
 down and when you give him the quarter-turn by 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.580
 the other two sides that are left 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:39.980
 now we are going to remove the skin to 502 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.110
 and has no secret to choose 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.910
 we are peeling with care of not 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.880
 burn us because this is freshly taken 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.200
 from the oven 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.200
 and we're hitting 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.120
 then we'll strips 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.850
 not very thick 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.790
 and this is the result of the three 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.650
 pepper the onion we will remove the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.650
 first layer that is a bit dry 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.380
 and we will cross it 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.879
 this would be the result of the peppers 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.730
 with the two onions and the aubergines 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.080
 we will put them on this side we are going to 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.080
 talk now the eggplant 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.780
 It is very easy 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.780
 all do everything hot 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.520
 and we do the exact same thing 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.520
 we will cut everything into strips 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.210
 once the aubergine is peeled 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.210
 cutting strips 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.060
 and we put it in our 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.060
 container and so nice and simple 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.760
 is to make a escalivada tell you that this 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.239
 it is stored in the refrigerator in the refrigerator 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.360
 and hold up well I do not know how much can 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.739
 endure but more than a week like this 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.130
 because it lasts more than one 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.410
 You can fill it with a little bit of 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.680
 oil so that it lasts a little longer and 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.680
 is 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.560
 you can eat in salad as is 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.830
 toasts 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.090
 and make a salad with this the egg 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.890
 hard and tuna that is very good and good 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.580
 we at home like to do a lot 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.569
 borrowed put the escalivada over 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.030
 and then put anchovies 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.090
 we line it up with salt oil and vinegar 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.569
 strong vinegar of this wine or of 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.900
 sherry 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.609
 we are very little but and it is very very 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.719
 Well if you try it, you'll tell me 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.719
 I hope you liked it a lot
