just move towards the small tower so i'm

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.010

reason i thought that the left one was
smaller<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.970> am<00:01:48.299> incorrect<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.649> on

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
smaller I am incorrect it's the one on

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
smaller I am incorrect it's the one on
the<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.040> at<00:01:50.399> least<00:01:50.579> from<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> landing

and<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.300> between<00:02:42.480> these<00:02:42.840> two<00:02:43.080> boxes<00:02:43.320> is<00:02:43.800> our

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
and in between these two boxes is our

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.750 
and in between these two boxes is our
can<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.850> blast<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.230> once<00:02:46.530> again<00:02:46.710> we<00:02:47.340> are<00:02:47.370> going

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
can of blast so once again we are going

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.250 
can of blast so once again we are going
to<00:02:47.850> shoot<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.210> like<00:02:48.240> we've<00:02:48.630> been<00:02:48.660> doing

from<00:03:30.570> here<00:03:30.780> we<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:30.930> see<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> gap<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:31.950> the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
from here we can see a gap in the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.160 
from here we can see a gap in the
background<00:03:32.880> between<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.140> different

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
background between all the different

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.650 
background between all the different
rock<00:03:34.620> formations<00:03:35.250> right<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.510> can

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
rock formations right there you can

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.330 
rock formations right there you can
probably<00:03:36.870> see<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.110> better<00:03:37.350> there<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.800> there's

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
probably see it better there and there's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.540 
probably see it better there and there's
a<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.790> trust<00:03:39.300> me<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.780> there<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.170> promise

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
a can trust me it's there I promise

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.820 
a can trust me it's there I promise

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
and another achievement our next map is

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.530 
and another achievement our next map is
warlord<00:03:55.470> which<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.920> another<00:03:56.370> like<00:03:56.760> super

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
warlord which is another like super

warlord which is another like super
duper<00:03:57.989> classic<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.650> right<00:03:58.769> here<00:03:58.950> i<00:03:58.980> spawned

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
duper classic and right here i spawned

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.890 
duper classic and right here i spawned
at<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.670> red<00:03:59.850> base<00:04:00.060> but<00:04:00.480> we're<00:04:00.570> going<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.780> want

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
at the red base but we're going to want

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.390 
at the red base but we're going to want
to<00:04:00.989> make<00:04:01.140> our<00:04:01.290> way<00:04:01.440> over<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.890> yellow<00:04:02.160> base

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
to make our way over to the yellow base

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.190 
to make our way over to the yellow base
so<00:04:02.610> over<00:04:02.850> there<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.150> green<00:04:03.420> base<00:04:03.660> blue<00:04:04.050> is

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
so over there is green base blue is

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.199 
so over there is green base blue is
directly<00:04:04.560> across<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:05.310> yellow<00:04:05.850> is<00:04:06.000> right

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
directly across and yellow is right

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.940 
directly across and yellow is right
there<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.930> we're<00:04:07.019> going<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.200> hop<00:04:07.350> through<00:04:07.680> here

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
there so we're going to hop through here

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.100 
there so we're going to hop through here
and<00:04:08.040> I'm<00:04:08.130> going<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.459> admire<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.110> envisioned

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
and I'm going to admire the envisioned

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.520 
and I'm going to admire the envisioned
because<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.980> looks<00:04:11.190> pretty<00:04:11.640> anyways<00:04:12.540> jump

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
because that looks pretty anyways jump

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.960 
because that looks pretty anyways jump
over<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:13.830> yellow<00:04:14.100> base<00:04:14.340> i'm<00:04:14.610> going<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.820> make

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
over to yellow base i'm going to make

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.099 
over to yellow base i'm going to make
sure<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.420> know<00:04:15.540> it's<00:04:15.690> yellow<00:04:15.900> base

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.590 
sure that you know it's yellow base
again<00:04:16.440> because<00:04:16.890> why<00:04:17.280> not<00:04:17.310> right<00:04:17.790> so<00:04:18.120> yellow

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
again because why not right so yellow

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.030 
again because why not right so yellow
bay<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:18.870> definitely<00:04:19.410> yellow<00:04:19.530> base<00:04:19.799> one

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
bay is definitely yellow base one

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.130 
bay is definitely yellow base one
hundred<00:04:20.340> percent<00:04:20.370> yellow<00:04:20.790> base<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.269> right<00:04:21.989> in

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
hundred percent yellow base and right in

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.779 
hundred percent yellow base and right in
this<00:04:22.289> corner<00:04:22.350> where<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:22.979> vine<00:04:23.250> meets<00:04:23.550> the
