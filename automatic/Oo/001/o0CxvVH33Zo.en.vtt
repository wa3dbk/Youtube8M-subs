you're going down again and you switch
the<00:00:40.810> fourth<00:00:41.140> now<00:00:42.010> you<00:00:42.610> can<00:00:42.790> also<00:00:43.090> use<00:00:43.360> fourth

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
the fourth now you can also use fourth

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.070 
the fourth now you can also use fourth
and<00:00:44.290> a<00:00:44.410> third<00:00:44.650> year<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.340> enter<00:00:46.090> this<00:00:46.270> corners

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
and a third year to enter this corners

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.220 
and a third year to enter this corners
and<00:00:47.350> then<00:00:48.130> now<00:00:48.280> you're<00:00:48.460> going<00:00:48.760> up<00:00:48.970> again<00:00:49.360> which

and then now you're going up again which
which<00:00:50.770> is<00:00:50.980> using<00:00:51.430> fourth<00:00:51.700> years<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.300> now<00:00:52.870> this

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
which is using fourth years and now this

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.850 
which is using fourth years and now this
corner<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:53.890> can<00:00:54.070> use<00:00:55.200> just<00:00:56.200> the<00:00:56.350> exhalation

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
corner you can use just the exhalation

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.560 
corner you can use just the exhalation
work<00:00:57.310> no<00:00:58.000> brakes<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.890> straight<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.760> you're

work no brakes now straight and you're

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.499 
work no brakes now straight and you're
entering<00:01:01.899> number<00:01:02.200> eight<00:01:02.410> corners<00:01:02.739> and<00:01:03.579> you

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
entering number eight corners and you

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.520 
entering number eight corners and you
change<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.259> short<00:01:05.880> sea-cans<00:01:06.880> which<00:01:07.530> is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
change to the short sea-cans which is

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.500 
change to the short sea-cans which is
ninth<00:01:08.770> corner<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.430> enter<00:01:09.760> with<00:01:09.940> fourth<00:01:10.270> gear

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
ninth corner you enter with fourth gear

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.960 
ninth corner you enter with fourth gear
and<00:01:10.750> then<00:01:11.020> right<00:01:11.290> to<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.740> right<00:01:12.400> side<00:01:12.700> which

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
and then right to the right side which

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.060 
and then right to the right side which
is<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.360> don't<00:01:13.450> have<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.810> push<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.620> left

too much because you can just use the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.910 
too much because you can just use the
center<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.250> use<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.870> apex<00:01:19.870> to<00:01:20.140> make<00:01:20.170> short

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
center and use a apex to make short

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.060 
center and use a apex to make short
corners

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
corners

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.000
