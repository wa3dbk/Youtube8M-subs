00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.710
 who will care if the atlas 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.900
 loses the category is a team that does not 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.930
 has done nothing should go to the league of 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.930
 ascent 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.680
 ah 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.689
 three lovely amateurs with this 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.390
 I am very happy to greet them 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.699
 I know they are prepared they are 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.030
 ready are already very excited for the 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.040
 morning game of pumas america I do not 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.019
 I know why if washing predicted a 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.610
 good classic game like the one that goes the one 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.589
 happened from blue cross chivas that everyone 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.600
 I expected a great match and in the end I left her 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.399
 much to wish emotions nothing more to 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.680
 dropper and it's over tomorrow I think 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.659
 that will be the same in zebu but that 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.879
 and you are at risk of 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.350
 buy a ticket that surely we 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.720
 they're going to drop in resale like 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.479
 it always happens in our football truth 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.670
 and it's not going to happen that way they're going to end 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.860
 paying almost a thousand pesos for a match 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.860
 it's not going to be worth it, not me 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.020
 I would doubt that they will be 0-0 and as always 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.780
 or as many times has happened but good 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.380
 this week's theme beyond the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.390
 cougar game america tips the morbid 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.000
 by alfredo tena in humans of the year 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.409
 what about the last tournament all this called me 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.750
 much attention what Jorge said 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.520
 vergara with respect to the atlas who 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.470
 had offered money to save the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.630
 precarious situation of the club 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.880
 I wanted to help them because you do not 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.620
 I would like them to go to the one who lost 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.170
 the category is no longer called first 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.790
 now and of promotion but that would like 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.250
 that the class would be there by God for 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.830
 hit or no no no no it can be okay 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.810
 suddenly you have a good heart and you 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.790
 you see the human side thing that suddenly 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.710
 I think you do it just for it to be 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.540
 speak well of you because the truth that 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.420
 there are many situations inside the 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.280
 club that does not seem like me because 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.320
 Many fans of chivas do not 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.720
 it seems but good the truth in this 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.400
 point I do not agree with you can not be 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.460
 that you are helping a team 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.670
 mediocre mediocre two neighbors as is the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.070
 atlas and I do not say it for the team itself 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.200
 the tradition club in the city of 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.830
 Guadalajara, the current directive is a 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.860
 disaster has no idea what it is 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.740
 football how to manage a team of 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.930
 soccer and who are you going out to help them 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.820
 see those who scratch with their own 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.220
 nails that go to the league of ascent 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.070
 that the managers lose 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.210
 they must pay for their mistakes my dear 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.400
 Jorge 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.670
 and soon someone helped you when 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.650
 chivas and all that you with your with your form 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.570
 of being has taken to Guadalajara 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.110
 Guadalajara forward for good or for 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.450
 wrong 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.390
 there is the guadalajara always 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.360
 you were champion with chivas in 2006 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.880
 and well you've done Guadalajara where 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.400
 your basic forces in a matter 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.200
 important to nourish the selection 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.110
 Mexican as at the time did the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.690
 pumas and that kind of situations in the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.570
 classe with all the money that the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.640
 atlas and its partners to this lorena ochoa a 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.100
 this rafita marquez to this alejandro 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.830
 fernandez who want to help what to 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.900
 the best in good faith want me to be 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.520
 take the team out of their loves forward 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.250
 putting something of what they have gained 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.950
 on a professional level the directive says 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.870
 that does not leave those who leave the 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.090
 team will not happen anything that you 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.760
 very concerned about the classic tapatío 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.620
 the rivalry nothing happens gradually 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.200
 happened a little bit fell madrid when 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.640
 the athletic one went to second division to 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.960
 little the president of real madrid in the 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.060
 that the time 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.460
 was there convincing jesus gil and 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.800
 gil who was still living since knowing 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.560
 accept this money we will help you for 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.260
 for nothing a rivalry is like that with the 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.410
 sorry if you go to the atlas to the league of 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.660
 promotion is your problem if you say that 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.970
 massa or selling is not going to happen anything 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.850
 the same thing when it happened right now 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.610
 river plate whose directives are 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.490
 the culprits of the failures of the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.370
 clubs for bad decisions by 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.570
 hire bad technicians for doing everything 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.510
 upside down 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.850
 and the atlas that's what he has done 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.770
 the atlas deserves to be in first 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.710
 division even if you say it jorgito 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:23.290
 Will you please let them go? 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.180
 learn from your mistakes, nothing else 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.040
 to give you an idea, they have not yet 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.870
 could solve the case of andrés 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.120
 saved when he went to the sports the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.370
 Coruña and this thief three neighbors of 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.800
 august caesar lendoiro still owes them 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.360
 money gave he owes to everyone should 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.190
 I think that also of colotto and I think 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.290
 that now owes the goalkeeper munúa that 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.580
 He was with them for seven years is not 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.880
 possible that the directive of the atlas 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.160
 have the weight 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:52.670
 to demand that he be signed by andrés 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.010
 saved this kind of situations 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.050
 the bad signings that the promoters 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.390
 they see their faces all that kind of things 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.410
 they have the atlas sunk in the 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.570
 mediocrity 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.250
 jorgito please leave them not going to happen 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.650
 nothing in the city of Guadalajara is not 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.810
 will fall because the class is in the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.780
 promotion league yes and the managers 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.360
 they have to learn from their mistakes and if 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.180
 they go to the first division to the league 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.860
 of promotion is your responsibility and I 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.990
 I am of the age that no one owes them 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.260
 help they should go out for their 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.610
 own foot nothing else like that because if not 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.040
 Well, they're going to stay around the world 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.440
 He is helping them, and then nobody is 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.140
 is going to put to work and nobody is going to move 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.200
 a finger please Jorge I ask you not the 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.900
 help and nothing happens if the class goes 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.900
 it's a mediocre 3p team but stingy 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.730
 it was ten years before the truth 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.640
 the promise of Mexican football for the 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.910
 kids that they brought and how to play now is 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.550
 one more team of the bunch 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.610
