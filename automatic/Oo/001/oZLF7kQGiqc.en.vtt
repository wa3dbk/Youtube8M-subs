the lego movie sets the trap Chomper
verse<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.460> ice<00:00:11.730> cream<00:00:12.179> machine<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.500> idea

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
verse the ice cream machine and the idea

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.770 
verse the ice cream machine and the idea
is<00:00:14.160> if<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.460> could<00:00:14.700> only<00:00:14.849> buy<00:00:15.120> one<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.540> these

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
is if you could only buy one of these

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.019 
is if you could only buy one of these
sets<00:00:16.109> which<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:16.800> should<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.220> buy<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:18.000> let's

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
sets which one should you buy so let's

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.960 
sets which one should you buy so let's
go<00:00:18.330> ahead<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> comparisons<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.820> both

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
go ahead and do the comparisons so both

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.170 
go ahead and do the comparisons so both
of<00:00:21.000> these<00:00:21.210> sets<00:00:21.480> are<00:00:21.660> $30<00:00:22.619> sets<00:00:23.039> they<00:00:23.910> are<00:00:24.060> also

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
of these sets are $30 sets they are also

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.410 
of these sets are $30 sets they are also
the<00:00:24.449> two-in-one<00:00:25.320> builds<00:00:25.820> now<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.150> trash

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the two-in-one builds now the trash

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.470 
the two-in-one builds now the trash
jumper<00:00:27.779> comes<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.279> 389<00:00:29.279> pieces<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
jumper comes with 389 pieces the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.110 
jumper comes with 389 pieces the
ice-cream<00:00:30.929> machine<00:00:31.140> comes<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.850> 344<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
ice-cream machine comes with 344 and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.959 
ice-cream machine comes with 344 and
then<00:00:33.930> each<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.559> these<00:00:34.649> sets<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.340> come<00:00:35.610> with

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
then each one of these sets do come with

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:36.910 
then each one of these sets do come with
three<00:00:36.300> minifigures

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
three minifigures

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.280 
three minifigures
so<00:00:37.920> first<00:00:38.190> we'll<00:00:38.370> compare<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.850> two

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
so first we'll compare the two

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.630 
so first we'll compare the two
micromanagers<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:40.739> go<00:00:40.920> say<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.280> these

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
micromanagers now go say this these

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000 
micromanagers now go say this these
really<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.600> not<00:00:42.719> gonna<00:00:42.899> factor<00:00:43.440> into<00:00:43.680> my

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
really are not gonna factor into my

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.270 
really are not gonna factor into my
decision<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.640> which<00:00:45.120> set<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.600> choose<00:00:46.190> but<00:00:47.190> we

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
decision on which set to choose but we

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.069 
decision on which set to choose but we
will<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.550> ahead<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.760> take<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> look<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.360> them<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
will go ahead and take a look at them so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.100 
will go ahead and take a look at them so
the<00:00:49.230> similar<00:00:49.710> designs<00:00:50.070> black<00:00:50.430> box<00:00:50.870> red<00:00:51.870> lights

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the similar designs black box red lights

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
the similar designs black box red lights
on<00:00:52.289> them<00:00:52.469> everywhere<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
on them everywhere if you can see in the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
on them everywhere if you can see in the
back<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.199> flick<00:00:55.559> fire

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
back here they do have flick fire

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.540 
back here they do have flick fire
missiles<00:00:56.719> so<00:00:57.719> there's<00:00:58.170> another<00:00:58.770> similarity

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
missiles so there's another similarity

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.569 
missiles so there's another similarity
they<00:00:59.940> both<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.899> arms<00:01:01.309> that<00:01:02.309> are

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
they both have the arms that are

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.570 
they both have the arms that are
adjustable<00:01:03.949> this<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.159> does<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
adjustable this one does have the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.820 
adjustable this one does have the
platform<00:01:06.150> underneath<00:01:06.900> where<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.560> kind

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
platform underneath where this one kind

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.670 
platform underneath where this one kind
of<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:09.450> smooth<00:01:09.869> underneath<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.470> does

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
of just is smooth underneath but it does

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.370 
of just is smooth underneath but it does
have<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.340> Jets<00:01:12.119> red<00:01:12.600> lights<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> back<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
have the Jets red lights in the back so

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.160 
have the Jets red lights in the back so
they<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.619> kind<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.950> both<00:01:14.070> flying<00:01:14.400> machines

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
they are kind of both flying machines

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
they are kind of both flying machines
now<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> flick<00:01:16.770> fire<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:18.180> one

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
now with the flick fire on this one

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
now with the flick fire on this one
which<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.380> comes<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.799> the

which is the one that comes with the
trash<00:01:20.880> chopper<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:22.080> wings<00:01:22.320> kind<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.890> open<00:01:23.220> up

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
trash chopper the wings kind of open up

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.980 
trash chopper the wings kind of open up
there<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> Flip<00:01:24.659> missiles

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
there and you have the Flip missiles

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.460 
there and you have the Flip missiles
underneath<00:01:25.729> where<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
underneath where is on the one with the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.109 
underneath where is on the one with the
ice<00:01:28.619> cream<00:01:28.799> machine<00:01:29.159> these<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.520> actually

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
ice cream machine these are actually

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.710 
ice cream machine these are actually
kind<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.810> rapid-fire<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.729> fire<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
kind of a rapid-fire one so you fire the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.810 
kind of a rapid-fire one so you fire the
first<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.619> loads<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> next<00:01:35.490> fire

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
first one and it loads the next fire

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.370 
first one and it loads the next fire
oops<00:01:36.420> did<00:01:36.930> come<00:01:37.140> out

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
oops did come out

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.149 
oops did come out
fire<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> next<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:39.320> loads<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.500> next<00:01:40.860> fire

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
fire the next one loads the next fire

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.700 
fire the next one loads the next fire
the<00:01:41.310> next<00:01:41.899> well<00:01:42.899> I'm<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.170> actually<00:01:43.350> shooting

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the next well I'm not actually shooting

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069 
the next well I'm not actually shooting
these<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.009> they're<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.369> coming<00:01:44.670> out<00:01:45.079> but

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
these out so they're not coming out but

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.990 
these out so they're not coming out but
you<00:01:46.290> get<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> gist<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you get the you get the gist of it and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760 
you get the you get the gist of it and
then<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.899> kind<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.229> reload<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
then you just kind of reload the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.399 
then you just kind of reload the
cartridge<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> actually<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.229> one

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
cartridge so I actually like the one

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.010 
cartridge so I actually like the one
with<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> rapid<00:01:53.100> fire<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.759> one's

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
with the rapid fire I think that one's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.510 
with the rapid fire I think that one's
the<00:01:55.020> better<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.680> two<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.280> it's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the better of the two just because it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.249 
the better of the two just because it's
kind<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.759> neat<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> rapid<00:01:57.390> fire<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:58.079> only

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
kind of neat with the rapid fire it only

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.929 
kind of neat with the rapid fire it only
has<00:01:58.469> three<00:01:58.770> flick<00:01:59.100> missiles<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.700> where

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
has three flick missiles on this where

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.840 
has three flick missiles on this where
this<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.299> does<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.509> four<00:02:01.610> but<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.640> know

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
this one does have four but you know

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.480 
this one does have four but you know
like<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.119> said<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:04.049> isn't<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.590> big<00:02:04.799> factor<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
like I said this isn't a big factor the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.100 
like I said this isn't a big factor the
micromanagers<00:02:06.030> isn't<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> big<00:02:06.719> factor<00:02:07.079> in

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
micromanagers isn't a big factor in

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.070 
micromanagers isn't a big factor in
which<00:02:07.530> which<00:02:08.009> set<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> would<00:02:08.580> choose<00:02:08.959> but<00:02:09.959> it

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
which which set I would choose but it

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.479 
which which set I would choose but it
was<00:02:10.170> good<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.379> kind<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.679> take<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> look<00:02:11.099> at<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
was good to kind of take a look at the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.610 
was good to kind of take a look at the
comparisons<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> two<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.080> now<00:02:13.200> looking<00:02:13.500> at

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
comparisons on the two so now looking at

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.890 
comparisons on the two so now looking at
the<00:02:13.709> me

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
the me

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.899

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
figures that come in the two sets you do

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.229 
figures that come in the two sets you do
get<00:02:16.120> three<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:16.870> each<00:02:17.170> set<00:02:17.730> over<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.000> trash

look at the two city builds of the

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.059 
look at the two city builds of the
two-in-one<00:03:16.359> bill<00:03:16.540> I'm<00:03:17.409> actually<00:03:17.680> not<00:03:17.949> going

two-in-one bill I'm actually not going
to<00:03:18.129> do<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> comparison<00:03:18.849> between<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.870> two

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
to do a comparison between the two

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.259 
to do a comparison between the two
flying<00:03:20.590> machines<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.669> movie-themed<00:03:22.150> to

flying machines the movie-themed to

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.849 
flying machines the movie-themed to
build<00:03:22.449> just<00:03:23.079> because<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.349> have<00:03:23.500> these<00:03:23.650> built

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
build just because I have these built

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.289 
build just because I have these built
already<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.519> don't<00:03:24.579> want<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.819> take<00:03:24.970> off<00:03:25.090> our

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
already and I don't want to take off our

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.789 
already and I don't want to take off our
to<00:03:25.419> build<00:03:25.569> those<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.109> then<00:03:26.260> take<00:03:26.470> those<00:03:26.620> apart

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
to build those and then take those apart

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.860 
to build those and then take those apart
and<00:03:27.160> rebuild<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.639> city<00:03:27.790> sets<00:03:28.060> because<00:03:28.840> I

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
and rebuild the city sets because I

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.229 
and rebuild the city sets because I
actually<00:03:29.139> prefer<00:03:29.650> these<00:03:30.010> builds<00:03:30.579> in<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.030> two

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
actually prefer these builds in the two

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.659 
actually prefer these builds in the two
and<00:03:31.419> one<00:03:31.540> as<00:03:32.230> opposed<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:33.069> movie-themed

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
in the review if you guys watch it the

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.809

back end doesn't open off that much so

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.629

better build then this one actually is

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.120 
better build then this one actually is

I'd love to know that but this is gonna

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.839 
I'd love to know that but this is gonna
be<00:05:46.960> a<00:05:46.990> little<00:05:47.380> bit<00:05:47.500> more<00:05:47.620> rare<00:05:47.949> of<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.460> vehicle

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
be a little bit more rare of a vehicle

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.850 
be a little bit more rare of a vehicle
than<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.210> garbage<00:05:49.539> truck<00:05:49.810> so<00:05:50.380> that's<00:05:50.590> kind<00:05:50.770> of

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
than the garbage truck so that's kind of

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.409 
than the garbage truck so that's kind of
why<00:05:50.979> I<00:05:51.009> would<00:05:51.280> choose<00:05:51.639> this<00:05:51.759> one<00:05:51.940> over<00:05:52.300> this

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
why I would choose this one over this

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.930 
why I would choose this one over this
one<00:05:52.479> they<00:05:53.440> they're<00:05:53.830> both<00:05:54.009> good<00:05:54.250> builds<00:05:54.669> the

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
one they they're both good builds the

minifigures<00:05:55.449> I<00:05:55.570> like<00:05:55.780> I<00:05:56.469> like<00:05:57.039> them<00:05:57.159> all<00:05:57.400> I'm

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
minifigures I like I like them all I'm

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.649

not a big fan of cardio carry but Jonah
and<00:06:01.930> Mike<00:06:02.199> the<00:06:02.380> ice<00:06:02.469> cream<00:06:02.680> vendors<00:06:02.949> are

and Mike the ice cream vendors are
really<00:06:03.370> cool<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:03.789> do<00:06:03.849> like<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.210> garbage

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
really cool and I do like the garbage

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.260 
really cool and I do like the garbage
men<00:06:04.630> in<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:04.840> show<00:06:04.990> so<00:06:05.580> yeah<00:06:06.580> that's<00:06:06.819> really<00:06:06.909> my

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
men in the show so yeah that's really my

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.240 
men in the show so yeah that's really my
reasoning<00:06:07.659> why<00:06:07.990> I<00:06:08.020> would<00:06:08.349> buy<00:06:08.500> this<00:06:08.770> just<00:06:09.009> a

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
reasoning why I would buy this just a

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.969 
reasoning why I would buy this just a
little<00:06:09.669> bit<00:06:09.819> funner<00:06:10.240> of<00:06:10.509> a<00:06:10.659> set<00:06:11.020> it<00:06:11.259> definitely

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
little bit funner of a set it definitely

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.010 
little bit funner of a set it definitely
looks<00:06:12.250> better<00:06:12.370> than<00:06:12.639> the<00:06:12.880> herps<00:06:13.120> trunk<00:06:13.389> in<00:06:13.569> you

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
looks better than the herps trunk in you

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.950 
looks better than the herps trunk in you
