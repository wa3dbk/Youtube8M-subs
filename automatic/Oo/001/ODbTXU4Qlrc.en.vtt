recommend and then they went on to ask
you<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.090> used<00:00:51.420> at

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
you know what this is gonna be used at

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.550 
you know what this is gonna be used at
and<00:00:52.610> whether<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.910> good<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:54.810> how<00:00:55.350> far

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
and whether it's good you know how far

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you can see in the dark

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
you can see in the dark
and<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> decided<00:00:57.660> since<00:00:58.110> I<00:00:58.230> was<00:00:58.380> out<00:00:58.470> here<00:00:58.620> in

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and so I decided since I was out here in

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.750 
and so I decided since I was out here in
the<00:00:58.800> middle<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> country<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> would

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the middle of the country that I would

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.270 
the middle of the country that I would
go<00:00:59.880> ahead<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.360> review<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.900> and<00:01:01.280> we're

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
go ahead and do a review on it and we're

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.380 
go ahead and do a review on it and we're
going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.610> go<00:01:02.700> ahead<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.940> show<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.150> at

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
going to go ahead and show you at

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
going to go ahead and show you at
different<00:01:03.570> distances<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.470> how<00:01:04.559> bright<00:01:04.800> it

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
different distances just how bright it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.540 
different distances just how bright it
is<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.399> how<00:01:05.520> easy<00:01:05.550> it<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:07.009> at<00:01:08.009> about

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
is and how easy it is to see at about

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.240 
is and how easy it is to see at about
950<00:01:09.360> yards<00:01:09.570> 100<00:01:09.930> yards<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> think<00:01:11.130> we're

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
950 yards 100 yards and I think we're

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.139 
950 yards 100 yards and I think we're
probably<00:01:11.340> gonna<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:11.759> up<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.149> far<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.979> 300

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
probably gonna go up to as far as 300

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.730 
probably gonna go up to as far as 300
depending<00:01:15.149> on<00:01:15.270> how<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.660> goes<00:01:15.690> in<00:01:16.200> 50<00:01:16.530> yard

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
depending on how it goes in 50 yard

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
depending on how it goes in 50 yard
progression<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.270> let's<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.600> all<00:01:21.600> right

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
progression so let's get to it all right

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.170 
progression so let's get to it all right
so<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.530> 50<00:01:22.920> yards<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:26.970> ahead<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
so this is it 50 yards and go ahead and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.660 
so this is it 50 yards and go ahead and
put<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> behind<00:01:27.479> your<00:01:27.630> back<00:01:27.870> I<00:01:28.370> can<00:01:29.370> see<00:01:29.580> them

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
put it behind your back I can see them

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
put it behind your back I can see them
very<00:01:29.909> clearly<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.870> you<00:01:31.880> can<00:01:32.880> even<00:01:33.060> zoom<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
very clearly and you can even zoom in to

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.060 
very clearly and you can even zoom in to
see<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.200> cornflakes<00:01:34.590> box<00:01:34.860> he's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
see that it's a cornflakes box he's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.210 
see that it's a cornflakes box he's
holding<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.700> now<00:01:35.820> we're<00:01:36.000> gonna<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.330> out<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:37.530> 100

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
holding so now we're gonna go out to 100

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.810 
holding so now we're gonna go out to 100
yards

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
yards

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.370 
yards
go<00:01:39.479> ahead<00:01:40.790> alright<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.510> 100<00:01:43.170> yards

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
go ahead alright so this is at 100 yards

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.609 
go ahead alright so this is at 100 yards

all<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.040> zoomed<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.270> zoom

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
all the way zoomed out and if you zoom

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.899 
all the way zoomed out and if you zoom
all<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.690> way<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.250> still<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.729> out

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
all the way in you can still make out

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.020 
all the way in you can still make out
real<00:01:51.450> faint<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.110> he's<00:01:52.260> holding<00:01:52.710> a

that<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.079> just<00:02:25.140> gonna<00:02:25.350> be<00:02:25.560> kind<00:02:25.709> of

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
that because it's just gonna be kind of

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.319 
that because it's just gonna be kind of
redundant<00:02:25.980> you're<00:02:26.700> not<00:02:26.820> going<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.120> able<00:02:27.209> to

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
redundant you're not going to be able to

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.080 
redundant you're not going to be able to
see<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:27.989> on<00:02:28.049> camera<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.489> see<00:02:29.700> him<00:02:29.910> down

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
see it on camera but I can see him down

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.590 
see it on camera but I can see him down
to<00:02:30.239> 200<00:02:30.690> yards<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:32.690> can<00:02:33.690> see

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
to 200 yards I can see

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.990 
to 200 yards I can see
probably<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.780> about<00:02:36.920> 300<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.490> be<00:02:38.700> able<00:02:38.910> to

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
probably to about 300 just be able to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.550 
probably to about 300 just be able to
make<00:02:39.150> out<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.840> know<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.140> there's<00:02:40.350> something

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
make out you know that there's something

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.240 
make out you know that there's something
down<00:02:40.890> there

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
down there

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.900 
down there
but<00:02:42.240> other<00:02:42.480> than<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:43.520> probably<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:44.670> past

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
but other than that probably not past

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.470 
but other than that probably not past
300<00:02:45.510> yards<00:02:46.820> what's<00:02:47.820> really<00:02:48.060> cool<00:02:48.210> is<00:02:48.270> this

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
300 yards what's really cool is this

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.550 
300 yards what's really cool is this
does<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.530> two<00:02:49.980> setting<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:52.110> it'll<00:02:52.320> go<00:02:52.470> dim

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
does have a two setting so it'll go dim

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.760 
does have a two setting so it'll go dim
and<00:02:55.560> then<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.520> got<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> bright<00:02:56.940> setting<00:03:00.770> that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
and then it's got a bright setting that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.460 
and then it's got a bright setting that
actually<00:03:02.070> translates<00:03:02.520> pretty<00:03:02.730> quick<00:03:03.470> of

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
actually translates pretty quick of

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.200 
actually translates pretty quick of
course<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:05.010> all<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.430> has<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> lock<00:03:05.880> button

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
course like all it has a lock button

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.610 
course like all it has a lock button
it'll<00:03:07.200> work<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.980> locks<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:12.320> it's<00:03:13.320> just<00:03:13.500> an

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
it'll work so it locks and it's just an

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.900 
it'll work so it locks and it's just an
