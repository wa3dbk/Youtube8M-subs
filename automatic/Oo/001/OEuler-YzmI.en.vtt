00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
changed it to crayon doodles because

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.160 
changed it to crayon doodles because
crayon<00:01:21.890> doodles<00:01:22.249> wouldn't<00:01:22.670> be<00:01:22.789> good<00:01:22.999> enough

we wanted to like we didn't want to make
pixel<00:01:27.499> art<00:01:27.710> because<00:01:28.130> pixel<00:01:28.520> art<00:01:28.609> we<00:01:28.909> think<00:01:29.119> is

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
pixel art because pixel art we think is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.059 
pixel art because pixel art we think is
really<00:01:29.479> overdone<00:01:29.869> even<00:01:30.140> though<00:01:30.259> it's<00:01:30.799> really

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
really overdone even though it's really

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.109 
really overdone even though it's really
cool<00:01:32.319> we<00:01:33.319> wanted<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:33.829> be<00:01:34.130> kind<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:34.939> yeah<00:01:35.090> I

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
cool we wanted to be kind of yeah I

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.520 
cool we wanted to be kind of yeah I
guess<00:01:35.329> you<00:01:35.450> could<00:01:35.569> say<00:01:35.600> Punk<00:01:35.990> we<00:01:36.200> want<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.439> to

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
guess you could say Punk we want it to

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.319 
guess you could say Punk we want it to
be<00:01:36.619> really<00:01:36.799> different<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.369> try<00:01:37.579> not<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.969> like

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
be really different and try not to like

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.989 
be really different and try not to like
make<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.049> pixel<00:01:39.679> platformer<00:01:40.490> thing

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
make a pixel platformer thing

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.319 
make a pixel platformer thing
so<00:01:41.740> these<00:01:42.740> deliberately<00:01:43.399> ugly<00:01:43.819> aesthetics

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
so these deliberately ugly aesthetics

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.270 
so these deliberately ugly aesthetics
are<00:01:44.509> actually<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.869> delivery<00:01:45.319> device<00:01:45.499> for<00:01:45.920> humor
