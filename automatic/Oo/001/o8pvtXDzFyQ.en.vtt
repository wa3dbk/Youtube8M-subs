because<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:12.750> i<00:00:12.840> said<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.170> previous<00:00:13.530> games

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
because like i said the previous games

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.930 
because like i said the previous games
that<00:00:13.920> don't<00:00:14.040> know<00:00:14.250> which<00:00:14.429> game<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.790> is

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
that don't know which game this is

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.890 
that don't know which game this is
because<00:00:15.089> they're<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.299> order<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:15.750> we're<00:00:15.870> just

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
because they're not order so we're just

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.950 
because they're not order so we're just
gonna<00:00:16.139> chug<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.190> through<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.609> them<00:00:17.960> we're

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
gonna chug on through all of them we're

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.830 
gonna chug on through all of them we're
on<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> map<00:00:19.470> Newkirk<00:00:20.359> precinct<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> name

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
on the map Newkirk precinct was the name

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.599 
on the map Newkirk precinct was the name
of<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.020> map<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.439> thought<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.039> normally

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
of this map I thought it was normally

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
of this map I thought it was normally
Newkirk<00:00:24.060> city<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> don't<00:00:25.320> know<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.560> is

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
Newkirk city but I don't know if this is

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
Newkirk city but I don't know if this is
a<00:00:25.710> variation<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.580> or<00:00:26.789> what<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> dealio<00:00:27.840> is

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
a variation of it or what the dealio is

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.019 
a variation of it or what the dealio is
I<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> download<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.789> not<00:00:29.880> the

I to download it so up it's not the
standard<00:00:30.269> map<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.050> looks<00:00:31.260> pretty<00:00:31.320> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
standard map but it looks pretty it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.479

looks pretty similar so quite sure
what's<00:00:35.700> actually<00:00:36.140> different<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.350> this

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
what's actually different about this

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.639 

and<00:00:56.329> what<00:00:57.329> does<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.600> white<00:00:57.960> raw<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.440> for

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and what does right white raw going for

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.349 
and what does right white raw going for
working<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.460> some<00:00:59.640> probes<00:00:59.910> probably<00:01:00.270> gonna

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
working out some probes probably gonna

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.490 
working out some probes probably gonna
go<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.660> twelve<00:01:00.899> gateway<00:01:02.510> no<00:01:03.510> there's<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> gas

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
go for twelve gateway no there's the gas

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.100 
go for twelve gateway no there's the gas
so<00:01:04.920> we've<00:01:05.100> got<00:01:05.250> an<00:01:05.369> 88<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
so we've got an 88 this is like the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
so we've got an 88 this is like the
fastest<00:01:07.860> um<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.159> fastest<00:01:11.729> Reaper<00:01:12.060> bill

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
fastest um the the fastest Reaper bill

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.550 
fastest um the the fastest Reaper bill
that<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.840> makes<00:01:13.080> sense<00:01:13.380> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that you can do that makes sense of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.960 
that you can do that makes sense of
course<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> could<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.729> straight

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
course you could do like just straight

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
course you could do like just straight
for<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.979> point

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
for it but that just like at that point

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
for it but that just like at that point
you<00:01:17.369> lose<00:01:17.570> income<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.960> could<00:01:19.110> have

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
you lose income that you could have

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
you lose income that you could have
gained<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> trade-off<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
gained and the trade-off is just this is

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
gained and the trade-off is just this is
the<00:01:21.570> best<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.140> guess<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> call<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.619> early<00:01:22.920> like

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the best I guess you call it early like

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.280 
the best I guess you call it early like
super<00:01:23.700> early<00:01:23.850> build<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:24.740> as<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> repro

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
super early build you can do as a repro

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.690 
super early build you can do as a repro
so<00:01:28.290> we'll<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.619> white<00:01:28.890> raw<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> be

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so we'll see if white raw is going to be

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.600 
so we'll see if white raw is going to be
bolded<00:01:30.060> off<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.500> usually<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.400> get

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
bolded off you know usually you can get

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.789 
bolded off you know usually you can get
a<00:01:32.670> stalker<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> don't<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> stock

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
a stalker out and you don't get a stock

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.219 
a stalker out and you don't get a stock
route<00:01:35.009> before<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.640> Reaper<00:01:35.939> shows<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.329> even<00:01:36.540> if

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
route before the Reaper shows up even if

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.450 
route before the Reaper shows up even if
you<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.470> boost<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.280> 12

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you gonna boost it if you go for 12

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.920 
you gonna boost it if you go for 12
gateway<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> micro

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
gateway so you kind of have to micro

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.020 
gateway so you kind of have to micro
your<00:01:40.079> probes<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.829> while<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.640> keep

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
your probes for a little while but keep
