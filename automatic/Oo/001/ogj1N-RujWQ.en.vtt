here's why there will always be a spark

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.540 
here's why there will always be a spark
on<00:06:13.690> making<00:06:14.170> or<00:06:14.350> breaking<00:06:14.650> this<00:06:15.100> final

on making or breaking this final

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.120 
on making or breaking this final
connection<00:06:16.140> therefore<00:06:17.140> it<00:06:17.410> is<00:06:17.590> important<00:06:18.100> to

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
connection therefore it is important to

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.490 
connection therefore it is important to
