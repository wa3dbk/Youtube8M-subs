encompasses the majority of the people
within<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.350> community<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:17.070> necessarily

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
within that community not necessarily

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
within that community not necessarily
everybody<00:01:18.270> because<00:01:18.570> we're<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.259> individuals

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
everybody because we're all individuals

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.620 
everybody because we're all individuals
right<00:01:20.130> everybody's<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.670> little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:21.210> different

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
right everybody's a little bit different

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.690 
right everybody's a little bit different
at<00:01:21.720> least<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.689> why<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.080> unity<00:01:25.950> important<00:01:26.580> in

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
at least so so why is unity important in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.330 
at least so so why is unity important in
the<00:01:26.790> skateboarding<00:01:27.299> community<00:01:28.189> well<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.250> be

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the skateboarding community well to be

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.700 
the skateboarding community well to be
honest<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:29.970> more<00:01:30.900> important<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
honest it's more more important on a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.539 
honest it's more more important on a
local<00:01:32.700> level<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.930> although<00:01:34.549> that's

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
local level I think although that's

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.130 
local level I think although that's
probably<00:01:35.729> debatable<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.659> you'll<00:01:36.780> probably

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
probably debatable and you'll probably

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140 
probably debatable and you'll probably
call<00:01:37.500> me<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> comments

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
call me out on that in the comments

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.350 
call me out on that in the comments
section<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.659> actually<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.030> expect<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
section and actually I expect one of you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.639 
section and actually I expect one of you
to<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.780> because<00:01:42.930> there's<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.409> very

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
to do so because there's a very

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.990 
to do so because there's a very
intelligent<00:01:43.890> argument<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.640> made<00:01:44.850> about

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
intelligent argument that can made about

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.280 
intelligent argument that can made about
that<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.630> time<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.170> my

it<00:03:57.480> goes<00:03:57.600> both<00:03:57.810> ways<00:03:58.079> we're<00:03:58.620> kind<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.889> fighting

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
it goes both ways we're kind of fighting

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.250 
it goes both ways we're kind of fighting
ourselves<00:03:59.880> because<00:04:00.690> we're<00:04:00.840> all<00:04:00.989> individuals

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
ourselves because we're all individuals

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.910 
ourselves because we're all individuals
and<00:04:01.889> it's<00:04:03.200> unfortunately<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.500> negative

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
and it's unfortunately the negative

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.440 
and it's unfortunately the negative
things<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.280> generally<00:04:05.549> went<00:04:06.030> out<00:04:06.209> not

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
things that generally went out not

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.270
