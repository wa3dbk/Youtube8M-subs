 he 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:12.370
 our black sea and so rich in bioresources 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.249
 like other tropical and even 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.699
 northern may 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.179
 but still inaction 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.339
 always what's found 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.960
 many unusual creatures and inhabitants 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.839
 you just need more careful books 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.480
 take a closer look 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.490
 grandmother 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.980
 or as it is called the Sultan Khan 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.010
 about three family su tank 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.170
 detachment perch shaped 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.960
 on the lower lip are two geese playing Gaddafi 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.300
 the main role when looking for food 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.420
 spiridon moves slowly around the very 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.610
 bottom still strongly felt to be him 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.370
 the surface of the bushes in search 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.310
 small bottom animals 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.760
 crime along the channel the tank has a lot of bristles 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.280
 worms 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.620
 mollusks and benthic 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.630
 hand shaped occasionally trades and shallow 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.920
 fish 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.630
 the most active was get 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.680
 additional time 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.660
 food activity depends on time 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.520
 of the year 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 in the winter in the black sea it decreases sharply 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.710
 and the chip itself can reach dozens 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.670
 centimeters males usual evening 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.030
 this is a typical bottom fisherman never 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.840
 rising in the water column 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.240
 she sticks soft tourists in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.910
 sandy or shell rock in soils 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.330
 meeting stony 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.520
 out of fifty as existing in the world 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.690
 parabolic black sea belongs 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.370
 only one which theologians are called 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.030
 he needs rba tuscon current 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.190
 setting so those are tropical 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.790
 and subtropical waters of the Atlantic 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.280
 quiet 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 and indian oceans 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400
 although some even live in the waters of norway 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.669
 if sultanka is characterized 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.669
 parody antennae on chin 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.740
 red mullets live off the coast 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.839
 at shallow depths of 15 to 30 meters 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.909
 although come across and at a depth of 300 to the table 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:28.829
 meters 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.489
 the ambassador also keeps in flocks comfortably 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.959
 the drums of the world that's how they call this fish in 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.900
 Israel and also in greece bulgaria 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.949
 egypt in turkey and cyprus 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.310
 in Syria and Lebanon 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.380
 also called fish sultan ibrahimov 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.010
 from here comes the second Russian 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.010
 name of red sultan 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.469
 Sudanese has very tasty and tender meat 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.339
 therefore lepisto for industrialized shores 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:00.350
 Mediterranean 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.999
 and black seas 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.509
 five were particularly popular 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.079
 fish in ancient rome 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.540
 according to legend, large sultanka 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.859
 paid equal to them for less 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.859
 the amount of silver 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.840
 and now fishing levels 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.009
 doing all over the world 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.499
 however there is at least one species 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.329
 who has poisonous meats is true 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.109
 this red mullet dwells in the waters

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.430
 promotion going down 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.580
 almost vertical wheel and disembark 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.769
 passengers eyes 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.989
 small fits at the bottom 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.590
 parts of the head of the genus with a knife fine teeth 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.699
 bristles 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.929
 because of the length of the legs, tobacco is still asleep and it is not 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.929
 in Russian pavement boxes among 4 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.249
 while searching for food the red mullet is raising 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:07.639
 small cozy little clouds which they 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.419
 are up to her participation after all apple 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.760
 attract other fish 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.970
 practicing the so-called fireplace 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.979
 soloists 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.469
 it's either companions 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:20.259
 often the presence of goatfish 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.209
 determined by the presence at the bottom 

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:23.800
 small craters 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.710
 activity levels can be in 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.020
 depending on the species here are the accessories on 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.600
 day 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.600
 after all, night 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.939
 m some types of parabolic changed to 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.340
 predatory lifestyle 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.199
 for example, how is this inhabitant 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.639
 red sea golden and saturday 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.639

 the mole is different for its coloring it has 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.400
 spotted zones 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.320
 by the way at night in work change

 in the second third year of life 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.779
 i.e. shares from May to August 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:21.560

 explosive devices several portions of Crimea 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.369
 the total fertility of the season is 

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:32.050
 shelling 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.169
