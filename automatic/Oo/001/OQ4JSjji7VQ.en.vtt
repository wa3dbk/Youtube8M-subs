00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.210
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection Mobile Suit Gundam 00 a House 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.809
 War Kemp in the pocket is ah ah 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:14.860
 Kempfer is a teaching suit for the military of the Zeon 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.550
 The whole body is designed with a graceful line and the fan is still in the sharp design 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.140
 Many 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:25.000
 Because of that, when you are asked something about your favorite mobile suit on the net 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.200
 Care should be taken in being Showers Ganota handling If you answer Toka like Ken Pu fur 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.880
 Recently, spot participation, such as Bahia run 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.630
 When you push the old expectation that example I was likely bad Kampfer is training in the colony 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.900
 It is unusual for mobile suit of dione in mobile suit specialized in 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.900
 From the beginning of the aircraft series, where the name itself has some meaning 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.280
 The parts disassembly and assembly scenes are depicted in detail 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.190
 It became more possible to Gundam thruster equipped fan to what is whole body was pegged 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.460
 Blowout strategy 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.070
 I can only say that I am good at cherry blossoms 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.600
 There is only a minimum required thickness to increase mobility, and at that time it is considered to be a paper armor 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.250
 It was a poor aircraft 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.969
 Even armed weapons are not equipped except for Saber, and full-body weapons such as Bazooka can be used throughout 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.210
 Equipment 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.450
 Weapons that have run out have advanced while being disposable as they become red weights 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.500
 came 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.729
 The pilot of Kampfer Mikhail Kaminsky attention nicknamed misia 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.149
 It was also drunk driver when I was riding in Kenpufa in middle-aged men in Al 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:24.829
 Ride Chris like a drunk approached me drank to idle 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:28.440
 It consisted of the gym sniper and mass production type cancer canon which approached Gundam nt 1. 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:32.550
 Annihilate Federal Army's Scarlet Corps, but there 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.440
 Kempfer, who had run out at the Royal Palace, was in the abrasive chamber, which had previously been hidden in a container 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.060
 Attacked in Gundam 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.990
 Let's make nt 1 go by the explosion of the chain mine that will teach you how to fight 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.159
 Will succeed but 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.560
 The whole body is made a beehive with Gatling gun which is a hidden weapon of Gundam nt 1 -1 part 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.220
 It has been defeated without difficulty 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.829
 At the time of the fans of this scene was so much is 1 part Gatling gun 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.890
 In addition to Pokesen is the unexplored side and called it thing Well kit, but the price at the time was 800 yen 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.980
 I can not do a little better compared to the kit of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.470
 The popularity of the kempfer 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:10.790
 Is huge and the modeler of that time poured all of the technology that can be used into this kit 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:15.380
 As a basic work , parts of Skaska such as chain mine are filled with putty or plavan 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.060
 Do you want to narrow or extend the width as you like? 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.000
 I wonder if you do 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.600
 I think young people do not know, but for robots designed by Yutaka Dejima 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.110
 Is there was a detail that was open roughly five long holes in February 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.910
 It is also on the Patlabor Toka mass production type gun Cannon 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.750
 As a simple process, I only black out, but modelers of these days are pin vise 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.310
 After hollowed out 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.990
 The details were added from the back, and the Zeon army of these days did not know 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.000
 It became Ppoku former German army Izubuchi's late Otaku 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.230
 It is the fault of 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.230
 For the dying ones
