00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.429
 Well, we are back with more 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.640
 lactating desserts that will make you happy 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.990
 to your body and those around you 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.570
 now let's make a loser press 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.400
 that is going to look great this way 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.560
 point the ingredients well since 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.560
 but we will use 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.470
 half a cup of oat flakes 2 cups 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.900
 of natural yogurt from strawberries split 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.490
 half and 2 tablespoons of mashed sugar 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.020
 now I have to say I'm going to 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.240
 talk a little about who signed the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.790
 Kefir is a very rare yogurt that is 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.580
 originally from the Caucasus the to get 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.280
 sure bulgarian is very easy there are two 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.230
 types of that if one is the one that is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 fermented in water and the other is the one that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 ferment in milk in this case you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.100
 you can get your own that here and it's 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.010
 there with the Bulgarians put the milk and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.890
 they are going to ferment the milk and that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.140
 ferment what it achieves is the arm 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.390
 bacilio and as we all know the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.220
 Lactobacilli regenerate all flora 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.640
 intestinal and regenerating the flora 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.229
 intestinal we have more facility to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.430
 absorb body nutrients 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.840
 because they are like a few hairs and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 these little hairs what they do is that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.070
 absorb nutrients and through 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.020
 those hairs go through the nutrients 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 into the bloodstream and then it's 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.160
 move towards the molecules or the cells 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.300
 who need our body now 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.400
 when the intestinal flora is 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.980
 nonexistent and this happens has continued with 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.050
 people who take a lot of laxatives 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.390
 and it melts and then the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.540
 nutrients no longer pass also reaches 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.560
 spend with people who have problems 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.610
 that do not digest gluten or coeliacs 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.140
 they also have flora problems 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.620
 intestinal because it also degrades its 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 tissue of the flora and they run out of it and 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.030
 generally it is very inflamed its 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.170
 intestine then it is very convenient 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.120
 also for this kind of people 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.760
 make you suggest or take the 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.920
 lactobacilli to be able to regenerate that 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.330
 final speaker that is super useful for 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.190
 all our organism who was going to 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.940
 tell us that the intestine was the most 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.890
 important of good nutrition come 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.930
 let's make a mix of our 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.640
 say that we did it well based on 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.980
 Bulgarians in milk these are fermented 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.320
 the Bulgarians sneak in and stay 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.569
 with the yogurt that is this can be 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.840
 buy also I've done 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.659
 and then if they do not get it then 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.950
 understanding a natural yogurt that has 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:40.799
 added this lactobacilli or the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.129
 review alone or you can also buy 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.959
 little that the game that is Arabic and also 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.090
 It is made from ferments of 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.799
 Lactobacilli that can help 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.790
 also to regenerate that intestinal flora 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:57.719
 that really made them not be 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.639
 happy that the lactobacilli live 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.030
 come on let's put here let's mix 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.430
 the kefir 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.209
 or Bulgarian yogurt 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.459
 and we're going to mix it with the oatmeal and there 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.859
 we're going to let it settle a bit now 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.049
 the oatmeal is a super to me I love it is 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.819
 a super cereal has a lot 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.650
 properties plus it has a 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.510
 Very nice texture in the mouth because 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.879
 it's like soft it has a lot of fiber 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.799
 the only thing is that in the vein is 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.400
 contraindicated for patients who have 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.489
 diabetes because what it can cause is 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.440
 drop a lot of insulin and cause 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.260
 then be saved 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.510
 fat or extra sugar in the form of 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.930
 fat in the body and this can cause 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.520
 well to gain weight or failing to increase 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.890
 the cholesterol that in itself must be 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.230
 high in diabetics cholesterol 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.420
 the blood then try not to do 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.940
 many things with oats I give them a 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.070
 option the option to my liking would be the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.480
 amaranth for me there is nothing that is 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.160
 look like the amaranth I think it's the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.430
 best of the best serials that 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.830
 we have in existence and that's why I 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.830
 I think it was our our communion not 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.020
 dare to say that something so small had 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.870
 so many good things in the case of the 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.510
 oatmeal we have a lot of protein we have is 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.910
 of fiber we have vitamins from the complex 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.150
 b we also have some vitamin c 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.440
 we have calcium and this can help us 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.110
 an optimization of the organism and we are going to 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.139
 put this in a few glasses 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.249
 as it has softened him a little 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:43.849
 the oats with which they know that in the 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:46.279
 pharmacy also then sell this I say 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.099
 for people who have problems 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:52.610
 already with gluten and that are celiac 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:54.889
 fasting this lactobacillus vials 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.629
 that have 2000 units of lactobacilli 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.849
 and this can be also 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.499
 taking every day to regenerate 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.810
 regenerate all tissues of the 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:05.389
 organism and but also the typical ones that 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.520
 the typical ones are the other kind of yes 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.919
 what it does is ferment the 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.110
 piloncillo or juices or honey and 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.639
 these things the lower part of cholesterol 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.500
 and then it is also very good 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.650
 we always have to rely on those in the 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.360
 base on the microorganisms that end 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.169
 being super good for the body he 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.080
 never do not think the most German 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.520
 vitamin b12 also impresses me is 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.969
 a vitamin that is obtained through 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.759
 the bugs is to say if the pacifier falls 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.529
 of your child to the floor and have not spent more 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.870
 of 5 seconds is the rule of 5 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.580
 dried seconds and if not start over 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.889
 5 seconds you can put it back 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.939
 the pacifier and so will you acquire 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.349
 of vitamin B vitamins and also not 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.759
 be we that we fall something to the 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.229
 floor and we pick it up what we have 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.449
 touched something that is a bit dirty and 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:56.240
 accidentally touch our mouth or 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.330
 something like that what you achieve is to obtain this 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.919
 vitamin b12 that activates a little bit all the 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.699
 body metabolism who was going to 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.430
 tell us everything is necessary in the world 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.289
 well let's set up our little things 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.229
 let's put a little of the firm 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:16.200
 clear with oats and that's what we're going to 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:20.140
 put it back to carotenes 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.150
 beta carotene from strawberries and strawberries 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.380
 they fascinate me it makes me a fruit 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.300
 delicious 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.020
 besides that it has a lot of 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.540
 properties if it's the best fruits 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.620
 that there is like to eliminate radicals 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.930
 free 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:42.389
 they can be sweet they can be eaten in 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:45.060
 salads are ready and we're going to 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.760
 add a little bit of mashed sugar 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.669
 that is 9 dead and therefore has 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.949
 fiber equally and it's only for 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:54.270
 sweeten a little bit they will not throw 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:56.610
 a little bit so much because our 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.979
 organism does not need it and here we 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.190
 we go to the year now we go to the table of 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.190
 presentation 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.970
 do not 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.740
 Now we already know that desserts 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.500
 It can also have an effect 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.409
 beneficial to health today we did 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.050
 two laxative desserts one jelly 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:22.120
 nopal and one that is to go for strawberries and then 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.220
 they look great and now they can 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.110
 surprise your guests and your family 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.030
 with desserts that have functions 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.680
 organic and what they are going to do to us all 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.409
 very happy believe me they will be us 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.360
 very happy sometimes it's important to be 

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:36.370
 regenerating the intestinal flora is not 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.900
 forget that because there they all know 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.729
 the nutrients are super important 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.500
 I hope you liked it, see you 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:44.169
