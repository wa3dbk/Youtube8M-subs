I<00:02:17.500> had<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.340> fabricate<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.180> piece<00:02:19.450> here<00:02:20.280> just

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
I had to fabricate this piece here just

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.250 
I had to fabricate this piece here just
cut<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.760> raise<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.750> when<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.020> roll

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
cut it to raise it so that when you roll

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.960 
cut it to raise it so that when you roll
it<00:02:23.290> up<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.680> doesn't<00:02:23.830> bind<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.490> top<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.910> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
it up it doesn't bind on top of the

it up it doesn't bind on top of the
rails<00:02:25.210> here<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.250> just<00:02:27.610> grabbed<00:02:27.850> some<00:02:28.320> PVC

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
rails here so I just grabbed some PVC

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.940 
rails here so I just grabbed some PVC
pipe<00:02:30.780> screw<00:02:31.780> some<00:02:32.050> screws<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:32.380> there<00:02:32.740> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
pipe screw some screws in there and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.330 
pipe screw some screws in there and
raised<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.360> sits<00:02:34.600> up<00:02:34.810> tall<00:02:35.340> works

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
raised it so it sits up tall works

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.020 
raised it so it sits up tall works
really<00:02:36.610> well

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
really well

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.120 
really well
and<00:02:37.120> heats<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.110> pool<00:02:38.560> up<00:02:38.800> phenomenally<00:02:41.130> this

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
and heats the pool up phenomenally this

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.190 
and heats the pool up phenomenally this
little<00:02:42.460> guy<00:02:42.640> here<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.330> works<00:02:43.540> amazingly

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
little guy here it just works amazingly

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.160 
little guy here it just works amazingly

when you're filling this pool to the
rails<00:04:01.560> will<00:04:01.920> bow<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.960> but<00:04:03.960> when<00:04:04.710> it<00:04:04.830> gets<00:04:04.950> to

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
rails will bow in but when it gets to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.250 
rails will bow in but when it gets to
about<00:04:05.280> three<00:04:05.880> inches<00:04:05.910> from<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.510> top<00:04:06.720> it'll<00:04:07.080> go

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
about three inches from the top it'll go

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.740 
about three inches from the top it'll go
nice<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.470> straight<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.640> it's<00:04:09.600> pretty

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
nice and straight so it's pretty

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.910 
nice and straight so it's pretty
straight<00:04:10.280> pulls<00:04:11.280> down<00:04:11.460> 100%<00:04:12.150> level<00:04:12.390> either<00:04:12.660> I
