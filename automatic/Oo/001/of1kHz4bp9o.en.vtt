00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.460 

I<00:00:29.359> wanted<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.419> write<00:00:30.660> about<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.259> most

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
I wanted to write about the most

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.770 
I wanted to write about the most
powerful<00:00:32.430> force<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.059> nature<00:00:33.210> through<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
powerful force in nature through the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.119 
powerful force in nature through the
eyes<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> people<00:00:34.470> who<00:00:34.559> understood<00:00:34.949> it<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
eyes and people who understood it the

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.850 
eyes and people who understood it the
most<00:00:35.449> in<00:00:36.449> the<00:00:36.899> case<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.379> way<00:00:37.470> of<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.710> was

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
most in the case of the way of it was

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.369 
most in the case of the way of it was
layered<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.210> other<00:00:39.449> people<00:00:39.930> who<00:00:40.079> were<00:00:40.350> at

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
layered and the other people who were at

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.439 
layered and the other people who were at
the<00:00:40.739> very<00:00:40.829> apex<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.519> sport<00:00:41.909> it's<00:00:42.239> like

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
the very apex of the sport it's like

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.790 
the very apex of the sport it's like
this<00:00:42.659> amazing<00:00:43.610> band<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:45.180> adventurers<00:00:46.050> but

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
this amazing band of adventurers but

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.319 
this amazing band of adventurers but
it's<00:00:46.949> not<00:00:47.159> even<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.579> much<00:00:47.640> surfing<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.180> like

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it's not even so much surfing it's like

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
it's not even so much surfing it's like
so<00:00:48.540> far<00:00:48.720> beyond<00:00:48.960> surfing<00:00:49.409> it's<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.769> into

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
so far beyond surfing it's going into

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.340 
so far beyond surfing it's going into
this<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.280> element<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.150> is<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:52.110> all

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
this other element and that is what all

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.689 
this other element and that is what all
these<00:00:52.530> characters<00:00:52.890> had<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.129> common<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.579> this

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
these characters had in common was this

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.090 
these characters had in common was this
willingness<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.540> step<00:00:55.110> across<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> threshold

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
willingness to step across the threshold

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.950 
willingness to step across the threshold
you<00:00:56.820> know<00:00:56.909> to<00:00:56.970> go<00:00:57.239> into<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.600> other<00:00:57.720> element

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you know to go into this other element

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.500 
you know to go into this other element
big<00:00:58.680> weights<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.309> each<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.879> has<00:01:00.180> such<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
big weights have so each one has such a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.819 
big weights have so each one has such a
different<00:01:00.960> character<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:01.530> what's<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
different character that's what's so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.400 
different character that's what's so
great<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> way<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.760> they're<00:01:02.910> all<00:01:03.090> so

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
great in a way that they're all so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.749 
great in a way that they're all so
uniquely<00:01:04.410> different<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.580> their<00:01:05.729> own

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
uniquely different and have their own

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.310 
uniquely different and have their own

yeah<00:01:07.410> it's<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.770> oh<00:01:07.890> terror<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.240> everything

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
yeah it's like oh terror and everything

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.430 
yeah it's like oh terror and everything
mixed<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:12.240> was<00:01:12.360> also<00:01:12.539> the<00:01:12.720> scientists<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
mixed it was also the scientists that

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.810 
mixed it was also the scientists that
are<00:01:13.500> studying<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:14.070> waves<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.610> trying<00:01:14.759> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
are studying these waves and trying to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.010 
are studying these waves and trying to
figure<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.479> why<00:01:15.690> are<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:15.899> these

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
figure out you know why are all these

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.840 
figure out you know why are all these
boats<00:01:16.229> disappearing<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.310> don't<00:01:17.460> even<00:01:17.580> know

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
boats disappearing we don't even know

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.669 
boats disappearing we don't even know
how<00:01:18.600> these<00:01:18.810> waves<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.110> breaking<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
how these waves are breaking out the

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.830 
how these waves are breaking out the
middle<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.009> ocean<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.520> sometimes<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.660> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
middle of the ocean like sometimes in a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.120 
middle of the ocean like sometimes in a
40-foot<00:01:22.289> sea<00:01:22.440> there<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:22.679> be<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> hundred<00:01:23.039> foot

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
40-foot sea there will be a hundred foot

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.800 
40-foot sea there will be a hundred foot
wave<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> how<00:01:23.610> does<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.940> even<00:01:24.060> happen<00:01:24.179> for<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
wave and how does that even happen for a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.120 
wave and how does that even happen for a
long<00:01:24.899> time<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.350> wasn't<00:01:25.500> physics<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
long time there wasn't physics that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.680 
long time there wasn't physics that
could<00:01:26.369> explain<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.030> there<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.390> still

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
could explain it and there are still

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.719 
could explain it and there are still
conditions<00:01:28.530> under<00:01:28.740> which<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.159> happens<00:01:29.580> and

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
conditions under which it happens and

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
conditions under which it happens and
nobody<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.239> knows<00:01:30.390> why<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> wanted<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
nobody really knows why so I wanted to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.919 
nobody really knows why so I wanted to
find<00:01:32.039> out<00:01:32.190> what<00:01:32.369> what's<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.539> on<00:01:33.660> in

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
find out what what's really going on in

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.100 
find out what what's really going on in
the<00:01:34.369> darkest<00:01:35.369> darkest<00:01:35.910> most<00:01:36.450> powerful<00:01:36.899> part

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the darkest darkest most powerful part

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.290 
the darkest darkest most powerful part
of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.289> ocean<00:01:37.440> and<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.950> think<00:01:38.160> that's<00:01:38.340> part<00:01:39.149> of

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
of the ocean and I think that's part of

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.050 
of the ocean and I think that's part of
what<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:40.500> book<00:01:40.920> offers<00:01:41.459> people<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.910> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
what this book offers people is the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.419 
what this book offers people is the
opportunity<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.690> understand<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.950> way<00:01:44.099> that

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
opportunity to understand the way that

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.160 
opportunity to understand the way that
and<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> earth<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> living<00:01:45.390> organism<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and the earth is a living organism I

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.740 
and the earth is a living organism I
mean<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.950> wind<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.970> mean<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
mean it's the wind and I mean it's a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.630 
mean it's the wind and I mean it's a
lion<00:01:48.989> and<00:01:49.349> it's<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.619> waves<00:01:49.830> are<00:01:50.069> that's<00:01:50.489> what

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
lion and it's what waves are that's what

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160 
lion and it's what waves are that's what
surfing<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> that's<00:01:51.479> what<00:01:51.630> our<00:01:51.750> lives<00:01:51.989> are

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
surfing is that's what our lives are

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.199 
surfing is that's what our lives are
that's<00:01:52.349> what<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.619> dedicate<00:01:53.039> our<00:01:53.160> lives<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.550> the

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
that's what we dedicate our lives to the

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.479 
that's what we dedicate our lives to the
ocean<00:01:54.599> the<00:01:55.590> climate<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.129> we<00:01:56.190> think<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.459> so

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:56.489 
ocean the climate that we think is so

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:58.729 
ocean the climate that we think is so
stable<00:01:56.940> is<00:01:57.300> changing<00:01:57.720> in<00:01:57.959> a<00:01:58.050> rather<00:01:58.200> volatile

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
stable is changing in a rather volatile

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.949 
stable is changing in a rather volatile
weight<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.250> wanted<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.729> point<00:01:59.910> out<00:02:00.149> that

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
weight and I wanted to point out that

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.440 
weight and I wanted to point out that
this<00:02:01.709> earth<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.099> we're<00:02:02.280> living<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.879> is<00:02:03.119> not<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
this earth that we're living on is not a
