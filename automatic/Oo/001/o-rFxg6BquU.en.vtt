00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
wheel I got kind of close to the hull I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.650 
wheel I got kind of close to the hull I
didn't<00:02:31.670> make<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.820> flush<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.450> hull

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
didn't make it flush with the hull

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.660 
didn't make it flush with the hull
because<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.680> wood<00:02:33.890> didn't<00:02:34.190> come<00:02:34.370> right<00:02:34.520> up

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
because the wood didn't come right up

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.820 
because the wood didn't come right up
against<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.060> hole<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.390> wood<00:02:35.540> came<00:02:35.780> off<00:02:35.990> the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
against the hole the wood came off the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.710 
against the hole the wood came off the
hull<00:02:37.010> maybe<00:02:37.250> almost<00:02:37.430> as<00:02:37.670> much<00:02:37.820> of<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:38.060> hat<00:02:38.240> as<00:02:38.660> a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
hull maybe almost as much of a hat as a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.080 
hull maybe almost as much of a hat as a
half-inch<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.410> some<00:02:39.650> places<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.760> was<00:02:40.940> just

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
half-inch in some places and was just

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.580 
half-inch in some places and was just
filled<00:02:41.270> along<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.660> edge<00:02:41.840> with<00:02:42.110> epoxy<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.390> and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
filled along the edge with epoxy and and

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.130 
filled along the edge with epoxy and and
fiberglass<00:02:47.590> back<00:02:48.590> there<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:50.720> where<00:02:51.020> the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
fiberglass back there is where the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.470 
fiberglass back there is where the
that's<00:02:51.500> where<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.710> battery<00:02:52.070> went<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.700> I'm

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
that's where the battery went and I'm

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.910 
that's where the battery went and I'm
not<00:02:53.600> sure<00:02:53.810> how<00:02:53.960> I'm<00:02:54.050> gonna<00:02:54.170> get<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.560> last

that<00:03:00.140> last<00:03:00.380> little<00:03:00.500> piece<00:03:00.740> may<00:03:00.980> just<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.400> may

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
that last little piece may just I may

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.690 
that last little piece may just I may
just<00:03:01.730> scab<00:03:01.940> over<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.920> it's<00:03:03.920> under<00:03:04.220> these

covers it's not even really visible and
I<00:03:07.520> don't<00:03:07.820> really<00:03:07.940> know<00:03:08.560> there's<00:03:09.560> also<00:03:09.709> this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
I don't really know there's also this

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.500 
I don't really know there's also this
piece<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:11.330> runs<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:12.620> can<00:03:12.739> see<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:12.950> made<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> cut

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
piece that runs you can see I made a cut

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.320 
piece that runs you can see I made a cut
here<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:15.620> just<00:03:16.070> sits<00:03:16.280> alongside<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:17.000> the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
here and it just sits alongside the the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.240 
here and it just sits alongside the the
main<00:03:17.510> stringer<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.170> as<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.890> can<00:03:19.010> see<00:03:19.160> the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
main stringer and as you can see the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.910 
main stringer and as you can see the
wood<00:03:19.430> here<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.760> all<00:03:19.910> rotten<00:03:20.270> too<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.410> I'm<00:03:21.739> gonna

wood here is all rotten too so I'm gonna
have<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.160> maybe<00:03:22.430> get<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.640> dremel<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.350> score<00:03:24.370> all

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
have to maybe get a dremel and score all

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.370 
have to maybe get a dremel and score all
down<00:03:25.940> here<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.420> take<00:03:26.570> this<00:03:26.810> piece<00:03:27.080> of

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.550

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
fiberglass off to replace that wood

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.840 
fiberglass off to replace that wood
although<00:03:33.560> now<00:03:34.010> that<00:03:34.160> I'm<00:03:34.220> looking<00:03:34.310> at<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.730> I'm

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
although now that I'm looking at it I'm

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.090 
although now that I'm looking at it I'm
not<00:03:35.000> sure<00:03:35.269> what<00:03:36.080> purpose<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.530> would<00:03:36.830> even

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
not sure what purpose that would even

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.990 
not sure what purpose that would even
serves<00:03:37.840> maybe<00:03:38.840> it's<00:03:38.989> a<00:03:39.050> temperature<00:03:39.470> thing

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
serves maybe it's a temperature thing

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.140 
serves maybe it's a temperature thing
for<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.090> engine<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:42.700> really<00:03:43.700> don't<00:03:43.850> know<00:03:43.970> I

for the engine I really don't know I
don't<00:03:44.390> know<00:03:44.480> why<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:44.810> woods<00:03:45.019> there<00:03:45.670> no<00:03:46.670> idea

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
I did I just took a cut off wheel cut

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.910 
I did I just took a cut off wheel cut
along<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.180> edge<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:06.260> sanded<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.709> down<00:04:06.890> a

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
along the edge and I sanded it down a

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.250 
along the edge and I sanded it down a
little<00:04:07.130> bit<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.489> make<00:04:07.610> a<00:04:07.640> nice<00:04:07.880> kind<00:04:08.209> of<00:04:08.330> edge

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
little bit to make a nice kind of edge

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.379 
little bit to make a nice kind of edge
for<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.709> new<00:04:09.830> wood<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.340> sit<00:04:10.550> on<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:14.120> now<00:04:14.239> that

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
for the new wood to sit on and now that

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.210 
for the new wood to sit on and now that
I'm<00:04:14.480> looking<00:04:14.600> forward<00:04:15.230> looks<00:04:15.799> like<00:04:15.950> there's<00:04:16.160> a

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.580 
and this piece I'm standing on is also
kind<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:38.830> soft<00:04:39.069> I<00:04:39.340> may<00:04:39.490> replace<00:04:39.819> that<00:04:40.090> too<00:04:40.590> but

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
kind of soft I may replace that too but

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.249 
kind of soft I may replace that too but
you<00:04:42.039> know<00:04:42.159> it's<00:04:42.659> pretty<00:04:43.659> gonna<00:04:43.990> be<00:04:44.110> pretty

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
you know it's pretty gonna be pretty

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.839 
you know it's pretty gonna be pretty
easy<00:04:44.349> to<00:04:44.650> replace<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.099> center<00:04:45.400> pieces<00:04:45.610> the

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
easy to replace that center pieces the

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.760 
easy to replace that center pieces the
edge<00:04:45.969> pieces<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.689> are<00:04:46.810> going<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.620> be<00:04:47.740> a

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
edge pieces that are going to be a

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.999 
edge pieces that are going to be a
challenge<00:04:48.249> and<00:04:49.439> now<00:04:50.439> that<00:04:50.590> I've<00:04:50.650> taken<00:04:50.800> it

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
challenge and now that I've taken it

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.740 
challenge and now that I've taken it
apart<00:04:51.279> and<00:04:51.490> cleaned<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.150> up<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.479> doesn't<00:04:52.689> even

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
apart and cleaned it up it doesn't even

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.879 
apart and cleaned it up it doesn't even
look<00:04:52.870> like<00:04:52.930> it's<00:04:53.199> gonna<00:04:53.289> be<00:04:53.439> that<00:04:53.560> much<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:53.740> a

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
look like it's gonna be that much of a

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.769 
look like it's gonna be that much of a
challenge<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:56.560> plan<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:57.219> lay<00:04:57.370> in<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.849> new

00:04:58.769 --> 00:04:58.779 
challenge so the plan is to lay in a new

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.990 
challenge so the plan is to lay in a new
piece<00:04:59.819> and<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:02.770> glue<00:05:03.099> it<00:05:03.129> down<00:05:03.490> it<00:05:03.789> was

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
piece and just glue it down it was

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.899 
piece and just glue it down it was
stapled<00:05:04.740> with<00:05:05.740> these<00:05:05.919> staples<00:05:06.189> going<00:05:06.669> into

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
stapled with these staples going into

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.209 
stapled with these staples going into
the<00:05:07.000> stringer<00:05:07.449> I'm<00:05:08.319> not<00:05:08.529> gonna<00:05:08.680> staple<00:05:08.979> it

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
the stringer I'm not gonna staple it

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:10.589 
the stringer I'm not gonna staple it
back<00:05:09.400> down<00:05:09.669> because<00:05:09.939> I<00:05:10.029> don't<00:05:10.180> want<00:05:10.360> to<00:05:10.419> cut

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
back down because I don't want to cut

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.640 
back down because I don't want to cut
into<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:10.900> stringer<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.960> stringers<00:05:14.439> by<00:05:14.589> the

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
into that stringer the stringers by the

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.769 
into that stringer the stringers by the
way<00:05:15.180> feel<00:05:16.180> they<00:05:16.930> sound<00:05:18.389> when<00:05:19.389> you<00:05:19.479> hit<00:05:19.509> them

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:19.779 
way feel they sound when you hit them

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:23.879 
way feel they sound when you hit them
they<00:05:19.960> they<00:05:20.199> ring<00:05:20.469> they<00:05:20.710> don't<00:05:20.889> thud<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:22.509> I<00:05:22.930> you

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
they they ring they don't thud so I you

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.740 
they they ring they don't thud so I you
know<00:05:24.009> did<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.879> best<00:05:25.060> inspection<00:05:25.599> of<00:05:25.689> the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
know did the best inspection of the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.779 
know did the best inspection of the
stringers<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.289> I<00:05:26.349> could<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:27.490> think<00:05:27.669> the

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
stringers that I could and I think the

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.909 
stringers that I could and I think the
stringers<00:05:28.150> are<00:05:28.240> ok<00:05:28.599> and<00:05:28.839> the<00:05:29.409> same<00:05:29.589> thing<00:05:29.800> with

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
stringers are ok and the same thing with

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.019 
stringers are ok and the same thing with
the<00:05:30.009> transom<00:05:31.650> everything<00:05:33.000> everything<00:05:34.000> but

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
the transom everything everything but

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:39.230 
the transom everything everything but
the<00:05:34.300> floor<00:05:34.569> seems<00:05:35.110> pretty<00:05:35.439> sound<00:05:36.990> so<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.649> know

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
the floor seems pretty sound so you know

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.639 
the floor seems pretty sound so you know
if<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.419> stringers<00:05:40.779> were<00:05:40.930> rotten<00:05:41.289> if<00:05:41.500> the

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:41.649 
if the stringers were rotten if the

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:43.920 
if the stringers were rotten if the
transom<00:05:42.099> was<00:05:42.219> rotten<00:05:42.610> I<00:05:42.909> would<00:05:43.539> pull<00:05:43.810> the

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
transom was rotten I would pull the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.579 
transom was rotten I would pull the
engine<00:05:44.259> and<00:05:44.439> just<00:05:45.479> trash<00:05:46.479> the<00:05:46.659> boat<00:05:46.810> but<00:05:47.469> it

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:47.589 
engine and just trash the boat but it

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:50.969 
engine and just trash the boat but it
seems<00:05:47.830> like<00:05:47.979> everything's<00:05:48.399> it's<00:05:48.969> it's<00:05:49.270> ok<00:05:49.979> so

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
seems like everything's it's it's ok so

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.459 
seems like everything's it's it's ok so
that's<00:05:51.310> what<00:05:51.490> made<00:05:51.639> the<00:05:52.169> that's<00:05:53.169> what<00:05:53.319> makes

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:53.469 
that's what made the that's what makes

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.559 
that's what made the that's what makes
the<00:05:53.589> repair<00:05:53.889> worthwhile<00:05:54.219> so<00:05:55.000> anyway<00:05:55.479> the

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
the repair worthwhile so anyway the

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.029 
the repair worthwhile so anyway the
whole<00:05:55.629> reason<00:05:55.960> why<00:05:56.050> I<00:05:56.080> started<00:05:56.349> this<00:05:56.500> was<00:05:56.830> I

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
whole reason why I started this was I

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.540 
whole reason why I started this was I

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
figure out what to do with the back part

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.080 
figure out what to do with the back part
I<00:06:41.630> have<00:06:41.990> that<00:06:42.139> fuel<00:06:42.470> line<00:06:42.639> kind<00:06:43.639> of<00:06:43.789> held<00:06:43.970> up

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
I have that fuel line kind of held up

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.290 
I have that fuel line kind of held up
with<00:06:44.270> a<00:06:44.409> tie<00:06:45.409> down<00:06:45.909> so<00:06:46.909> I<00:06:46.940> have<00:06:47.030> to<00:06:47.090> figure<00:06:47.210> out

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
with a tie down so I have to figure out

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.210 
with a tie down so I have to figure out
what<00:06:47.449> to<00:06:47.509> do<00:06:47.599> with<00:06:47.690> that<00:06:47.840> back<00:06:48.020> part<00:06:48.319> and<00:06:48.590> with

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220 
what to do with that back part and with

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.600 
what to do with that back part and with
this<00:06:49.370> piece<00:06:50.000> that<00:06:50.810> runs<00:06:51.020> alongside<00:06:51.610> the

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
this piece that runs alongside the

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.219 
this piece that runs alongside the
stringer<00:06:53.060> down<00:06:53.539> in<00:06:53.900> the<00:06:53.990> engine<00:06:54.289> bay<00:06:55.000> I<00:06:56.229> just

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:57.229 
stringer down in the engine bay I just

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.469 
stringer down in the engine bay I just
simply<00:06:57.860> can't<00:06:58.099> think<00:06:58.639> of<00:06:58.729> a<00:06:58.789> reason<00:06:59.030> why<00:06:59.210> that

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
simply can't think of a reason why that

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:04.270 
simply can't think of a reason why that
would<00:06:59.780> even<00:06:59.960> be<00:07:00.080> there<00:07:01.090> but<00:07:02.090> I'm<00:07:02.210> using<00:07:03.280> just

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
would even be there but I'm using just

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.990 
would even be there but I'm using just
regular<00:07:04.990> Home<00:07:05.990> Depot<00:07:06.409> half-inch<00:07:07.039> plywood

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
regular Home Depot half-inch plywood

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.279 
regular Home Depot half-inch plywood
which<00:07:08.990> is<00:07:09.139> actually<00:07:10.659> about<00:07:11.659> a<00:07:11.719> twentieth<00:07:12.199> of

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
which is actually about a twentieth of

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:17.080 
which is actually about a twentieth of
an<00:07:12.409> inch<00:07:13.779> thinner<00:07:14.779> than<00:07:15.620> plot<00:07:16.039> than<00:07:16.340> regular

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090 
an inch thinner than plot than regular

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.029 
an inch thinner than plot than regular
plywood<00:07:17.330> so<00:07:17.779> I<00:07:17.810> mean<00:07:17.960> I<00:07:18.169> really<00:07:18.650> should<00:07:18.860> use

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 
plywood so I mean I really should use

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.439 
plywood so I mean I really should use
marine<00:07:19.430> grade<00:07:19.990> half-inch<00:07:20.990> mahogany<00:07:21.919> ply<00:07:22.449> and

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.449 
marine grade half-inch mahogany ply and

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:26.010 
marine grade half-inch mahogany ply and
I<00:07:23.569> should<00:07:23.779> use<00:07:23.930> you<00:07:24.080> know<00:07:24.199> SEPA<00:07:24.650> sand<00:07:25.069> and

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020 
I should use you know SEPA sand and

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.790 
I should use you know SEPA sand and
epoxy<00:07:27.639> resin<00:07:28.639> and<00:07:28.909> all<00:07:29.479> the<00:07:29.719> all<00:07:30.560> the

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 
epoxy resin and all the all the

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.219 
epoxy resin and all the all the
high-dollar<00:07:31.009> stuff<00:07:31.690> but<00:07:32.690> that<00:07:32.719> would<00:07:33.050> turn

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:33.229 
high-dollar stuff but that would turn

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:34.870 
high-dollar stuff but that would turn
this<00:07:33.409> floor<00:07:33.710> into<00:07:34.069> probably<00:07:34.400> a<00:07:34.460> thousand

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
this floor into probably a thousand

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.309 
this floor into probably a thousand
dollar<00:07:35.000> job<00:07:35.330> when

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 
dollar job when

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:38.469 
dollar job when
I'm<00:07:36.379> trying<00:07:36.680> to<00:07:36.740> do<00:07:36.919> it<00:07:37.089> looks<00:07:38.089> like<00:07:38.240> I<00:07:38.330> can

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 
I'm trying to do it looks like I can

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:41.050 
I'm trying to do it looks like I can
probably<00:07:38.599> get<00:07:38.839> it<00:07:38.930> done<00:07:39.080> for<00:07:39.259> 300<00:07:40.069> or<00:07:40.189> so

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060 
probably get it done for 300 or so

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.610 
probably get it done for 300 or so
anyway<00:07:41.960> so<00:07:42.020> that's<00:07:42.200> my<00:07:42.380> plan<00:07:43.090> this<00:07:44.090> is

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.620 
anyway so that's my plan this is

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.110 
anyway so that's my plan this is
actually<00:07:45.620> day<00:07:45.800> two<00:07:45.860> in<00:07:46.310> the<00:07:46.490> process<00:07:46.940> just

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 
actually day two in the process just

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.250 
actually day two in the process just
wanted<00:07:47.480> to<00:07:47.540> show<00:07:47.830> we<00:07:48.830> got<00:07:49.010> so<00:07:49.160> far<00:07:50.020> so<00:07:51.020> if<00:07:51.110> I'm

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:51.260 
wanted to show we got so far so if I'm

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.510 
wanted to show we got so far so if I'm
feeling<00:07:51.410> pretty<00:07:51.950> good<00:07:52.070> about<00:07:52.190> it

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 
feeling pretty good about it

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.330 
feeling pretty good about it
and<00:07:52.730> I<00:07:53.480> think<00:07:54.110> it'll<00:07:54.260> be<00:07:54.380> okay

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:58.340 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.040 

right

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.050 
right

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.680 
right
