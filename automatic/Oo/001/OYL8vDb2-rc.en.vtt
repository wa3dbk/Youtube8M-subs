00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:19.430
 Hello everyone, today I spoke to a boxing 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.340
 some clubs for you here only the 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.050
 different models some accuse me 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.359
 others to the customer is the other 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.710
 tried to assemble the machine so he chose 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.480
 the cabinet now choices so I 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.970
 I've tried some things but I'm in 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.030
 my suppliers and I'll show you 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.030
 you the characteristic of each one 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.150
 It will only be a separate video, right? 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.220
 get better organized 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:54.610
 initially I'll show you 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:57.620
 play the master ex-botafogo of the law but 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.620
 I particularly like this. 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.140
 cooler for both his design and 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.159
 quality itself 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.210
 here you can see he has it's all 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.509
 in acrylic to the black part is more 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.899
 dark the palettes a format well 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:24.700
 differentiated and it is with the 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:28.509
 of leds né, who's who on facebook 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.579
 that used 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.210
 who wants to take a look at the photos that 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.950
 stay on the computer 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:45.560
 I think a lot of people have four LEDs 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:53.780
 red is a high air circulation 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:56.960
 high flow rotation lot 800 2208 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:05.179
 good in the specifications here measures 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:08.149
 which led 2012 and 2025 thick is 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:12.050
 usually a standard thickness at 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.330
 speed from 800 to 2 thousand and 200 rpm with 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.630
 a variation of 10% 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.810
 the airflow 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.530
 is 34 points 0 2 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.920
 is a 100 cubic meter being 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.320
 number a compared to this one 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.980
 the wef 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:37.170
 the one that already has and even 63.7 only that the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.700
 rotation itself that is higher compared 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:46.350
 this model his noise is 38 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.830
 cybex in the case of that other here is 38 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:03:10.200
 but the best air flow is a pressure is 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:03:12.860
 of air is greater here and that consumption 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.860
 out of 5 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.100
 I already said several times it's a brand 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.700
 very good very trustworthy then never 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:34.790
 I had problem with a product much less 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.790
 here you can see he has 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:43.160
 first the screws and stainless steel chrome 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.200
 I do not particularly 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.600
 I'm too use a little spoon 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.880
 of the campinense are determined and 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.080
 Cabinets, you'd better have what to reap. 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.990
 together even more the machine does not Tuesdays 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.950
 these parties sure who likes to use 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.550
 you can put the supporting rubbers 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.459
 here he comes 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.840
 the manual is we all certificate of 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.709
 Warranty 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.650
 Right here for what I 'm looking at 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.889
 I think two years warranty 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.290
 ok and here the specifications and warranty 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:33.660
 here you have 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:38.130
 model snow dice with spoon bias 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:42.180
 mark and let's go to the conen itself 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:46.889
 how can you repair and len here gives 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.710
 to have a relative electrobra and the leds 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.910
 addition to large edson four leds one 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:58.290
 Here trac trac tank palette very 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:01.889
 pretty much put it with the connected LEDs 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.600
 and these curves in her are very 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.150
 pretty in the office 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.610
 the son is all black will not stay 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.610
 that camp with one with the wire 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.870
 colored and it is inter it my four 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.000
 children together 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.840
 remembering that you can connect it 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.300
 both on the motherboard with docking for is 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.250
 three or four pins will get a 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.090
 son out, that's okay 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.880
 some 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:32.160
 Okay, so this spoon I like here. 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.669
 much of it is very cost effective. 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.669
 good 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.720
 I recommend that anyone who has interest 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:44.430
 also buy can contact 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:47.220
 that I can also provide a large 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.550
 personal hug once again much 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.860
 Thank you for the feedback you give me 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.860
 videos né in comments 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.800
 today all around or comment 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:07.009
 I always received very educated people 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:10.169
 very interested and you're talking about 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:13.199
 did you like my videos 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:16.439
 I do not think I have an interest in 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:18.870
 say nothing in a hurry or hide a 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:20.610
 information that is good is good that is good not 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.749
 It's good to talk about what I think the important thing is 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:27.479
 is to pass on true information and 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:31.319
 the goal is to demonstrate with the 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.129
 people is what it is because this base 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.250
 Valley 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:39.860
