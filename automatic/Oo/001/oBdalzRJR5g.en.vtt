00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
weight is you know pulling it down you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.209 
weight is you know pulling it down you
know<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:46.079> weight<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.890> faster

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
know the more weight it's the faster

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.950 
know the more weight it's the faster
it's<00:00:47.340> gonna<00:00:47.399> fall<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> ground<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.510> forces

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it's gonna fall to the ground the forces

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.950 
it's gonna fall to the ground the forces
are<00:00:49.079> more<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.710> ball<00:00:50.030> than<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.420> you

are more on that ball than this one you
can<00:00:52.110> definitely<00:00:52.230> tell<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> difference<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
can definitely tell the difference I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.889 
can definitely tell the difference I
mean<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.059> gym<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.420> seven<00:00:54.750> days<00:00:54.870> a

yes<00:01:40.240> we<00:01:40.870> did<00:01:41.080> what<00:01:41.410> did<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.620> think<00:01:41.800> happened<00:01:42.130> I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
yes we did what did you think happened I

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.770 
yes we did what did you think happened I
feel<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.490> black<00:01:42.700> one<00:01:42.880> went<00:01:43.030> first<00:01:43.210> we've<00:01:43.630> got

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
feel a black one went first we've got

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.690 
feel a black one went first we've got
the<00:01:43.870> black<00:01:44.020> one<00:01:44.050> later<00:01:44.350> at<00:01:44.440> first<00:01:44.620> he'd<00:01:45.610> have

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
the black one later at first he'd have

00:01:45.700 --> 00:02:00.510 
the black one later at first he'd have
to<00:01:45.790> go<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.030> tape<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.840> did<00:01:58.930> you<00:01:59.050> see<00:01:59.520> they

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
to go to the tape what did you see they

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.890 
to go to the tape what did you see they
looked<00:02:00.700> like<00:02:00.790> that<00:02:01.120> pretty<00:02:01.330> much<00:02:01.420> land<00:02:01.720> at<00:02:01.840> the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
looked like that pretty much land at the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.170 
looked like that pretty much land at the
same<00:02:02.110> time<00:02:02.320> same<00:02:03.040> thing<00:02:03.070> at<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.400> same<00:02:03.700> time<00:02:03.880> I

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
same time same thing at the same time I

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.940 
same time same thing at the same time I
thought<00:02:04.630> it's<00:02:04.720> very<00:02:04.750> closest<00:02:05.260> place<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.440> basic

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
thought it's very closest place to basic

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.860 
thought it's very closest place to basic
in<00:02:06.040> it<00:02:06.160> it's<00:02:06.820> good<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.450> not<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:07.600> very<00:02:07.660> high

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
in it it's good so it's not a very high

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.419 
in it it's good so it's not a very high
distance<00:02:08.320> sorry

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
distance sorry

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.190 
distance sorry
they<00:02:09.940> haven't<00:02:10.300> really<00:02:10.540> reached<00:02:10.959> their

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
they haven't really reached their

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.470 
they haven't really reached their
maximum<00:02:11.350> velocity<00:02:12.070> yet<00:02:12.400> Oh<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:13.090> blackboards

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
maximum velocity yet Oh the blackboards

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.730 
maximum velocity yet Oh the blackboards
didn't<00:02:13.780> reach<00:02:13.900> terminal<00:02:14.050> velocity<00:02:14.260> wasn't

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
didn't reach terminal velocity wasn't

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.960 
didn't reach terminal velocity wasn't
enough<00:02:14.890> time<00:02:15.040> for<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.250> fall<00:02:15.490> I<00:02:15.700> would

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
enough time for it to fall I would

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.800 
enough time for it to fall I would
thought<00:02:16.060> it'd<00:02:16.150> be<00:02:16.180> like<00:02:16.360> with<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> different

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
thought it'd be like with a different

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.830 
thought it'd be like with a different
variables<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.410> um<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:19.090> like<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.510> one<00:02:19.660> had

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
variables like um so like that one had

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.070 
variables like um so like that one had
to<00:02:20.050> like<00:02:20.200> right<00:02:20.440> boom<00:02:21.270> here<00:02:22.270> whatever<00:02:22.720> break

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
to like right boom here whatever break

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.030 
to like right boom here whatever break
more<00:02:23.320> air<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:26.290> answer<00:02:26.680> is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
more air the answer is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.610 
more air the answer is
although<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.880> force<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.540> gravity<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.380> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
although the force of gravity on the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.130 
although the force of gravity on the
black<00:02:29.830> ball<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.250> greater<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.940> has<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> greater

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
black ball is greater it has a greater

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.949 
black ball is greater it has a greater
mass<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.830> therefore<00:02:33.070> greater<00:02:33.490> inertia<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.840> it

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
mass and therefore greater inertia so it

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.920 
mass and therefore greater inertia so it
requires<00:02:35.410> more<00:02:35.770> force<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:36.250> accelerate<00:02:36.520> it

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
requires more force to accelerate it

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.480 
requires more force to accelerate it
there's<00:02:37.930> less<00:02:38.260> gravitational<00:02:38.770> force<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.310> the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
there's less gravitational force on the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.910 
there's less gravitational force on the
basketball<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:40.750> because<00:02:41.140> it's<00:02:41.440> mass<00:02:41.680> is

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
basketball but because it's mass is

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.030 
basketball but because it's mass is
lower<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.790> has<00:02:43.060> less<00:02:43.630> inertia<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.320> therefore

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
lower it has less inertia and therefore

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.160 
lower it has less inertia and therefore
requires<00:02:45.400> less<00:02:45.730> force<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.209> accelerate<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.050> at

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
requires less force to accelerate it at

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.330 
requires less force to accelerate it at
the<00:02:47.380> same<00:02:47.560> rate<00:02:47.830> as<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:49.269> medicine<00:02:49.600> ball<00:02:50.340> let's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the same rate as the medicine ball let's

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.700 
the same rate as the medicine ball let's
give<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.640> try<00:02:51.810> three<00:02:52.810> two<00:02:53.709> one
