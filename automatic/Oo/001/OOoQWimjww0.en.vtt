00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.150
 My name is Mario Arias, I am your 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.070
 photographic advisor in art photography 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.860
 we have before us a declaration of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.000
 sound intentions I think because 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.440
 independently of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.720
 characteristics of the camera from which 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.570
 I'm going to talk shortly I think what 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.960
 there has been a turn of screw in the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 Japanese manufacturer and I think we're going to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 start to see and this is the first 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 soon other models will come that the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.370
 will follow a series of cameras with 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.110
 appearance of traditional reflex type 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.559
 translucent wings that there was up to 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.700
 now but with a bayonet system 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.890
 confident and based on the system the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.170
 mount is what lead all all 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 Nex cameras are obviously treated 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 of a hybrid without a mirror although the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.530
 aspect can be that of a camera 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.240
 traditional SLR or translucent camera 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.360
 from the manufacturer but what he has wanted 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.550
 do is incorporate the full range 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.079
 in this type of cameras this means 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.610
 that the crops are going to be quite 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.680
 lighter than we could have 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.900
 in the alpha mount and well 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.660
 somehow I insist that what 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.420
 we had in are and to date it was 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.370
 translucent cameras without a mirror but 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.950
 good with a reflex system let's say and 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.900
 there since you lack the system is a 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.210
 Danish disguised as a reflex camera 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.360
 word the model that is an alpha or 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.610
 antonio to master alpha and lc 3000 k is 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.050
 a basic camera of the ideal range for 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.180
 learn but with many features 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.490
 that I see it very interesting with 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.550
 with respect to the ones that the 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.280
 type competition with cannon is a 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.830
 sensor to psc of 20 million pixels 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.170
 whereupon how much resolution do I think 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.369
 let's get a resolution more than 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.690
 enough incorporates a processor 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.820
 we have house brand 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.570
 somehow this kind of thing other 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.340
 part of the general quickness let's say a 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.810
 quality in image processing is 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.570
 more than interesting to understand the machine 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.120
 it can work by making jpg files or 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.730
 raw and also incorporates another of the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.530
 things that is very interesting is the type 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.220
 of electronic viewfinder that you take a tweet 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.590
 high end finder 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.320
 quality in terms of the response that 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.870
 we see through it and with some 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.640
 way with a few more features and 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.010
 more interesting 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.330
 the switch button that does not 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.340
 I was watching I was trying 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.870
 improvise is upwards that 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.450
 commute between the screen and what 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.450
 commute between the viewer at eye level in 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.400
 the focus response is very fast what 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.240
 you can check with the acoustic piquito 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.470
 is that it sounds shot and the time of 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.900
 shot you see that it is practically 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.220
 immediately the camera as it could not be 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.620
 another way comes with a position 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.350
 smart automatic to be able 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.360
 use comfortably for those 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.850
 let's say fans who do not want 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.959
 complications of life but at the same time 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.030
 want to have more results than 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.560
 optimal and well in this type of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.930
 programming knows there is a 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.450
 recognition of the scene and the machine 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.069
 will act in such a way for a portrait 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.379
 put it in portrait mode 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.060
 a landscape by landscape mode etc the 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.010
 automatic scene control 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.959
 we have it in the scenes button itself 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.379
 to choose it I am approval 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.670
 automatic a more manual way and then 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.439
 without hard because it has all the 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.290
 Private options fixed speed 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.700
 diaphragm until you have all the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.230
 functions the focusing system is 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.700
 you said a system of approach apart from 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.519
 a fast is smart in such a way 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.599
 that allows me to keep the subject 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.329
 focused without needing to be neither 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.609
 if they electronically button so 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.079
 how much to take photos and videos 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.000
 clear that it is very interesting especially 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.250
 when there is action through 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.480
 quality of recorded video can not be 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.879
 another way and to our products a 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.650
 full hd which we see a quality of 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.329
 extraordinary video by focus 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.340
 automatic and with the possibility that 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:55.440
 keep the focus on this movement 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.540
 another function that will allow 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.980
 that is to cut the image in one's own 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.680
 undamaged machine without losing quality 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.330
 that attracts attention and is many times 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.459
 so grace the processors of the bronx 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.160
 that they carry are and how good it allows 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.700
 have these kinds of possibilities 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.050
 there are up to 15 effects of images 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.940
 programmed to be able to tell the 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.190
 sensor because I want the typical effect 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.010
 retro a selection 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.370
 selective color or the typical 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.720
 toy camera function and good is 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.960
 possible definitive in relation 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.160
 quality-price that is a machine of 399 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.600
 euros with what is sold with this 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.310
 goal for those photographers 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.840
 incipient want to start the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.969
 digital photography I see it very 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.489
 interesting 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.019
 in photographs of we have units 

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:42.209
 you can go see them whenever you want and 

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:43.319
 show online store as you encourage 

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:44.429
 buy it are your whole 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.869
 provision 

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:48.259
 I hope you liked it and until the 

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:48.259
 next
