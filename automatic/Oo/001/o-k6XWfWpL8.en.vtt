 You're in the Senate for speed. 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.460
 know what is happening in the world 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.000
 Welcome to the channel 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.590
 Dolabella today is friday day 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.640
 hot's week 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.430
 so come on, let's start this 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 I thought it was Thursday and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.390
 we put a video of our channel 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.410
 explaining and commenting on the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 what is sting is how does it work 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.270
 So if it's safe, then it's not safe then. 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.930
 You who have doubts about how it works 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.750
 but to take a look at the channel is that the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.780
 video explains how it works ooo 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.309
 steam engine and also yesterday 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.160
 started to add to the steam that is the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.440
 summer sales on steam when day 11 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.489
 from June until June 22 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.770
 I took a look and I thought the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.320
 business is not as good as the years 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.510
 but there is quite a good thing 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.909
 because I'm talking you do not have it for me 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.590
 not so good because some 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.760
 games that were on my list of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.030
 wishes 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.729
 they raised the price and then 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.040
 discount is cheaper than it was 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.560
 before but it is not that business 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.100
 so ours 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.570
 But there's a lot of cool and cheap stuff there. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:41.220
