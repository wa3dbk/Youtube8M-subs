00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.999 
don't get hit by the V I'm not forced to
block<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.930> swing<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.470> much<00:01:25.650> earlier

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
vicinity versus the x1 yeah it is and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.760 
vicinity versus the x1 yeah it is and
the<00:02:06.479> way<00:02:06.600> we'll<00:02:06.780> deal<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.380> will<00:02:07.619> do
