the<00:02:26.490> drawer<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.090> going<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.660> attached

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
the drawer that is going to be attached

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.260 
the drawer that is going to be attached
to<00:02:28.170> an<00:02:28.440> easy<00:02:28.860> way<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.130> do<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.970> force

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
to an easy way to do that is to force

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.210 
to an easy way to do that is to force
thread<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.709> dowel

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
thread in the dowel

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.580 
thread in the dowel
now<00:02:33.060> since<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.420> dowel<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.840> about<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.350> same

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
now since the dowel is about the same

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.070 
now since the dowel is about the same
dimension<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:36.300> can<00:02:36.330> do<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:37.130> just<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.430> this

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
dimension you can do this just like this

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.510 
dimension you can do this just like this
trying<00:02:40.080> get<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.470> as<00:02:40.590> tight<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.010> can

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
trying get it in as tight as you can

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.330 
trying get it in as tight as you can
now<00:02:42.150> I'm<00:02:42.270> going<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> cut<00:02:42.690> off<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.930> piece<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.560> I'm

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
now I'm going to cut off a piece and I'm

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.949 
now I'm going to cut off a piece and I'm
going<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.670> leave<00:02:44.970> about<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.989> half<00:02:46.650> inch<00:02:47.250> of

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
going to leave about a half inch of

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.979 
going to leave about a half inch of
dowel<00:02:48.959> remaining<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.430> gonna<00:02:50.580> mark<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.180> half

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
dowel remaining so I'm gonna mark a half

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.370 
dowel remaining so I'm gonna mark a half
inch<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:57.200> okay

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
inch like that okay

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.380 
inch like that okay
so<00:02:59.220> now<00:02:59.400> we're<00:02:59.550> going<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.700> take<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.970> other<00:03:00.000> end

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
so now we're going to take the other end

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.190 
so now we're going to take the other end
and<00:03:00.540> do<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> same<00:03:01.050> thing

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.890 

and<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:06.010> one<00:03:06.160> looks<00:03:06.190> pretty<00:03:06.430> good<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.660> all

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
and that one looks pretty good and all

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.190 
and that one looks pretty good and all
we<00:03:07.990> have<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.140> do<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.920> Mount<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.960> see<00:03:11.170> uh

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
we have to do is Mount it you see uh

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.780 
we have to do is Mount it you see uh
plenty<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.680> space<00:03:11.950> now<00:03:12.250> with<00:03:12.460> that<00:03:12.580> extra

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
plenty of space now with that extra

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.750 
plenty of space now with that extra
half-inch<00:03:13.330> for<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.350> hem<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:14.890> it's<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.520> simple

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
half-inch for the hem so it's a simple

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.310 
half-inch for the hem so it's a simple
matter<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:17.530> taking<00:03:18.160> this<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:19.200> finding<00:03:20.200> the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
matter of taking this and finding the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.380 
matter of taking this and finding the
center<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:23.170> tend<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.620> eyeball<00:03:24.100> it

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
center and I just tend to eyeball it

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.410 
center and I just tend to eyeball it
goes<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.510> be<00:03:25.600> perfectly<00:03:26.050> honest<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:28.060> eyeball

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
goes to be perfectly honest the eyeball

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
goes to be perfectly honest the eyeball
works<00:03:28.690> out<00:03:28.900> almost<00:03:29.200> as<00:03:29.350> well<00:03:31.200> now<00:03:32.200> I'm<00:03:32.290> going

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
works out almost as well now I'm going

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.310 
works out almost as well now I'm going
to<00:03:32.500> take<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.670> 3/32<00:03:33.670> inch<00:03:33.760> bit<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.240> drill<00:03:35.140> into

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
to take a 3/32 inch bit and drill into

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.980 
to take a 3/32 inch bit and drill into
the<00:03:35.590> down<00:03:38.250> now<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.280> noticed<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:39.700> when<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.750> put

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
the down now I noticed that when I put

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.300 
the down now I noticed that when I put
this<00:03:41.110> here<00:03:41.290> with<00:03:41.440> rocks<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.830> little<00:03:42.040> bit<00:03:42.130> that

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
this here with rocks a little bit that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.300 
this here with rocks a little bit that
means<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.610> have<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.620> make<00:03:44.620> sure<00:03:44.830> it's<00:03:45.010> flat

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
means I have to make sure it's flat

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.430 
means I have to make sure it's flat
there<00:03:46.300> we<00:03:46.480> go

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.990 

now<00:03:51.440> we<00:03:51.500> have<00:03:51.740> to<00:03:51.860> install<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.220> on<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.700> draw

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
now we have to install it on the draw

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.560 
now we have to install it on the draw
this<00:03:53.420> piece<00:03:54.140> is<00:03:54.820> about<00:03:55.820> three<00:03:56.210> and<00:03:56.330> a<00:03:56.360> half

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
this piece is about three and a half

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.930 
this piece is about three and a half
inches<00:03:56.990> so<00:03:57.680> I've<00:03:57.920> cut<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.280> in<00:03:58.430> half<00:03:58.460> one<00:03:58.910> and

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
inches so I've cut that in half one and

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.450 
inches so I've cut that in half one and
three-quarter<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.840> I've<00:04:00.470> drawn<00:04:00.800> a<00:04:00.830> line<00:04:01.100> down

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
three-quarter and I've drawn a line down

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.740 
three-quarter and I've drawn a line down
the<00:04:01.520> center<00:04:03.190> now<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.370> whole<00:04:04.580> thing<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.820> nine

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
the center now this whole thing is nine

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.970 
the center now this whole thing is nine
and<00:04:06.110> 1/8<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.570> distance<00:04:08.570> between<00:04:09.560> these<00:04:10.040> holes

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
and 1/8 the distance between these holes

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.860 
and 1/8 the distance between these holes
is<00:04:12.980> six<00:04:13.490> and<00:04:13.700> five<00:04:14.570> eighths<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.430> have<00:04:17.090> two

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
is six and five eighths so I have two

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.289 
is six and five eighths so I have two
and<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.080> half<00:04:18.260> inches<00:04:18.709> excess<00:04:19.549> which<00:04:19.880> I'll<00:04:20.060> cut

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
and a half inches excess which I'll cut

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.020 
and a half inches excess which I'll cut
in<00:04:20.420> half<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:20.959> make<00:04:21.620> one<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.130> quarter<00:04:22.580> I'll

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
in half and make one and a quarter I'll

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.080 
in half and make one and a quarter I'll
check<00:04:23.450> it<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:23.750> make<00:04:23.810> sure<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:24.880> did<00:04:25.880> my
