this<00:00:16.230> trainee<00:00:16.500> has<00:00:16.619> been<00:00:16.830> around<00:00:17.039> for<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> long

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this trainee has been around for a long

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.519 
this trainee has been around for a long
time<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:18.000> not<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> lot<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.080> people<00:00:19.350> know<00:00:19.500> about

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
time but not a lot of people know about

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.040 
time but not a lot of people know about
it<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.670> explain<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.119> me<00:00:21.150> how<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.390> works

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
it so can you explain to me how it works

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.200 
it so can you explain to me how it works
like<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.529> would<00:00:22.680> say<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.279> glass<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:24.119> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
like I would say it's a glass it's a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
like I would say it's a glass it's a
glass<00:00:24.449> tube<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:24.990> an<00:00:25.080> evacuated<00:00:25.560> glass<00:00:25.740> tube

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
glass tube it's an evacuated glass tube

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.370 
glass tube it's an evacuated glass tube
technology<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.420> little<00:00:27.810> bit<00:00:27.930> different<00:00:28.289> than

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
technology a little bit different than

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.550 
technology a little bit different than
your<00:00:28.500> flat<00:00:28.710> panel<00:00:29.150> it's<00:00:30.150> around<00:00:30.480> collector<00:00:31.080> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
your flat panel it's around collector so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.950 
your flat panel it's around collector so
it<00:00:31.830> tracks<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> Sun<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.820> day<00:00:32.850> long<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.510> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
it tracks the Sun all day long and it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
it tracks the Sun all day long and it
collects<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> heat<00:00:34.590> pretty<00:00:34.860> much<00:00:35.040> all<00:00:35.250> day

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
collects the heat pretty much all day

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.940 
collects the heat pretty much all day
long<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.820> opposed<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.630> flat<00:00:37.440> panel<00:00:37.680> which

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
long as opposed to the flat panel which

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.340 
long as opposed to the flat panel which
is<00:00:38.129> fix<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:39.090> midday<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> drops<00:00:40.170> off

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
is fix that at midday that it drops off

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.830 
is fix that at midday that it drops off
both<00:00:40.590> times<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.489> day<00:00:41.670> yep

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
both times of the day yep

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.139 
both times of the day yep
it's<00:00:43.050> capable<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.680> heating<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> water<00:00:44.430> you

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
it's capable of heating the water you

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.930 
it's capable of heating the water you
know<00:00:45.329> well<00:00:45.960> well<00:00:46.320> above<00:00:46.649> 65<00:00:47.190> degrees<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.789> we

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
know well well above 65 degrees but we

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.410 
know well well above 65 degrees but we
tried<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.210> limit<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> about<00:00:48.899> 65<00:00:49.620> 70<00:00:49.649> degrees

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
tried to limit it to about 65 70 degrees

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.119 
tried to limit it to about 65 70 degrees
the<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.690> works<00:00:51.899> you've<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.559> arm

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the way it works you've got your arm

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.920 
the way it works you've got your arm
you've<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.640> storage<00:00:54.210> tank<00:00:54.480> which<00:00:54.719> goes

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you've got your storage tank which goes

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.930 
you've got your storage tank which goes
on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.199> side<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> house<00:00:55.800> yeah<00:00:56.250> you've<00:00:56.730> got

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
on the side of the house yeah you've got

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.459 
on the side of the house yeah you've got
your<00:00:57.120> panel<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.629> gets<00:00:57.840> assembled<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
your panel that gets assembled on the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.799 
your panel that gets assembled on the
roof<00:00:58.770> you've<00:00:59.670> got<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> water<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.420> flows

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
roof you've got the water that flows

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
roof you've got the water that flows
through<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.320> pump<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> collector

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
through the pump out to the collector

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.729 
through the pump out to the collector
then<00:01:02.969> back<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> pump<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.500> try

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
then back into the pump so just to try

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.340 
then back into the pump so just to try
to<00:01:04.799> keep<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.570> try<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> warm<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> water

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
to keep the try to warm up the water

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
to keep the try to warm up the water
during<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> day<00:01:07.979> okay<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.150> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
during the day okay so what are some of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.160 
during the day okay so what are some of
the<00:01:09.450> other<00:01:09.600> benefits

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the other benefits

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.660 
the other benefits
now<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> water<00:01:10.830> gets<00:01:11.100> warmed<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.520> during

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
now all the water gets warmed up during

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
now all the water gets warmed up during
the<00:01:11.850> day<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.750> great<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.140> water<00:01:13.590> storage

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the day so it's great for water storage

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.249 
the day so it's great for water storage
the<00:01:14.159> benefit<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.659> doesn't<00:01:15.900> freeze

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the benefit is that it doesn't freeze

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.070 
the benefit is that it doesn't freeze
yeah<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.610> withstand<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> minus<00:01:18.720> 15

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
yeah it can withstand down a minus 15

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.460 
yeah it can withstand down a minus 15
degrees<00:01:19.409> without<00:01:19.680> freezing<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:22.350> know

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
degrees without freezing you know

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.070 
degrees without freezing you know
especially<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.670> Melbourne<00:01:24.420> environment<00:01:24.960> it's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
especially in Melbourne environment it's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.850 
especially in Melbourne environment it's
quite<00:01:25.320> cold<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:26.220> gets<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.610> below<00:01:26.880> zero<00:01:27.240> so

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
quite cold it gets the below zero so

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.039 
quite cold it gets the below zero so
breathing<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.240> way<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
breathing this it is that way it's that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.499 
breathing this it is that way it's that
that<00:01:31.259> problem<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.770> eliminated<00:01:32.509> eliminated

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that problem is eliminated eliminated

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.170 
that problem is eliminated eliminated
and<00:01:34.170> you've<00:01:35.100> got<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> controllers<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and you've got the controllers and the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420 
and you've got the controllers and the
components<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> built-in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
components which is it's got a built-in

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.969 
components which is it's got a built-in
antifreeze<00:01:38.939> system<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.479> well<00:01:39.659> okay<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
antifreeze system as well okay if the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.069 
antifreeze system as well okay if the
water<00:01:41.189> does<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.759> too<00:01:42.210> cold<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> pipework

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
water does get too cold in the pipework
