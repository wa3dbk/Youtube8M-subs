00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Welcome to a new photoshop 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.480
 video and today I would like to see you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.170
 the new export functions of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.360
 photoshop cc 2015 show there has become 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.370
 namely done a lot and photoshop 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.970
 now offers for all those 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.470
 many different levels have a picture 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.359
 and these separated 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.580
 many and want to export 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.529
 extensive functions and would say 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.480
 we start directly I show you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.010
 Just what I did 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.320
 I have a picture of the claudia here 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.700
 open and first of all I will 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.559
 duplicate that now 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.760
 just different ones 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.300
 possibilities to present here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.000
 can 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.520
 because that can be black and white why me 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.750
 this is what we call we'll see you soon 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.360
 will be here just once black and white 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.289
 Conversion make of it when on 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.940
 this level 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.070
 and we see we have those now 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.469
 background and the black and white 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.500
 level and also the background level dissolve 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.600
 It's called on the color just like that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.290
 What happened now? I'll go here 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.880
 file and go to save under here 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.220
 has done nothing at all 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.010
 You see this normal save dialog 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 he stayed the same as usual 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 But there is something new here 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.840
 export export entry of now 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.119
 much more things than that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.240
 so far and first falls around here 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.009
 this entry into the eye is fast 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.170
 export as png 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.210
 You can set that up for yourself 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.009
 you want to have it here and here at 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.560
 the export preset there we go 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.630
 once a short format for fast 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.420
 set export here we can do that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.340
 Simply choose can also say how 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 should export the quality of the fast 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.610
 his six it is here a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.170
 Transparency at PNG or what we do 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.420
 want to have here 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.869
 I read that she just png now 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.719
 click on ok and go again 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.350
 export here and which one quickly 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.880
 export as png from alternative if you 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.070
 you do not want to do this here 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.220
 now just here in the plane 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.340
 right click quick export as export 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.100
 png and now, of course, one also plays 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.930
 what we do here 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.580
 At level select we can here so 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.070
 just choose the color or the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.130
 black and white click here quickly 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.860
 export as png immediately it goes on here 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.330
 and you will see the name of the plane 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.710
 right here already as filename 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.780
 used and i could do that now 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.560
 just secure 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.080
 So I can also with the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.090
 make colors but there are still 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.900
 another possibility and show 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.980
 me now 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.100
 You can also export here as 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.260
 choose 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.170
 and if we just go here 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.480
 on it we come this dialog 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.300
 But here are only for now 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.380
 an entry how do we change that 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.440
 go to cancel 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.340
 and who clicks on both levels from this 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.570
 then right here export as 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.480
 get this same dialog now 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.650
 but again with both levels and that 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.560
 beautiful is we can now here 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.960
 click separately from each other and 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.090
 can also be separated from each other 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.390
 choose how the export should be 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.110
 namely in jpeg have stayed with color 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.770
 are ing 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:23.390
 but that should only be 250 pixels tall 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.420
 if I can adjust myself here and can 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.770
 then just click here to export 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.950
 I'll click these places 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.900
 export and the whole thing became 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.730
 exported and if thats easy 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.040
 times open again 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.180
 Here we see it is now once there 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.030
 white to black and white it should mean and 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.160
 color that one jetpack of the other pmg 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.470
 finally open because both and we will 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.740
 yes here's the color that it 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.980
 been reduced as png is white 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.130
 remained the same but a jpeg image am 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.710
 Use known export for web 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.040
 save under there nothing has changed 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.890
 but I think this dialogue will be here 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.330
 in the short or long term maybe even 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.650
 to be replaced here is one more 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.050
 few more opportunities you gave me the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.130
 possibility to select the slices so 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.400
 That's why it will certainly be 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.660
 but remain so for the basic 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.780
 export function, I now find the new 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.970
 in particular 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.610
 port as and fast export 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.830
 really a top thing that's fast 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.570
 that works without problems 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.910
 and I really like that very much 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.950
 I would like to know what you are looking for 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.419
 these new features keep writing 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.400
 it in the comments and maybe 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.840
 Just write me how 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.550
 your pictures are always so 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.290
 maybe there is still something exported there 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.110
 one or the other what I at my 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.750
 export can improve and if you still 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.130
 then you want to learn more about photoshop 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.070
 I definitely recommend you mine 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.830
 training photoshop learn from a to z 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.480
 now at around 1 and 2 the 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.310
 on the left, I'll pack in the video 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.800

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.000

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.270

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.380

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.110

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.360
 And besides, I'll show you here
