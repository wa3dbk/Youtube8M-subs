00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.100
 in automotive engines, a turbocharger with relief damper is used 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.600
 for better performance at low engine speeds and the best control 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.799
 high engine speeds and turbo pressure 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.980
 the term floodgate 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.699
 comes from the fact that with this style of turbocharger some of the gas 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.000
 exhaust is transferred through the gate around the turbine of the 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.829
 turbocharger and exhaust power is vented so that the exhaust energy 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.140
 it is not used by the turbocharger compressor to pump air into the engine 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.240
 The relief damper is a normally closed valve in the charging tube 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.379
 that allows a controlled amount of exhaust gases to be derived from the turbine 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.340
 when you open this erroneous gate valve mariela pressure of the turbo 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.420
 Charger with inlet air pressure in a desired range 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.010
 The air pressure of the charging tube is proportional to the speed of the motor 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.370
 with it full throttle as we can see in this graph 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.020
 if we want to increase the air flow the peak torque power we can use a 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.940
 higher capacity turbocharger 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.190
 however this turbocharger results in more turbo pressure of the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.730
 that we need and pressures and temperatures I decided not to exist 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.990
 nominal speed 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.980
 using a turbocharger that produces the desired pressure torque rate 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.920
 peak and that it reduces the pressure or relief to the exhaust gases of peak torque of 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.330
 The minal cityans achieve the desired pressure for the entire range of operation 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.210
 the motor 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.929
 the goal of a turbocharger 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.389
 with vent valve is to keep constant the power of the 

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:36.110
 payroll 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.370
 but that provide additional pressure sharia actor who stung 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.930
 A gate actuator mounted on the hx 35 loader tube controls the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.480
 position of the gate valve depending on the turbo pressure that 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.539
 receive from the turbocharger compressor housing 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.770
 the actuator 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.469
 is a container with a rod one end of the rod is connected yet 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.009
 bellows inside the container and the other end connects the valve 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.590
 I relieve an internal spring in the container apply the force to close 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.209
 the valve the pressure of the turbocharger applies pressure to one side 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.649
 of the bellows and try to open the valve 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.449
 this force is opposed to the resort and internal to the container the position of the 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.139
 Relief valve is determined by the balance of force and pressure of the 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.939
 turbo and spring force 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.919
 when the pressure of the turbo in the bellows is greater than the pressure of 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.949
 opposite spring the gate opens to let the exhaust gases derive 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.249
 of the turbocharger turbine 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.439
 When the pressure of the turbo decrease the spring close the valve
