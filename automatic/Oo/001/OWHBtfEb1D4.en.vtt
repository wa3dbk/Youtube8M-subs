good<00:00:00.269> stuff<00:00:00.420> what<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.500> problem<00:00:01.740> about

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
good stuff what is the problem about

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.630 
good stuff what is the problem about
eating<00:00:02.879> meat<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.540> dairy<00:00:04.529> products<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.370> mean

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
eating meat and dairy products I mean

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.059 
eating meat and dairy products I mean
for<00:00:05.910> some<00:00:06.569> vegetarians<00:00:07.049> may<00:00:07.290> be<00:00:07.350> aware<00:00:07.919> that

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
for some vegetarians may be aware that

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.890 
for some vegetarians may be aware that
that's<00:00:08.250> why<00:00:08.460> they've<00:00:08.730> become<00:00:08.970> vegetarian<00:00:09.690> but

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
that's why they've become vegetarian but

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.410 
that's why they've become vegetarian but
but<00:00:10.230> what<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.710> argument<00:00:10.920> yes<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:12.030> too<00:00:12.240> is

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
but what is the argument yes you too is

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.120 
but what is the argument yes you too is
that<00:00:12.719> meat<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.259> dairy<00:00:13.620> production<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.099> very

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
that meat and dairy production is very

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.740 
that meat and dairy production is very
intensive<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.000> terms<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.299> production<00:00:15.690> of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
intensive in terms of production of

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.960 
intensive in terms of production of
greenhouse<00:00:16.109> gases<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> fertilizers<00:00:17.789> that

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
greenhouse gases so the fertilizers that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.640 
greenhouse gases so the fertilizers that
they<00:00:18.060> use<00:00:18.240> release<00:00:18.539> nitrous<00:00:18.990> oxide<00:00:19.350> very

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
they use release nitrous oxide very

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.320 
they use release nitrous oxide very
powerful<00:00:20.100> greenhouse<00:00:20.220> gases<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> livestock

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
powerful greenhouse gases the livestock

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.720 
powerful greenhouse gases the livestock
emit<00:00:21.630> methane<00:00:21.810> directly<00:00:22.619> these<00:00:23.070> produce<00:00:23.400> very

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
emit methane directly these produce very

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.580 
emit methane directly these produce very
high<00:00:23.850> impacts<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.420> farmers<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.199> farmers<00:00:25.500> are

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
high impacts and farmers and farmers are

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.660 
high impacts and farmers and farmers are
really<00:00:25.859> important<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> after-hour

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
really important in the after-hour

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.910 
really important in the after-hour
countryside<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:28.170> protecting<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
countryside and in protecting the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.439 
countryside and in protecting the
environment<00:00:28.949> they<00:00:29.460> wants<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.000> do<00:00:30.119> their<00:00:30.300> bit

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
environment they wants to do their bit

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.999 
environment they wants to do their bit
for<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.689> environment<00:00:30.720> they've<00:00:31.500> tried<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> cut

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
for the environment they've tried to cut

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.920 
for the environment they've tried to cut
back<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.189> those<00:00:32.489> impacts<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.450> personal

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
back on those impacts but personal

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.959 
back on those impacts but personal
choices<00:00:34.110> also<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> role<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> play<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.880> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
choices also have a role to play so this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.729 
choices also have a role to play so this
is<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.270> about<00:00:36.480> cows<00:00:36.809> burping<00:00:37.350> isn't<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.649> this

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
is all about cows burping isn't it this

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.740 
is all about cows burping isn't it this
is<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> methane<00:00:38.399> produced<00:00:38.790> by<00:00:38.969> cows<00:00:39.239> causing

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
is the methane produced by cows causing

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.940 
is the methane produced by cows causing
this<00:00:39.899> huge<00:00:40.200> impact<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> environment

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
this huge impact on the environment

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.470 
this huge impact on the environment
that's<00:00:41.309> exactly<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.879> there's<00:00:42.120> something

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that's exactly it and there's something

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.639 
that's exactly it and there's something
there's<00:00:42.660> some<00:00:42.809> parts<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
there's some parts you can do about that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.529 
there's some parts you can do about that
with<00:00:43.890> technology<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.700> focus<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
with technology so we focus on in the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.869 
with technology so we focus on in the
report<00:00:45.899> improving<00:00:46.800> greenhouse<00:00:47.700> gas

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
report improving greenhouse gas

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:48.860 
report improving greenhouse gas
emissions<00:00:48.239> through<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> production

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
emissions through the production

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.690 
emissions through the production
improvements<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> problem<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
improvements but the problem is the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.189 
improvements but the problem is the
technology<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.270> only<00:00:51.360> take<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.750> part<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
technology can only take as part of the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.810 
technology can only take as part of the
ways<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.590> people's<00:00:52.920> own<00:00:53.039> personal<00:00:53.579> choices

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
ways of people's own personal choices

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.729 
ways of people's own personal choices
have<00:00:54.210> their<00:00:54.329> important<00:00:54.780> role<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.050> play<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.500> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
have their important role to play and it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.130 
have their important role to play and it
and<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.579> vegetarian<00:00:57.300> society<00:00:57.899> how

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and there at the vegetarian society how

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
and there at the vegetarian society how
many<00:00:58.559> vegetarians<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> think<00:01:00.059> have

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
many vegetarians do you think have

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.529 
many vegetarians do you think have
chosen<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.230> diet<00:01:01.850> because<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> effects

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
chosen that diet because of the effects

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
chosen that diet because of the effects
on<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> environment<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.409> how<00:01:04.559> many<00:01:04.739> others

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
on the environment and how many others

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.880 
on the environment and how many others
because<00:01:05.460> they're<00:01:05.700> concerned<00:01:06.090> about<00:01:06.650> eating<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
because they're concerned about eating a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.390 
because they're concerned about eating a
living<00:01:08.640> creature<00:01:09.170> well<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.710> find<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.250> our

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
living creature well what we find in our

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.890 
living creature well what we find in our
research<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.390> majority<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
research is that the majority of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.469 
research is that the majority of
vegetarians<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:14.280> become<00:01:14.760> vegetarian

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
vegetarians have become vegetarian

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.660 
vegetarians have become vegetarian
because<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.869> animal<00:01:16.080> welfare<00:01:16.470> reasons<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
because of animal welfare reasons a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.520 
because of animal welfare reasons a
number<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> others<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> Health<00:01:19.290> or

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530

because<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> environment<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.580> perhaps

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
because of the environment or perhaps

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.789 
because of the environment or perhaps
because<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.299> faith-based<00:01:21.509> reasons<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.560> well

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
because of faith-based reasons as well

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.219 
because of faith-based reasons as well
for<00:01:23.670> many<00:01:23.820> people<00:01:24.150> though<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.659> mixture<00:01:24.960> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
for many people though it's a mixture of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.039 
for many people though it's a mixture of
all<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> those<00:01:25.770> or<00:01:26.400> some<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.990> are

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
all of those or some of them so what are

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.800 
all of those or some of them so what are
you<00:01:28.110> suggesting<00:01:28.259> people<00:01:29.100> who<00:01:29.280> want<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.750> have<00:01:30.750> a

you suggesting people who want to have a
vegetarian<00:01:31.229> diet<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.829> should<00:01:32.310> they<00:01:32.340> stop

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
vegetarian diet do should they stop

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.429 
vegetarian diet do should they stop
eating<00:01:32.729> meat<00:01:33.180> obviously<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.170> something<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
eating meat obviously it's something you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
eating meat obviously it's something you
meet<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:34.950> effects<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.400> diet<00:01:36.060> should

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
meet with what effects do diet should

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.270 
meet with what effects do diet should
they<00:01:36.540> stop<00:01:36.720> eating<00:01:36.750> dairy<00:01:37.170> products<00:01:37.740> should

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
they stop eating dairy products should

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520

produced meat that's definitely a part
of<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> story<00:02:11.970> isn't<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
of the story isn't it

of the story isn't it
meat<00:02:13.180> substitutes<00:02:13.689> can<00:02:13.870> certainly<00:02:14.200> be<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.409> part

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
meat substitutes can certainly be a part

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.949 
meat substitutes can certainly be a part
of<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.010> balanced<00:02:15.519> vegetarian<00:02:16.269> diet<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.689> think

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
of a balanced vegetarian diet I think

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.539 
of a balanced vegetarian diet I think
the<00:02:17.049> major<00:02:17.319> focus<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.099> question<00:02:18.280> about

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
the major focus is this question about

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.210 
the major focus is this question about
dairy<00:02:19.239> about<00:02:19.599> cheese<00:02:19.930> for<00:02:20.200> example<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.950> milk

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
dairy about cheese for example and milk

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.679 
dairy about cheese for example and milk
some<00:02:21.760> people<00:02:21.970> don't<00:02:22.120> realize<00:02:22.239> they<00:02:22.540> are

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
some people don't realize they are

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.509 
some people don't realize they are
almost<00:02:22.930> high<00:02:23.709> impact<00:02:24.129> in<00:02:24.280> terms<00:02:24.400> of

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
almost high impact in terms of

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.670 
almost high impact in terms of
greenhouse<00:02:24.849> gas<00:02:25.060> emissions<00:02:25.090> as<00:02:25.750> meat<00:02:26.260> itself

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
greenhouse gas emissions as meat itself

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.899 
greenhouse gas emissions as meat itself
is<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.129> if<00:02:27.189> you're<00:02:27.340> vegetarian<00:02:27.489> for

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
is so if you're vegetarian for

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:28.860 
is so if you're vegetarian for
environmental<00:02:28.450> reasons

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
environmental reasons

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.149 
environmental reasons
that's<00:02:29.260> something<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:29.650> worth<00:02:29.799> considering

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
that's something it's worth considering

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.000 
that's something it's worth considering
as<00:02:30.400> well<00:02:30.720> that's<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:31.840> your<00:02:31.959> diet<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.680> use

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
as well that's what your diet is I use
