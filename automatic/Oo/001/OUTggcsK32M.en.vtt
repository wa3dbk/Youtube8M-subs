about<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.490> oven<00:06:14.880> it's<00:06:15.420> almost<00:06:15.630> like<00:06:15.900> we're<00:06:16.200> a

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
about the oven it's almost like we're a

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:25.790 
about the oven it's almost like we're a
bit<00:06:18.390> slower<00:06:19.190> now<00:06:20.190> it's<00:06:20.640> 10<00:06:21.000> speed<00:06:24.470> so<00:06:25.470> yeah

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
bit slower now it's 10 speed so yeah

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.010 
bit slower now it's 10 speed so yeah
that's<00:06:26.010> basically<00:06:26.400> it<00:06:26.820> if<00:06:27.090> you<00:06:27.240> know<00:06:27.360> any<00:06:27.660> more

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
that's basically it if you know any more

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.970 
that's basically it if you know any more
space<00:06:28.650> but<00:06:29.310> I<00:06:29.430> think<00:06:29.700> that's<00:06:29.970> all<00:06:30.240> of<00:06:30.270> them

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
space but I think that's all of them

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.620 
space but I think that's all of them
