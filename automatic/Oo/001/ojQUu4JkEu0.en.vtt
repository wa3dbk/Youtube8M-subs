00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.820
 drivers, good morning, I'm mars and bridges 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.910
 I write blog learning to drive and today 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.860
 We're going to give a really cool tip to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.480
 not getting into the wrong gear 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.689
 Look here, I'm going to go first if I 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.180
 going too fast will end up coming in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.199
 in the same way with the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.340
 second in some cases you pass 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.579
 too fast 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.219
 will enter the fourth gear because it is the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.559
 which is the backward movement here 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.550
 When you pass, is it going to happen? 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.090
 first 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.920
 The most common mistake is to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 third because it is very strong 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.320
 It goes very strong and ends up giving error 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.960
 So what's the secret to stepping on the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.620
 clutch to be able to cut the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.170
 communication between wheels and engine is 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.870
 It is the function of the clutch in the car it 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.380
 cuts the communication between the motor 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.150
 wheel when the engine taj as nando 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.950
 the greater the greater the turning speed of the motor 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.500
 then you can go to a march 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.130
 You have to cut off that communication. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.540
 all strong march on Wednesday 60 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.030
 time so to speak 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.049
 I want to move on to the second to reduce 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.439
 Monday 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.009
 You have to brake to reduce bringing 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.240
 gear speed range 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.240
 Monday 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.189
 and does this by slowing down to reduce 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.430
 velocity 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.590
 then weighing the clutch to cut 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.780
 this communication between engine and wheels 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.700
 is that the wheel will stop spinning not she 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.460
 It will continue to spin, but it will not 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.850
 receive the force of the motor just to 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.259
 you can pass another gear one 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.960
 reduced 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.799
 ok so then this is the function of 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.610
 clutch cut communication between 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.610
 motor and wheels
