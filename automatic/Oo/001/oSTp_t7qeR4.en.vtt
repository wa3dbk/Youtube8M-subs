00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello there is psycho arthur and this video 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.590
 from the game tips section 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.580
 a specific map here I am on a tank 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.800
 E25 most likely not even tank Fri-Sau seventh 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.320
 premium level but now talk 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.720
 never in the car about what i have 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.230
 lagging replay now doesn't lag 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.900
 so here's an NSC card always on my 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.630
 cardboard machines caused some 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.940
 problems that is, I did not understand where to cheek 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.760
 go on it because you go to the city and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.680
 convenient to shoot 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 you will go to Zelenka there should in principle 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 shootouts are similar to urban 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.770
 only born in the fact that you can 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.230
 get around by zero if you continue 0 and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.950
 you will not support this sense 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.820
 also 0 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.629
 as you see now on setup class 33 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.800
 chance of winning 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.539
 that is, well , everyone is just plain sad 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.650
 Are they words assure olenemetr have it 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.130
 topic for a separate video and by the way she 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.850
 coming out soon and I forgot to turn off the column 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.740
 not to understand 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.020
 in general, what I want to say now 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.549
 This position I came to is 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 These are 5 lines and this passage between gd 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.710
 ways and the city itself is 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.680
 perfect absolutely perfect and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.299
 universal to start the fight absolutely 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.509
 on any tank not possessing 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.380
 booking including suspenders then 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.340
 there is e25 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.039
 in such a situation when he 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.039
 albeit in the top of the list but frontal 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.950
 shootout can't take part 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.479
 as you see I did not go to the green and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.609
 it was awesome what a correct 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.420
 decision because there settled our 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:55.539
 couple hulk stage and all that is our 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.280
 a crowd of lords who went to the city 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.170
 I will try to come back now 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.209
 Hindu will frantically click on the fact that 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.069
 all the same 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.560
 base in the same place will be taken now 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.860
 little by little they really aren't right on pearl 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.950
 in this whole situation, move here 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.190
 i can hide my carcass under 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.250
 lumbago from enemy base and some 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.519
 time is still not much opponents 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.470
 I can restrain the onslaught 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.060
 those who take the gods well and try 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.430
 slowly beat down as you can see 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.629
 the capture counter is already inexorably ticking 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:38.650
 Straight in general, everything is sad and I understand that 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.630
 need to break in as we saw that our 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.890
 allies are already very close but as 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.110
 stayed 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.130
 in 10 seconds I can not just do not have time 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.760
 20 seconds 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:53.920
 slowly we bring down but now my 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.810
 zalet center base followed 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.849
 shooting opponents there turned out to be 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.769
 decisive because i wouldn't do it 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:08.299
 now perhaps the second case 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:11.090
 did not appear that is practically 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.390
 because of my flight to the base and 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.159
 knock down capture there after after withdrawal 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.109
 statistics sixty three sixty 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.420
 seven points shoot down capture my on 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.519
 my account 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.769
 as you can see we put a big here 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.549
 some opponents, that is, those who 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.280
 have come 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.310
 grab our base but this position 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.950
 universally not only in order to shoot down 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.930
 capture in the event of a breakthrough brilliant green you also 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.000
 can work well on 3 lines 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.000
 that is, on the minimap I can see 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.510
 now overlooking 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.780
 here we have a minimap ie you can 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.940
 see what the third line is when 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.310
 the boys will be leaving town here 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.170
 shootout you can with this 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.180
 or further from this point calmly 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.849
 shoot here 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.409
 By the way, yes, how convenient is our super 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.510
 skill boys with numerical 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.090
 advantage twice as cool as 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.739
 opponents are trying to finish them I can 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.110
 tell you how else to use this 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.940
 position in general, they straight thought about me 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.019
 when i was going to do this guide and 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.320
 actually here i am becoming 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.310
 both places and at some points 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.470
 cardboard and such as borsch or 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.389
 waffentrager auf pz 4 also leopard-1 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.880
 even 121 can work perfectly here 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.740
 later the only vulnerabilities the 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.050
 Cases can be that you 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.760
 will want to make some friend but 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.560
 usually if you are trying here 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.389
 crush something gets under cross 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.150
 fire or friend from town 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.820
 either sloupokov from the base plus you can 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.820
 intercept fireflies or drunkards started 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.340
 became on the light and with the help of stereo 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.990
 highlight kid who move but 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.910
 in case you have a fast tank dastin 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.280
 or you are just very close to it 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.300
 the place for the sharp in general is all that I am 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.200
 wanted to say about this position 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.639
 can also be used from 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.560
 opposite lisp there absolutely 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.260
 equally destination and as nsk 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.020
 practical mirror with minimal 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.580
 the differences 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.129
 in general, thank you all for watching 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.129
 subscribe to tv all good luck
