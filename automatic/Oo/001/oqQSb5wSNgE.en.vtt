00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.010 

the<00:00:05.220> circular<00:00:05.549> force<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.970> great<00:00:06.150> way<00:00:06.330> to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
the circular force is a great way to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.839 
the circular force is a great way to
work<00:00:07.230> through<00:00:07.529> all<00:00:07.830> 12<00:00:08.220> different<00:00:08.670> keys

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
work through all 12 different keys

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.730 
work through all 12 different keys
whether<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.240> be<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.480> scales<00:00:09.750> arpeggios<00:00:10.050> or

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
whether it be with scales arpeggios or

whether it be with scales arpeggios or
chord<00:00:11.070> progressions<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:12.480> main<00:00:12.660> reason<00:00:12.900> why

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
chord progressions the main reason why

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.629 
chord progressions the main reason why
we<00:00:13.080> use<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.410> circle<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.860> force<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
we use the circle of force and at the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.910 
we use the circle of force and at the
circle<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.150> fifths<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.630> because<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.500> how<00:00:16.650> net

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
circle of fifths is because it's how net

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.019 
circle of fifths is because it's how net
is<00:00:17.279> how<00:00:17.400> music<00:00:17.820> naturally<00:00:18.359> moves<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.170> force<00:00:20.029> so

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
is how music naturally moves in force so

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.720 
is how music naturally moves in force so
why<00:00:21.150> does<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.420> go<00:00:21.510> from<00:00:21.720> C<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.590> F<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.160> not<00:00:23.279> C<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
why does it go from C to F and not C to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.660 
why does it go from C to F and not C to
B<00:00:23.939> or<00:00:24.180> C<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.869> c-sharp<00:00:25.080> which<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:26.039> only<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.430> half

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
B or C to c-sharp which are only a half

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.790 
B or C to c-sharp which are only a half
step<00:00:26.880> away<00:00:27.000> main<00:00:27.840> reason<00:00:28.199> why<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.349> if<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.619> take

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
step away main reason why is if we take

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.259 
step away main reason why is if we take

that's how we get one our B flat major
scale<00:01:43.680> than<00:01:43.890> our<00:01:43.979> E<00:01:44.130> flat<00:01:44.160> major<00:01:44.580> scale<00:01:44.970> same

when<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.390> go<00:02:27.570> down<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.870> circle<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.380> only<00:02:28.620> one

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
when we go down the circle for only one

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.220 
when we go down the circle for only one
note<00:02:29.130> changes<00:02:29.550> between<00:02:29.790> each<00:02:30.180> one<00:02:30.390> another

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
note changes between each one another

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.630

way<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.380> work<00:02:31.590> through<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:31.860> chord<00:02:32.250> wise<00:02:32.430> is

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
way to work through this chord wise is

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.170 
way to work through this chord wise is
if<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:32.850> are<00:02:32.970> taking<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.600> major<00:02:34.200> chord<00:02:34.590> C<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:36.000> is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
if we are taking a major chord C this is

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.789 
if we are taking a major chord C this is
we're<00:02:36.330> starting<00:02:36.690> out<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.140> top<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
we're starting out on the top of the

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.550 
we're starting out on the top of the
circle<00:02:38.010> we<00:02:38.910> turn<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.239> into<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.600> dominant<00:02:40.200> that

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
circle we turn that into a dominant that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.979 
circle we turn that into a dominant that
turns<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.670> five<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.420> next<00:02:42.720> chord

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
turns in to the five of the next chord

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.180 
turns in to the five of the next chord
of<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> circle<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.310> c<00:02:45.230> c7<00:02:46.230> becomes<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
of the circle so c c7 becomes the

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.720 
of the circle so c c7 becomes the
dominant<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.820> leads<00:02:48.360> us<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.810> F<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:50.280> turn<00:02:50.519> F
