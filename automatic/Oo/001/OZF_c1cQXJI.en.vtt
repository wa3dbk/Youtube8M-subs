but<00:02:13.830> let<00:02:13.920> me<00:02:13.950> go<00:02:14.099> take<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> video<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.390> 1080p<00:02:15.870> so

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
but let me go take a video in 1080p so

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.240 
but let me go take a video in 1080p so
you<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:16.860> see<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.159> it<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.830> I'm<00:02:20.040> holding

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
you can see what it is so I'm holding

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.619 
you can see what it is so I'm holding
the<00:02:20.549> camera<00:02:20.580> with<00:02:21.090> both<00:02:21.330> hands<00:02:23.239> let<00:02:24.239> me<00:02:24.269> see<00:02:24.360> if

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
the camera with both hands let me see if

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.619 
the camera with both hands let me see if
we<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.930> pick<00:02:25.170> up<00:02:26.900> whoa<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:29.400> get<00:02:29.580> some<00:02:29.849> depth

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
we can pick up whoa and get some depth

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.600 
we can pick up whoa and get some depth
of<00:02:30.810> field<00:02:31.019> going<00:02:31.230> will<00:02:32.099> adjust<00:02:34.430> okay<00:02:35.430> there

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
of field going will adjust okay there

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.869 
of field going will adjust okay there
you<00:02:35.640> go

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
you go

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.210 
you go
so<00:02:36.120> depth<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.510> field<00:02:36.690> works<00:02:36.959> really<00:02:37.260> well<00:02:37.470> we

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
so depth of field works really well we

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.289 
so depth of field works really well we
have<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> hummingbird<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:40.010> over<00:02:41.010> there<00:02:41.299> okay

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
have a hummingbird here over there okay

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.089 
have a hummingbird here over there okay
and<00:02:42.810> let<00:02:43.170> me<00:02:43.230> go<00:02:43.349> down<00:02:43.470> there<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.860> take<00:02:44.069> some

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
and let me go down there and take some

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.210 
and let me go down there and take some

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:23.810 

this<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:15.860> my<00:03:16.130> um<00:03:16.390> rest<00:03:17.390> area<00:03:17.780> tent<00:03:19.000> all<00:03:20.000> right

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.760 

and<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.110> taken<00:03:26.560> with<00:03:27.130> my<00:03:28.470> galaxy<00:03:29.470> note

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
and this is taken with my galaxy note

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.710 
and this is taken with my galaxy note
holding<00:03:30.490> with<00:03:30.640> two<00:03:30.820> hands<00:03:32.070> it's<00:03:33.070> in<00:03:33.550> 1080p<00:03:34.120> so

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
holding with two hands it's in 1080p so

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.320 
holding with two hands it's in 1080p so
it<00:03:34.840> might<00:03:35.020> be<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> little<00:03:35.470> shaky<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:37.120> my

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
it might be a little shaky but my

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.450 
it might be a little shaky but my
thought<00:03:37.720> on<00:03:37.960> smartphones<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.800> you<00:03:39.370> know

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
thought on smartphones that you know

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.460 
thought on smartphones that you know
they're<00:03:39.790> not<00:03:39.820> gonna<00:03:40.060> still<00:03:40.420> be<00:03:40.570> as<00:03:40.810> good<00:03:41.320> as

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
they're not gonna still be as good as

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.560 
they're not gonna still be as good as
point-and-shoot<00:03:42.070> cameras<00:03:42.490> if<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.270> really

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
point-and-shoot cameras if you really

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.910 
point-and-shoot cameras if you really
want<00:03:43.780> some<00:03:44.020> good<00:03:44.290> 1080p<00:03:45.160> recording<00:03:45.700> video<00:03:46.920> I

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
want some good 1080p recording video I

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.210 
want some good 1080p recording video I
would<00:03:48.550> go<00:03:48.730> with<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.330> canyon<00:03:49.720> el<00:03:49.900> 300<00:03:50.590> HS<00:03:50.980> or

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
would go with the canyon el 300 HS or

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.350 
would go with the canyon el 300 HS or
above<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:52.060> think<00:03:52.120> they<00:03:52.420> have<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.950> 302<00:03:53.950> 310<00:03:54.850> HS

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
above I think they have the 302 310 HS

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.950 
above I think they have the 302 310 HS
now<00:03:55.570> 320<00:03:56.410> HS<00:03:56.770> one<00:03:57.070> of<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.220> two<00:03:57.400> anyway<00:03:58.300> but<00:03:58.870> the

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
now 320 HS one of the two anyway but the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.840 
now 320 HS one of the two anyway but the
camera<00:03:59.350> is<00:03:59.470> really<00:03:59.890> nice<00:04:00.160> camera<00:04:00.550> works

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
camera is really nice camera works

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.970 
camera is really nice camera works
really<00:04:01.030> well<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:02.170> video<00:04:02.410> actually<00:04:02.620> works

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
really well the video actually works

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.580 
really well the video actually works
really<00:04:03.250> well<00:04:03.730> as<00:04:04.540> shown<00:04:04.780> in<00:04:04.810> my<00:04:05.050> other<00:04:05.260> video

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590

showing you at night time testing so
it's<00:04:08.430> okay<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.670> mean<00:04:10.210> it's<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.750> smart<00:04:11.020> phone

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
it's okay I mean it's a smart phone

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.920 
it's okay I mean it's a smart phone
you're<00:04:11.500> not<00:04:11.530> gonna<00:04:11.740> get<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.460> know<00:04:12.580> as<00:04:13.090> good<00:04:13.780> as

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
you're not gonna get you know as good as

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.020 
you're not gonna get you know as good as
of<00:04:14.770> a<00:04:14.890> point-and-shoot

of a point-and-shoot

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.590 
of a point-and-shoot
but<00:04:16.780> it's<00:04:17.769> still<00:04:18.010> pretty<00:04:18.250> good<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.030> that
