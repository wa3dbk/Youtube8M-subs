this<00:00:49.710> cap<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.120> sight<00:00:51.300> which<00:00:51.390> was

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
this cap this is a sight which was

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
this cap this is a sight which was
designed<00:00:51.840> back<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.289> 30s<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.890> would<00:00:53.039> have

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
designed back in the 30s that would have

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
designed back in the 30s that would have
appeared<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.579> some<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.179> the<00:00:54.269> original<00:00:54.510> new<00:00:55.079> bow

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
appeared on some of the original new bow

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.189 
appeared on some of the original new bow
watches<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.300> crowd<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.629> screws<00:00:58.050> as

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
watches and then this crowd on screws as

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.259 
watches and then this crowd on screws as
well<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.280> aim<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.429> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.910> keep<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
well but the aim of this is to keep it

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.979 
well but the aim of this is to keep it
obviously<00:01:00.539> watertight<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.660> then<00:01:03.660> down<00:01:03.960> here

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
obviously watertight and then down here

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.149 
obviously watertight and then down here
you've<00:01:04.650> got<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.300> helium<00:01:06.300> valve<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.720> well<00:01:07.159> so

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you've got the helium valve as well so

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.130 
you've got the helium valve as well so
this<00:01:08.820> would<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.060> been<00:01:09.240> designed<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.780> use

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
this would have been designed to use

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.679 
this would have been designed to use
with<00:01:10.680> divers<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:12.450> deep

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
with divers going down to very deep

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.020 
with divers going down to very deep
depths<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.650> avoid<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> glass<00:01:14.340> from<00:01:14.610> popping

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
depths to avoid the glass from popping

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.030 
depths to avoid the glass from popping
out<00:01:15.180> due<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> pressure<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.560> builds<00:01:16.740> up

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
out due to the pressure that builds up

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.969 
out due to the pressure that builds up
you<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.119> simply<00:01:18.329> use<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.229> release<00:01:19.799> that

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you can simply use this to release that

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.380 
you can simply use this to release that
pressure<00:01:21.860> moving<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> trying<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> watch<00:01:26.390> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
pressure moving on to trying to watch so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.319 
pressure moving on to trying to watch so
yes<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.259> large<00:01:28.560> watch<00:01:29.000> but<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.149> meant

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
yes it is a large watch but it's meant

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.660 
yes it is a large watch but it's meant
to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.619> it's<00:01:31.619> definitely<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> talking<00:01:32.430> point

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to be it's definitely a talking point

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.060 
to be it's definitely a talking point
and<00:01:33.110> despite<00:01:34.110> its<00:01:34.290> size<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.649> does<00:01:34.829> sit

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and despite its size it does sit

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.020 
and despite its size it does sit
comfortably<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.759> 1,001<00:01:38.759> by

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
comfortably so here we have the 1,001 by

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.870 
comfortably so here we have the 1,001 by
u-boats<00:01:39.469> available<00:01:40.500> dural<00:01:40.829> watches<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.520> four

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
u-boats available dural watches for four
