00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
there was actually using the capo upside

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.490

this<00:01:01.769> allows<00:01:01.920> me<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.280> play<00:01:02.549> things<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.659> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
this allows me to play things like the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.640 
this allows me to play things like the
open<00:01:04.110> D<00:01:04.260> chord<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.769> instance<00:01:06.290> but<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.440> that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
open D chord for instance but with that

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.090 
open D chord for instance but with that
that<00:01:08.250> low<00:01:08.600> key<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> DB

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that low key right now because the DB

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.210 
that low key right now because the DB
comes<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.460> e<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> k-put<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.330> second<00:01:12.630> fret

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
comes in e when I k-put at second fret

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
comes in e when I k-put at second fret

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
indicator lights here and basically like

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.390 
indicator lights here and basically like
a<00:01:45.510> low<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> high<00:01:46.050> if<00:01:46.470> you're<00:01:46.710> too<00:01:46.890> high<00:01:47.070> you

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
a low and a high if you're too high you

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.850 
a low and a high if you're too high you
know<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:48.390> you're<00:01:48.870> really<00:01:49.050> out<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.800> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
know if you're really out it's going to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.860 
know if you're really out it's going to
show<00:01:50.040> red<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.640> you're<00:01:50.850> sort<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.600> it's

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
show red if you're sort of out it's

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.350 
show red if you're sort of out it's
going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> show<00:01:52.260> orange<00:01:52.620> and<00:01:53.010> if<00:01:53.820> you're<00:01:54.060> in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
going to show orange and if you're in

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.780 
going to show orange and if you're in
pitch<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.290> center<00:01:55.590> light<00:01:55.770> lights<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.520> in

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
pitch then the center light lights up in

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.510 
pitch then the center light lights up in
green<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.650> pretty<00:01:59.159> intuitive

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
green so it's pretty intuitive

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.270

easy-to-use<00:02:00.440> one<00:02:01.440> thing<00:02:01.620> I<00:02:01.710> liked<00:02:01.920> about<00:02:02.010> this

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
easy-to-use one thing I liked about this

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.940 
easy-to-use one thing I liked about this
capo<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.360> fact<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.840> has<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
capo is the fact that it has the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.630 
capo is the fact that it has the
adjustable<00:02:06.650> tension<00:02:07.650> control<00:02:08.220> here<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.549> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
adjustable tension control here on the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.050 
adjustable tension control here on the
back<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:10.140> adjusts<00:02:10.769> how<00:02:10.950> much<00:02:11.190> force<00:02:11.610> you're

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
back this adjusts how much force you're

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.899 
back this adjusts how much force you're
applying<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> spring<00:02:13.760> one<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.849> the

applying with the spring one of the

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.960 
applying with the spring one of the
biggest<00:02:15.090> downfalls<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.230> lot<00:02:16.409> of<00:02:16.560> these

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
biggest downfalls of a lot of these

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.800 
biggest downfalls of a lot of these

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
they're really super handy to use you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.840 
they're really super handy to use you
can<00:02:23.550> just

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
can just

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.490 
can just
drop<00:02:23.970> them<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.240> there<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:25.020> because<00:02:25.320> there's

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
drop them on there but because there's

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.190 
drop them on there but because there's
no<00:02:25.620> tension<00:02:25.830> control<00:02:26.900> sometimes<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.050> find

tension<00:02:34.140> control<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.000> can<00:02:36.090> adjust<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.750> to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
tension control so you can adjust it to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.050 
tension control so you can adjust it to

stuff<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:44.040> also<00:02:44.220> comfortable<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.910> use<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
stuff it's also comfortable to use it

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.110 
stuff it's also comfortable to use it
fits<00:02:46.230> nicely<00:02:46.350> in<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> hand<00:02:47.580> it's<00:02:47.850> kind

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
fits nicely in the in the hand it's kind

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.760 
fits nicely in the in the hand it's kind
of<00:02:48.180> grippy<00:02:48.630> along<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.990> top<00:02:49.170> here<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.620> that

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
of grippy along the top here so that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.250 
of grippy along the top here so that
works<00:02:50.580> well<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:52.830> can<00:02:53.010> use<00:02:53.190> this<00:02:53.430> as<00:02:53.990> as<00:02:54.990> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
works well you can use this as as a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.440 
works well you can use this as as a
tuner<00:02:55.710> when<00:02:55.920> you're<00:02:56.070> actually<00:02:56.310> que<00:02:56.820> pode

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.640 

it'll<00:03:00.450> register<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:01.050> there<00:03:01.230> because<00:03:01.380> it's

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
it'll register in there because it's

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.960 
it'll register in there because it's
working<00:03:01.950> through<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.160> vibration<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:02.880> it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
working through the vibration so it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.340 
working through the vibration so it
doesn't<00:03:03.240> of<00:03:03.330> your<00:03:03.600> guitar<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.140> really

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
doesn't of your guitar so it really

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.170 
doesn't of your guitar so it really
doesn't<00:03:04.530> matter<00:03:04.680> where<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.850> guitar

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
doesn't matter where on the guitar

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.550 
doesn't matter where on the guitar
you've<00:03:07.170> got<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.500> thing<00:03:07.770> flipped<00:03:08.100> on<00:03:08.310> its

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
you've got this thing flipped on its

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.370 
you've got this thing flipped on its
going<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.680> work<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.490> can<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:12.020> it's<00:03:13.020> telling

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
going to work you can see it's telling

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.850 
going to work you can see it's telling
me<00:03:13.820> that<00:03:14.820> light<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.090> showing<00:03:15.840> up<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.230> it's

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
me that light is showing up and it's

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:25.820 
me that light is showing up and it's
telling<00:03:17.160> me<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:19.520> I'm<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.580> little<00:03:20.910> bit<00:03:21.060> sharp

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.910 

it's<00:03:26.830> quite<00:03:26.980> sensitive<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:28.150> works<00:03:28.360> good

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
it's quite sensitive so it works good

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.960 
it's quite sensitive so it works good
like<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.930> when<00:03:31.930> it's<00:03:32.080> actually<00:03:32.260> que<00:03:32.590> pode<00:03:32.970> it

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
like that when it's actually que pode it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.630 
like that when it's actually que pode it
also<00:03:34.360> works<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:34.930> like<00:03:35.260> using<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:35.740> way<00:03:35.950> as<00:03:36.160> a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
also works I like using it this way as a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.160 
also works I like using it this way as a
headstock<00:03:37.150> tuner<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.660> can<00:03:37.810> just<00:03:37.960> clip<00:03:38.140> it

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
headstock tuner you can just clip it

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.040 
headstock tuner you can just clip it
onto<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.590> end<00:03:38.710> of<00:03:38.830> your<00:03:38.890> head<00:03:39.070> stock<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:40.050> go

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
onto the end of your head stock and go

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.450 
onto the end of your head stock and go
ahead<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.380> tune<00:03:41.530> your<00:03:41.710> guitar<00:03:41.740> as<00:03:42.190> long<00:03:42.370> as

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
ahead and tune your guitar as long as

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.890 
ahead and tune your guitar as long as
you're<00:03:42.640> as<00:03:42.850> i<00:03:43.000> said<00:03:43.210> before<00:03:43.330> as<00:03:43.600> long<00:03:43.750> as

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
you're as i said before as long as

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.470 
you're as i said before as long as
you're<00:03:43.990> roughly<00:03:44.620> in<00:03:44.710> tune<00:03:45.240> then<00:03:46.240> this<00:03:46.360> is

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
you're roughly in tune then this is

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.210 
you're roughly in tune then this is
going<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.660> be<00:03:46.750> fine<00:03:46.960> and<00:03:46.990> hopefully<00:03:47.650> your<00:03:48.040> ear

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
going to be fine and hopefully your ear

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.290 
going to be fine and hopefully your ear
is<00:03:48.310> good<00:03:48.490> enough<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:48.880> can<00:03:49.000> hear<00:03:49.180> if

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
is good enough that you can hear if

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.770 
is good enough that you can hear if
you're<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.480> whole<00:03:49.630> tone<00:03:50.140> out<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.710> tune<00:03:51.190> because

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
you're a whole tone out of tune because

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.050 
you're a whole tone out of tune because
then<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.870> got<00:03:53.020> something<00:03:53.320> wrong<00:03:53.350> right<00:03:53.880> but<00:03:54.880> i

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
then you got something wrong right but i

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.760 
then you got something wrong right but i
find<00:03:55.300> this<00:03:55.420> is<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.630> really<00:03:55.960> handy<00:03:56.230> way<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.410> very

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
find this is a really handy way to very

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.140 
find this is a really handy way to very
quickly<00:03:56.950> make<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.820> little<00:03:58.000> micro

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
quickly make the little micro

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.820 
quickly make the little micro
adjustments<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.990> make<00:03:59.350> sure<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.710> you're

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
adjustments to make sure that you're

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.040 
adjustments to make sure that you're
fully<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.370> tune<00:04:00.580> it's<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.480> lot<00:04:01.630> easier<00:04:01.660> than

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
fully in tune it's a lot easier than

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.010 
fully in tune it's a lot easier than
unclipping<00:04:02.770> and<00:04:03.100> or<00:04:03.880> unplugging<00:04:04.750> and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
unclipping and or unplugging and

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.060 
unclipping and or unplugging and
plugging<00:04:05.950> into<00:04:06.490> a<00:04:06.580> tuner<00:04:07.000> or<00:04:07.320> grabbing<00:04:08.320> you

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
plugging into a tuner or grabbing you

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.260 
plugging into a tuner or grabbing you
know<00:04:09.160> one<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.340> those<00:04:09.490> other<00:04:09.730> tuners<00:04:10.120> that

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
know one of those other tuners that

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.400 
know one of those other tuners that
relies<00:04:10.540> on<00:04:10.570> sound<00:04:11.190> because<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:13.540> works<00:04:14.170> when

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
relies on sound because this works when

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.039 
relies on sound because this works when
there's<00:04:14.760> other<00:04:15.760> other<00:04:16.150> sounds<00:04:16.630> happening

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
there's other other sounds happening

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.380 
there's other other sounds happening
around<00:04:17.200> you<00:04:17.560> because<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:17.920> works<00:04:18.100> off<00:04:18.280> the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
around you because it works off the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.370 
around you because it works off the
vibrations<00:04:19.390> of<00:04:19.540> your<00:04:19.690> guitar<00:04:19.989> not<00:04:20.170> the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
vibrations of your guitar not the

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.880 
vibrations of your guitar not the
audible<00:04:20.980> sound<00:04:21.190> waves<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:22.390> that's<00:04:22.570> cool<00:04:22.890> it's

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
audible sound waves so that's cool it's

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.460 
audible sound waves so that's cool it's
got<00:04:24.040> a<00:04:24.070> little<00:04:24.160> on-off<00:04:24.580> button<00:04:24.790> at<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.030> top

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
got a little on-off button at the top

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.570 
got a little on-off button at the top
you<00:04:26.470> probably<00:04:26.740> can't<00:04:26.950> see<00:04:27.010> that<00:04:27.250> is<00:04:27.370> quite

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
you probably can't see that is quite

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.410 
you probably can't see that is quite
small<00:04:27.760> but<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:30.370> thing<00:04:30.550> also<00:04:30.850> turns<00:04:31.090> itself

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
small but the thing also turns itself

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.590 
small but the thing also turns itself
off<00:04:31.660> automatically<00:04:32.530> after<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.920> few<00:04:33.130> minutes<00:04:33.600> in

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
off automatically after a few minutes in

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.510 
off automatically after a few minutes in
case<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.960> gets<00:04:35.050> bumped<00:04:35.470> or<00:04:35.650> if<00:04:35.920> you<00:04:36.040> forget<00:04:36.370> or

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
case it gets bumped or if you forget or

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.640 
case it gets bumped or if you forget or
something<00:04:36.820> like<00:04:36.910> that<00:04:36.970> so<00:04:37.150> it's<00:04:37.450> pretty<00:04:38.260> handy

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
something like that so it's pretty handy

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.990 
something like that so it's pretty handy
overall<00:04:39.040> I<00:04:39.070> really<00:04:39.190> like<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.640> thing<00:04:39.820> actually

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
overall I really like the thing actually

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.370 
overall I really like the thing actually
I've<00:04:40.210> been<00:04:40.300> using<00:04:40.480> it<00:04:40.720> for<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.900> few<00:04:41.050> weeks<00:04:41.200> now

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
I've been using it for a few weeks now

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.930 
I've been using it for a few weeks now
and<00:04:43.530> it's<00:04:44.530> kind<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:44.890> turned<00:04:45.160> into<00:04:45.340> my<00:04:45.610> tuner

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
and it's kind of turned into my tuner

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.030 
and it's kind of turned into my tuner
because<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.330> can<00:04:46.510> tune<00:04:46.720> by<00:04:46.900> ear<00:04:46.930> pretty<00:04:47.770> close

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
because I can tune by ear pretty close

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.620 
because I can tune by ear pretty close
and<00:04:48.250> then<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.400> use<00:04:48.580> this<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:48.970> just<00:04:49.120> tweak<00:04:49.390> things

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
and then I use this to just tweak things

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.860 
and then I use this to just tweak things
and<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:51.640> it's<00:04:51.850> been<00:04:51.940> fun<00:04:52.180> experimenting<00:04:52.660> with
