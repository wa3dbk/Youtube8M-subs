00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.500
 little hand up and there is some doubt 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.390
 question remember to comment down on 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.610

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.089
 I answer so I hope that the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.089
 enjoy 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.740
 The first thing we should do is melt 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.080
 our butter once it 's in 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.630
 the temperature that we can tolerate in 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.450
 hands are going to incorporate the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.130
 cookie 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.469
 we have to be very careful not 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.930
 we can use a lot of butter 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.659
 because if not our 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.759
 Frost is not going to be crispy like 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.789
 we want after having added the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.429
 butter we add sugar as you know 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.319
 that our cross is network and simply 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.420
 we press a little bit like the fist of 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.960
 the hand and if we see that it is compact 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.340
 perfectly without looking very wet 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.159
 then it would be perfect 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.060
 in a mold prepared with paper 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.280
 bake and tam space or butter let's go 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.219
 to put our cookie in the background 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.000
 pressing with our hands until 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:00.450
 it is completely clear the thickness of 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.120
 the cross you want to see it is at your 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.630
 discretion 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.810
 once in our game is already 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.150
 completely at the bottom of our 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.930
 furniture we are going to put in the oven 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.430
 preheated to 350 degrees fahrenheit by 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.430
 approximately 5 minutes 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.990
 for the mini cheesecake simply 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.200
 you would need a mold of cupcakes 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.670
 little papers or cupcake lakers and 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.370
 we repeat the step 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.950
 of the big mold putting it in the background 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.650
 pressing with our fingers now to 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 when baking we must have a 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.030
 a little more of care because they are more 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.780
 small so maybe he takes them from 3 to 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.780
 4 minutes 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.480
 in the container of our blender 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.580
 we place the cream cheese 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.980
 this cream cheese was at temperature 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.709
 environment approximately 30 to 40 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.049
 minutes and this helps you to be more 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.049
 soft at the time of cream 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.750
 we added the star cream we were going to leave 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.959
 Mix until it becomes a mixture 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.959
 homogeneous 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.280
 with our blender at slow speed 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.280
 we will add the sugar little by little 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.840
 with a spatula we will go scraping the 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.840
 borders 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.200
 we had our blender at speed 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.200
 half 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.740
 this is the moment in which we are going to 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.670
 add the flavors in this case I'm 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.010
 using vanilla and I always me 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.870
 I always like to throw a grated 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.660
 lemon in this case I used 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.440
 just like a quarter teaspoon 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.440
 of lemon zest 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.250
 we beat our mixture well in case there is 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.920
 some type of chromium can 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.280
 perfectly incorporated into the mixture 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.520
 then we add at slow speed the 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.710
 flour little by little 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.680
 once we have incorporated the flour 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.520
 we add the milk little by little to 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.520
 slow speed 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.110
 we beat until our mixture is 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.110
 totally homogeneous 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.240
 we add the eggs one by one to 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.520
 slow speed and here we have to have 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.410
 a little bit of care since not 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.800
 we want truth about beating our 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.680
 mix this gives you air and time 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.410
 baking can make cracks 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.470
 our joke and it will not look so 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.300
 pretty so once our eggs 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.920
 are well incorporated into the mixture 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.920
 we just turn off 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.659
 and what remains to be done and our 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:18.370
 mold prepared with our the already 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:21.270
 baked we're going to put the mixture in the 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.529
 mold and we're going to take it to the oven for 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.099
 approximately 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:29.709
 40 45 minutes or until inserted is a 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:34.559
 stick and it 's completely clean this 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:34.559
 it's going to be 350 degrees fahrenheit 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:41.969
 and for our mini cakes we are going to 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:45.300
 put our mixture in a container 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:48.749
 then it becomes easy to incorporate it into 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.360
 the lakers or the mold of cupcakes and in 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:55.289
 this case we're going to bake for 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.119
 approximately 12 to 15 minutes until 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:00.689
 that insert is a stick and leave 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:03.619
 completely clean also at 350 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.619
 fahrenheit degrees 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.150
 to decorate your cheesecake you can 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:12.050
 use your creativity and any type 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.580
 of this is either chocolate jam 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:18.840
 me in my case I'm using cream 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:22.110
 whipped and strawberries to decorate in my case 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:27.090
 and that strawberry that half to cover 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:30.180
 completely the cheesecake of strawberries and 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.610
 then I made some ribbons or some edges 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:36.000
 in whipped cream like a pastry bag 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:38.800
 with a star tip to decorate 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.710
 so that it will look prettier 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.780
 and here in my final result of 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.240
 big cheesecake 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.850
 for the small cheesecake simply 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.210
 uses the same sleeve the same cream and 

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.919
 use one half of a strawberry and the 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.770
 apply half or a quarter of 

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:58.090
 strawberry to decorate I hope you have 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:03.270
