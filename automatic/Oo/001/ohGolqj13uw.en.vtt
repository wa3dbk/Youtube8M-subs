this<00:06:09.370> I<00:06:09.900> was<00:06:10.900> an<00:06:11.020> idea<00:06:11.350> i<00:06:11.410> actually<00:06:11.919> had<00:06:12.100> a

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
this I was an idea i actually had a

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.580 
this I was an idea i actually had a
while<00:06:12.970> ago<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:13.390> I<00:06:13.480> sure<00:06:13.660> a<00:06:13.690> lot<00:06:13.900> of<00:06:13.960> people<00:06:14.050> did

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
while ago and I sure a lot of people did

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.650 
while ago and I sure a lot of people did
where<00:06:15.460> you<00:06:15.669> kind<00:06:15.910> of<00:06:15.970> wish<00:06:16.180> that<00:06:16.240> you<00:06:16.600> could

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
where you kind of wish that you could

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.330 
where you kind of wish that you could
take<00:06:16.930> a<00:06:16.960> picture<00:06:17.530> a<00:06:17.560> new<00:06:17.860> front<00:06:18.100> and<00:06:18.220> back

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
take a picture a new front and back

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.000 
take a picture a new front and back
camera<00:06:18.760> at<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:18.910> same<00:06:19.270> time<00:06:19.570> so<00:06:20.500> people<00:06:20.710> can

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
camera at the same time so people can

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.909 
camera at the same time so people can
see<00:06:21.040> you<00:06:21.550> and<00:06:21.760> what<00:06:21.940> you're<00:06:22.120> seeing<00:06:22.419> I<00:06:22.840> need<00:06:23.770> to

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
see you and what you're seeing I need to

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.850 
see you and what you're seeing I need to
change<00:06:24.130> this<00:06:24.370> paper<00:06:24.730> this<00:06:25.660> app<00:06:25.990> is<00:06:26.230> kind<00:06:26.620> of

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
change this paper this app is kind of

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.800 
change this paper this app is kind of
like<00:06:27.100> that<00:06:27.550> but<00:06:27.850> you<00:06:28.150> take<00:06:28.390> them<00:06:28.630> both

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
like that but you take them both

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.500 
like that but you take them both
separately<00:06:29.110> so<00:06:29.680> I<00:06:29.740> guess<00:06:29.950> there's<00:06:30.220> no<00:06:30.510> ability

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
separately so I guess there's no ability

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.420 
separately so I guess there's no ability
to<00:06:31.720> do<00:06:31.960> that<00:06:32.200> yet<00:06:32.500> but<00:06:32.740> I<00:06:32.800> think<00:06:33.160> they'll<00:06:33.310> be

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
to do that yet but I think they'll be

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.600 
to do that yet but I think they'll be
the<00:06:33.550> first<00:06:33.580> to<00:06:33.970> do<00:06:34.090> it<00:06:34.120> if<00:06:34.900> if<00:06:35.500> it<00:06:35.680> does<00:06:35.890> bright

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
the first to do it if if it does bright

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.060 
the first to do it if if it does bright
nest<00:06:36.910> and<00:06:37.289> good<00:06:38.289> housekeeping

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
nest and good housekeeping

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.820 
nest and good housekeeping
