00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.990
 speak the tongue fisherman beauty in the river of 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.059
 Today I'm going to show you how to spend 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.300
 annual steel cable 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:22.609
 we will need a fishing plier from 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.539
 draws a spinner compatible with the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.609
 set 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.150
 in this case I will use the usual 12 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:33.170
 0 bars and a 120-pound steel cable 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:40.070
 It's about 32 centimeters and we're going 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:45.190
 also use two 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:51.020
 steel cable connection puts glove 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:53.290
 the generator passes the steel cable in the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.290
 connection 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.310
 I cough about one 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.310
 centimeter only 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:21.890
 and passes through the connection sleeve 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:39.270
 an inch also from the generator 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.310
 the pliers 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.310
 let's use it to adapt 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.430
 and 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.410
 the cutting part of the pliers let 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:09.789
 use to finish 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:10.630
 reinforcement and we repeat the same thing 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.800
 other side 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.800
 connecting student 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.220
 the hook 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.360
 cough the tip of the steel cable 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.210
 goes through the connecting moon 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:02.470
 leaves nothing left because it can 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:02.470
 disrupt fishing and pulls 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.380
 careful not to be hooked 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:26.410
 and again tighten using the pliers and 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.980
 makes the reinforcement with the cutting part of 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.980
 Ricardinho 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.300
 our tied steel cable is ready 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.700
 that's it, that's ok 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.760
 ah
