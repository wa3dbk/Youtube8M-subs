00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
you got to be careful with that because

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.040 
you got to be careful with that because
that<00:02:15.240> could<00:02:15.330> be<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> trap

that could be a trap

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.660 
that could be a trap
you<00:02:16.140> know<00:02:16.230> let's<00:02:16.500> say<00:02:16.620> you're<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.950> job<00:02:17.280> and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
you know let's say you're in a job and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.790 
you know let's say you're in a job and
you<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.390> if<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.540> work<00:02:18.900> harder<00:02:19.530> you'll

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
make more money not necessarily you

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.900 
make more money not necessarily you
might<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.530> get<00:02:22.710> more<00:02:22.950> stressed<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.670> end<00:02:23.820> up

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
might just get more stressed and end up

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.250 
might just get more stressed and end up
staying<00:02:24.090> later<00:02:24.360> nights<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.870> being<00:02:25.020> away<00:02:25.200> from

your<00:02:25.470> family<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.640> might<00:02:26.850> all<00:02:27.240> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
your family and you might all the

overtime that you make if you do get
paid<00:02:29.190> overtime<00:02:29.490> will<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.600> end<00:02:30.780> up<00:02:30.840> going<00:02:31.020> to

everything you start to use less you

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.050 
everything you start to use less you
start<00:05:09.599> to<00:05:09.720> eat<00:05:09.870> less<00:05:10.259> you<00:05:10.650> start<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:12.030> know

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
start to eat less you start to you know

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.600

drive less you start to spend less

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.480 
drive less you start to spend less
because<00:05:15.539> you<00:05:15.720> have<00:05:15.900> more<00:05:16.169> than<00:05:16.349> enough<00:05:16.490> it's

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
because you have more than enough it's

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.189 
because you have more than enough it's
so<00:05:17.699> it's<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:18.090> weird<00:05:18.360> way<00:05:18.509> to<00:05:18.570> think<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.930> it<00:05:19.050> but

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
so it's a weird way to think of it but

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.230 
so it's a weird way to think of it but
then<00:05:19.349> that's<00:05:19.560> been<00:05:19.800> my<00:05:19.979> experience<00:05:20.099> that<00:05:20.699> you

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
then that's been my experience that you

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.180 
then that's been my experience that you
actually<00:05:21.870> spend<00:05:22.349> less<00:05:22.590> than<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.949> earn

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
actually spend less than you earn

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.950 
actually spend less than you earn
because<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.759> already<00:05:23.940> feel<00:05:24.300> abundant<00:05:24.630> but

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
because you already feel abundant but

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.999 
because you already feel abundant but
that's<00:05:25.139> the<00:05:25.289> starting<00:05:25.560> point<00:05:25.650> you<00:05:25.770> got<00:05:25.919> to

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
that's the starting point you got to

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.219 
that's the starting point you got to
feel<00:05:26.130> about<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.460> first<00:05:26.639> and<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.630> sixth<00:05:28.050> sign

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
feel about it first and the sixth sign

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.110 
feel about it first and the sixth sign
that<00:05:28.440> you're<00:05:28.620> just<00:05:28.889> really<00:05:29.520> trying<00:05:29.849> too<00:05:30.090> hard

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
that you're just really trying too hard

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.149 
that you're just really trying too hard
to<00:05:30.360> manifest<00:05:30.659> money<00:05:30.960> I<00:05:31.199> think<00:05:31.979> you're<00:05:32.070> not

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
to manifest money I think you're not

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.070
