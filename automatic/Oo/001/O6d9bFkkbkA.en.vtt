like I said the retention on this was a

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.089

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
little hit and miss sometimes it was

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.740 
little hit and miss sometimes it was
okay<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.209> was<00:04:18.269> never<00:04:18.630> like<00:04:19.620> this<00:04:19.859> one<00:04:20.099> is<00:04:20.280> now

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
okay it was never like this one is now

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.570 
okay it was never like this one is now
but<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.900> retention<00:04:22.289> on<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.710> one<00:04:22.889> was<00:04:23.099> a

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
but the retention on this one was a

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.500 
but the retention on this one was a
little<00:04:24.300> weak<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:25.169> begin<00:04:25.410> with<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:26.479> honestly<00:04:27.479> I

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
little weak to begin with and honestly I

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.710 
little weak to begin with and honestly I
think<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:28.110> because<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.770> may<00:04:28.919> have<00:04:29.039> been

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
think it's just because it may have been

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.480 
think it's just because it may have been
customers<00:04:30.720> checking<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.409> out<00:04:31.530> because<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:32.280> mean

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
customers checking it out because I mean

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.219 
customers checking it out because I mean
who<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.240> heck<00:04:33.390> wouldn't<00:04:33.690> want<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.900> check<00:04:34.080> out

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229
