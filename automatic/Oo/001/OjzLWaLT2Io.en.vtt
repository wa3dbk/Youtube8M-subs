00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.839 

well<00:00:11.429> if<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.639> deal<00:00:11.820> with<00:00:11.849> pace<00:00:12.719> first<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.849> used

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
well if we deal with pace first I used

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.130 
well if we deal with pace first I used
to<00:00:14.940> take<00:00:15.089> middle<00:00:15.480> as<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> guard<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:17.180> I<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
to take middle as a guard and I the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.570 
to take middle as a guard and I the
reason<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.470> did<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.890> because<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.279> don't<00:00:20.430> want

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
reason I did that because I don't want

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.820 
reason I did that because I don't want
to<00:00:20.760> some<00:00:21.119> people<00:00:21.390> stand<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.779> mill<00:00:21.990> enough<00:00:22.260> they

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
to some people stand on mill enough they

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.220 
to some people stand on mill enough they
come<00:00:23.189> over<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> feel<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.390> therefore

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
come over but I feel that therefore

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.839 
come over but I feel that therefore
their<00:00:25.380> back<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.890> sometimes<00:00:26.310> come<00:00:26.550> down

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
their back can sometimes come down

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.839 
their back can sometimes come down
outside<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.840> line<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> stumps<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:29.730> if

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
outside the line of the stumps now if

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.220 
outside the line of the stumps now if
the<00:00:29.939> ball<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.300> straight<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.900> means<00:00:31.080> they're

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the ball is straight it means they're

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.749 
the ball is straight it means they're
ever<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.560> slightly<00:00:31.800> coming<00:00:32.130> across<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.579> ball

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
ever so slightly coming across the ball

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.600 
ever so slightly coming across the ball
there<00:00:32.910> could<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.090> an<00:00:33.210> LBW<00:00:33.660> candidate<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.980> when

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
there could be an LBW candidate so when

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.040 
there could be an LBW candidate so when
I<00:00:35.640> was<00:00:35.910> batting<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.329> took<00:00:36.540> middle<00:00:36.809> guard

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
I was batting I took middle guard

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.170 
I was batting I took middle guard
because<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> wanted<00:00:38.010> after<00:00:38.340> I'd<00:00:38.460> done<00:00:39.030> my

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I wanted my bat to be able to come down

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.110 
I wanted my bat to be able to come down
on<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.360> line<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.809> milonov<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.460> access<00:00:44.879> to

the ball so that was my personal

the ball so that was my personal
preference<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.260> ball<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> pitch<00:00:50.039> was

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
preference if the ball if the pitch was

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.479 
preference if the ball if the pitch was
keeping<00:00:50.579> low<00:00:50.850> again<00:00:51.510> space<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.340> in

keeping low again space or there was in

I<00:00:54.059> might<00:00:54.660> shuffle<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.230> bit<00:00:55.410> more<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.770> two<00:00:55.890> legs

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
I might shuffle a bit more on two legs

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.700 
I might shuffle a bit more on two legs
stump<00:00:56.550> now<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.480> would<00:00:57.629> show<00:00:57.989> more<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.559> my

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
stump now that would show more of my

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.189 
stump now that would show more of my
stumps<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.670> again<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.300> allowing<00:01:00.780> me<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.930> get

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
stumps but again it's allowing me to get

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.789 
stumps but again it's allowing me to get
the<00:01:01.320> bat<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> ball<00:01:01.859> taking<00:01:02.579> out<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> LBW

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
the bat at the ball taking out the LBW

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.679 
the bat at the ball taking out the LBW
position<00:01:04.799> or<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.220> obw<00:01:05.549> dismissal<00:01:06.330> because

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
position or the obw dismissal because

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.140 
position or the obw dismissal because
the<00:01:06.810> ball<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.020> keeping<00:01:07.530> low<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.760> wicket<00:01:09.060> is

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the ball is keeping low if the wicket is

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.510 
the ball is keeping low if the wicket is
bouncy<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.500> might<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.340> actually

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
bouncy it might be that you actually

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.820 
bouncy it might be that you actually
have<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.270> over<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.260> offside<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
have to get over to the offside and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.950 
have to get over to the offside and
against<00:01:14.070> Glenrock<00:01:14.490> rah<00:01:14.760> who<00:01:15.450> used<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> bowl<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
against Glenrock rah who used to bowl a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
against Glenrock rah who used to bowl a
lot<00:01:16.200> around<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.710> stump<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.220> outside<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
lot around off stump just outside and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.780 
lot around off stump just outside and
get<00:01:18.630> bounced<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.290> found<00:01:19.920> myself<00:01:20.070> having<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.640> get

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
get bounced I found myself having to get

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.870 
get bounced I found myself having to get
over<00:01:21.119> into<00:01:21.570> line<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.189> behind<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
over into line and get in behind the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.490 
over into line and get in behind the
ball<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> again<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.890> tactical<00:01:26.490> decision

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
ball so again that's a tactical decision

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.090 
ball so again that's a tactical decision
with<00:01:28.500> spin<00:01:28.890> bowling<00:01:30.290> against<00:01:31.290> left<00:01:31.500> arm<00:01:31.710> spin

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
with spin bowling against left arm spin

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.870 
with spin bowling against left arm spin
I<00:01:32.340> would<00:01:32.970> back<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.479> onto<00:01:33.720> leg<00:01:34.200> stump<00:01:34.880> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
I would back out onto leg stump the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.280 
I would back out onto leg stump the
reason<00:01:36.210> being<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.930> would<00:01:37.049> sort<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
reason being is that it would sort of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.760 
reason being is that it would sort of
open<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.430> offside<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.180> play<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.380> spin

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
open the offside to play with the spin

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
open the offside to play with the spin
so<00:01:41.490> I'd<00:01:41.579> always<00:01:41.729> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.180> playing<00:01:42.390> with

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
so I'd always want to be playing with

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.929 
so I'd always want to be playing with
the<00:01:42.810> spin<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> knew<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.850> if

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the spin really and then I knew that if

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.749 
the spin really and then I knew that if
the<00:01:45.060> bowler<00:01:45.270> followed<00:01:45.689> me<00:01:45.869> actually<00:01:46.759> he's

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the bowler followed me actually he's

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.460 
the bowler followed me actually he's
pitching<00:01:48.000> outside<00:01:48.450> leg<00:01:48.659> stump<00:01:48.899> which<00:01:49.079> gave<00:01:49.290> me

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
pitching outside leg stump which gave me

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.460 
pitching outside leg stump which gave me
a<00:01:49.500> free<00:01:49.829> free<00:01:50.729> hit<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.119> leg<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.049> whether<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> was

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
a free free hit to leg so whether it was

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.020 
a free free hit to leg so whether it was
on<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.619> front<00:01:52.829> foot<00:01:53.159> playing<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> spin

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
on the front foot playing with the spin

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.600 
on the front foot playing with the spin
or<00:01:54.210> getting<00:01:54.600> back<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.680> had<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> room<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.460> be

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
or getting back it I had the room to be

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.929 
or getting back it I had the room to be
able<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.909> access<00:01:57.390> through<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.740> off<00:01:58.890> side<00:01:59.219> for

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
able to access through the off side for

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
able to access through the off side for
the<00:02:00.030> off-spinner<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.719> was<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> opposite<00:02:01.380> I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the off-spinner it was the opposite I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.760 
the off-spinner it was the opposite I
would<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.520> across<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.060> off<00:02:03.210> stump<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:04.439> over

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
would go across to off stump but over

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800 
would go across to off stump but over
here<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.189> look<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.700> play<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> spin

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
here and look to play with the spin

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.479 
here and look to play with the spin
through<00:02:07.770> mid<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.190> through<00:02:09.000> midwicket

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
through mid on through midwicket

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.300 
through mid on through midwicket
sometimes<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.760> was<00:02:11.879> outside<00:02:12.060> off<00:02:12.540> stump

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
sometimes if it was outside off stump

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.010 
sometimes if it was outside off stump
of<00:02:13.370> course<00:02:13.849> you<00:02:14.060> know<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.239> can<00:02:14.480> sweep<00:02:14.780> from

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
of course you know you can sweep from

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.170 
of course you know you can sweep from
outside<00:02:15.380> off<00:02:15.560> stump<00:02:15.590> as<00:02:16.010> well<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:17.000> there's

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
outside off stump as well so there's

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.780 
outside off stump as well so there's
tactical<00:02:17.780> reasons<00:02:18.260> as<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.560> what<00:02:19.310> god<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.580> used

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
tactical reasons as to what god I used

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:34.020 
tactical reasons as to what god I used
to<00:02:20.000> take

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.090
