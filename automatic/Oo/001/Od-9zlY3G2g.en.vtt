I<00:03:40.610> don't<00:03:41.030> know<00:03:41.120> if<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.270> can<00:03:41.360> see<00:03:41.600> it<00:03:41.690> on<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
I don't know if you can see it on the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.470 
I don't know if you can see it on the
camera<00:03:42.200> but<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.680> can<00:03:42.860> just<00:03:43.640> see<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.120> flesh

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
camera but you can just see the flesh

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.440 
camera but you can just see the flesh
duck<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.080> come<00:03:45.290> away<00:03:45.590> from<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.980> shell<00:03:46.310> if<00:03:47.270> you

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
duck to come away from the shell if you

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.300 
duck to come away from the shell if you
look<00:03:47.630> closely<00:03:47.990> there<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.590> might<00:03:48.800> be<00:03:48.950> able<00:03:49.130> to

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
look closely there you might be able to

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.070 
look closely there you might be able to
see<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.760> it's<00:03:49.880> pretty<00:03:50.120> hard<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.540> see<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:50.750> think

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
see it it's pretty hard to see I think

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.430 
see it it's pretty hard to see I think
on<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.380> camera<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:53.000> but<00:03:53.330> if<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:53.540> just<00:03:53.720> boil

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
on the camera so but if you just boil

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.930 
on the camera so but if you just boil
them<00:03:54.590> for<00:03:54.770> five<00:03:55.340> minutes

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
them for five minutes

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.250 
them for five minutes
big<00:03:56.390> prawns<00:03:56.780> like<00:03:57.110> this<00:03:58.810> after<00:03:59.810> they've<00:03:59.959> come

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
big prawns like this after they've come

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.880
