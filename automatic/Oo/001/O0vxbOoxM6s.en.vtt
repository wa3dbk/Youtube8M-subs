00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello today in the series from the fisherman 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.960
 fisherman I'll share a secret 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:16.560
 fast seine this secret technology 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.060
 fast seine and I kept secret from 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.400
 all over thirty maybe 35 years 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.519
 quick seine it i called it because 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.230
 that it is compact 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.750
 it can be hidden in a case from fishing rods and 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.950
 You can put it on the river or on the ultrasound in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.129
 for a minute or two 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.890
 but first I will show you how I see 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.320
 seine lie i seine u natural 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.910
 solid fishing line 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.559
 making habits like a hanging loop 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 I already showed the hanging loop in one 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.649
 From the movies 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.329
 here I am just repeating 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.079
 you were given the same visual hands form 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.739
 loops and start twisting start 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.060
 twist the lower loops and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.770
 main loop which forms a leash 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.810
 you slip into these twist loops 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.180
 here it turns out hanging loop again 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.350
 You can see the detail in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.280
 encyclopedia of knots 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.930
 this is further here is a feature I'm on this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.630
 povodochek Gadget's dress size you 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.820
 You can see here is such a secret I 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.850
 then I will tell you why I wear it 5 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.930
 of course i do i do paste from 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.170
 stainless steel as all wet then it is necessary 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.320
 not to anything that's rusted dress hook 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 the ice is such a thing on 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.420
 fly hook and near the hook gadget 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.500
 then we will see why all this is needed 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.350
 and understand even without much explanation from 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.610
 I'm trying to show you a tick with 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.549
 hook here then I do between the seine 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.560
 hooks approximately 2 meters per 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.429
 meter eighty meter 50 dependency 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.890
 the fact that you catch and on every leash I 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.900
 here I put again 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.360
 such gadget and hook well, I show you 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.690
 for it to be quite visual 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.150
 how do i cook seine and at the same time 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.310
 show that with skill 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.450
 item in 2030 hooks can 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.510
 cook for half an hour here I am 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.800
 showing now two hooks collected 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.750
 fast enough and so and 3 4 5 6 further 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.390
 now you will see why all this 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.630
 I made further imagine that you are at home 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.700
 stay and cook and go to 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.090
 fishing that's the beauty of this fast 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.920
 seine that you can cook it at home 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.380
 you see there pin plastic I have 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.530
 I imagine that this bait well 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.310
 What bait if on carp this this the 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:12.320
 it's corn 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:17.600
 if at all anything fish meat 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:20.000
 tours were or chicken whatever you want but 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.160
 further already on guess here 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.700
 hole in order and serves i would go there 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.220
 I put the hook along with the bait and here 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.720
 now you understand why gadget 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.700
 Gadget needed helps to crochet 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.280
 inside and so that the hook does not slip 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.680
 through this gap and made 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.400
 Well, now I will show a few bunches 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.220
 yes here to pay attention that the loop between 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.110
 hooks for i put on the wand from 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.019
 long but on the corpse on the tube as comfort 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.150
 which is equal to the length of the pipe here and 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.680
 on the tube again at the end of the movie you 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.459
 show all or tell in more detail 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:04.100
 how to make it and from what and so on on 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:07.720
 like this 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.000
 just stick and bait 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.810
 thrust and here in this one 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.810
 hole and 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.109
 just bait prevents overlap 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.570
 its not hooks inside so they don't 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.020
 cling to each other enough 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.930
 comfortable fishing hundreds of times and I'll tell you 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.030
 that never no problems 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.289
 fuck again this loop is bright 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.600
 put it on the shelf 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.240
 then you will see well, you probably already 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.880
 understand that this stick you then 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.930
 pull these loops on the pipe I 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.470
 I'll show you there 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.509
 and it will be quite compact tube 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.509
 with a stick and a shelf 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:53.330
 we will have them in order not to 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:56.030
 unwound asya rezinochka clings to them 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.710
 also show here the last piece for 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.310
 demonstrating it just by showing 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.349
 I insert the last bill there and you 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:10.940
 farther farther I will just show what 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:13.639
 wrapping this stick like that 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.180
 impose and so all the loops of this stick 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:20.780
 was very very simple very comfortable 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.409
 cook it all home now 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.150
 I'll show you what I wind the shelf 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.690
 There are no secrets here able you do it 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:33.139
 You understand in this way pull 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.919
 inspect all loops by loops 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.380
 short 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:40.820
 becomes because they are length 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.160
 decreases two times further you are at the ends 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.250
 this 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.940
 pipe shelves dress rezinochki like 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.410
 Want rezinochki or simply tape 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.990
 wrapping which then easy to take here 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.290
 It turns out this little thing compact all 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.030
 This can then be hidden in this as 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.950
 now see the most important thing 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.900
 all this is done here on fishing 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:07.030
 you have now dropped the sinkers and you are very 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.140
 fast you paddle there by boat or even 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.410
 riding a motor 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:20.520
 and you pop up one by one. Well 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:22.690
 I'll show you myself now 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.050
 or how it can be called 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.780
 holder for the pipe kiddle 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.450
 this is a pipe layout of course just made from 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.840
 paper pipe I actually did 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:37.540
 PVC pipe crossings 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.160
 pipes and that's the best way to get pvc 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:45.210
 you know white such pipes are sold 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:49.979
 hardware stores for for pipes 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:51.810
 for drain pipes from to pipe cut off 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.520
 to the length you want depending on 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.229
 what seine do for what 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.150
 subject do and cut cutter 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:02.759
 mean do yourself after you 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:07.530
 the cut pipe usually collapses 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:10.259
 so do caps are at the ends 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.009
 doctors of the other side of the tube and these 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.440
 stubs 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:15.300
 strengthen aluminum then works the pipe 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.289
 then drilled threaded and 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.780
 screw secured here if very long 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:25.410
 pipe from on in the middle as if this 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.800
 happiness it will collapse and i do 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.539
 I usually cut the ring in the middle 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.000
 tough enough and 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:36.060
 or a couple of rings and bolts them 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.180
 cogs the same colt on the same rings 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.320
 I sometimes make a mount for for 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.630
 mounts to the boat 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.889
 quickly put the boat on two pins and 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:50.460
 also through this hole 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:54.090
 threw weights and for a minute already 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.889
 all the bait there already in the river or lake well 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:59.180
 here are all the secrets of quick cut 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:02.180
 thanks for watching all the best and up 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.180
 dating
