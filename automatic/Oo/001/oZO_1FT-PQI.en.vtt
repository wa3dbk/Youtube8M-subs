00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.710
 for example how they take birth 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.109
 but in fact they take birth in the corner of the elected and gas is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.909
 with as painful the site 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.690
 these big we know big clouds 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.339
 so beautiful 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:14.759
 super nice to see but 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.550
 it would be better to bet good shots 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.949
 gas is hot and just as the big misery is beautiful in May 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.289
 for few words 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.079
 so it's so 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.460
 that canvases exposed in their cocoon 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.300
 because if filled grass that feed on blood 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.369
 you have to know that the stars the guide proposes that so it has his passion to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.960
 art 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.690
 so the shovel 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.880
 konate the super-g montrouge 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.080
 and that 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 so that explodes after the supernova break 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.540
 baucus who after after supernova so that me 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.670
 under the transforming neutron star and that pray for them bravo to these 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.530
 events too much actually 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.670
 so the transfer on the light factor the stars 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.240
 the big misery 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.950
 let's get out now from our solar system 2 the little cocoon 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.200
 show a little more a little bit further up 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.850
 for what he did 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.600
 remember that an elective elective of lovers that we call com and the voice of our 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.510
 Milky Way 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.510
 bordeaux which is still 200 billion starry 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.780
 so our a good cake at home 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.930
 and since we must also know that several categories of galaxies 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.100
 we can also have an ordinary spiral 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.980
 bouthillier% to 5 arms 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.290
 and a core center me that you have to know that we are in the center 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.360
 is a black hole 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 so gold my account on the light 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.470
 so that our solar system 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.470
 it was the turn of the galaxy on everything that moves it revolves around a man 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.100
 of which always member 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 edge of 150 million years 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.890
 the closest galaxy 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890
 that the andromeda moment so the movement 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.330
 scientists and August 31 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
 montpellier is still 2 million light-years away 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.040
 I'm going to quote you from class a shares of spiral galaxies so 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.990
 no others 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.470
 irregular it ticks so more you take balls 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.689
 and lenticular 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.859
 now that rooney was very quickly 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.129
 the belgian lions running from everything 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.570
 attention if they have more and more 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.649
 of the earth a more than 10 billion years 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.029
 light 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.029
 so we can see there an election that regroup in one month 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.799
 eyi and so close up superclusters 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.760
 the team with tiphaine who ends up going strong but a structure 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.059
 filamentous 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:37.049
 all our customers 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.649
 we take a big step back 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:41.399
 and we imagined it 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.779
 small sme also a little bit of time 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.379
 without this place 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.789
 it's a man think - finished in this infinite universe 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.009
 we leave we are well weakened 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.439
 and of course 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.819
 but I knew that I was skiing much more crunches then at 32nd things and then 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.329
 discover 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.739
 this is one of the officers what really came in very nice then 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.569
 and then also had a word how can we meet to quote the spartans 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.569
 to this huge universe that puts 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:14.219
 do you realize that you athens 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.639
 any break 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.049
 do you take time for everyone to leave the profession passion for you 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.419
 first duty almost today is thanks for living 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.789
 take it glory 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.919
 and if you have not done something yet, it's okay that Jesus is acceptable 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.579
 but this montpellier meeting 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.639
 we wait for the duel of the courses they discover the wonders of the cd &amp; v which 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.489
 is for you 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.619
 athletes 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:39.779
 the eventual creation of a war 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.349
 this is a marvel 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.629
 he did a very great thing for you too 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.409
 he gave his only son 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.099
 they must follow in their own story the twins I believe for you 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.189
 to hurry for you 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.189
 as for the little feet on the ground the captain 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.719
 it repairs the tpg it is enough that you advance 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.219
 at 3f 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.689
 jean lord 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.499
 magic circuit of morbihan - m 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:09.059
 I am touched knee 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:12.059
 we are under pressure on Friday 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:19.779
 she
