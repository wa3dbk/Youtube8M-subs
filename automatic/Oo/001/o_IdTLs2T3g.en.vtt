 As for the gameplay, the game has 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.060
 demonstrated in e3 of 2012 but it 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.560
 can appreciate that it is a game in the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.510
 which happens to be able to hack any 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.880
 device know the information of 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.380
 anyone walking and obviously 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.579
 listen to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.250

 becoming a watchman for 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.470
 try to avoid this the qualification of 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.069
 this game in terms of the story let's 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.289
 to put him in an 8 since it has not been said 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.569
 nothing or at least the 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.810
 most of the story regarding the 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.780
 character character the truth promises 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.810
 a lot so let's put a nice 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.060
 8 regarding the gameplay we are going to 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.209
 put a popcorn and obviously a 10 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.890

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.799
 videogames something that had never been 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.590

 a car sales company 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.600
 this character in the game will grant a 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.850
 Additional driving skill is 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.609
 presented at the inguinal frank mission 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.739
 simply this game is perfect the 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.620
 story is simply magnificent though 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.100
 obviously it does not have as much history as 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.479
 It is common in all grand theft auto 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.030
 you simply dedicate yourself to murder and 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.550
 murder though in this game the truth 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.760
 is 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.670
 the story got better enough from 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.010
 of the grand theft auto 4 we can say 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.890
 from history to history we are going to 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.260
 put a 9 to this great game since 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.720
 has many missions and each one of 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.230
 they are totally different from the 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.840
 previous 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.450
 also has mini missions that are 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.100
 pretty good and it's something very very 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.400
 original in terms of the characters 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.710
 main we are going to put a nice 8 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.680
 to the characters since each one has 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.340
 special abilities and each of 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.250
 they have different missions that's why 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.270
 we put a popcorn and an 8 now 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.330
 something of the most important is missing 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.850
 where each of these is developed 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.760
 games let's start with wash 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.210
 westbrook is held in chicago a 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.810
 futuristic city and obviously very 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.639
 relaxing in quotes 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.520
 this city has a violence 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.680
 awesome and you take care of it too 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.169
 of catching several thieves in this 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.139
 city on a simple smartphone you can 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.800
 handle any camera in this city 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:45.820
 and any cell phone while 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:51.410
 which in gta 5 is a pretty city 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:54.980
 dangerous very very very dangerous you have 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.500
 enough places to be bought 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.610
 weapons accept tattoos until buy 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.610
 drug each of these places are very 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.940
 very good so these two places 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.970
 we are going to put a 10 but with which we 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.820
 We were personally I 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.560
 I stay with grand theft auto the truth is 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.110
 that has a very good story though 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.330
 even this is not far behind that is my 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.560
 opinion your opinion of can leave it in 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.410

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.820
