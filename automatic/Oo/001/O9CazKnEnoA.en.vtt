scholar<00:01:07.610> girls<00:01:07.850> I<00:01:08.060> think<00:01:08.270> it's<00:01:08.360> going<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.510> be

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600

much<00:01:08.750> tougher<00:01:08.810> task<00:01:09.110> maroma<00:01:10.070> than<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:10.820> was<00:01:10.970> ok

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
much tougher task maroma than it was ok

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.890 
much tougher task maroma than it was ok
cska<00:01:12.020> moscow<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:13.490> think<00:01:14.210> Manchester<00:01:14.390> City

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
cska moscow and I think Manchester City

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.840 
cska moscow and I think Manchester City
will<00:01:15.110> edge<00:01:15.260> this<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:15.770> think<00:01:16.250> what<00:01:16.400> we<00:01:16.490> saw<00:01:16.670> from

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
will edge this I think what we saw from

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.330 
will edge this I think what we saw from
them<00:01:17.000> against<00:01:17.240> Bayern<00:01:17.450> Munich<00:01:17.780> was<00:01:17.870> a<00:01:18.340> more

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
them against Bayern Munich was a more

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.130 
them against Bayern Munich was a more
sensible<00:01:19.850> approach<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.660> there<00:01:21.050> won't

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
sensible approach and there won't

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.890 
sensible approach and there won't
gung-ho<00:01:21.620> flying<00:01:22.460> fault<00:01:22.850> they<00:01:23.270> played<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.750> much

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
gung-ho flying fault they played it much

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.120 
gung-ho flying fault they played it much
more<00:01:24.140> sensibly<00:01:24.620> I<00:01:24.710> think<00:01:24.860> we'll<00:01:24.980> see<00:01:25.100> a

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
more sensibly I think we'll see a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.740 
more sensibly I think we'll see a
similar<00:01:25.490> performance<00:01:25.640> from<00:01:26.060> Manchester<00:01:26.540> City

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
similar performance from Manchester City

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.140 
similar performance from Manchester City

think they'll be I think it'll be all
that<00:02:58.310> midfield<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.120> think<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.480> looking<00:02:59.780> Roma

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.900 
that midfield and I think I looking Roma
with<00:03:00.650> their<00:03:00.860> three<00:03:01.040> points<00:03:01.550> in<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.730> bank

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
with their three points in the bank

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.550 
with their three points in the bank
already<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.750> think<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:02.989> have<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.140> robust

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
already you think you have a robust

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.080 
already you think you have a robust
point<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.920> view<00:03:04.220> they've<00:03:04.640> really<00:03:04.670> got<00:03:05.060> a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
point of view they've really got a

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.940 
point of view they've really got a
guaranteed<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.810> know<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.230> three<00:03:06.560> points<00:03:06.860> in

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
only six points now if you can get a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.949

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
know that's not a pan result at all is

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.430 
know that's not a pan result at all is
it<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.790> then<00:03:17.180> they'll<00:03:17.750> think<00:03:17.989> they<00:03:18.140> can<00:03:18.320> go

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
it and then they'll think they can go

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.110 
it and then they'll think they can go
and<00:03:18.560> beat<00:03:18.709> manchester<00:03:19.160> city<00:03:19.400> at<00:03:19.519> home<00:03:19.730> as<00:03:19.940> well

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
and beat manchester city at home as well

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.580 
and beat manchester city at home as well
you<00:03:20.750> know<00:03:20.840> they<00:03:20.959> still<00:03:21.140> got<00:03:21.260> two<00:03:21.440> games

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
you know they still got two games

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.990 
you know they still got two games
against<00:03:21.890> bite<00:03:22.070> me<00:03:22.250> licking<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.579> be<00:03:22.730> 10

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
against bite me licking that be 10

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.509 
against bite me licking that be 10
points<00:03:23.360> in<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.540> back<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:24.049> think<00:03:24.890> rauf<00:03:25.100> will<00:03:25.400> be

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
points in the back I think rauf will be

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.340 
points in the back I think rauf will be
about<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.880> draw<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.450> think<00:03:26.750> Manchester<00:03:26.930> City

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
about the draw I think Manchester City

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.810 
about the draw I think Manchester City
will<00:03:27.500> be<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.620> little<00:03:27.799> bit<00:03:27.950> frustrated<00:03:28.579> at<00:03:28.760> times

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
will be a little bit frustrated at times

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.630 
will be a little bit frustrated at times
but<00:03:29.360> I<00:03:29.420> think<00:03:29.660> they'll<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:29.840> get<00:03:30.350> there

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
but I think they'll just get there

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.130 
but I think they'll just get there
one-nil<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.700> facilities<00:03:32.540> what<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.720> can<00:03:32.959> see

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
one-nil to facilities what I can see

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.229

top tip then for playing this match the
other<00:03:58.430> 2.5<00:03:59.030> price<00:03:59.299> is<00:03:59.540> great<00:03:59.750> in<00:03:59.930> my<00:04:00.049> opinion

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
other 2.5 price is great in my opinion

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.720

and<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:01.010> know<00:04:01.100> it's<00:04:01.250> obviously<00:04:01.519> different

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
and you know it's obviously different

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.370 
and you know it's obviously different
from<00:04:02.090> what<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.360> say<00:04:02.570> just<00:04:03.019> what<00:04:03.140> I've<00:04:03.230> seen

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
from what you say just what I've seen

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.410 
from what you say just what I've seen
from<00:04:03.440> Manchester<00:04:04.190> City<00:04:04.400> at<00:04:04.610> home<00:04:04.850> against<00:04:05.269> the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
from Manchester City at home against the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.000 
from Manchester City at home against the
big<00:04:05.600> teams<00:04:05.810> they're<00:04:06.410> not<00:04:06.530> particularly

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
big teams they're not particularly

big teams they're not particularly
expansive<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:07.910> think<00:04:08.390> that's<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.660> way<00:04:08.750> they'll

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
expansive I think that's the way they'll

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.170 
expansive I think that's the way they'll
play<00:04:09.260> against<00:04:09.680> Roma<00:04:09.950> than<00:04:10.459> worry<00:04:10.670> about<00:04:10.760> how

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
play against Roma than worry about how

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.150 
play against Roma than worry about how
