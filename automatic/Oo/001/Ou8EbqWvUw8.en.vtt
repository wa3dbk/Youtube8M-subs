this technique is we just spread out
some<00:01:52.080> grits<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.619> what<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.890> call<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.520> it's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
some grits is what we call it and it's

some grits is what we call it and it's
just<00:01:53.700> cornmeal<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.770> take<00:01:56.159> our<00:01:56.340> dough<00:01:56.580> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
just cornmeal so we take our dough and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.730 
just cornmeal so we take our dough and
then<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.320> rake<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.979> rake<00:01:59.190> it<00:01:59.460> the

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
then we have to rake it we rake it the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:11.660 
then we have to rake it we rake it the
meat<00:02:01.740> from<00:02:02.100> doubling<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.270> oven<00:02:10.670> okay
