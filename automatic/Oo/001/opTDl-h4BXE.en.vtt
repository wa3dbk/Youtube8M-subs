um then you just want it away I wanted
to<00:01:37.049> demonstrate<00:01:37.200> how<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> counter<00:01:38.640> mechanism

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
to demonstrate how the counter mechanism

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.740 
to demonstrate how the counter mechanism
works<00:01:40.820> basically<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> rocker<00:01:42.450> arm

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
works basically you have a rocker arm

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
works basically you have a rocker arm
that<00:01:42.960> moves<00:01:43.170> back<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.530> forth<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.950> every

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that moves back and forth with every

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
that moves back and forth with every
revolution<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> spindle

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
revolution of the spindle

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.560 
revolution of the spindle
I<00:01:49.040> have<00:01:50.040> installed<00:01:50.370> a<00:01:50.580> single<00:01:50.970> pole<00:01:51.210> single

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I have installed a single pole single

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.010 
I have installed a single pole single
throw<00:01:52.729> normally<00:01:53.729> open<00:01:54.270> contact<00:01:55.229> switch<00:01:57.020> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
throw normally open contact switch that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.080 
throw normally open contact switch that
clicks<00:01:58.440> every<00:01:58.830> time<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.220> rocker<00:01:59.490> arm<00:01:59.820> moves

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
clicks every time this rocker arm moves

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.920 
clicks every time this rocker arm moves
backwards<00:02:04.700> now<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.910> is<00:02:06.090> connected<00:02:06.630> directly

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
backwards now that is connected directly

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.430 
backwards now that is connected directly
to<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.410> standard<00:02:07.920> RCA<00:02:08.100> jack<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.929> allows<00:02:10.200> me

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to a standard RCA jack it just allows me

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.949 
to a standard RCA jack it just allows me
to<00:02:10.560> disconnect<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:13.050> counter<00:02:13.500> easily<00:02:17.959> and

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
to disconnect the counter easily and

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.380 
to disconnect the counter easily and
that<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.320> wired<00:02:19.560> across<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.280> plus<00:02:20.610> key<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.180> a

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that is wired across the plus key of a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.990 
that is wired across the plus key of a
regular<00:02:21.780> old<00:02:22.050> adding<00:02:22.500> machine<00:02:22.920> now<00:02:23.640> what<00:02:23.970> I

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
regular old adding machine now what I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.479 
regular old adding machine now what I
found<00:02:24.330> pretty<00:02:24.989> interesting<00:02:25.110> about<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.220> is

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
found pretty interesting about this is

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.560 
found pretty interesting about this is
that<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:28.260> thing<00:02:28.530> will<00:02:28.770> read<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.190> 700<00:02:30.060> rpm

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
that this thing will read up to 700 rpm

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.170 
that this thing will read up to 700 rpm
without<00:02:31.020> overloading<00:02:31.830> its<00:02:32.190> debounce<00:02:32.670> circuit

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
without overloading its debounce circuit

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.710 
without overloading its debounce circuit
so<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.690> was<00:02:33.870> pretty<00:02:34.110> impressed<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.709> and

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
so I was pretty impressed with that and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.630 
so I was pretty impressed with that and
it<00:02:36.720> wound<00:02:36.930> up<00:02:37.080> being<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.470> very<00:02:37.650> simple<00:02:38.190> counting

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
it wound up being a very simple counting

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.040 
it wound up being a very simple counting
mechanism<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:41.550> way<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.700> operate<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.870> I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
mechanism the way I operate this is I

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.759 
mechanism the way I operate this is I
hit<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.519> key<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> middle

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
hit the one key and it's in the middle

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.759 
hit the one key and it's in the middle
of<00:02:46.980> an<00:02:47.070> operation<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.000> let's<00:02:48.450> click<00:02:48.989> out<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
of an operation so let's click out of it

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.150 
of an operation so let's click out of it
okay<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:50.760> we'll<00:02:50.970> hit<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.209> one<00:02:51.390> key<00:02:52.160> I'm

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160

currently<00:02:53.640> I'm<00:02:53.880> click<00:02:54.120> back<00:02:54.360> into<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.840> okay<00:02:55.440> so

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
currently I'm click back into it okay so

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.580 
currently I'm click back into it okay so
hit<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.610> one<00:02:56.790> key<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.269> every<00:02:58.140> time<00:02:58.320> we<00:02:58.470> hit

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
the plus key we get a new count on the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.370 
the plus key we get a new count on the
counter<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.510> every<00:03:03.510> revolution<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
counter so every revolution of the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.480 
counter so every revolution of the
spindle

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.449
