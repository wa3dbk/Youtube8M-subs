00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
flush to the cutting edge so you will

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.770 
flush to the cutting edge so you will
need<00:01:09.859> to<00:01:09.979> use<00:01:10.159> a<00:01:10.189> guide<00:01:10.579> for<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.090> bearing<00:01:11.600> to

exactly up to the pencil line as I said
the<00:01:26.210> bit<00:01:26.479> will<00:01:26.659> cut<00:01:26.929> flush<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.770> guide<00:01:28.009> so

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
the bit will cut flush to the guide so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.399 
the bit will cut flush to the guide so
you<00:01:28.759> want<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.119> put<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.420> guide<00:01:29.630> right<00:01:30.049> on<00:01:30.259> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
but the offset design will help me keep

the<00:02:28.500> whole<00:02:28.680> time<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:28.950> am<00:02:29.160> making<00:02:29.610> my<00:02:29.790> cuts<00:02:30.120> you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
the whole time I am making my cuts you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.680 
the whole time I am making my cuts you
can<00:02:30.840> see<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.500> start<00:02:32.310> off<00:02:32.489> keeping<00:02:32.940> two<00:02:33.180> hands<00:02:33.570> on

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
can see I start off keeping two hands on

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.080 
can see I start off keeping two hands on
the<00:02:33.840> router<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.769> quickly<00:02:35.220> move<00:02:35.489> one<00:02:35.760> hand

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the router but I quickly move one hand

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.540 
the router but I quickly move one hand
to<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.660> point<00:02:37.140> because<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.070> offset

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
to the on point because the offset

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.000 
to the on point because the offset
design<00:02:38.730> gives<00:02:39.300> me<00:02:39.480> more<00:02:39.720> leverage<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.830> keep

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
against my guide this will make the cut

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
depth of the round over a bit just deep

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.130 
depth of the round over a bit just deep
enough<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:27.080> knock<00:04:27.290> off<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.830> corner<00:04:29.110> now<00:04:30.110> I
