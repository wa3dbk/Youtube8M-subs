00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
hard and it's also not very easy it's

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.910 
hard and it's also not very easy it's
quite<00:00:34.300> tricky<00:00:34.570> actually<00:00:35.289> and<00:00:35.469> I'll<00:00:35.649> show<00:00:35.890> you

quite tricky actually and I'll show you
how<00:00:36.219> but<00:00:37.210> first<00:00:37.510> of<00:00:37.690> all<00:00:37.780> before<00:00:38.320> we<00:00:38.620> do<00:00:38.890> that

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
how but first of all before we do that

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.599 
how but first of all before we do that
it's<00:00:39.760> very<00:00:40.179> very<00:00:40.719> important<00:00:41.589> that<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.159> skin

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
it's very very important that the skin

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.139 
it's very very important that the skin
is<00:00:42.870> prepped<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.170> when<00:00:44.649> I<00:00:44.800> say<00:00:45.129> prep<00:00:45.519> it<00:00:45.819> needs

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
is prepped and when I say prep it needs

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.459 
is prepped and when I say prep it needs
to<00:00:46.449> be<00:00:46.710> well<00:00:47.710> hydrated<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.719> either<00:00:49.929> you<00:00:50.260> put

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
to be well hydrated it's either you put

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.919 
to be well hydrated it's either you put
on<00:00:50.649> a<00:00:51.089> moisturizing<00:00:52.089> mask<00:00:52.449> or<00:00:52.839> a<00:00:53.829> moisturizer

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
on a moisturizing mask or a moisturizer

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.469 
on a moisturizing mask or a moisturizer
but<00:00:55.929> I<00:00:56.489> normally<00:00:57.489> don't<00:00:57.639> put<00:00:57.909> moisturizer

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
but I normally don't put moisturizer

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.840 
but I normally don't put moisturizer
because<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.469> tends<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.979> make<00:01:00.129> my<00:01:00.339> face<00:01:00.670> a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
because it tends to make my face a

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.250 
because it tends to make my face a
little<00:01:01.030> bit<00:01:01.179> greasy<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:03.100> I<00:01:03.429> choose<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.449> use<00:01:05.049> the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
little bit greasy so I choose to use the

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.890 
little bit greasy so I choose to use the
moisturizing<00:01:05.950> mask<00:01:06.280> like<00:01:07.090> for<00:01:07.299> example<00:01:07.390> I'm

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
moisturizing mask like for example I'm

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.950 
moisturizing mask like for example I'm
using<00:01:07.930> this<00:01:08.470> locks<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.460> done<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:10.630> three

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
using this locks it done the three

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.760 
using this locks it done the three
minutes<00:01:11.350> mask<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.670> very<00:01:13.180> very<00:01:13.990> good<00:01:14.380> because

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
minutes mask it's very very good because

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.680 
minutes mask it's very very good because
we<00:01:15.190> only<00:01:15.340> need<00:01:15.610> it<00:01:15.640> for<00:01:15.760> three<00:01:16.150> minutes<00:01:16.360> and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
we only need it for three minutes and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.590 
we only need it for three minutes and
then<00:01:17.080> after<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:17.620> you<00:01:18.070> just<00:01:18.120> use<00:01:19.120> a<00:01:19.330> damp

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
then after that you just use a damp

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.020 
then after that you just use a damp
cloth<00:01:19.750> or<00:01:20.440> tissue<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:21.490> wipe<00:01:21.520> off<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:22.000> excess

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
cloth or tissue to wipe off the excess

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.490 
cloth or tissue to wipe off the excess
and<00:01:22.450> then<00:01:22.570> that's<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:24.630> why<00:01:25.630> is<00:01:25.690> it<00:01:25.930> important

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
and then that's it why is it important

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.900 
and then that's it why is it important
to<00:01:26.560> hydrate<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.100> skin<00:01:27.130> before<00:01:27.550> application

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
to hydrate the skin before application

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.110 
to hydrate the skin before application
of<00:01:28.390> makeup<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:29.050> make<00:01:29.620> sure<00:01:30.010> that<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.790> skin

of makeup to make sure that the skin

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.290 
of makeup to make sure that the skin
does<00:01:31.330> not<00:01:31.360> become<00:01:31.930> flaky<00:01:32.680> after<00:01:33.400> okay<00:01:34.090> and

where they start number one important to

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.420 
where they start number one important to
have<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:38.110> brush<00:02:38.500> like<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.950> a

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.470 
don't extend up to the front okay now
you<00:04:12.090> want<00:04:12.450> your<00:04:13.220> contouring<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:15.120> look<00:04:15.300> as

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
you want your contouring to look as

natural as possible positioning the
brushes<00:04:21.390> like<00:04:21.600> this<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:27.350> then<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.680> other

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
brushes like this and then on the other

brushes like this and then on the other
side

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.520 

because<00:04:42.750> what<00:04:43.410> we<00:04:43.650> want<00:04:43.919> is<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.310> effect<00:04:44.699> that

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.409 

actually<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.590> gutom<00:04:50.010> look<00:04:50.220> effect<00:04:52.070> no<00:04:53.419> you

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
actually the gutom look effect no you

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:05.310 
actually the gutom look effect no you
want<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.780> kiss<00:04:55.290> look

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.060 

so<00:05:06.100> after<00:05:06.340> this<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:07.150> use<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:08.410> because<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.860> have

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
so after this I use this because I have

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.810 
so after this I use this because I have
lighter<00:05:09.400> skin<00:05:09.970> but<00:05:10.840> if<00:05:11.200> you're<00:05:12.100> a<00:05:12.130> little<00:05:12.640> bit

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
lighter skin but if you're a little bit

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.300 
lighter skin but if you're a little bit
on<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.300> darker<00:05:13.750> side<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:14.470> would<00:05:15.160> recommend

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
on the darker side I would recommend

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.420 
on the darker side I would recommend
using<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.120> mac<00:05:16.830> definitive<00:05:17.830> sculpting

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
using the mac definitive sculpting

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.090 
using the mac definitive sculpting
powder<00:05:18.640> this<00:05:19.450> is<00:05:19.600> more<00:05:19.870> for<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.230> Marianas<00:05:20.800> or

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
powder this is more for the Marianas or

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.940 
powder this is more for the Marianas or
the<00:05:21.220> darker<00:05:21.580> skin<00:05:21.880> tone<00:05:22.090> so<00:05:22.720> now<00:05:22.930> after<00:05:23.230> the

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
the darker skin tone so now after the

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.100 
the darker skin tone so now after the
contouring<00:05:24.340> I<00:05:24.670> would<00:05:25.060> be<00:05:25.210> now<00:05:25.360> applying<00:05:25.750> the

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
contouring I would be now applying the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.290 
contouring I would be now applying the
normal<00:05:26.470> blush<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:27.430> now<00:05:27.610> we're<00:05:27.790> using<00:05:27.970> the

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
normal blush so now we're using the

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.450 
normal blush so now we're using the
benefit<00:05:28.810> coralista<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:31.140> like<00:05:32.140> shade<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.250> this

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
benefit coralista I like shade of this

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.410 
benefit coralista I like shade of this
because<00:05:33.910> it's<00:05:34.150> very<00:05:34.840> near<00:05:35.350> my<00:05:36.220> contouring

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.580 

sure<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:42.190> application<00:05:42.880> of<00:05:42.970> the<00:05:43.150> blush<00:05:43.590> is

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
sure so the application of the blush is

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.830 
sure so the application of the blush is
a<00:05:44.620> little<00:05:44.980> bit<00:05:45.100> tricky<00:05:45.340> to<00:05:45.490> you<00:05:46.240> don't<00:05:46.450> apply

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
it where you applied the contour you

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
it where you applied the contour you
apply<00:05:52.210> it<00:05:52.270> on<00:05:52.920> top<00:05:53.920> of<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.820> contoured<00:05:55.420> part

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
apply it on top of the contoured part

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.210
