co2 emissions heavy there's a word again
heavy<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.080> you're<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.650> co2<00:01:05.159> emissions

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
heavy but you're right the co2 emissions

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.120 
heavy but you're right the co2 emissions
represent<00:01:06.240> two<00:01:06.479> billion<00:01:06.869> metric<00:01:07.080> tons<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.619> co2

what<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.390> doc<00:01:10.010> at<00:01:11.010> night<00:01:11.310> incremental

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
what can we do doc at night incremental

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
what can we do doc at night incremental
power<00:01:12.330> will<00:01:12.659> likely<00:01:12.840> come<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.320> coal<00:01:13.560> but

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
power will likely come from coal but

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
power will likely come from coal but
during<00:01:14.430> daytime<00:01:14.790> hours<00:01:14.970> include<00:01:15.540> panel<00:01:15.840> power

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
during daytime hours include panel power

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
during daytime hours include panel power
typically<00:01:16.680> comes<00:01:16.890> from<00:01:17.070> hydro<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.490> highly

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
typically comes from hydro and highly

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.050 
typically comes from hydro and highly
efficient<00:01:18.360> gas<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.159> although<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.759> may<00:01:20.880> be

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
efficient gas so so although it may be

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
efficient gas so so although it may be
cheaper<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.450> charge<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> ball<00:01:22.020> tonight<00:01:22.200> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
cheaper to charge the ball tonight it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.620 
cheaper to charge the ball tonight it
may<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.369> better<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> environment<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
may be better for the environment to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.649 
may be better for the environment to
charge<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> ball<00:01:25.140> during<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.560> day<00:01:25.740> Wow<00:01:26.659> yeah

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
charge the ball during the day Wow yeah

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.520 
charge the ball during the day Wow yeah
yeah<00:01:28.350> yeah<00:01:29.009> yo<00:01:29.390> sounds<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.509> someone

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
yeah yeah yo sounds like someone
