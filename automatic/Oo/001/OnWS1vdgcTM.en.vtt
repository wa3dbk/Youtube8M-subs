00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.620
 choose functional garments that make you 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.510
 See very professional during the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.850
 convention I recommend that you take 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.969
 basic clothes that you can combine 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.250
 easily and use several times so that 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.440
 do not have to carry too much luggage 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.480
 if you want to know what the garments are 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.000
 basic I invite you to see 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.520
 of basic clothes in this link 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.100
 and pants and skirts in neutral tones 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.080
 as black brown gray or navy blue 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.360
 so you can combine them with 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.610
 any blouse shirt and blazer that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.340
 wear long-sleeved shirts in step 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.979
 or three quarters of classic cut next to 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.900
 a few more fun designs and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.720
 recommendations that you wear a shirt 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.420
 white one blue and one black because they are 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.420
 easy to combine small or bring a 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.780
 more intense color or in a pastel tone a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.490
 blazer should not be missing in your suitcase 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.979
 preferably in gray black tone or 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.590
 navy blue to match with the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.780
 pants and fouls for cocktails 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.690
 My recommendation is that I am a dress 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.030
 black structured cut and other blue 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.700
 dark or gray and that you do it with 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.220
 striking accessories in terms of handbags 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.890
 and wallets the best thing is that you pack one 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.619
 large in black tone or one beige for 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.660
 that you use during the day but type about 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.789
 or clutch for you to use during 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.550
 cocktails the shoes will be extremely 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.040
 important in this trip remember that 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.739
 you will be working so focus all 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.010
 that are closed with medium heels and in 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.879
 neutral colors coffee black or beige 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.650
 They are the easiest colors to combine 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.109
 for the cocktails choose ones that 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.150
 combine with both dresses but not 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:33.299
 Make too much weight in your luggage 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.310
 now we go to the accessories for the 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.280
 day choose ones that are not too 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.159
 striking can be two pairs of 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.889
 small earrings a simple necklace and a 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.799
 classic watch for cocktails yes

 some earrings or a ring or necklace 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.019
 larger bracelet reminds the 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.209
 prominence to only one piece at last 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.609
