00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
then there's a couple more over there

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.500 
then there's a couple more over there
but<00:00:27.230> I'm<00:00:28.230> gonna<00:00:28.349> dig<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.519> set<00:00:30.480> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
but I'm gonna dig this one out and set a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.780 
but I'm gonna dig this one out and set a
trap<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> again<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.570> set<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> trap<00:00:37.489> this<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
trap so again to set the trap this is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:50.029 
trap so again to set the trap this is
the<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> Victor<00:00:45.260> gopher<00:00:46.260> trap<00:00:48.649> it's<00:00:49.649> easy<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the the Victor gopher trap it's easy to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.910 
the the Victor gopher trap it's easy to
set<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> push<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.989> down<00:00:55.199> under<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.739> by

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
set so push this down under here by

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.020 
set so push this down under here by
pushing<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.430> down

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
pushing this down

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.570 
pushing this down
that'll<00:00:57.390> unlock<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.960> jaws<00:01:01.190> just<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
that'll unlock the jaws just like that

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.780 
that'll unlock the jaws just like that
push<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> bars<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:07.920> unlocks<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> jaws

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
push the bars down that unlocks the jaws

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.490 
push the bars down that unlocks the jaws
all<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> way<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:10.409> set<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> trigger

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
all the way and set the trigger

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.680 
all the way and set the trigger
now<00:01:13.100> again<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:13.370> usually<00:01:13.880> bring<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.300> back<00:01:14.660> a

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
now again I usually bring this back a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.530 
now again I usually bring this back a
little<00:01:14.840> bit<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:15.620> trigger<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:17.240> it's<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.420> lot

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
little bit this trigger so it's a lot

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.630 
little bit this trigger so it's a lot
easier<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.050> go<00:01:18.170> off<00:01:20.710> when<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.860> Gopher<00:01:22.220> pushes

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
easier to go off when the Gopher pushes

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.080 
easier to go off when the Gopher pushes
the<00:01:23.080> dirt<00:01:24.080> up<00:01:24.320> on<00:01:24.500> here<00:01:24.800> that'll<00:01:25.670> trigger<00:01:25.880> it

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
the dirt up on here that'll trigger it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.800 
the dirt up on here that'll trigger it
so<00:01:27.050> now<00:01:27.170> let's<00:01:27.380> go<00:01:27.530> set<00:01:27.740> it

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.440 

okay<00:01:34.810> as<00:01:34.870> you<00:01:34.990> can<00:01:35.020> see<00:01:35.170> I've<00:01:35.410> dug<00:01:35.590> down<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
okay as you can see I've dug down and

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
okay as you can see I've dug down and
there's<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.200> tunnel<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:40.150> goes<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.570> way<00:01:40.750> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
there's a tunnel that goes that way and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.390 
there's a tunnel that goes that way and
a<00:01:42.640> tunnel<00:01:42.910> that<00:01:43.000> goes<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.390> way<00:01:44.160> so<00:01:45.160> I'm<00:01:45.250> going

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
a tunnel that goes this way so I'm going

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.720 
a tunnel that goes this way so I'm going
to<00:01:45.430> set<00:01:45.610> two<00:01:45.790> traps
