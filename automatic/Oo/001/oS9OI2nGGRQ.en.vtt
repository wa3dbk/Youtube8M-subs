puts<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.439> after<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
puts a one after it so I just get in the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.100 
puts a one after it so I just get in the
habit<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.430> using<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.000> naming<00:00:36.329> convention<00:00:36.450> with

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
habit of using a naming convention with

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:46.920 
habit of using a naming convention with
a<00:00:37.140> capital<00:00:37.440> letter<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> first

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.590 

now<00:00:47.530> if<00:00:47.830> I<00:00:48.100> take<00:00:48.130> both<00:00:48.670> objects<00:00:49.150> and<00:00:49.360> try<00:00:49.540> to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
now if I take both objects and try to

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.030 
now if I take both objects and try to
rotate<00:00:49.840> them<00:00:51.540> they<00:00:52.540> are<00:00:52.570> rotating<00:00:53.530> based<00:00:53.740> upon

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
rotate them they are rotating based upon

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.670 
rotate them they are rotating based upon
their<00:00:54.220> local<00:00:54.810> rotations<00:00:55.810> which<00:00:56.140> means<00:00:56.410> each

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
their local rotations which means each

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.310 
their local rotations which means each
object<00:00:57.040> has<00:00:57.310> its<00:00:57.670> own<00:00:57.820> local<00:00:58.060> rotation<00:00:58.630> or

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
object has its own local rotation or

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.930 
object has its own local rotation or
local<00:00:59.860> pivot<00:01:00.190> point<00:01:00.430> and<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:03.129> you<00:01:03.280> rotate

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
local pivot point and when you rotate

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.420 
local pivot point and when you rotate
them<00:01:04.180> in<00:01:04.330> world<00:01:04.570> space<00:01:04.870> they<00:01:05.770> rotate<00:01:06.190> fine

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
them in world space they rotate fine

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.590 
them in world space they rotate fine
this<00:01:06.670> way<00:01:06.880> they<00:01:07.869> rotate<00:01:08.410> fine<00:01:09.210> only<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.390> way

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
this way they rotate fine only that way

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.210 
this way they rotate fine only that way
though<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:13.600> also<00:01:13.869> have<00:01:14.260> problems<00:01:14.770> scaling

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
though they also have problems scaling

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:23.880 
though they also have problems scaling
notice<00:01:15.880> if<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.090> scale<00:01:16.390> these<00:01:21.450> ok<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:23.320> rectify

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
notice if I scale these ok to rectify

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.520 
notice if I scale these ok to rectify
this<00:01:23.950> we<00:01:24.610> can<00:01:24.790> use<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.970> thing<00:01:25.300> called<00:01:25.330> groups<00:01:26.140> if

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
this we can use a thing called groups if

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.710 
this we can use a thing called groups if
you<00:01:27.130> go<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.310> general<00:01:27.759> we<00:01:28.119> can<00:01:28.300> group<00:01:28.509> these

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
you go to general we can group these

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.380 
you go to general we can group these
objects<00:01:29.140> together<00:01:29.610> notice<00:01:30.610> an<00:01:30.759> outliner<00:01:31.149> now

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
objects together notice an outliner now

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.749 
objects together notice an outliner now
I<00:01:31.630> have<00:01:31.960> this<00:01:32.229> I<00:01:32.530> can<00:01:32.920> hit<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.100> plus<00:01:33.310> mark<00:01:33.580> and

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
I have this I can hit the plus mark and

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.180 
I have this I can hit the plus mark and
I<00:01:33.790> have<00:01:33.820> two<00:01:34.210> things<00:01:34.509> in<00:01:34.780> this<00:01:34.990> group<00:01:35.259> I<00:01:35.500> go<00:01:36.130> to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
I have two things in this group I go to

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.139 
I have two things in this group I go to
the<00:01:36.369> group<00:01:36.610> its<00:01:37.570> pivot<00:01:38.020> point<00:01:38.050> screwed<00:01:38.649> up<00:01:39.149> so

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
the group its pivot point screwed up so

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.060 
the group its pivot point screwed up so
I<00:01:40.210> can<00:01:40.390> go<00:01:40.649> modify<00:01:41.880> center<00:01:42.880> pivot<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:44.710> i'll<00:01:44.920> be

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
I can go modify center pivot now i'll be

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.370 
I can go modify center pivot now i'll be
using<00:01:45.280> center<00:01:45.729> pivot<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.149> lot<00:01:46.360> for<00:01:46.600> things<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.350> i

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
using center pivot a lot for things so i

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.219 
using center pivot a lot for things so i
would<00:01:47.710> say<00:01:48.430> center<00:01:49.300> pivots<00:01:49.660> one<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.050> one

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
would say center pivots one of the one

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.930 
would say center pivots one of the one
commands<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.890> should<00:01:51.159> be<00:01:51.280> up<00:01:51.400> on<00:01:51.549> your<00:01:51.670> shelf

center pivot now is on your shelf I have

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.870 
center pivot now is on your shelf I have
two<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:19.000> these<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.470> in<00:02:20.799> order<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.400> get<00:02:21.640> rid<00:02:21.850> of

two of these so in order to get rid of

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.750 
two of these so in order to get rid of
them<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:23.500> have<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.709> go<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:23.860> settings<00:02:24.640> and

polygon menu I can page down and I have

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.140 
polygon menu I can page down and I have
to<00:02:35.110> Center<00:02:35.410> pivots<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:36.010> can<00:02:36.549> click<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.790> one<00:02:37.120> of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
to Center pivots I can click on one of

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.400 
to Center pivots I can click on one of
them<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.570> delete<00:02:38.049> it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.740 

so<00:02:43.040> that's<00:02:43.250> how<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.490> quickly<00:02:43.910> add<00:02:44.240> that<00:02:44.540> to

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
so that's how you quickly add that to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.080 
so that's how you quickly add that to
the<00:02:44.840> shelf<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.100> guess<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.460> covered<00:02:46.760> one<00:02:46.910> more

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
the shelf so I guess I covered one more

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.190 
the shelf so I guess I covered one more
thing<00:02:47.300> in<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:47.540> video<00:02:49.480> okay<00:02:50.480> grouping<00:02:50.930> allows

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
thing in this video okay grouping allows

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.370 
thing in this video okay grouping allows
you<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.590> do<00:02:51.740> this<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:53.150> break<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.900> group<00:02:54.200> up

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
you to do this and to break a group up

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.840 
you to do this and to break a group up
you<00:02:54.560> hold<00:02:54.800> middle<00:02:55.070> mouse<00:02:55.190> button<00:02:55.220> click<00:02:55.700> and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
you hold middle mouse button click and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.450 
you hold middle mouse button click and
drag<00:02:56.060> over<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.450> objects<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.170> unbreak<00:02:57.680> to

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
drag over the objects to unbreak to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.490 
drag over the objects to unbreak to
break<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.850> group<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.210> you<00:03:00.020> can<00:03:00.140> get<00:03:00.260> rid<00:03:00.440> of

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
break the group and you can get rid of

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.350 
break the group and you can get rid of
the<00:03:00.620> group<00:03:00.800> by<00:03:00.980> clicking<00:03:01.190> on<00:03:01.490> it<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:01.730> deleting

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
the group by clicking on it and deleting

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.290 
the group by clicking on it and deleting
it<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.890> next<00:03:04.220> thing<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.430> called<00:03:04.730> combining

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
it the next thing is called combining

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.900 
it the next thing is called combining
the<00:03:05.420> objects<00:03:06.280> you'll<00:03:07.280> see<00:03:07.490> a<00:03:07.520> huge<00:03:07.880> difference

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
the objects you'll see a huge difference

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.880 
the objects you'll see a huge difference
here<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.800> if<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.160> highlight<00:03:10.820> both<00:03:11.090> objects<00:03:11.890> go

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
here so if you highlight both objects go

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.200 
here so if you highlight both objects go
mesh<00:03:13.280> combined<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.830> get<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.880> get<00:03:17.090> these

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
mesh combined I get this and I get these

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.980 
mesh combined I get this and I get these
very<00:03:17.630> confusing<00:03:18.140> looking<00:03:18.620> nodes<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.640> here

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
very confusing looking nodes in here

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.730 
very confusing looking nodes in here
this<00:03:20.990> is<00:03:21.290> history<00:03:23.020> for<00:03:24.020> every<00:03:24.350> amount<00:03:24.560> of

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
this is history for every amount of

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.680 
this is history for every amount of
history<00:03:25.190> that's<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.550> Maya<00:03:25.760> Maya<00:03:26.150> will<00:03:26.450> move

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
history that's in Maya Maya will move

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.120 
history that's in Maya Maya will move
slower<00:03:27.050> think<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.740> history<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.190> an<00:03:28.370> undo<00:03:30.130> okay

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
slower think of history is an undo okay

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.210 
slower think of history is an undo okay
but<00:03:32.090> history<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:33.020> bad<00:03:33.200> thing<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.710> a<00:03:34.040> good

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
but history is a bad thing and a good

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.490 
but history is a bad thing and a good
thing<00:03:34.460> in<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.760> way<00:03:34.790> i<00:03:35.210> would<00:03:35.960> say<00:03:36.170> as<00:03:36.440> a

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
thing in a way i would say as a

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.020 
thing in a way i would say as a
beginning<00:03:37.040> student<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.610> should<00:03:37.820> always

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
beginning student you should always

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.590 
beginning student you should always
learn<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:39.020> delete<00:03:39.380> by<00:03:39.530> type<00:03:39.560> history<00:03:40.420> every<00:03:41.420> so

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
learn to delete by type history every so

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.510 
learn to delete by type history every so
often<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:43.300> way<00:03:44.680> nodes<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.980> are<00:03:46.040> appearing

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
often that way nodes that are appearing

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.570 
often that way nodes that are appearing
in<00:03:46.760> here<00:03:47.090> do<00:03:47.450> not<00:03:47.950> kind<00:03:48.950> of<00:03:49.040> interfere<00:03:49.430> with

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
in here do not kind of interfere with

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.199 
in here do not kind of interfere with
memory<00:03:50.530> again<00:03:51.530> anytime<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.490> combine<00:03:52.880> or

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
memory again anytime you combine or

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.360 
memory again anytime you combine or
group<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.990> notice<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.680> center<00:03:55.040> pivot

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
group you notice that the center pivot

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.490 
group you notice that the center pivot
gets<00:03:55.850> messed<00:03:56.090> up<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:56.540> moves<00:03:56.780> back<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:57.260> World

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
gets messed up and moves back to World

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.790 
gets messed up and moves back to World
Space<00:03:57.800> Center<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.810> I<00:03:59.840> have<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.200> hit<00:04:00.320> my<00:04:00.530> center

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
Space Center so I have to hit my center

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.430 
Space Center so I have to hit my center
pivot<00:04:01.100> but<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.990> difference<00:04:03.320> between

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
pivot but the difference between

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.890 
pivot but the difference between
grouping<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.190> combining<00:04:04.520> is<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:05.000> don't<00:04:05.090> longer

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
grouping and combining is I don't longer

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.810 
grouping and combining is I don't longer
have<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.410> ability<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.920> go<00:04:07.220> into<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.640> other

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
have the ability to go into the other

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.560 
have the ability to go into the other
object<00:04:08.390> okay<00:04:09.380> this<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:09.890> one<00:04:10.340> object<00:04:10.820> so<00:04:11.360> this

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
object okay this is one object so this

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.870 
object okay this is one object so this
ports<00:04:11.959> over<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.350> applications<00:04:13.100> better<00:04:13.370> when

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
ports over to applications better when

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.260 
ports over to applications better when
you<00:04:14.000> combine<00:04:15.100> when<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.190> group<00:04:16.520> it<00:04:16.790> only<00:04:16.970> lives

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
you combine when you group it only lives

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.449 
you combine when you group it only lives
in<00:04:17.540> Maya<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.230> anytime<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.739> pour<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.070> over<00:04:19.160> to

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
in Maya so anytime you pour it over to

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.040 
in Maya so anytime you pour it over to
another<00:04:19.669> program<00:04:20.230> it<00:04:21.430> necessarily<00:04:22.430> breaks<00:04:23.210> so

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.480 

now<00:04:27.050> let's<00:04:27.290> go<00:04:27.440> in<00:04:27.560> here<00:04:27.590> go<00:04:28.250> my<00:04:28.460> separate

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
now let's go in here go my separate

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.270 
now let's go in here go my separate
again<00:04:31.490> what<00:04:32.090> happens<00:04:32.540> here<00:04:32.840> is<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.950> get<00:04:34.250> a

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
again what happens here is you get a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.150 
again what happens here is you get a
group<00:04:34.669> formation<00:04:35.120> first<00:04:35.660> so<00:04:36.560> when<00:04:37.070> you

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
group formation first so when you

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.520 
group formation first so when you
separate<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:37.940> breaks<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:38.750> up<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.020> group<00:04:39.320> and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
separate it breaks it up to a group and

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.180 
separate it breaks it up to a group and
if<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.490> want<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:40.850> out<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.720> group<00:04:42.190> middle

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
if you want it out of the group middle

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.220 
if you want it out of the group middle
mouse<00:04:43.340> button<00:04:43.370> click<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.090> drag<00:04:44.300> outside<00:04:45.020> that

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
mouse button click and drag outside that

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.700 
mouse button click and drag outside that
group<00:04:45.440> structure

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.500 

click<00:04:50.710> on<00:04:50.830> both<00:04:51.040> objects<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:51.670> edit<00:04:52.000> delete<00:04:52.360> by

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
click on both objects and edit delete by

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:02.110 
click on both objects and edit delete by
type<00:04:52.690> history<00:04:53.970> okay<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:57.090> center<00:04:58.090> pivot

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.310 

so<00:05:02.690> keep<00:05:03.320> a<00:05:03.470> clean<00:05:03.740> scene<00:05:04.570> keep<00:05:05.570> only<00:05:05.840> meshes

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
so keep a clean scene keep only meshes

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.400 
so keep a clean scene keep only meshes
in<00:05:06.350> here<00:05:06.740> if<00:05:06.979> possible<00:05:07.720> whenever<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.930> see

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
in here if possible whenever I see

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.290 
in here if possible whenever I see
things<00:05:10.310> like<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:11.350> shape<00:05:12.350> nodes<00:05:12.710> or<00:05:13.120> some<00:05:14.120> kind

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
things like the shape nodes or some kind

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.270 
things like the shape nodes or some kind

of transform nodes or anything in here

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.760 
of transform nodes or anything in here
you<00:05:17.240> know<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.360> marked<00:05:17.840> students<00:05:18.260> down<00:05:18.440> for<00:05:18.710> the
