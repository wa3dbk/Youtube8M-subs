00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
in four sections and each section I just

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.959

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.569

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.719 
leave it like this if you don't you know
if<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.090> like<00:01:25.270> there's<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.689> flatter<00:01:25.960> look<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:27.640> I

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
if you like there's a flatter look but I

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.069 
if you like there's a flatter look but I
know<00:01:27.789> so<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.810> want<00:01:29.469> to<00:01:29.649> separate<00:01:30.159> each<00:01:30.490> piece

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
know so I want to separate each piece

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.740 
know so I want to separate each piece
into<00:01:32.079> two<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.909> like<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.060> den<00:01:34.360> mother<00:01:34.390> to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.969 
into two just like a den mother to
company<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:39.009> so<00:01:39.189> far<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.729> do<00:01:39.789> like<00:01:40.209> it<00:01:40.979> last

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979

night when I didn't when I do my twist

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.169 
night when I didn't when I do my twist
it<00:01:44.380> seemed<00:01:44.619> like<00:01:44.799> it<00:01:44.979> left<00:01:45.219> to<00:01:45.490> warm<00:01:45.700> my<00:01:45.909> name

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.649 
it seemed like it left to warm my name
instead<00:01:47.020> I<00:01:47.049> was<00:01:47.200> having<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.679> shrink<00:01:48.009> up<00:01:48.189> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
instead I was having it shrink up I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.660 
instead I was having it shrink up I
don't<00:01:49.659> know<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:50.110> was<00:01:50.799> be<00:01:51.009> able<00:01:51.069> to<00:01:51.220> do<00:01:51.459> them

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
don't know I was be able to do them

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.699 
don't know I was be able to do them
during<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.119> day<00:01:52.329> and<00:01:52.750> then<00:01:52.929> it<00:01:53.079> dry<00:01:53.319> like<00:01:53.530> I'm

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
during the day and then it dry like I'm

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.729 
during the day and then it dry like I'm
her<00:01:53.860> dryer<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:57.579> we've<00:01:57.880> gone<00:01:58.060> on<00:01:58.239> wet

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
her dryer and that's we've gone on wet

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:01.410 
her dryer and that's we've gone on wet
they<00:01:59.739> would<00:02:00.009> have<00:02:00.129> like<00:02:00.369> wrinkled<00:02:01.030> up<00:02:01.119> and

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
they would have like wrinkled up and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.459 
they would have like wrinkled up and
right<00:02:01.569> back<00:02:02.039> so<00:02:03.539> just<00:02:04.539> out<00:02:04.689> what<00:02:04.899> doesn't<00:02:05.319> have

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
right back so just out what doesn't have

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:14.640 
right back so just out what doesn't have
more<00:02:05.799> length<00:02:06.039> to<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:12.629> they<00:02:13.629> also<00:02:13.870> have<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
more length to it they also have of the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.030 
more length to it they also have of the
loft<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:16.120> if<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.540> had<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.930> gloss<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.590> will<00:02:17.860> put

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
loft and if I had that gloss I will put

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.629 
loft and if I had that gloss I will put
a<00:02:18.069> little<00:02:18.310> bit<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.549> my<00:02:18.700> fingertips<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.590> then

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:20.639 
a little bit on my fingertips and then

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.340 
a little bit on my fingertips and then
separate<00:02:21.639> them<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.170> would

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
separate them like that and that would

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.379 
separate them like that and that would
eliminate<00:02:23.560> from<00:02:23.950> me<00:02:24.100> any<00:02:24.310> frizz<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.090> add

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:25.389 
eliminate from me any frizz and add

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.830 
eliminate from me any frizz and add
shine<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.400> instead<00:02:27.760> I'm<00:02:28.150> fighting<00:02:28.510> am<00:02:28.630> using

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
shine so instead I'm fighting am using

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:52.050 
shine so instead I'm fighting am using
my<00:02:29.200> shaker

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.600 

but<00:02:53.060> if<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.360> fully<00:02:53.720> separated<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.920> fluffed

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
but if this fully separated and fluffed

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.460 
but if this fully separated and fluffed
out

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.440 

that's<00:03:03.400> why<00:03:03.490> I<00:03:03.610> just<00:03:03.880> took<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.030> little<00:03:04.210> bit<00:03:04.390> of

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
that's why I just took a little bit of

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.420 
that's why I just took a little bit of
my<00:03:04.630> shea<00:03:04.840> butter<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.890> know<00:03:06.010> put<00:03:06.220> on<00:03:06.310> my

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
my shea butter and you know put on my

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.270 
my shea butter and you know put on my
tips<00:03:06.700> but<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.090> separate<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:09.010> nice<00:03:09.250> and

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
tips but I separate it so it's nice and

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.180 
tips but I separate it so it's nice and
shiny<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:11.200> was<00:03:11.320> nice<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.530> shiny<00:03:11.830> either

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
shiny it was nice and shiny either
