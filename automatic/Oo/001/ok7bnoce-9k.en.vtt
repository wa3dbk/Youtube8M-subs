 At the point of deployment offered at the beginning 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.520
 one picture involved three cars 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.010

 the car still a person in sat on 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.240

 The driver of the citroen became easy 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.680
 injured 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.240

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.370
