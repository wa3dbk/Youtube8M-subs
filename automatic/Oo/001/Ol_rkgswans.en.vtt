00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
and on the shoulders which I was kind of

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.130 
and on the shoulders which I was kind of
concerned<00:02:34.360> with<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.660> shoulders<00:02:34.930> because<00:02:35.020> it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
concerned with the shoulders because it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.990 
concerned with the shoulders because it
makes<00:02:35.260> your<00:02:35.410> shoulders<00:02:35.740> look<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> little

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
makes your shoulders look like a little

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.180 
makes your shoulders look like a little
more<00:02:37.210> broad<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.870> like<00:02:38.050> more<00:02:38.320> boxy<00:02:38.860> than<00:02:39.070> they

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
more broad and like more boxy than they

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.250 
more broad and like more boxy than they
are<00:02:39.370> already<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.360> if<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.540> have<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:41.080> more

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
are already so if you have like more

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.810 
are already so if you have like more
broad<00:02:41.470> shoulders<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.980> probably<00:02:42.550> wouldn't

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
broad shoulders you probably wouldn't

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.820 
broad shoulders you probably wouldn't
like<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.060> feature<00:02:43.270> very<00:02:43.600> much<00:02:43.810> but<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.410> think

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
like that feature very much but I think

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.530 
like that feature very much but I think
it<00:02:44.920> looks<00:02:44.950> pretty<00:02:45.160> nice<00:02:45.460> and<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:46.030> has<00:02:46.240> sort<00:02:46.420> of

it looks pretty nice and it has sort of

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.770 
it looks pretty nice and it has sort of
like<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.860> flap<00:02:47.970> opening<00:02:48.970> when<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.480> close<00:02:49.750> it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780

it's<00:05:08.700> just<00:05:08.850> like<00:05:08.910> cream<00:05:09.330> color<00:05:09.600> which<00:05:09.870> isn't
