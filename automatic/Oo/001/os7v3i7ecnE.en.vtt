00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.150

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.130
 ask once the app download 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.590

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.620
 Mine that the value is not strange is this 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.390
 application that makes your speech louder 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.539
 other apps say they left 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.129

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.960
 need to download the programs and even 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.559
 it takes much longer but this app 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:59.570
 what music involves strange if low 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:02.910
 For your part, by the play in store. 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:08.119

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:15.250
 At that time, the musician was 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.250

 now it looks like height and it got 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.120
 think 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.610
 information such as jal 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.250
