00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
curls out at the root and then also

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.199 
curls out at the root and then also
adding<00:02:10.299> more<00:02:10.479> volume<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.700> product<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
adding more volume and the product is a

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.920 
adding more volume and the product is a
cream<00:02:13.600> which<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.700> seems<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.850> generally<00:02:16.269> work<00:02:16.690> a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
cream which I seems to generally work a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.420 
cream which I seems to generally work a
little<00:02:17.079> bit<00:02:17.290> better<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.620> creams<00:02:17.889> do<00:02:18.100> because

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
little bit better the creams do because

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.740 
little bit better the creams do because
they<00:02:18.579> seem<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.239> little<00:02:19.449> bit<00:02:19.600> more

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
they seem to be a little bit more

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.220 
they seem to be a little bit more
moisture

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
moisture

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.520 
moisture
rising<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:22.269> know<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.080> just<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.470> idea

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
rising and I know I just like the idea

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.880 
rising and I know I just like the idea
of<00:02:23.769> using<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.129> cream<00:02:24.400> as<00:02:24.580> opposed<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.060> gel

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
of using a cream as opposed to a gel

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.759 
of using a cream as opposed to a gel
sometimes<00:02:26.890> um<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:29.080> oh<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.900> by<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:31.989> way<00:02:32.140> it

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
sometimes um so oh and by the way it

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.930 
sometimes um so oh and by the way it
costs<00:02:33.360> originally<00:02:34.620> originally<00:02:35.620> $8<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.790> it

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
costs originally originally $8 and it

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.690 
costs originally originally $8 and it
was<00:02:37.060> at<00:02:37.180> Marshall's<00:02:37.510> for<00:02:37.690> 399<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:41.519> anyways<00:02:42.519> it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
was at Marshall's for 399 so anyways it

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.150 
was at Marshall's for 399 so anyways it
after<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.940> dried<00:02:46.239> for<00:02:46.599> about<00:02:46.750> an<00:02:46.840> hour<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.650> 45

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
after it dried for about an hour and 45

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.420 
after it dried for about an hour and 45
minutes<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.730> arrest<00:02:49.629> I<00:02:50.200> noticed<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.159> every

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
minutes to arrest I noticed that every

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.170 
minutes to arrest I noticed that every
single<00:02:51.640> section<00:02:52.030> was<00:02:52.450> curled<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:54.489> really<00:02:55.000> like

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
single section was curled it really like

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.270 
single section was curled it really like
activated<00:02:56.170> my<00:02:56.260> curls<00:02:56.560> more<00:02:56.709> than<00:02:56.860> any<00:02:57.010> other

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
activated my curls more than any other

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.740 
activated my curls more than any other
product<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.610> I've<00:02:57.760> ever<00:02:57.910> used<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.599> they

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
product that I've ever used and they

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.259 
product that I've ever used and they
sprung<00:02:59.500> up<00:02:59.709> so<00:03:00.160> much<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.730> they<00:03:00.819> were<00:03:00.879> like

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
sprung up so much and they were like

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.680 
sprung up so much and they were like
tiny<00:03:01.900> tiny<00:03:02.260> tiny<00:03:02.349> little<00:03:02.680> ringlets<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.690> it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
tiny tiny tiny little ringlets and it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.569 
tiny tiny tiny little ringlets and it
defined<00:03:05.170> them<00:03:05.470> they<00:03:05.650> all<00:03:05.799> separate<00:03:06.280> instead

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
defined them they all separate instead

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.330 
defined them they all separate instead
of<00:03:06.670> clumping<00:03:07.000> together<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:08.950> really

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
of clumping together and that I really

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.440 
of clumping together and that I really
liked<00:03:09.549> I<00:03:10.269> liked<00:03:10.900> how<00:03:11.170> much<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:12.060> amplified<00:03:13.060> my

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
curls and how much it separated them

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.830 
curls and how much it separated them
without<00:03:18.640> me<00:03:18.879> actually<00:03:19.299> having<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.690> go<00:03:19.810> through

without me actually having to go through

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.770 
without me actually having to go through
and<00:03:20.170> separate<00:03:20.560> each<00:03:20.769> curl<00:03:21.099> but<00:03:21.879> after<00:03:22.690> the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
that it had a lot of hold so I felt like

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.250

cold air hot day the weather really
wouldn't<00:04:14.139> affect<00:04:14.739> my<00:04:15.609> curls<00:04:16.030> too<00:04:16.329> much<00:04:16.510> like

wouldn't affect my curls too much like

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.330

sometimes<00:04:17.349> if<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.560> use<00:04:17.590> products<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.099> don't

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
sometimes if you use products that don't

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.210 
sometimes if you use products that don't
have<00:04:18.459> enough<00:04:18.699> hold<00:04:18.970> like<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.660> heat<00:04:20.220> the

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
have enough hold like the heat the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.640 
have enough hold like the heat the
humidity<00:04:21.430> or<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.570> cold<00:04:22.900> air<00:04:23.139> and<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:23.440> wind

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
humidity or the cold air and the wind

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.580 
humidity or the cold air and the wind
just<00:04:23.979> like<00:04:24.099> completely<00:04:25.050> puffs<00:04:26.050> your<00:04:26.349> hair<00:04:26.560> out

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
just like completely puffs your hair out

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.620 
just like completely puffs your hair out
so<00:04:27.010> I<00:04:27.370> like<00:04:27.639> that<00:04:27.669> it<00:04:27.940> did<00:04:28.090> have<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.300> little<00:04:28.539> bit

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
so I like that it did have a little bit

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.060 
so I like that it did have a little bit
of<00:04:28.810> hold<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.169> wasn't<00:04:29.320> too<00:04:29.590> slop<00:04:29.860> but<00:04:30.010> it

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
of hold and it wasn't too slop but it

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.830 
of hold and it wasn't too slop but it
was<00:04:30.159> just<00:04:30.310> too<00:04:30.550> much<00:04:30.789> hold<00:04:31.120> for<00:04:31.360> me<00:04:31.450> and<00:04:31.750> when<00:04:32.680> I

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
was just too much hold for me and when I

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.170 
was just too much hold for me and when I
went<00:04:32.990> in<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.199> blow-dry<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:34.040> didn't<00:04:34.550> my<00:04:34.910> curls

normally and I just didn't like how it
felt<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:44.150> didn't<00:04:44.900> hate<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.410> product<00:04:45.830> but

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
felt so I didn't hate the product but

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.450 
felt so I didn't hate the product but
