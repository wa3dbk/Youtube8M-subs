00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 so I had salmon is known to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.370
 people, if you ever heard of this 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.960
 mark before 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.300
 You're probably coming. 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.870
 related to something a 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.330
 Cooling such as gloves or 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.070
 even computer cabinets as well 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.439
 am it is related to products of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.869
 audio including I recommended a product 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.090
 them a very small microphone of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.550
 lapel I wore for a long time, which is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.470
 a very good microphone though guys like 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:43.890
 is that this mark goes out in relation to 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:48.270
 mouses this video is sponsored by fg 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 tech and then beauty galley from and since then 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.260
 but the video this time the guys I'm going 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.600
 bring to you by mouse review 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.190
 salman gm gm 3 eclipse that is this evil 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.870
 What are you people watching then? 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 this mouse was made for the public 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.299
 gamer then they cite that this evil of him 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.180
 especially good was made to be 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.670
 used in games and if mouse then has six 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.040
 buttons plus scroll with functions 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.799
 fully configurable by software and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.570
 the business of this mouse I think the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.430
 first thing and see what 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.280
 it's a little different then they 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.770
 were a little creative I would say in 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.689
 appearance of the year mouse it seems to be 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.180
 less ergonomic so looking at it 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.990
 he thinks it does not look like it fits 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.060
 very well in your hand in an aspect to 5 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.350
 that he seems to want to impress with the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.119
 his vision so he has a little vision 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.070
 different this is something that can 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.720
 please some and may not please 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.280
 others but in the end does not 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.920
 much difference 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 because you'll probably be with the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.380
 hand on top of him and not looking at him 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.240
 but in the matter of ergonomics this 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.070
 mouse it is not bad and economically 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.659
 but it's also not as good as 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.299
 other models I've tested some 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.610
 other bad ones such as cm only one 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.590
 rich or should join 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.030
 they are much more economical if they 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.720
 fits better in the hand and 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.670
 use an eclipse even though it does not 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.100
 be so economical 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.510
 he is a good mouse he fits well in 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.670
 your hand after a customary time 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.830
 natural has just gotten used to it 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.080
 it 's not an uncomfortable mouse if you 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.209
 look at it and so be in doubt 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.830
 but is this mouse comfortable already 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.520
 that he has this strange look and 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.110
 different 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.450
 do not worry about it because it does not 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.440
 it's an uncomfortable mouse it's a good mouse 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.020
 however they try not to attract with this 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.760
 very creative visual 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.360
 I think the biggest criticism I would have 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.840
 with regard to his appearance is economy 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.570
 it would be the scrolling issue of the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.390
 Spanish Emilio Peixe and I 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.920
 I would rather find more 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.660
 cool if he was a little school 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.790
 the wider I think I 'd be a little 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.620
 more comfort but other than that he is a 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.600
 Mouse well comfortable guys and in beautiful 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.610
 depending on the taste of the user 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.250
 the eclipse does not have any kind of 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.320
 LED lighting or customization in this 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.390
 on the other hand the crew with a 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.690
 great difference of this mouse is that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.450
 can add or remove up to six weights 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.049
 of four grams each, that is, 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.049
 change the weight of the mouse by up to 24 grams and 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.200
 the total weight of the mouse without any is thus 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.900
 one edition is 115 grams ie it can 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.299
 change the total weight of the mouse by about 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.040
 20% and this is something that can then 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.350
 please some users who like 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.329
 to play this kind of thing to me is a 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.799
 Which does not make much difference to me. 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.630
 I usually prefer the mouse to be 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.820
 simply a reservation is possible 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.910
 but in the crowd the fact that they put 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.540
 this allows a mouse to be more 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.420
 with regard to the taste of 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.650
 users with weight then this can 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.720
 become interesting if 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.150
 necessarily wants evil to be 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.370
 very heavy what bad is very light 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.280
 So you can do this. 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.590
 customization on it but it has a good 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.150
 feeling about his quality . 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.989
 does not realize that it is a good product 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.690
 quality 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.159
 he does not pass there is the feeling that he 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.860
 It will break fast at the 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.010
 contrary 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.720
 it is a very robust plastic product 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.910
 it looks like a quality plastic 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.950
 including the weight system which is a 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.660
 system that could be a bit fragile 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.330
 have some fragility and 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.460
 ease in breaking seems to be robust 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.860
 and you probably will not have any 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.250
 problem in that sense with him 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.430
 the sensor of this mouse is the bum 9800 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.990
 galley and has incredible 8 thousand and 200 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.420
 pique in my opinion is more than 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.590
 anyone could possibly want 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.940
 of sensitivity 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.220
 reminding the people who defend the 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.110
 sensitivity and do not need 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.630
 the dependents can be configured 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.660
 then the interval of 200 of ipi 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.310
 the minimum being also 200 of ipi with 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.160
 relation to the need of this evil of the galera 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.040
 he is a he he has a sensor or the wave 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.919
 9800 is very precise it looks like 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.040
 the 3090 spot is up to a little bit 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:13.010
 better in speed characteristics 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.450
 of acceleration and detection and you 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.100
 probably will not notice any 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.930
 problem of treatment no problem 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.479
 no acceleration problem it is 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.370
 simply a sensor 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.320
 very cool and you guys can play 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.960
 quietly with him being players 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.580
 low or high sensitivity and beyond 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.400
 In addition, it also has a 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.110
 thousand defendants and is the rate of 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.390
 standard update and for all bad 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.630
 to make a mouse software is possible 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.300
 then set the adp and mouse to 200 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.060
 up to eight thousand two hundred and 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.270
 200 from ipi and then the mouse it can have 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.080
 up to four stages of de ipi that can 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.640
 change with wine shortcuts on top of the mouse 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.770
 for example changing defends within the game 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.990
 a clinician a click or something 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.020
 so it can also change the function 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.330
 of all nine buttons from clicks 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.000
 normal mouse and even marks or functions 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.950
 multimedia and this can then split 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.870
 all these settings in up to three 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.330
 benefits in relation to the cable guys and 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.270
 simon if he has a locked car like 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.280
 is to be expected from mice games today in 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.960
 day it also has a connector then 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.110
 gold plated, which adds a 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.510
 little durability to the connector 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.970
 value of this evil if people 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.760
 moment of posting this video is about 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.210
 of 160 reais and this gives a 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.890
 interesting product benefit is 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.190
 of a product that has good quality of 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:40.790
 construction a good sensor of high 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.980
 sensitivity 11 11 11 that offers 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.490
 customizations such as power 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.190
 change his weight but without 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.240
 lose functions like macro or buttons 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.860
 customizable 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.870
 this can be a very 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.970
 interesting for 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.290
 because it has all the quality of 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.270
 products use 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.740
 On the other hand, a product 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.800
 maybe a little more 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:07.490
 comfortable maybe ambidextrous or maybe 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.020
 a little more ergonomic has a macros 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.060
 a little more complete program 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.310
 lighting when viewing this product is not 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.930
 the right product for you however it is a 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.360
 mouse very nice guys on a mouse 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.580
 very good at the time I played with him is 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.740
 I could do whatever I wanted 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.790
 to do it did not leave me in 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.200
 no sense 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.700
 so I finish my review around here 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.890
 thanks guys, because in this style and 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.750
 do not stop giving light if you liked 

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.490
 be sure to also go to the 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.290
 fgts provided us with this product for 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.820
 do this review and do not forget to 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.250
