00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.750 

so<00:00:01.290> let's<00:00:01.469> look<00:00:01.650> at<00:00:01.829> Cherokee<00:00:02.159> shuffle<00:00:02.639> as<00:00:02.730> a

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
so let's look at Cherokee shuffle as a

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.340 
so let's look at Cherokee shuffle as a
way<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> break<00:00:03.270> out<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.480> those<00:00:03.659> patterns<00:00:03.959> of

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
way to break out of those patterns of

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.720 
way to break out of those patterns of
the<00:00:09.500> so<00:00:10.500> what<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:10.950> do<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.400> can<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.700> a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
the so what you can do is you can do a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.610 
the so what you can do is you can do a
modification<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.780> forward<00:00:13.080> backward<00:00:13.230> roll

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
modification of a forward backward roll

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.799 
modification of a forward backward roll
simply<00:00:14.009> by<00:00:14.130> skipping<00:00:14.460> out<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> note<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.599> can

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
simply by skipping out a note so you can

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:27.109 
simply by skipping out a note so you can
go<00:00:16.130> instead<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.279> going<00:00:25.760> that<00:00:26.760> would<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.029> an

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
go instead of going that would be an

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.839 
go instead of going that would be an
interesting<00:00:27.269> intro<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.429> forward

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
interesting intro so you do a forward

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.830 
interesting intro so you do a forward
backward<00:00:30.000> roll<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.869> skip<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> note

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
backward roll but you skip out a note

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.240 
backward roll but you skip out a note
and<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.460> thumb<00:00:36.300> index<00:00:36.950> thumb<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and then you do a thumb index thumb and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.650 
and then you do a thumb index thumb and
you<00:00:38.340> skip<00:00:38.610> out<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> middle<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
you skip out the middle and you can do a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.209 
you skip out the middle and you can do a
little<00:00:46.559> kind<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.100> modified<00:00:48.030> Milotic<00:00:48.690> run

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.389 

and<00:00:53.219> then<00:00:53.489> instead<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.879> doing<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.510 

modified<00:00:59.399> forward<00:00:59.730> backward<00:01:00.149> roll<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.930> can

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
modified forward backward roll you can

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:15.649 
modified forward backward roll you can
do<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.559> backward<00:01:04.559> roll<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.790> then

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
do just the a backward roll so and then

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.780 
do just the a backward roll so and then
the<00:01:15.810> end<00:01:15.990> tag<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.590> actually<00:01:17.009> instead<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.369> doing

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the end tag is actually instead of doing

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.330 
the end tag is actually instead of doing
a<00:01:18.090> thumb<00:01:18.840> index<00:01:19.470> you're<00:01:19.740> actually<00:01:20.009> doing<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
a thumb index you're actually doing a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:38.429 
a thumb index you're actually doing a
thumb<00:01:20.600> middle

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:02:22.710 

and<00:01:39.439> then<00:01:39.680> for<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.009> second<00:01:40.430> part<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.619> can<00:01:42.619> go

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:53.470 

some<00:02:23.720> interesting<00:02:24.230> licks<00:02:24.470> there<00:02:24.799> is

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.630 

so<00:02:54.480> there's<00:02:54.660> all<00:02:54.870> really<00:02:55.230> subtle<00:02:55.860> variations

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
so there's all really subtle variations

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:19.699 
so there's all really subtle variations
that<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.879> can<00:02:57.000> do<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.629> that<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:19.380> what<00:03:19.500> you're

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
that you can do on that so what you're

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.050 
that you can do on that so what you're
doing<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.040> really<00:03:20.250> breaking<00:03:20.610> under<00:03:20.910> those

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
doing is really breaking under those

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.759 
doing is really breaking under those
patterns<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.660> you're<00:03:21.810> still<00:03:22.110> kind<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.470> doing

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
patterns and you're still kind of doing

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.319 
patterns and you're still kind of doing
forward<00:03:23.130> backward<00:03:23.549> rules<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.030> you're<00:03:24.180> really

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
forward backward rules but you're really

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.210 
forward backward rules but you're really
separating<00:03:25.110> now<00:03:25.260> breaking<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.920> out<00:03:26.040> into

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
separating now breaking it out into

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:44.599 
separating now breaking it out into
components<00:03:26.879> and<00:03:27.030> doing<00:03:27.329> like<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.450> then<00:03:43.609> doing

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
components and doing like and then doing

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.640 
components and doing like and then doing
instead<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.299> slide<00:03:45.600> on<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:46.109> standard

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
instead of a slide on that standard

00:03:46.650 --> 00:04:00.860 
instead of a slide on that standard
first<00:03:47.010> beat

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.030 

and<00:04:01.870> what<00:04:02.020> it<00:04:02.140> does<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.530> provides<00:04:02.920> a

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
and what it does is it provides a

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.800 
and what it does is it provides a
different<00:04:03.220> bit<00:04:03.550> of<00:04:03.640> syncopation<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.570> puts

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
different bit of syncopation it puts

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.110 
different bit of syncopation it puts
spaces<00:04:05.650> in<00:04:05.830> when<00:04:06.100> you're<00:04:06.310> not<00:04:06.340> expecting<00:04:06.610> the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
spaces in when you're not expecting the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.730 
spaces in when you're not expecting the
space<00:04:07.420> and<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.320> really<00:04:08.650> colors<00:04:10.440> colors<00:04:11.440> that

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
space and it really colors colors that

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.220 
space and it really colors colors that
solo<00:04:12.160> instead<00:04:12.700> of<00:04:12.880> just<00:04:13.150> standing<00:04:13.540> sounding

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
solo instead of just standing sounding

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.840 
solo instead of just standing sounding
like<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.590> wall<00:04:14.890> of<00:04:15.070> sound<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.700> can

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
like that wall of sound that can

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.490 
like that wall of sound that can
sometimes<00:04:16.090> happens<00:04:16.720> when<00:04:16.870> you're<00:04:16.989> just<00:04:17.170> doing

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
sometimes happens when you're just doing

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.590 
sometimes happens when you're just doing
forward<00:04:17.800> backward<00:04:18.730> rolls<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.120> alternating

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
forward backward rolls and alternating

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.250 
forward backward rolls and alternating
thumbs<00:04:19.930> hope<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:21.870> helps<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:22.960> out<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.080> little

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
thumbs hope that helps you out a little

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.380 
thumbs hope that helps you out a little
bit<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.710> if<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.100> want<00:04:24.370> some<00:04:24.640> of<00:04:24.670> those<00:04:24.820> tab

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
bit and if you want some of those tab

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.620 
bit and if you want some of those tab
don't<00:04:25.720> for<00:04:25.960> you<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.290> can<00:04:26.500> ask<00:04:26.890> me<00:04:27.190> or<00:04:27.460> if<00:04:28.450> you

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
don't for you you can ask me or if you

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.870 
don't for you you can ask me or if you
want<00:04:28.810> close-ups<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.830> my<00:04:30.010> left<00:04:30.250> hand<00:04:30.580> or<00:04:30.760> my
