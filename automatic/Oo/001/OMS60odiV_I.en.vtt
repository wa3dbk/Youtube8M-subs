00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
but it's a glass

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.090 
but it's a glass
I've<00:00:33.809> called<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> ice<00:00:34.410> through<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:34.920> whole

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
I've called it ice through my whole

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.180 
I've called it ice through my whole
walkthrough<00:00:35.540> but<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.719> close<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.350> let's<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
walkthrough but it's close so let's and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.209 
walkthrough but it's close so let's and
what<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.180> score<00:00:40.129> with<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
what I do now is score with the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.810 
what I do now is score with the
basketball

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
basketball

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.670 
basketball
it's<00:00:42.390> very<00:00:42.600> important<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> score<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
it's very important to score with that

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.610 
it's very important to score with that
basketball<00:00:44.570> because<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> miss<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
basketball because if you miss the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889 
basketball because if you miss the
bowling<00:00:46.950> ball<00:00:47.129> will<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.399> reach<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.000> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
bowling ball will not reach it so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.439 
bowling ball will not reach it so
there's<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:50.660> let's<00:00:51.660> head<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:53.360> 1:22

have<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.550> go<00:02:50.880> down<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.840> do<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.170> no<00:02:52.620> we

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
have it go down so if we can do it no we

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.960 
have it go down so if we can do it no we
can't<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.640> course<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:54.060> can't<00:02:54.330> but<00:02:55.670> there<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.790> is

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
but you see how it works

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.500

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.729 

125<00:03:13.880> what's<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.090> I'll<00:03:15.510> split<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.200> balls

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739

that<00:03:31.890> actually<00:03:32.250> work<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.030> did<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:34.370> thought

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
that actually work that it did I thought

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.670 
that actually work that it did I thought
I<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.900> didn't<00:03:36.900> know<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.989> hit<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.440> thought<00:03:37.650> I

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
I I didn't know I hit that I thought I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.280 
I I didn't know I hit that I thought I
hit<00:03:37.829> just<00:03:38.070> once<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.549> I<00:03:38.579> hit<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.760> twice<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.299> okay

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
hit just once but I hit it twice so okay

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.289 
hit just once but I hit it twice so okay
here's<00:03:40.530> another<00:03:40.590> one<00:03:40.920> splitting<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.610> balls

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:56.500 

so<00:03:45.299> if<00:03:45.360> we<00:03:45.540> can<00:03:45.630> get<00:03:45.750> three<00:03:46.110> stars<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.709> no<00:03:52.370> man

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.350 

let's<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:57.660> count<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.020> off<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.380> wall<00:03:58.590> there

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
let's just count it off that wall there

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.950 
let's just count it off that wall there
there<00:04:00.360> we<00:04:00.540> go

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
there we go

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.390 
there we go
I'll<00:04:01.050> come<00:04:01.440> on<00:04:01.650> now<00:04:03.500> do<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.560> again<00:04:07.100> one<00:04:08.100> more

I'll come on now do it again one more
time<00:04:10.340> there<00:04:11.340> we<00:04:11.370> go<00:04:13.760> got<00:04:14.760> lucky<00:04:15.120> on<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.270> one

got lucky on that one no doubt about it
Roy<00:04:22.980> 127<00:04:23.880> it's<00:04:24.000> almost<00:04:24.240> over<00:04:24.690> man<00:04:26.630> okay<00:04:27.630> where

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
Roy 127 it's almost over man okay where

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:37.940 
Roy 127 it's almost over man okay where
we<00:04:27.990> doing<00:04:28.200> here<00:04:28.350> oh<00:04:28.680> yes<00:04:29.220> oh<00:04:29.870> yes<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:36.710> could<00:04:37.710> go

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
we doing here oh yes oh yes I could go

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.660 
we doing here oh yes oh yes I could go
ahead<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.250> use<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.460> bomb<00:04:38.640> again<00:04:41.870> on<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:43.140> I

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
ahead and use the bomb again on that I

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.980 
ahead and use the bomb again on that I
think<00:04:44.670> it's<00:04:44.940> easiest<00:04:45.300> way<00:04:45.420> to<00:04:45.450> do<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:45.810> one

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
think it's easiest way to do that one

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.630 
think it's easiest way to do that one
and<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.170> like<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:46.470> just<00:04:46.620> use<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:47.160> bomb<00:04:47.310> on<00:04:47.460> this

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
and I like to just use the bomb on this

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.090 
and I like to just use the bomb on this
one<00:04:47.880> too
