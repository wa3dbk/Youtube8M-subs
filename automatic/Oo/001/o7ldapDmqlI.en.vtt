00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.630
 what would happen if we didn't have to pay the bills for the consumption of 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.189
 home fresh water 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.120
 from here there are scenarios a man for the consumer 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.710
 almost a dream, never more than a dream, as a world without bills seems 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.419
 be really possible 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.970
 haflinger is the name of the system that performs this miracle 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.440
 the house for the right is nature, optimizing resources like water 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.790
 the sun and wind and transforming the domestic merge, the carrier of this 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 system is called an electrolyser a device that produces hydrogen a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.410
 energy carrier that is stored and feeds electricity and gas by escaping 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.510
 missing the sun mansutti in the wind the water is the one that dances collected in one

 suntech gold photovoltaics 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.540
 when hydrogen is obtained it is confirmed in low pressure cylinders or yes 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.860
 transforms into energy for domestic use 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.650
 finally the disposal of waste water we have passed through the life cycle - 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.340
 nitrogen being a gas it activates the boiler the stove furnace but also the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.820
 your city but we must not forget the house positive energy the project 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.950
 the architect Mario Cucinella 100 square meters for 100 thousand euros energy 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.720
 used to heat the house but also for scarlet offers for utilities 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.670
 domestic water for hot water prevent everything from renewable sources and does not produce 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.080
 a single gram of carbon dioxide the house from 100 thousand euros to many spaces 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.820
 internal suggested sharing of colligative cards even talk about 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.410
 car sharing thinking about how much space such donald of parking lots and a limb 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 condominiums managed by the final photovoltaic and thermal solar system 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.619
 on the roof you cover the total consumption of the building the glass surfaces exploit 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.759
 at best the warmth of the sun even in winter and guarantee shorts 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.980
 while protection from solar radiation is possible from recipes 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.000
 horizontal and stopped to remain mobile 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.009
 there is also a rainwater collection tank 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.410
 vertical geothermal probes all ground water ester post event return 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.890
 state-of-the-art wind turbines and beautiful to look at that can be installed in the garden 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.219
 the dream home seems as much as possible boa logo
