00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710 

I<00:00:00.210> think<00:00:01.050> it's<00:00:01.170> incredibly<00:00:01.680> damaging<00:00:02.129> because

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:02.720 
I think it's incredibly damaging because

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.120 
I think it's incredibly damaging because
dr.<00:00:03.720> fryer<00:00:03.899> has<00:00:04.020> been<00:00:04.200> in<00:00:04.319> practice<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.920> guess

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
dr. fryer has been in practice I guess

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.330 
dr. fryer has been in practice I guess
since<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.759> 80s<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.960> it's<00:00:07.350> been<00:00:07.560> widely<00:00:07.980> known

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
since the 80s and it's been widely known

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.700 
since the 80s and it's been widely known
when<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.580> was<00:00:08.820> racing<00:00:09.320> people<00:00:10.320> who<00:00:10.410> are<00:00:10.500> with

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
when I was racing people who are with

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.919 
when I was racing people who are with
them<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.010> was<00:00:11.040> dramatic<00:00:11.630> dramatic<00:00:12.630> difference

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
them it was dramatic dramatic difference

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.680 
them it was dramatic dramatic difference
in<00:00:13.049> performance<00:00:13.969> but<00:00:14.969> then<00:00:15.150> there<00:00:15.269> was<00:00:15.330> huge

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
in performance but then there was huge

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.380 
in performance but then there was huge
drug<00:00:15.960> scandal<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.500> 1998<00:00:17.220> which<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.210> had<00:00:18.359> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
drug scandal in 1998 which we had a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.230 
drug scandal in 1998 which we had a
chance<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.840> clean<00:00:18.960> up<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> sport<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.800> then

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
chance to clean up the sport and then

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.599 
chance to clean up the sport and then
everybody<00:00:21.240> wanted<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.570> put<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> behind<00:00:22.050> us

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
everybody wanted to put it behind us

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.220 
everybody wanted to put it behind us
every<00:00:23.609> year<00:00:23.850> there's<00:00:24.060> been<00:00:24.359> another<00:00:24.840> scandal

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
that are really disrupting the system

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.269 
that are really disrupting the system
and<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.040> financial

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
there that there's very little evidence

nutrition<00:01:01.969> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.170> it's<00:01:04.170> even<00:01:04.920> people

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
nutrition you know I it's even people

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.030 
nutrition you know I it's even people
that<00:01:05.309> took<00:01:05.519> antioxidants<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:07.040> tremendous

that took antioxidants a tremendous
amount<00:01:08.189> early<00:01:08.610> 90s<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> shows<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> cells

antioxidants your body produces a lot of
stuff<00:01:16.500> naturally<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:19.290> still<00:01:19.890> gets<00:01:20.070> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
stuff naturally that it still gets to

stuff naturally that it still gets to
back<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.460> physiology<00:01:20.759> 101<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.439> that's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
back to physiology 101 that's it that's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
back to physiology 101 that's it that's
really<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:24.049> kind<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:26.180> cover<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.810> doping

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
really a kind of a cover for for doping

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.260 
really a kind of a cover for for doping
Greg<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> ask<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.490> question<00:01:29.549> were<00:01:30.090> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
Greg have to ask this question were you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.069 
Greg have to ask this question were you
ever<00:01:30.479> tempted<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.110> dope<00:01:31.290> during<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.740> career

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
ever tempted to dope during your career

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.800 
ever tempted to dope during your career
I'd<00:01:34.079> rather<00:01:34.340> not<00:01:35.340> win<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.970> race<00:01:36.360> than<00:01:36.659> be

I'd rather not win a race than be
positive<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.470> mean<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.850> winning

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
positive I mean just it's it's winning

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.120 
positive I mean just it's it's winning
the<00:01:39.570> race<00:01:39.720> wear<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:40.619> mask

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you're cheating it's kind of like taking

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.649 
you're cheating it's kind of like taking
a<00:01:43.340> shortcut<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> finish<00:01:44.909> line<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.360> mean<00:01:45.570> do

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
a shortcut to the finish line I mean do

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.620 
a shortcut to the finish line I mean do
you<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:45.960> win<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> race<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> mean<00:01:48.600> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you really win the race and so I mean I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.940 
you really win the race and so I mean I
I<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.610> very<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.329> think<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.439> end<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:52.890> career

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
I was very I think the end of my career

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.550 
I was very I think the end of my career
when<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.909> watched<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.390> rider<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:55.079> team<00:01:55.320> leave

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and he ended up dying just right after I

and I was saying that the riders

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.780 
and I was saying that the riders
themselves

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
themselves

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.580

one<00:02:12.060> constant<00:02:12.599> here<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> riders<00:02:13.319> keep

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
one constant here the riders keep

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.160 
one constant here the riders keep
changing<00:02:14.040> every<00:02:14.329> five<00:02:15.329> ten<00:02:15.629> years<00:02:15.870> there's

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
changing every five ten years there's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.720 
changing every five ten years there's
new<00:02:16.349> riders<00:02:16.769> but<00:02:16.980> one<00:02:17.189> thing<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.519> hasn't

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
new riders but one thing that hasn't

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.819 
new riders but one thing that hasn't
changed<00:02:17.939> is<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.450> same<00:02:18.659> doctors<00:02:19.140> are<00:02:19.319> in<00:02:19.620> there

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
changed is the same doctors are in there

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.940 
changed is the same doctors are in there
people<00:02:20.250> think<00:02:20.640> we'll<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.599> know<00:02:21.799> just<00:02:22.799> let

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
people think we'll you know just let

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.289 
people think we'll you know just let
them<00:02:23.040> take<00:02:23.219> whatever<00:02:23.489> they<00:02:23.640> want<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:24.150> these

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
them take whatever they want but these

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.300 
them take whatever they want but these
riders<00:02:24.540> they're<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.680> way<00:02:25.829> we're<00:02:26.010> all<00:02:26.129> like

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
riders they're in a way we're all like

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.550 
riders they're in a way we're all like
kids<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:27.390> want<00:02:27.599> parents<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.019> put<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> limits

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
kids we want parents that put the limits

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.589 
kids we want parents that put the limits
on<00:02:28.680> us<00:02:28.829> we<00:02:29.640> want<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.879> bounce<00:02:30.120> up<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.359> those

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
on us we want to bounce up to those

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.710 
on us we want to bounce up to those
limits<00:02:30.959> like<00:02:31.890> kids<00:02:32.189> want<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.549> but<00:02:33.269> in<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.629> end

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
limits like kids want to but in the end

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.300 
limits like kids want to but in the end
we<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.319> all<00:02:34.439> like<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.650> there's<00:02:34.980> there's

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
we we all like that there's there's

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.800 
we we all like that there's there's
somebody<00:02:35.670> there's<00:02:36.180> putting<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.480> brake<00:02:36.659> on

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
somebody there's putting a brake on

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.770 
somebody there's putting a brake on
everybody<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.450> most

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
everybody and and I think that most

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.750 
everybody and and I think that most
riders<00:02:40.019> never<00:02:40.319> intend<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.829> get<00:02:40.920> into<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.609> in

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
riders never intend to get into the in

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.030 
riders never intend to get into the in
bike<00:02:41.969> racing<00:02:42.359> or<00:02:42.540> any<00:02:42.659> sport<00:02:43.049> with<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
bike racing or any sport with the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.179 
bike racing or any sport with the
intention<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.519> doping<00:02:44.939> and<00:02:45.439> and<00:02:46.439> that's<00:02:46.980> where

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
intention of doping and and that's where

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:48.890 
intention of doping and and that's where
I<00:02:47.220> think<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.760> needs<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.269> come<00:02:48.480> from<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.720> top

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
I think it needs to come from the top

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.360 
I think it needs to come from the top
the<00:02:49.109> change<00:02:49.349> has<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.530> come<00:02:49.620> from<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.950> top

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
the change has to come from the top

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.580 
the change has to come from the top
well<00:02:51.150> talking<00:02:51.419> of<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> top<00:02:52.109> Greg<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:52.530> I'm

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
well talking of the top Greg and I'm

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.710 
well talking of the top Greg and I'm
quoting<00:02:52.799> here<00:02:53.189> the<00:02:53.340> UCI<00:02:53.700> say<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.329> today's

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
quoting here the UCI say that today's

quoting here the UCI say that today's
riders<00:02:55.230> are<00:02:55.379> subject<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.010> most

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
riders are subject to the most

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.339 
riders are subject to the most
innovative<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.909> effective<00:02:57.349> anti-doping

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
innovative and effective anti-doping

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.470 
innovative and effective anti-doping
measures<00:02:58.859> in<00:02:59.040> sports<00:02:59.430> but<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.120> still<00:03:00.329> see

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
measures in sports but you still see

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.599 
measures in sports but you still see
there<00:03:00.629> being<00:03:00.780> some<00:03:00.959> big<00:03:01.109> problems<00:03:01.470> there<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
there being some big problems there the

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.479 
there being some big problems there the
problem<00:03:02.909> is<00:03:03.349> the<00:03:04.349> credibility<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.159> trust

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
problem is the credibility and the trust

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.179 
problem is the credibility and the trust
that's<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:05.909> there<00:03:06.299> when<00:03:06.959> when<00:03:07.919> you<00:03:08.010> have

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
that's in there when when you have

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.220 
that's in there when when you have
leaders<00:03:08.549> of<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.090> governing<00:03:09.419> body<00:03:09.540> favoring

leaders of the governing body favoring
and<00:03:10.919> willing<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.790> accept<00:03:12.180> money<00:03:12.659> from

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
and willing to accept money from

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.939 
and willing to accept money from
athletes<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.280> are<00:03:14.689> subject<00:03:15.689> to<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.949> suspicion

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
athletes that are subject to a suspicion

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.219 
athletes that are subject to a suspicion
of<00:03:17.069> doping<00:03:17.459> it's<00:03:18.150> inappropriate<00:03:18.449> and<00:03:18.930> that's

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
of doping it's inappropriate and that's

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.589 
of doping it's inappropriate and that's
ethically<00:03:19.650> crosses<00:03:20.159> boundaries<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.790> so

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
ethically crosses boundaries and so

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.719 
ethically crosses boundaries and so
that's<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.470> lack<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.709> trust<00:03:23.190> which<00:03:23.489> also

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729 
that's the lack of trust which also

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.759 
that's the lack of trust which also
creates<00:03:24.150> chaos<00:03:24.389> within<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.049> peloton<00:03:25.409> within

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
creates chaos within the peloton within

creates chaos within the peloton within
the<00:03:25.859> riders<00:03:26.220> now<00:03:26.909> an<00:03:27.060> independent<00:03:27.720> panel<00:03:27.959> has

the ECR during the Armstrong scandal do
you<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.269> any<00:03:33.540> confidence<00:03:34.139> in<00:03:34.229> that<00:03:34.349> process

you have any confidence in that process

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.979 
you have any confidence in that process
I<00:03:35.010> would<00:03:35.879> have<00:03:36.090> more<00:03:36.269> faith<00:03:36.479> if<00:03:36.659> they<00:03:36.840> would

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
I would have more faith if they would

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.500 
I would have more faith if they would
cooperate<00:03:37.169> with<00:03:37.470> wada<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:37.979> you<00:03:38.370> sada<00:03:38.669> and<00:03:39.060> the

government and hopefully they will
they'll<00:03:42.030> consider<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.599> because<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:43.049> think

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
they'll consider that because I think

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.849 
they'll consider that because I think
that<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.609> a<00:03:44.639> bigger<00:03:45.620> investigation<00:03:46.620> than

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
that this is a bigger investigation than

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.009 
that this is a bigger investigation than
just<00:03:47.159> looking<00:03:48.060> through<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.329> books<00:03:48.569> or<00:03:48.810> like<00:03:48.989> a

just looking through the books or like a

just looking through the books or like a
an<00:03:49.680> accounting<00:03:50.180> going<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.269> for<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> audit<00:03:52.440> it

an accounting going in for a audit it
takes<00:03:53.459> talking<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.060> people<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.659> it<00:03:55.290> has<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.680> be

takes talking to people and it has to be

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.640 
takes talking to people and it has to be
done<00:03:55.979> in<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.879> way<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.479> neutral<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.260> do

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
done in a way that is neutral I do

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.000 
done in a way that is neutral I do
believe<00:03:59.069> that<00:03:59.099> at<00:03:59.579> least<00:03:59.939> in<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.209> interim<00:04:01.010> the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
believe that at least in the interim the

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.969 
believe that at least in the interim the
president<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.819> see<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.000> should<00:04:03.409> resign<00:04:04.409> or<00:04:04.889> at

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
president you see I should resign or at

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.770 
president you see I should resign or at
least<00:04:05.220> temporarily<00:04:05.849> resign<00:04:06.269> while<00:04:06.629> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
least temporarily resign while the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.210 
least temporarily resign while the
investigation<00:04:07.409> goes<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.739> think<00:04:07.859> that<00:04:08.129> would

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
investigation goes on I think that would

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.699 
investigation goes on I think that would
be<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> great<00:04:08.579> step<00:04:08.849> and<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.479> would<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.199> would<00:04:10.560> give

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
be a great step and I would I would give

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:11.960 
be a great step and I would I would give
him<00:04:10.799> credit<00:04:11.040> for<00:04:11.189> that<00:04:11.340> because<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.699> think<00:04:11.729> he

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
him credit for that because I think he

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.569 
him credit for that because I think he
should<00:04:12.150> do<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.299> for<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.659> sport<00:04:12.979> in<00:04:13.979> a<00:04:14.250> funny

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
should do that for the sport in a funny

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.670 
should do that for the sport in a funny
way<00:04:14.699> though<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.239> this<00:04:15.479> also<00:04:15.780> an<00:04:16.349> opportunity

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
way though is this also an opportunity

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.439 
way though is this also an opportunity
for<00:04:17.130> cycling<00:04:17.789> do<00:04:17.909> you<00:04:18.000> think<00:04:18.180> there's<00:04:18.329> a

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
for cycling do you think there's a

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.170 
for cycling do you think there's a
momentum<00:04:19.199> for<00:04:19.380> change<00:04:19.409> now<00:04:19.889> yeah<00:04:20.849> absolutely

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
momentum for change now yeah absolutely

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.589 
momentum for change now yeah absolutely
and<00:04:21.840> it's<00:04:22.320> it's<00:04:22.740> not<00:04:22.950> having<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.490> rip<00:04:24.479> apart

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
and it's it's not having to rip apart

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.220 
and it's it's not having to rip apart
all

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
the UCI it's it's bringing in a new

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.820

and<00:04:29.300> really<00:04:30.300> talking<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.900> mean<00:04:31.050> working

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
and really talking to I mean working

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.220 
and really talking to I mean working
with<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.920> riders<00:04:32.490> working<00:04:32.820> with<00:04:32.940> the

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
with the riders working with the

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.210 
with the riders working with the
organizers<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:34.380> looking<00:04:34.860> at<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.040> best

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
organizers and looking at the best

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.930 
organizers and looking at the best
solution<00:04:35.640> to<00:04:36.170> assure<00:04:37.170> that<00:04:37.200> there's<00:04:37.530> a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
solution to assure that there's a

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.690 
solution to assure that there's a
neutrality<00:04:38.940> in<00:04:39.090> drug<00:04:39.900> testing<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:41.400> can't

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
neutrality in drug testing and it can't

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.640 
neutrality in drug testing and it can't
be<00:04:41.790> done<00:04:42.000> in-house<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.630> has<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.960> be<00:04:43.020> out<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.440> has

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
be done in-house it has to be out it has

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.860 
be done in-house it has to be out it has
to<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.800> independent<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.580> if<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.330> happens<00:04:45.780> I

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
to be independent and if that happens I

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.900 
to be independent and if that happens I
think<00:04:45.900> credibility<00:04:46.740> can<00:04:46.830> come<00:04:47.370> back<00:04:47.520> quickly

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
think credibility can come back quickly

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.110 
think credibility can come back quickly
to<00:04:48.240> cycling<00:04:48.990> Greg<00:04:49.800> Armstrong<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.730> obviously

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
to cycling Greg Armstrong is obviously

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.420 
to cycling Greg Armstrong is obviously
still<00:04:51.390> insisting<00:04:52.080> he<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.440> innocent<00:04:52.800> but<00:04:53.250> if<00:04:53.340> he

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
still insisting he is innocent but if he

wants to come out and tell a rather

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.240 
wants to come out and tell a rather
different<00:04:55.470> story

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
different story

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.190 
different story
would<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.550> confession<00:04:56.760> be<00:04:57.330> cleansing<00:04:57.840> for<00:04:58.140> the

would a confession be cleansing for the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.980 
would a confession be cleansing for the
sports<00:04:58.970> well<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.000> think<00:05:00.120> that's<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.450> greatest

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
sports well I think that's the greatest

contributions<00:05:01.740> Lance<00:05:02.340> could<00:05:02.580> ever<00:05:02.700> make<00:05:02.880> to

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
contributions Lance could ever make to

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.020 
contributions Lance could ever make to
cycling<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.750> I

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.220 

part<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.090> me<00:05:09.210> wants<00:05:09.480> to<00:05:09.510> believe<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:09.900> that'll

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
part of me wants to believe that that'll

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.070 
part of me wants to believe that that'll
happen<00:05:10.260> on<00:05:11.030> but<00:05:12.030> usually<00:05:12.330> it<00:05:12.570> takes<00:05:12.720> until

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
happen on but usually it takes until

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.380 
happen on but usually it takes until
you've<00:05:13.200> lost<00:05:13.380> everything<00:05:14.090> pretty<00:05:15.090> similar<00:05:15.330> to

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
you've lost everything pretty similar to

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.050 
you've lost everything pretty similar to
what<00:05:15.480> happened<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.840> Floyd<00:05:16.050> Landis<00:05:17.030> but<00:05:18.030> I

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
what happened to Floyd Landis but I

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.840 
what happened to Floyd Landis but I
think<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:19.070> there's<00:05:20.070> there's<00:05:20.430> always<00:05:20.670> that

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
think that there's there's always that

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.090 
think that there's there's always that
chance<00:05:20.910> for<00:05:21.510> whatever<00:05:22.080> he's<00:05:22.410> motivated<00:05:22.950> by<00:05:23.040> it

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
chance for whatever he's motivated by it

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.070 
chance for whatever he's motivated by it
doesn't<00:05:23.700> matter<00:05:24.030> if<00:05:24.150> he<00:05:24.240> could<00:05:25.100> come<00:05:26.100> out<00:05:26.310> and

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
doesn't matter if he could come out and

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.900 
doesn't matter if he could come out and
show<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.320> system<00:05:28.710> because<00:05:28.950> he<00:05:29.100> got<00:05:29.550> he<00:05:29.850> got

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
show the system because he got he got

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.780 
show the system because he got he got
away<00:05:30.120> with<00:05:30.420> 12<00:05:31.230> years<00:05:31.440> of<00:05:31.650> stuff<00:05:32.190> that<00:05:32.370> you

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
away with 12 years of stuff that you

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.130 
away with 12 years of stuff that you
know<00:05:32.880> nobody<00:05:33.060> else<00:05:33.300> really<00:05:33.420> got<00:05:33.720> away<00:05:33.840> with

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
know nobody else really got away with

know nobody else really got away with

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
and it would be nice to know how you can

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.870 
and it would be nice to know how you can
