 teaching this fusion of bachata the style that they learn with patience

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.100
 talking about the country 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.339
 in sky sky team on shoulders 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.759
 in this way we are going to mark the time one 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.829
 p 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:29.789
 3 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.709
 We walk 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.170
 they already knew the basis of spaces and also of the posture 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.189
 let's try to do it very slowly with our partner 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.389
 the imaginary if we do this 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.799
 so 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.539
 all this is united 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.569
 and then they retired 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.739
 the torso and the shoulders together we look 1 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:00.909
 at the national level 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.320
 the loan was very hard 6 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.680
 this is a movement 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.469
 where are we going 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:13.529
 how to make a sacca and a volley of the tango otan okey abortion temples 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.799
 for that we have to know first how to make a surge in the case of 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:18.879
 girl 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.719
 for this we are going to 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:22.599
 help our partner 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.999
 with two hands let's read similar delegation opening the legs 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.440
 and for the differences 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.799
 as if I step back slowly 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.709
 and go back 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.139
 there is an important moment especially for 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.300
 for those who asked can have well with their clothes 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:45.929
 what is the facade of the bar 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.339
 p this part 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:51.339
 when you pass pine nuts and very carefully 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.329
 the tip of the foot 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.649
 and cgt 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:58.649
 palazuelos to each one the wind was taken 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.789
 they realize the male in the bowling alley so this movement 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:06.449
 pulls out 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:07.689
 comes 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.689
 And come back 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:13.009
 nothing more to the country
