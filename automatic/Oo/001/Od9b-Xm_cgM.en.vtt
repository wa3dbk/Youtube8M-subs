 eck because now i got angry by people 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 about what you do 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.120
 we are going to have a plate full 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.949
 so there is a most difficult passage 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.710
 then I will start with the difficult 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.610
 adhere to s and it is every engine 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.070
 different 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.910
 starts at start at start type in c and d 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.210
 and click and you come to the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.090
 commands pop and that this bidipi I come 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.149
 yes and you press 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.270
 and back behind the block 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.610
 then there is a stupid gateway of mine 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.330
 name and then you step your browser and there 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.970
 enter this default gateway and then you 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.550
 you have to and and loki bigger 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.200
 usually is the password and is the 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.939
 username and password 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.229
 admin ate the but that is usually like 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.520
 that is not the case then you will be here for a moment 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.390
 Have to look in the booklet of your throws 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 sits down where you login man 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.720
 This band password can and the by 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.430
 girl case with my out men 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.950
 probably the organic shop 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.750
 so you try to log me in that name 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.600
 logging 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.979
 with every larger one 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.140
 different 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 so a left one larger than special 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.189
 for this, yes yes in the case of major such matters 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.220
 find out for yourself how it should be done 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.400
