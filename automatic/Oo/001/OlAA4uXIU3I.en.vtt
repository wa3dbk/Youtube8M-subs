00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.370
 celcom for the next video here on the 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.219
 channel to the next episode of hondas 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.660
 road to the top in the series edition 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.010
 last episode we have at the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.900
 left-back congstar with the 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.400
 left- back radu replaced by lazio 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.350
 and today there are two games in this one 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.109
 episode and in these we will 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.730
 hopefully a few victories 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.650
 can enter and a few gates 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.230
 shoot and therefore two 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.550
 Welcome new players to our team 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.050
 may at first what would 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.950
 this follow so come terry moderate 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.120
 be that we are a bit different there 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.559
 I'm up to it 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.000
 that's why the thieves on twitter follow 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.079
 or on facebook have said okay the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.820
 not on facebook but not now 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.950
 the ones on twitter can write something now 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.510
 is coming and that is how it is today 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.129
 little bit the topic and indeed 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.690
 my favorite youtuber was me 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.629
 namely in skype asked by 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.809
 subscribers like me that was by the way 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.250
 Max funny enough, like mine 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.690
 favorite with white so which mine 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.550
 are five favorite youtubers and have 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.170
 I said okay then I'll do it 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.220
 video to rather than just out 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.750
 to write because it is interested yes 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.510
 maybe more of bmw 's team 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.920
 See our first opponent and me 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.210
 I would say I start with 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.010
 the fifth place is the whole thing 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.340
 quickly explain why that 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.110
 my favorite youtubers are and yes me 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.610
 would say league times go to place five 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.409
 hold we must wrote several 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420
 I have now both the 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.590
 tobias otto band or against alex partout 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.850
 not taken because I do not like that 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.799
 really as a favorite overseas but 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.130
 rather than youtube soon, I say that 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.340
 times 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.360
 Tobias anyway as a real life friend too 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.290
 that's why this list is not 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.030
 more in it that again clearly 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.650
 differentiate but in place 5 I have 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.329
 made a very difficult decision 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.500
 because there are several extremely like 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.810
 and that is part of it 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.090
 max fps that finally took 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.890
 Eleven people get sick and commander warriors 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.140
 that's all people I'm about 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.000
 watch the same often and like to look 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.320
 because i like all the videos of me 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.579
 watch it all like I like from 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.869
 all the mood thats possible 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.759
 topics and so on and so forth 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.860
 eleven people the incredibly cool sock 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.290
 could be the best warrior anyway 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.450
 totally cool and max fps is just like that 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.740
 That's why I like the extreme all 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.850
 and that's why they 're about us 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.619
 place five together because I have the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.209
 wanted to set one to place four 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.429
 but then I could commit myself and 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.250
 though on case an at t 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.799
 yes the good jayjay why he just easy 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.519
 because he is the second most important fifa 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.599
 community man is ever in 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.310
 England you have to say I am 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.510
 of course not on the German 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.010
 community here because it has to 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.030
 one differentiates because between the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.620
 English and German community is ticking 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.030
 already pay by subscribers alone 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.670
 of course a huge difference though 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.500
 cases since then the second funniest resourceful 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.700
 and that's easy, it can also be anything 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.620
 he does everything he is going to do 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.299
 Somehow for me to gold I like everything 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.000
 What he market does not matter if there are five dollars 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.799
 touched or are players or everything and 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.239
 I really like to watch his videos everytime 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.319
 single Libyan at least twice 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.510
 looked at from that fits that 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.220
 accordingly extremely good and therefore 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.689
 money is just more space four and 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.549
 so that's how to get in 3rd place and 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.900
 between 3 and 2 there's an epic 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.819
 battle that's why I do not know so well 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.439
 how to pack there but in the end 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.239
 I've chosen hans sap 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.500
 I think that most behave 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.569
 will recognize good sake 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.000
 and he's now in fourth place 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.739
 I just wanted to get there first 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.180
 but I noticed that I almost did 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.799
 no longer constantly, of course , very much 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.629
 I like to be at the moment 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.609
 hansa stripped because the guy is easy 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.560
 incredibly correct incredibly chased and 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.970
 that's why it's extremely extreme at the moment 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.409
 So like all the can not look 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.970
 Even then I pass my son he 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.019
 looks extra push because I think 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.729
 but most of you know him 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.959
 anyway you can definitely 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.489
 of course come across all divisions 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.590
 gm and all the others but 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.150
 anyway, most of you know 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.889
 so it definitely will be up 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.019
 place 3 because he is a really cool guy 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.040
 there is space two there marcel scorpion me 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.780
 you do not have to think very much 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.569
 explain why marcel scorpion is 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.470
 just no idea my darling my 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.299
 sweetheart my knee 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.489
 that is just a very special one 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.959
 history but we were now but 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.669
 gamescom and we know each other a pain 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.650
 yes about and that's all 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.090
 a bit grown but much sicker 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.310
 grown as well as me even if I mean 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.049
 growth of cras with meanwhile 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.150
 almost 12,000 subs, but they are yes 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.629
 meanwhile 80,000 he awakened mixture 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.949
 found 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.810
 I have at the moment like a bit more 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.159
 contact with him or I had now 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.430
 no money goes straight back so 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.079
 reasonably and therefore yes the on 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.759
 second place because his comments is that 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.169
 unbelievable how much the one or hold 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.310
 although the guy can be stupid 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.109
 but human on this planet is 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.849
 Still, it's very funny and that's why 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.650
 is the second in place one 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.630
 and there are now the twitter people 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.079
 be at the start and know what I mean 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.830
 we know the good mister on place 1 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.960
 roadshow yes why harry why 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.990
 but why else would not be why 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.270
 because they are not easy because I bi 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.069
 suite as well as large parts of the fifa community 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.509
 do not look why can i if you can 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.650
 interested in a video sequence 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.750
 Of course I do not want to 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.919
 too much hayden or killed somehow 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.330
 But that's another story 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.250
 because red chance my favorite youtuber 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.419
 As I said, he is the coolest wise 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.069
 can you think if dell the 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.509
 second largest is then is already the 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.400
 coolest in the english viva community 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.719
 and I think that's easy because of me 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.009
 I have at least each one 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.469
 Video page not so many videos 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.259
 At least I have two at least 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:57.780
 especially the whole who looked 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.129
 is it full fifa incredibly funny 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.379
 Whole Pentecost is you can get 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.759
 1000 times looks at this is so cool and I 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.740
 Just love this guy for everything 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.729
 the power is done even if the occurrence occurs 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.469
 but i also wanted to write to me 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.750
 he answered what a horny day 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.250
 Hanover wins 3 2 against Berlin 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.770
 so I never expected 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.389
 schlaudraff and stindl meet 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.800
 that's not something at all 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.319
 works and then answers 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.550
 more neurotic on on twitter and it was 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.990
 generally a really horny day today 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.029
 the packaging will come too 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.690
 And if I say it all over Germany 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:28.770
 we can expect a lot 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:34.919
 nadal brings again to go facebook 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:36.719
 then you know which a-tec 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.460
 openings again my mouth like that though 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.529
 Roger why did I explain well ? 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.150
 are we ready or something up 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.620
 any case is the coolest because 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.580
 he is so funny because of the completely through 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.770
 Of course, that's just right 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.889
 correct person is worthy and with that 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.699
 wants to money that would be really cool ne 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.680
 story but I believe that we 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.479
 debate because he holds in I of the 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.550
 lives and in england or where i am 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.250
 he thinks he will be in england uk and uk 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.500
 not in the usa I mean there come only 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.509
 the whole in skills or in one 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.400
 rock as I always ne ne him and 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.409
 for example, I believe it comes too 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.569
 He also comes from there 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.440
 uk then come yet know is 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.789
 also completely does not matter 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.870
 In any case, so my top 5 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.430
 youtuber and you are welcome in the 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.599
 Comments write if you're there somehow 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.979
 could halfway agree or if 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.169
 anyone does not like it at all 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.849
 of course, everything is your opinion 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.409
 but you have the comments but 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.449
 I would not want that , of course 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.370
 but do not see it now 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.779
 always here the first one to one year 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.870
 lost 3 to 1 had no chance 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.889
 and now cohen is making the 2 1 for 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.839
 us after the nice pass from 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.810
 bonaventura in the run really well 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.610
 made this one 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.680
 lopez it was despite getting pretty 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.840
 At least I think that is cool 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.169
 accordingly, then serial is there and 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.880
 heads the ball to the 2 1 and Johanna 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.160
 this opponent was really relatively strong 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.500
 with his work is for me to him 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.139
 However , he had serious 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.790
 weaken in the defensive 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.930
 it was just that he was extremely open 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.830
 he stood up extremely high 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.910
 let it go by I can of course 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.410
 do not show everything that we have 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.850
 Timeframe of this video blow up 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.060
 that will land at eight minutes at the end 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.040
 but what was there again 90 makes the 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.389
 3 2 1 it was not a particularly exciting one 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.070
 Game result of his chances had 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:10.000
 but just like me, he's old, but he does 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.200
 did not use it I do not have it 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.400
 used but in the back but apparently have 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.780
 The whole thing was fun 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.070
 made of it to wash in the whole 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.200
 in the end I have three two 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.979
 one luckily still won and honda 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.560
 makes his first scorer points 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.810
 at least I believe in this at all 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.150
 he is now the road to the top 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.070
 really needs his red if at 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.660
 moment is not on the other hand 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.820
 yes in the Russian premier league 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.570
 premier league was where he wrestled three 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.130
 was but I guess that is 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.650
 hopefully in the course of this series 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.150
 the worst player in this in 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.530
 strothmann came for this game 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.640
 in the montolivo funny what troops 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.380
 but it's bad in the first game 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.340
 I just discovered that 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.990
 I accidentally korosides 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.550
 exchanged because I did not see it 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.750
 I do what I would willste 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.979
 Rejoice if this video is positive 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.960
 Rate will leave the comments 

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:50.830
 would and with my supportive ranger 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.000
 would drop by if we did 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.320
 that would be very helpful to me 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.010
 also look forward to facebook and 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.390
 so on and so forth 

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.890
 With that, I say goodbye 

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.479
 from this video wonderful day yet 

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.479
