00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.570
 there always the same 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.430
 think about blowing like riding the 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.830

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.410
 Spring descendants do not neglect 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.770
 the movement realized there always 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:12.570
 now alas always always speak so the 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:14.760
 same protocol 25 repetition so if 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:20.700
 it's too hard eh do not hesitate to 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:24.810
 take a little break and that's too much 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.070

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.600
 the east and so with peas to 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.400
 pegs so the third exercise 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.610
 so it's going to be the times with 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.660
 only 90 degrees that's where it appears 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.850
 in master on the upper part of 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.010
 great players we will add difficulty 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:46.140
 in fact the break to keep people at 90 Â° 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.600
 blow suplet blow when you 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.209
 go up to what has come down to the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.190
 inner security of course the movement 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.940
 you must not cross your feet 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.530
 we always had to tighten our knees 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:05.519
 do the exercise with a smile if that 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:07.530
 becomes hard so the device after the 25 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.830
 cross basilica competitions people 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.070
 at 90 degrees we will do the same for the 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.070
 hobbits 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:42.070
 will give if you realize your 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.070
 silence on board watching the video is 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:51.289
 so the second series of arrivals at the 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:05:02.150
 sprint by iphone 5 repetition work 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:05:05.050
 the bottom of the abs well breathe again 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.050
 Its very important 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.030
 but a lot of people who go to 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.630
 produce the exercise by putting hands 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.460
 under the buttocks 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.350
 so it's not interesting for better 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.419
 carry out the exercise well and make it 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:36.960
 less than the cheat ideas with the 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:37.560
 hands ok so here at monza in 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.080
 exercise 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.100
 saleh of the double hollow we will try to 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.660
 bring back young people have the same time as the 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.350
 earth and we will try to stretch the 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.789
 people so there on this exercise in has 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.250
 really worked all week to 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:55.860
 2001 this is an exercise that makes 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.120
 very very very beautiful after after all 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.120
 exos that we can hardly execute 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.500
 when it comes to training my 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.670
 abs so there is a lot of grip 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.380
 for sudden confessions the three years that's 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.950
 do not push interesting because we 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.120
 is going fast attention drive so the 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.470
 abs are very enduring music 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.090
 but it will not work and 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.650
 every night we will try to be at 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.410
 about three sessions of abdominals 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.050
 per week but it's already very 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.820
 well 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:34.710
 the last exercise is cladding 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.580
 so there if it's too easy could 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.580
 increase the cladding time 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.100
 so there for sheathing no calais 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:53.380
 with the buttocks we keep the back straight 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:53.380
 wyatt face to oneself and one breathes well 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.830
 ok so here you go 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:14.590
 feel free because of that session 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.590
