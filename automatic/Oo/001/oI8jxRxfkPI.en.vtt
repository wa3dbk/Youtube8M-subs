00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:18.240
 hello chicks today I bring you the review 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.850
 of the 123 of the brand bronzers 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.340
 visual that is part of the video of the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.410
 purchases arranged around here I leave you the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.170
 link to check the video or you already 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.180
 you know in the description I leave you all 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.790
 all the information 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.580
 then I'm going to make a switch and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.520
 review of these products 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.630
 the package comes like this in this box says 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.110
 I floor the product number and it comes with 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.570
 this line in orange because the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.990
 blushes of the viso brand handle this 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.200
 line but in pink 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.520
 comes perfectly packaged with your 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.520
 data its ingredients 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.890
 everything and here comes this the box 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.520
 which in fact comes with a small 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:14.320
 protection as you can see are are 1 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.940
 2 3 let's make a switch to light 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.940
 of the sun so that you see them 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.310
 I told you how you already saw them in the 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.580
 video are not mate are beautifully 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.480
 bright all in sun tone in what 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.840
 it is the sunbeams and the illuminator both 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.730
 they are completely golden 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.880
 you definitely do not find a shadow 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.180
 or a quartet that looks like these 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.480
 colors are the best option for you to me 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.380
 I love the sun tone I love it a lot 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.989
 golden things because of my skin tone 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.840
 I think I feel pretty good and 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.780
 Well, these products can serve you 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.060
 to outline would usually deal with 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.510
 more this is 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.670
 this serves as an illuminator but more 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.880
 it would be like a fantasy illuminator 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:42.160
 As it is too golden it is very golden and 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.330
 it practically looks more like a shadow than 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:50.430
 I do not know how it's too intense 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.430
 then we would occupy this to darken 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.629
 something that I tell you about the brand is that 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.489
 they survive as well as the flushes 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.340
 then I recommend that if you go to 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.360
 outline and how is a sun tone very 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.420
 bright this start of little more 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.400
 because it's a brilliant product then 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.230
 maybe you do not want it to shine 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.530
 too much or not any matter that of the 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.579
 Sun then you have to work it 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.579
 quite and blur it 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.070
 and the illuminator we can apply it in 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.770
 this part of same here in few 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.230
 amounts because this tone the 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.730
 Illuminator is more golden and brighter 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.730
 that the contouring 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:44.260
 personally this tone I like 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.610
 more like for makeup then 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.650
 we can take a small brush and 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.650
 apply the illuminator in this area 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.120
 take the middle tone 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.270
 since we have applied in this part of 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:09.030
 here I personally do not like 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.569
 illuminate with a tone as golden as 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.969
 these considered that it shines too much and 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:19.239
 you see the patent effect 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.969
 that I do not like the truth then 

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:25.179
 I do not like to extend this kind of 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:27.729
 product above and we're just going to take 

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:30.550
 the darkest 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:34.800
 to this part of here 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:38.200
 and make a small very small shadow 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.870
 I highly recommend these products 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.160
 if you're interested in having a sun look 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:48.490
 that as you can see is super super 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:52.510
 bright and it is golden very beautiful me 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:57.160
 they love me the golds in this case 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:59.200
 this look that I have in sun tone what 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.380
 I'm combining with a matte lipstick 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.770
 because good if you already have the whole face 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.800
 with this sub tone in golden and so shine 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.110
 site and maybe to lower that 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.740
 Shine cited you can add a lipstick 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.930
 mate and therefore it gives a very nice effect and 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.630
 good chicks and chicks this is the 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.180
