that<00:01:56.360> will<00:01:56.509> support<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:56.990> here<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.289> won't<00:01:57.530> go

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
that will support it here it won't go

that will support it here it won't go
back<00:01:57.829> to<00:01:58.149> let's<00:01:59.149> go<00:01:59.329> and<00:01:59.509> do<00:01:59.689> that<00:02:00.640> knobs<00:02:03.159> there

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
back to let's go and do that knobs there

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.830 
back to let's go and do that knobs there
we<00:02:04.250> go<00:02:04.369> if<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:04.819> need<00:02:04.970> more<00:02:05.149> knocks<00:02:05.390> it's<00:02:05.630> build

we go if you need more knocks it's build

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.210 
we go if you need more knocks it's build
up<00:02:05.960> your<00:02:06.079> knots<00:02:06.289> so<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.530> won't<00:02:06.860> go<00:02:06.979> through

and then you're going to keep it held

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.330 
and then you're going to keep it held

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
high and slowly lower down the bottom

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.650 
high and slowly lower down the bottom
position<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.970> then<00:03:23.090> you're<00:03:23.209> going<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.389> start

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
position and then you're going to start

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.960 
position and then you're going to start
once<00:03:23.959> again<00:03:24.109> keeping<00:03:25.040> those<00:03:25.250> forearms<00:03:25.549> tight

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
once again keeping those forearms tight

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.660 
once again keeping those forearms tight
getting<00:03:26.389> that<00:03:26.450> nice<00:03:26.660> pump<00:03:27.160> nice<00:03:28.160> contraction

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
getting that nice pump nice contraction

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.099 
getting that nice pump nice contraction
throughout<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.120> whole<00:03:29.359> motion<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:29.989> you

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
throughout the whole motion so you

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.750 
throughout the whole motion so you
really<00:03:30.380> get<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.530> time<00:03:30.889> under<00:03:31.130> tension<00:03:31.160> too

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
really get that time under tension too

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.370 
really get that time under tension too
because<00:03:32.389> you're<00:03:32.540> not<00:03:32.690> really<00:03:32.930> letting<00:03:33.200> it

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
because you're not really letting it

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.080 
because you're not really letting it
relax<00:03:33.739> you're<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.069> whole<00:03:34.220> motion<00:03:34.459> just<00:03:34.940> like

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
relax you're the whole motion just like

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.280 
relax you're the whole motion just like
so<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.329> you're<00:03:35.600> going<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.780> continue<00:03:35.930> to

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
so and you're going to continue to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.349 
so and you're going to continue to
process<00:03:36.739> over<00:03:37.069> and<00:03:37.190> over<00:03:37.400> again<00:03:37.489> I'm<00:03:38.180> going<00:03:38.269> to

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
process over and over again I'm going to

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.720 
process over and over again I'm going to
feel<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.569> massive<00:03:39.139> pump<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.560> lot<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.010> blood<00:03:40.160> go

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
feel a massive pump a lot of blood go

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.610 
feel a massive pump a lot of blood go
right<00:03:41.120> in<00:03:41.329> that<00:03:41.569> specific<00:03:41.840> area<00:03:42.349> those

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
right in that specific area those

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.470 
right in that specific area those
forearms<00:03:42.980> you're<00:03:43.700> going<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:43.880> continue<00:03:44.209> this

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
forearms you're going to continue this

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.110 
forearms you're going to continue this
until<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:45.319> fatigue<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:46.430> just<00:03:46.700> like<00:03:46.940> this

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
until you fatigue so just like this

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.360 
until you fatigue so just like this
you'll<00:03:47.930> want<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.380> strengthen<00:03:48.859> those<00:03:48.950> forms

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
you'll want that strengthen those forms

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.569 
you'll want that strengthen those forms
and<00:03:49.549> also<00:03:50.389> a<00:03:50.419> lot<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.780> size<00:03:50.959> too<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:52.220> keep<00:03:52.400> this

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
and also a lot of size too so keep this

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:53.600 
and also a lot of size too so keep this
up<00:03:52.820> nice

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
up nice

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.630
