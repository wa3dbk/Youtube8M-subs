00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.720 
was in the shower shampoo in my hair
her<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.970> did<00:03:00.870> not<00:03:01.170> have<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> lot<00:03:01.770> of<00:03:01.800> shedding<00:03:02.280> at

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
her I did not have a lot of shedding at

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.950 
her I did not have a lot of shedding at
all<00:03:03.360> like<00:03:03.900> when<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.320> was<00:03:04.350> finally<00:03:05.220> able<00:03:05.460> to

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
all like when I was finally able to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.750 
all like when I was finally able to
detangle<00:03:06.960> my<00:03:07.200> entire<00:03:07.740> head<00:03:08.250> in<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.330> shower<00:03:09.360> um

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
detangle my entire head in the shower um

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.120 
detangle my entire head in the shower um
maybe<00:03:11.760> four<00:03:12.450> or<00:03:12.480> five<00:03:12.810> strands<00:03:13.590> came<00:03:13.830> out

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
maybe four or five strands came out

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.500 
maybe four or five strands came out
total<00:03:14.990> um<00:03:15.990> yeah<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.770> that<00:03:17.250> was<00:03:17.280> very

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
total um yeah so that was very

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.300 
total um yeah so that was very
surprising<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.870> my<00:03:19.350> hair<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.620> no<00:03:20.040> longer

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
surprising that my hair is no longer

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.280 
surprising that my hair is no longer
shedding<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.240> did<00:03:21.840> stay<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.830> first<00:03:24.290> video

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
shedding I did stay in the first video

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.250 
shedding I did stay in the first video
when<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:25.860> initially<00:03:26.520> did<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.150> application<00:03:28.050> of

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
when I initially did the application of

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.890 
when I initially did the application of
the<00:03:28.710> beautiful<00:03:28.950> textures<00:03:29.550> that<00:03:29.760> my<00:03:30.270> hair<00:03:30.510> shed

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
the beautiful textures that my hair shed

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.130 
the beautiful textures that my hair shed
it<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.230> lot<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.760> do<00:03:33.420> believe<00:03:33.810> i'm

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
it a lot and I do believe i'm

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.680 
it a lot and I do believe i'm
ninety-nine<00:03:34.650> percent<00:03:35.040> sure<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:36.420> was

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
ninety-nine percent sure that was

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.770 
ninety-nine percent sure that was
because<00:03:36.900> i<00:03:37.350> used<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:38.130> protein<00:03:38.850> treatment<00:03:39.420> prior

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
because i used a protein treatment prior

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.480 
because i used a protein treatment prior
to<00:03:40.230> doing<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:41.720> beautiful<00:03:42.720> texture<00:03:43.170> system<00:03:43.800> so

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
to doing the beautiful texture system so

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.570 
to doing the beautiful texture system so
it<00:03:44.940> was<00:03:45.150> basically<00:03:45.300> protein<00:03:46.170> overload<00:03:46.620> and

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
it was basically protein overload and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.880 
it was basically protein overload and
that's<00:03:48.420> why<00:03:48.600> my<00:03:48.780> hair<00:03:49.020> was<00:03:49.200> shedding<00:03:49.500> like

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
that's why my hair was shedding like

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.590 
that's why my hair was shedding like
crazy<00:03:50.780> but<00:03:51.780> now<00:03:52.110> i<00:03:52.440> don't<00:03:52.530> have<00:03:52.710> that<00:03:53.010> problem
