adding buttercream to give it a little
bit<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.800> texture<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:32.160> I'm<00:00:32.340> using<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.850> use<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
bit of texture and I'm using I use the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.610 
bit of texture and I'm using I use the
short<00:00:33.420> spatula<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.050> I'm<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.350> use<00:00:34.469> this

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
short spatula so I'm going to use this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.900 
short spatula so I'm going to use this
one<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.610> glob<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:38.309> top<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
one and glob it on the top and on the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.450 
one and glob it on the top and on the
sides<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> reason<00:00:40.950> why<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.070> start<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
sides and the reason why I start with a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
sides and the reason why I start with a
smooth<00:00:41.730> buttercream<00:00:42.239> first<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
smooth buttercream first is just so I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.930 
smooth buttercream first is just so I
have<00:00:43.530> straight<00:00:43.950> sides<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.789> they're

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
have straight sides and I know they're

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.970 
have straight sides and I know they're
straight<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.390> begin<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
straight to begin with so the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.299 
straight to begin with so the
architecture<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> cake<00:00:47.730> isn't<00:00:47.910> wrecked<00:00:49.309> ok

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
architecture the cake isn't wrecked ok

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.430 
architecture the cake isn't wrecked ok

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
underneath so I know exactly where the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
underneath so I know exactly where the
round<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.659> dragging<00:01:06.990> my

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
