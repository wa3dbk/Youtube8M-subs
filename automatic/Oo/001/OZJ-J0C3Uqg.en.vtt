00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello dear friends with you from 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.029
 rain today we will play snowballs again 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.679
 a bolt on a hippixel server but in general 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.230
 and let's start choose choose server 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.570
 sims i like this name no 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.320
 I don't really like this 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.699
 swamp maybe this translates 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 maybe not in general we'll see 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:33.300
 this card and maybe never 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:40.680
 seen people not in the room like this hey no 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:48.230
 well well okay they look inside friend 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.230
 friend oh come on you this is great this is magic 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.940
 No, well, these are terrible, they are terrible, I'm mine 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.190
 bangs are better because I will explain why not 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.670
 look worse at them is painted on 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.500
 my head, I have a camera change 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.470
 So as you can see I have a second 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.900
 eye and hair and they are not drawn 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.330
 hair on the head is not as if separately from 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 heads they are a little taller it looks 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.479
 much more spectacular and under my hair 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.210
 I have an eye, I assure you 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.090
 so i'm not one-eyed yo his eyes i 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 not unusual chelkar these stupid 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 schoolchildren in clinical shirts so 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.340
 I'd rather the truth because I had to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.600
 pause but we started the game in general 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.640
 nothing lost count i said there by 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.490
 my body is not in the hope that I am not 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.070
 lost no topic 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.079
 and it will be possible to continue with peace of mind 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.259
 play again the bolt on the hippixel server and 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:58.920
 here is the second time I just slept to kill 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.430
 unfair and who have our greens there 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.530
 enemies 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:10.830
 about someone i killed yes i'm not afraid i send you 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.030
 assholes damn no but it's not fair 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.819
 again why do we get into the team 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.060
 which so stands out from everything that is 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.200
 yellow they were dark green okay were 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.170
 ordinary green so they do 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.790
 dark green and mixed with all this 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.269
 bullshit marsh me and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.269
 well what for the arrogance of the mob so lucky life 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.880
 you will die dude even have died so well 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.950
 how pain 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.390
 pechalka okay still ahead i'm not 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:56.220
 fear no one and nothing 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:58.579
 all we will win all but it's not fun 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.010
 it's so relaxing here 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:06.720
 even a little tiring atmosphere well and 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.790
 it gives its charm and I think so again 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.170
 yellow but look yellow 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.690
 you will notice that green horseradish 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.980
 I think according to us and you are unlikely to him 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.069
 Well spotted someone can be 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.230
 saw but obviously not all because of their 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.019
 seen really very, very bad 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.340
 I determined them mainly by nicknames 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.049
 here it is and everything in general is different 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.600
 otherwise, it’s just to define them 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.299
 impossible and we burn like on the map 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.739
 and I don't know why it's done this way. 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.870
 wouldn’t have turned to root there 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.650
 Trieste and pink color to thump on the bridge 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.440
 roam the whole crowd damn and so in general 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.810
 anything I do but clearing merge 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.989
 maybe a little with that reed give 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.750
 just something well or with this flower and how 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.569
 you see me there, I killed him, someone 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:01.719
 killed me 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:03.280
 it doesn't matter well I like that 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.700
 nice sound when you throw this 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.159
 snowball 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.900
 and certainly not nothing like the real 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:12.459
 usually when you throw in real life 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.519
 do you have a snowball crunching 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.690
 jackets or something like that usually in winter 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:22.060
 snowballs play correctly and the jacket 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.970
 when 3 fabric jackets apart 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.130
 it turns out something in the spirit of crunching rustle 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.520
 don't know in short the sound is different from 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.430
 of this 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.639
 swing well here you have to feel 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.800
 to the very end this sound is so when 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.560
 you play snowballs i think everything is in real 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.650
 life you do not listen to what sound makes 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.990
 your jackets are probably the only one to listen to 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.389
 no i never listened to really 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.810
 I really can’t remember how it sounds 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:53.860
 jacket when i lower what i carry guys 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.880
 sorry we play snowball snowball 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.810
 paintball don't know this peak pinball or 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.120
 paintball because 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.449
 pinball I know this here this here shit on 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.610
 computer when there ball click 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.710
 share button shoots it starts 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.099
 jump it needs to be thrown up but i think 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.289
 you understand, but there are points bal it is well then 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.380
 that we now seem to be playing 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.199
 there is yes people shoot each other out 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.949
 guns filled with paint balls 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:30.190
 mixed with water or there is no paint 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.840
 in short some kind of dye which 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.229
 laundered what's most interesting is very 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.330
 interesting paint was a time when we 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.460
 went to an abandoned building she she 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.550
 abandoned construction site just played 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.080
 this very pinball we collected as in this 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.110
 the ball remaining because naturally 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:52.270
 not everyone broke up and periodically friend 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:55.539
 even used to sell kids 0 children 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.530
 younger and how much was well let's say 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:02.169
 years 12 13 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.820
 the guys were smaller there 98 and he 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.400
 he sold pretty yet 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.030
 for a great price for example a bottle in 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.720
 balls 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.060
 Well, where are the greens won naturally? 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.490
 here he was selling these bottles with balls and 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.920
 we had you money we went them and 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.540
 was spending actually it was then we 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.360
 quite often got dirty from the country 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:26.440
 paint but it reminds something 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:29.230
 consistency know here is the protein from the egg 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.290
 boiled no fried no himself 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:35.800
 ordinary egg severely well and very very 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:38.050
 even easily takes away from being washed yes here 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.270
 what exactly wanted to say so green 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.680
 won everything is clear why because 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.500
 them was a strange disguise we 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.960
 stood out 9 had we kill and 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.590
 rather well in the game you 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.130
