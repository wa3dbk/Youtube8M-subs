me out up it's almost like liquid on top

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.740 
me out up it's almost like liquid on top
and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.640> dough<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> bottom<00:00:39.629> or

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
and then like dough at the bottom or

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
and then like dough at the bottom or
sand<00:00:40.079> yeah<00:00:40.320> yeah<00:00:40.800> okay<00:00:41.129> throw<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
sand yeah yeah okay throw it in the

sand yeah yeah okay throw it in the
speaker<00:00:41.879> ooh<00:00:42.030> black<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:43.260> sometimes<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.129> liquid

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
speaker ooh black is sometimes a liquid

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.979 
speaker ooh black is sometimes a liquid
so<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.820> know<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> wanted<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.480> we're<00:00:45.899> gonna

so you know if you wanted to we're gonna

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.000 
so you know if you wanted to we're gonna
we're<00:00:46.200> gonna<00:00:46.289> make<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.800> you'll<00:00:46.950> have

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
we're gonna make them in so you'll have

we're gonna make them in so you'll have
it<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.430> sometimes<00:00:47.760> it'll<00:00:48.300> pour<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it and sometimes it'll pour like a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.450 
it and sometimes it'll pour like a
liquid<00:00:49.469> okay

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
liquid okay

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
liquid okay
and<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.390> actually<00:00:51.480> pour<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> liquid<00:00:52.320> out

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and we can actually pour a liquid out

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
and we can actually pour a liquid out
onto<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> tray<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:54.420> other<00:00:54.629> times<00:00:54.719> it'll

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
onto this tray and at other times it'll

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.889 
onto this tray and at other times it'll
behave<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> solid<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.969> stays<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
behave like a solid and it stays in the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.689 
behave like a solid and it stays in the
tray<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.260> apply<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> force<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
tray when you apply a force to it it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.420 
tray when you apply a force to it it
gets<00:00:59.940> hard<00:01:00.289> quickly<00:01:01.289> obviously<00:01:01.500> yes<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
gets hard quickly obviously yes it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.329 
gets hard quickly obviously yes it
doesn't<00:01:02.579> splash<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.239> water<00:01:03.510> Wow<00:01:03.840> okay<00:01:04.339> but

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
doesn't splash like water Wow okay but

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609 
doesn't splash like water Wow okay but
if<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.670> pull<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.360> slowly<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
if you pull on it slowly you can get it

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.149 
if you pull on it slowly you can get it
to<00:01:07.740> move<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.369> it'll<00:01:08.549> flow<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> liquid

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
to move and it'll flow like a liquid

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.730 
to move and it'll flow like a liquid
what<00:01:11.159> better<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.750> apply<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> force<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
what better way to do apply a force to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.950 
what better way to do apply a force to
it<00:01:13.770> than<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.070> put<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> speaker<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it than to put it on a speaker that it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
it than to put it on a speaker that it
is<00:01:16.049> vibrating<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> speaker<00:01:17.640> applies<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
is vibrating as the speaker applies a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
is vibrating as the speaker applies a
force<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.229> starts<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.830> almost

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
force to it it starts to it's almost

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.010 
force to it it starts to it's almost
like<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.340> alive<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.880> hardens<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
like it's alive it hardens up and it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.050 
like it's alive it hardens up and it
dances<00:01:22.530> around<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:23.009> top<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> speaker<00:01:23.520> Wow

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
dances around on top of the speaker Wow

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.520 
dances around on top of the speaker Wow
and<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> thought<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> might<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.229> fun

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and so I thought it might be fun

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
and so I thought it might be fun
actually<00:01:25.920> throw<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.549> food<00:01:26.939> coloring<00:01:26.970> in

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
actually throw a little food coloring in

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
actually throw a little food coloring in
here<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.630> well<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.470> happens<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.040> we

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
here as well to see what happens if we

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.710 
here as well to see what happens if we
get<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.400> cool<00:01:29.729> patterns<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.570> what's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
get some cool patterns so what's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.719 
get some cool patterns so what's
happening<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> corn<00:01:31.350> starch<00:01:31.729> granules

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
happening is the corn starch granules

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.580 
happening is the corn starch granules
have<00:01:32.790> sharp<00:01:33.299> little<00:01:33.540> pointy<00:01:33.810> edges<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.409> them

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
have sharp little pointy edges on them

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
have sharp little pointy edges on them
okay<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.159> when<00:01:35.369> there's<00:01:35.520> water<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.090> between

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
okay and when there's water in between

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
okay and when there's water in between
them<00:01:36.420> they<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.630> slide<00:01:36.900> past<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.439> another<00:01:37.619> but

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
them they can slide past one another but

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.460 
them they can slide past one another but
when<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.759> apply<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> force<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.720> kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> lock

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
when you apply a force you kind of lock

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.020 
when you apply a force you kind of lock
those<00:01:40.710> granules<00:01:41.070> together<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:41.729> become

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
those granules together and they become

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.749 
those granules together and they become
like<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> hardened<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:43.140> ball<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.490> mean

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
like a hardened little ball so I mean

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.130 
like a hardened little ball so I mean
some<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:44.939> cool<00:01:45.360> science<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.020> can

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
some really cool science that you can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.090 
some really cool science that you can
even<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.860> your<00:01:46.979> kitchen

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
even you can do this in your kitchen

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.620 
even you can do this in your kitchen
right<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> mean<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.000> make<00:01:48.060> these<00:01:48.270> stuff<00:01:48.450> up

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
right I mean you can make these stuff up

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.149 
right I mean you can make these stuff up
safe<00:01:49.020> ingredients<00:01:49.590> right<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.890> call<00:01:50.040> me

water one part cornstarch but really the
really<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> real<00:01:56.130> way<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.280> tell<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.549> got<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
really the real way to tell you got the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.249 
really the real way to tell you got the
right<00:01:56.850> mixture<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.299> play<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.899> until

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
right mixture is just play with it until

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.940 
right mixture is just play with it until
it<00:01:58.350> feels<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.579> one<00:02:00.439> caution<00:02:01.439> with

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
it feels right now one caution with

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.609 
it feels right now one caution with
Oobleck<00:02:02.430> don't<00:02:03.360> pour<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.140> down<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> drain

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
Oobleck don't pour it down the drain

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.289 
Oobleck don't pour it down the drain
because<00:02:05.579> that's<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.939> totally<00:02:06.270> different

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
because that's a totally different

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.809 
because that's a totally different
experiment<00:02:06.960> called<00:02:07.079> call<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> plumber<00:02:07.819> for

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
experiment called call the plumber for

extraction<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.289> inured<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.520> you're

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
extraction in your inured so you're

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.700 
extraction in your inured so you're
gonna<00:02:12.000> get<00:02:12.209> chunks<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
gonna get chunks like that and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.920 
gonna get chunks like that and
pipes<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.460> it'll<00:02:15.210> it'll<00:02:15.450> anything<00:02:15.780> else

pipes and it's it'll it'll anything else

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.660 
pipes and it's it'll it'll anything else
good<00:02:16.080> it'll<00:02:16.230> settle<00:02:16.560> down<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.250> really

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
good it'll settle down and get really

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.910 
good it'll settle down and get really
really<00:02:17.880> hard<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.200> will<00:02:19.320> definitely<00:02:19.560> plug

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
really hard and it will definitely plug

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.090 
really hard and it will definitely plug

you can slap it you can if you have

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.640 
you can slap it you can if you have
enough<00:02:33.330> cornstarch<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.230> actually<00:02:34.470> walk

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
enough cornstarch you can actually walk

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.500 
enough cornstarch you can actually walk
on<00:02:34.680> top<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.280> because<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.850> hardens<00:02:36.240> up<00:02:36.300> as

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
on top of it because it hardens up as

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.910 
on top of it because it hardens up as
you<00:02:36.690> don't<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.290> began<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.530> walk<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.770> heads

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you don't you began to walk on heads

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.770 
you don't you began to walk on heads
cool<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.220> think<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.700> how<00:02:39.360> cool<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.750> that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
cool I think this is how cool is that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.480 
cool I think this is how cool is that
just<00:02:40.320> melts<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.740> then<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.950> melts<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.460> your

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
just melts and then it melts in your

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.370 
just melts and then it melts in your
hand<00:02:42.030> back<00:02:42.240> up<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.630> then<00:02:42.900> when<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.110> hits<00:02:43.290> that

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
hand back up and then when it hits that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.350 
hand back up and then when it hits that
force<00:02:43.740> down<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.130> speaker<00:02:44.460> becomes<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.180> lot

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
force down on the speaker becomes a lot

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.470 
force down on the speaker becomes a lot
that's<00:02:45.690> cool<00:02:45.930> most<00:02:46.170> very<00:02:47.130> cool<00:02:47.340> all<00:02:47.610> right
