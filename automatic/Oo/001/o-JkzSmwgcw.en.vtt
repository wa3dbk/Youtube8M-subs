heat<00:02:55.569> up<00:02:57.510> okay<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:58.569> I'll<00:02:59.049> show<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.560> colors

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
heat up okay so I'll show you the colors

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.020 
heat up okay so I'll show you the colors
when<00:03:00.069> they<00:03:00.219> go<00:03:00.430> warm<00:03:02.189> so<00:03:03.189> this<00:03:03.370> one<00:03:03.549> goes<00:03:03.760> some

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
when they go warm so this one goes some

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.369 
when they go warm so this one goes some
a<00:03:04.060> really<00:03:04.569> raspberry<00:03:05.349> pink<00:03:05.939> to<00:03:06.939> a<00:03:07.269> very<00:03:07.840> pale

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
a really raspberry pink to a very pale

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.500 
a really raspberry pink to a very pale
shimmery<00:03:08.919> pink<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.579> can<00:03:09.699> still<00:03:09.939> see<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.329> gold

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
shimmery pink you can still see the gold

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.809 
shimmery pink you can still see the gold
tones<00:03:10.840> in<00:03:11.109> there<00:03:12.449> really<00:03:13.449> pretty<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:15.579> then

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
tones in there really pretty and then

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.309 
tones in there really pretty and then
obviously<00:03:15.969> when<00:03:16.299> it<00:03:16.419> goes<00:03:16.569> cold

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
obviously when it goes cold

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.849 
obviously when it goes cold
goes<00:03:17.949> back<00:03:18.219> to<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.609> much<00:03:19.060> darker<00:03:19.560> pink<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.859> then

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
goes back to a much darker pink and then

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:32.640 
goes back to a much darker pink and then
this<00:03:24.189> one<00:03:24.519> goes<00:03:24.930> from<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.049> Goldy<00:03:26.590> Brown<00:03:31.650> this

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
this one goes from a Goldy Brown this

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.460 
this one goes from a Goldy Brown this
one<00:03:32.829> goes<00:03:33.009> to<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.280> really<00:03:33.849> soft<00:03:34.239> pale<00:03:34.659> apricot

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
one goes to a really soft pale apricot

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.740 
one goes to a really soft pale apricot
color<00:03:35.859> I<00:03:35.889> would<00:03:36.040> say<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.819> is<00:03:38.579> there<00:03:39.579> you<00:03:39.669> go<00:03:39.819> so

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
color I would say it is there you go so

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.280 
color I would say it is there you go so
you<00:03:40.780> can<00:03:40.870> still<00:03:41.290> see<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.620> gold<00:03:41.829> flecks<00:03:43.139> it's<00:03:44.139> a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
you can still see the gold flecks it's a

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.449 
you can still see the gold flecks it's a
really<00:03:44.650> peachy<00:03:45.280> color<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.699> one<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:47.459> then

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
really peachy color that one and then

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.399 
really peachy color that one and then
this<00:03:49.120> one<00:03:49.449> is<00:03:49.659> the<00:03:49.689> one<00:03:49.930> obviously<00:03:50.229> I'm

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
this one is the one obviously I'm

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.679 
this one is the one obviously I'm
wearing<00:03:50.919> so<00:03:51.909> when<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.329> is<00:03:52.479> warm<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:55.000> goes<00:03:55.269> this

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
wearing so when it is warm it goes this

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:04.429 
wearing so when it is warm it goes this
really<00:03:59.699> really<00:04:00.699> sort<00:04:00.969> of<00:04:01.000> pale<00:04:01.299> blue<00:04:01.799> color

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
really really sort of pale blue color

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.760 
really really sort of pale blue color
really<00:04:05.439> nice

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.770 

and<00:04:09.770> then<00:04:10.130> this<00:04:10.580> one<00:04:10.850> there's<00:04:11.030> not<00:04:11.150> much<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.720> a

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
and then this one there's not much of a

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.600 
and then this one there's not much of a
change<00:04:12.020> with<00:04:12.320> this<00:04:12.530> one<00:04:12.800> it's<00:04:13.010> very<00:04:13.280> very

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
change with this one it's very very

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.770 
change with this one it's very very
subtle<00:04:14.740> but<00:04:15.740> it<00:04:15.860> just<00:04:16.130> goes<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.540> sort<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.630> a

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
subtle but it just goes a sort of a

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.729 
subtle but it just goes a sort of a
brighter<00:04:18.170> orange<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:20.600> while<00:04:20.750> do<00:04:20.959> i<00:04:20.989> half<00:04:21.380> dip

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
brighter orange and while do i half dip

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.180 
brighter orange and while do i half dip
it<00:04:21.890> in<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.540> cold<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:24.440> you<00:04:24.650> can<00:04:24.830> see<00:04:25.040> the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
it in the cold and you can see the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.620 
it in the cold and you can see the
transition<00:04:25.610> there<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.090> that's<00:04:26.240> more<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.540> a

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
transition there so that's more of a

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.330 
transition there so that's more of a
gradient<00:04:27.200> one<00:04:27.380> that<00:04:27.590> ones<00:04:27.770> with<00:04:27.920> darker

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
gradient one that ones with darker

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.520 
gradient one that ones with darker
orange<00:04:28.610> at<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.790> bottom<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.420> lighter<00:04:30.200> at<00:04:30.500> the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
orange at the bottom and lighter at the

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.270 
orange at the bottom and lighter at the
top<00:04:31.870> this<00:04:32.870> one<00:04:33.110> is<00:04:33.260> obviously<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.620> really<00:04:33.920> dark

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
top this one is obviously a really dark

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:43.210 
top this one is obviously a really dark
brown

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.070 

and<00:04:43.820> then<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.030> goes<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.210> more<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.810> chocolate

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
and then it goes to more of a chocolate

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:53.170 
and then it goes to more of a chocolate
color<00:04:48.250> you<00:04:49.250> can<00:04:49.400> see<00:04:49.640> that<00:04:51.550> so<00:04:52.550> if<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:52.730> dip<00:04:52.970> it<00:04:53.090> in

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
color you can see that so if I dip it in

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.690 
color you can see that so if I dip it in
the<00:04:53.300> cold<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:53.840> can<00:04:54.110> see<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.650> transition<00:04:55.400> on

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
the cold you can see the transition on

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.890 
the cold you can see the transition on
that<00:04:55.880> one<00:04:56.000> as<00:04:56.120> well<00:04:58.480> okay<00:04:59.480> so<00:04:59.510> what<00:04:59.720> I'm<00:04:59.810> gonna

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.040 

there's<00:05:48.140> the<00:05:48.380> image<00:05:49.600> and<00:05:50.600> all<00:05:50.720> I'm<00:05:50.840> going<00:05:50.990> to

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
there's the image and all I'm going to

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.280 
there's the image and all I'm going to
do<00:05:51.230> is<00:05:51.530> literally<00:05:51.950> stamp<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:53.210> end<00:05:53.750> and<00:05:54.200> I'm

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
do is literally stamp the end and I'm

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.850 
do is literally stamp the end and I'm
just<00:05:54.320> gonna<00:05:54.620> squish<00:05:55.040> it<00:05:55.220> in<00:05:55.340> like<00:05:55.640> that<00:05:56.860> pull

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
just gonna squish it in like that pull

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.150 
just gonna squish it in like that pull
it<00:05:57.980> up<00:05:58.100> and<00:05:58.690> then<00:05:59.690> there's<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.680> image<00:06:00.800> there

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
it up and then there's the image there

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.810 
it up and then there's the image there
like<00:06:01.490> that<00:06:01.669> so<00:06:02.440> I'll<00:06:03.440> quickly<00:06:03.590> show<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:04.190> on

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
like that so I'll quickly show you on

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:15.610 
like that so I'll quickly show you on
another<00:06:05.390> nail

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.060 

I<00:06:17.230> thought<00:06:18.230> this<00:06:18.320> would<00:06:18.470> be<00:06:18.590> a<00:06:18.620> cool<00:06:18.890> design

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
I thought this would be a cool design

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.040 
I thought this would be a cool design
because<00:06:19.580> then<00:06:19.700> you<00:06:19.820> when<00:06:20.150> it<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.690> colors

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
because then you when it the colors

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:29.700 
because then you when it the colors
transitioning<00:06:21.940> you<00:06:22.940> can<00:06:23.180> see<00:06:23.720> the<00:06:23.990> stamping

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.940 

okay

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
okay

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.620 
okay
so<00:06:31.580> as<00:06:31.640> you<00:06:31.760> can<00:06:31.850> see<00:06:31.910> like<00:06:32.270> you've<00:06:32.390> got<00:06:32.510> the

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
so as you can see like you've got the

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.330 
so as you can see like you've got the
darker<00:06:33.020> blue<00:06:33.340> and<00:06:34.340> then<00:06:35.920> going<00:06:36.920> up<00:06:37.010> to<00:06:37.190> the

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
darker blue and then going up to the

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.360 
darker blue and then going up to the
lighter<00:06:38.240> blue<00:06:38.570> so<00:06:39.530> I'll<00:06:39.650> do<00:06:39.800> I<00:06:39.830> finish<00:06:40.190> these

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
lighter blue so I'll do I finish these

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.280 
lighter blue so I'll do I finish these
off<00:06:40.550> and<00:06:40.700> topcoat<00:06:40.940> them<00:06:41.360> and<00:06:41.570> show<00:06:41.780> you<00:06:41.840> okay

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
off and topcoat them and show you okay

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.540 
off and topcoat them and show you okay
so<00:06:42.350> this<00:06:42.530> is<00:06:42.710> the<00:06:42.830> finished<00:06:43.160> design

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
so this is the finished design

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.460 
so this is the finished design
I<00:06:43.850> think<00:06:44.420> that's<00:06:44.570> really<00:06:44.840> pretty<00:06:45.020> actually

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
I think that's really pretty actually

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.370 
I think that's really pretty actually
it's<00:06:45.560> soft<00:06:45.770> it's<00:06:45.920> like<00:06:46.010> a<00:06:46.130> chevron<00:06:46.700> French<00:06:47.570> now

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
it's soft it's like a chevron French now

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.960 
it's soft it's like a chevron French now
you<00:06:48.440> can<00:06:48.650> see<00:06:48.950> the<00:06:49.160> sort<00:06:49.400> of<00:06:49.460> the<00:06:49.670> green

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
you can see the sort of the green

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.480 
you can see the sort of the green
glistening<00:06:50.660> in<00:06:50.900> there<00:06:51.290> at<00:06:51.380> the<00:06:51.470> moment<00:06:51.890> I'll
