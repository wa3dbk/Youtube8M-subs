00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.300
 it was dear students came to the question 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.630
 number 8 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.350
 see the text considering that the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.520
 serve symbols or will it be me and this is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.830
 Whether or not this is the feel they represent 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.390
 logical operations or not and 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:53.190
 conditional respectively 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.000
 the juve has subsequent about logic 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:03.900
 of argumentation and this structures 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:09.590
 logs that are eight cesp only one 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:14.430
 of the three positions pqer is false 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.810
 then the compound proposition tries 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.470
 not that the office does not that then r will be 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:30.200
 true 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:33.899
 right or wrong let's solve solution 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.869
 if only one of these propositions 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:41.100
 ppi whatever i get is fake 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.170
 will this proposition be true? 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.750
 Let's check the truth table for 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.990
 this cavo only says weight with this 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.860
 true only that truth and only r 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.409
 true 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.780
 So let's take a look at the truth of this. 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.039
 case and vice will actually give yes 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.049
 let's not even do table truth 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.560
 from this opposite position 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.300
 Let's put a column to the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.230
 proposition to have a column for the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.200
 proposition that is a column for the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.910
 proposition r 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.080
 first let's make a column of the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.110
 denial that after I have the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:35.370
 claim that I'm going to do 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:39.890
 the fipe proposition is then not that now 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:47.790
 I'm going to make the Sidon proposition that 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:51.150
 if not what is then is and having these 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:03:01.680
 two columns I do this what it would be 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:10.110
 then the chip is then not what or if not 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:14.130
 what is r then by the turkey by the spun we 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:19.230
 we accept that only one of the three 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:23.850
 propositions eike and i are false then 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.140
 we can only have false p 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:33.450
 as soon as the true one is true or 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:37.650
 we can have in truth and that false and 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.830
 r true we can have true pv 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.680
 what true er is false 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.820
 we need to analyze only those three 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.020
 cases 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:53.760
 so let's build the non-column 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.980
 that the denial of the proposition that lies 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.610
 truth table let's deny the column of 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.600
 that if the denial is true 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.730
 which will be false if that was false link 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.430
 not that it will be true 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.380
 the one that was true did not link 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.480
 it will be false 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.760
 now I do if pp so not this 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.830
 My column and no conquest on Wednesday 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:28.980
 column cp then not that truth table 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:34.790
 if false false heitham of ip truth 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:44.400
 then if truth then true of 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:46.010
 This truth, then false from the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.380
 false 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.889
 now I will make the column but it 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.560
 then r if not queen 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.669
 it 's not the fourth column and then the 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.020
 third 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:03.960
 note that the antecedent is not that the 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.370
 toss not what then r 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:13.379
 cial line feel the truth of the 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:19.080
 truth but who then is true 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:26.569
 truth and if not who 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:30.110
 then r if false then false of truth 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:35.099
 if not then 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:42.240
 now let's do the egg or the one or 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:45.060
 With that , with that, there was this 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.650
 with this you hear from fao quoted i am not fake 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.710
 it is true 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:57.479
 vidal truth or truth in truth 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:06:00.629
 truth or truth of false truth or 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:05.069
 truth of truth 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:10.620
 we have only one of the three 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:14.520
 propositions is false then this 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:17.129
 proposition will always be true repairs 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.449
 that she will be five times right 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:26.909
 so the item is right 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:32.939
 the answer is certain that only one of the 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:34.199
 three positions and that is exactly one 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:37.080
 false 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:41.279
 this compound proposition will always be 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:47.460
 true true answer that they are 81 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:50.029
 answer right hope you already have 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:54.899
 formalized well the truth table 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:56.419
 cpp issues require truth table 

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:59.550
 nor mobilized 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.839
 Let's keep good luck here until 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.740
 the next question 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.740
 thank you
