any<00:00:12.750> problem<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.880> normal<00:00:14.880> origami<00:00:15.590> people

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
any problem for normal origami people

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.859 
any problem for normal origami people
but<00:00:17.359> let's<00:00:18.359> see<00:00:18.680> first<00:00:19.820> go<00:00:20.820> take<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.510> corner

but let's see first go take this corner

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.160 
but let's see first go take this corner
and<00:00:22.260> fold<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.460> over<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.090> make<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:25.080> good

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
and fold it over and make a very good

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.740 
and fold it over and make a very good
crease<00:00:27.500> then<00:00:28.500> you're<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> same

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
crease then you're going to do the same

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.889 
crease then you're going to do the same
for<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> other<00:00:31.019> corner<00:00:31.320> same<00:00:31.949> direction<00:00:32.899> just

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
for the other corner same direction just

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.850 
for the other corner same direction just
fold<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.680> over<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.210> just

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
like that so the thing it's inside out

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.900 
like that so the thing it's inside out
then<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.190> you're<00:00:53.340> gonna<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.879> you're

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
then what you're gonna do is you're

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.250 
then what you're gonna do is you're
gonna<00:00:54.980> close<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:58.370> bring<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.520> down<00:01:00.260> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
gonna close that in bring it down to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.289 
gonna close that in bring it down to
there<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.100> then<00:01:02.160> push<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.210> down<00:01:04.129> there<00:01:05.299> put

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
there and then push that down there put

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.289 
there and then push that down there put
it<00:01:06.390> into<00:01:06.659> place<00:01:07.640> she<00:01:08.640> should<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:09.030> something

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
it into place she should get something

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.590 
it into place she should get something
looks<00:01:09.720> wrecked<00:01:10.070> like<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:12.320> then<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.350> fold<00:01:13.680> up

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
looks wrecked like that then you fold up

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.920 
looks wrecked like that then you fold up
this<00:01:15.600> piece<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.990> paper<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:17.030> I'll<00:01:18.030> put<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> up

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
this piece of paper here I'll put it up

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.190 
this piece of paper here I'll put it up
there<00:01:21.470> then<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> other<00:01:23.040> side<00:01:24.200> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
there then you go on the other side and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.550 
there then you go on the other side and
put<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> same<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.560> each

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
put it up there and do the same on each

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.859 
put it up there and do the same on each
side<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.290> take<00:01:35.159> each<00:01:35.490> end<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.619> this

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
side so then you take each end here this

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:46.399 
side so then you take each end here this
then<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:42.350> like<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.750> all<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.079> way<00:01:46.320> into

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
then you like do the all the way into

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.069 
then you like do the all the way into
the<00:01:46.649> center<00:01:47.040> crease<00:01:47.509> do<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> same<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the center crease do the same on the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.300 
the center crease do the same on the
other<00:01:49.140> side<00:01:50.180> two<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.210> each<00:01:51.509> side<00:01:51.829> just<00:01:52.829> saying

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
other side two on each side just saying

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.139 
other side two on each side just saying
and<00:01:54.119> then<00:01:57.170> possibly<00:01:58.170> after<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.399> step<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and then possibly after this step is the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.260 
and then possibly after this step is the
hardest<00:02:00.180> part<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> whole<00:02:01.170> model<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.579> take

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
hardest part of the whole model so take

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.520 
hardest part of the whole model so take
these<00:02:03.509> bits<00:02:04.409> there<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.729> fold<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.689> over<00:02:06.750> so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
these bits there and fold that over so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.589 
these bits there and fold that over so
you<00:02:07.619> end<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.160> little<00:02:08.280> pocket<00:02:09.179> there

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
you end up with a little pocket there

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.040 
you end up with a little pocket there
and<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> same<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.800> other<00:02:10.830> side<00:02:12.050> you'll

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and do the same on the other side you'll

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.910 
and do the same on the other side you'll
end<00:02:13.349> up

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
end up

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.990 
end up
get<00:02:14.270> there<00:02:15.500> then<00:02:16.500> put<00:02:16.709> your<00:02:16.830> fingers<00:02:17.220> inside

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
get there then put your fingers inside

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.050 
get there then put your fingers inside
