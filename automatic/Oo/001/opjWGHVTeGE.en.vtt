00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
took here in Arizona of during this a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.100 
took here in Arizona of during this a
dust<00:00:38.219> storm<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.469> it's<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.680> these<00:00:40.829> huge

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
dust storm and it's just these huge

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.560 
dust storm and it's just these huge
crazy-looking<00:00:43.110> clouds<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:45.120> yeah<00:00:45.300> we're<00:00:45.480> gonna

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
crazy-looking clouds so yeah we're gonna

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.779 
crazy-looking clouds so yeah we're gonna
use<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.070> because<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.129> really<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> way

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
use this because I really like the way

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.250 
use this because I really like the way
it<00:00:48.120> looks<00:00:49.700> after<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.940> put<00:00:51.149> down<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.600> picture

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
it looks after we put down this picture

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
it looks after we put down this picture
of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> clouds<00:00:52.649> shrink<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> down<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:54.180> gonna

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
of the clouds shrink it down we're gonna

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.099 
of the clouds shrink it down we're gonna
put<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> layer<00:00:55.620> mask<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:57.180> invert<00:00:57.960> it

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
put on a layer mask and then invert it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.920 
put on a layer mask and then invert it
so<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.320> disappears<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.789> let's<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.539> kind

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
so it disappears and let's just get kind

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.870 
so it disappears and let's just get kind
of<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.230> rough<00:01:02.539> like<00:01:04.640> interpretation<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> what

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
of a rough like interpretation of what

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.310 
of a rough like interpretation of what
these<00:01:06.000> clouds<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> look<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.020> so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
these clouds are going to look like so

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.870 
these clouds are going to look like so
let's<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:07.950> start<00:01:08.100> we're<00:01:08.490> gonna<00:01:08.580> start

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
let's just start we're gonna start

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
let's just start we're gonna start
filling<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.750> layer<00:01:10.140> mask<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.890> white

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
filling in that layer mask with white

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.570 
filling in that layer mask with white
and<00:01:12.140> begin<00:01:13.140> drawing<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.950> these<00:01:14.490> clouds<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
and begin drawing in these clouds I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.550 
and begin drawing in these clouds I
should<00:01:17.580> say<00:01:17.700> smoke<00:01:18.090> drawing<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
should say smoke drawing in these the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.210 
should say smoke drawing in these the
smoke<00:01:20.509> it's<00:01:21.509> gonna<00:01:21.659> billow<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.350> into<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> end

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
smoke it's gonna billow up into the end

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.380 
smoke it's gonna billow up into the end
of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> sky

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.160 

okay<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.600> that's<00:01:28.689> that's<00:01:29.499> pretty<00:01:29.770> rough<00:01:31.170> what

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
okay and that's that's pretty rough what

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.779 
okay and that's that's pretty rough what
that'll<00:01:32.710> do<00:01:34.619> okay<00:01:35.619> you'll<00:01:35.770> notice<00:01:36.069> you'll

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
that'll do okay you'll notice you'll

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.749 
that'll do okay you'll notice you'll
notice<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.119> couple<00:01:37.270> things<00:01:37.539> in<00:01:37.750> this<00:01:37.990> image

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
notice a couple things in this image

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.609 
notice a couple things in this image
specifically<00:01:39.759> is<00:01:39.909> that<00:01:40.719> these<00:01:40.840> clouds<00:01:41.229> the

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
specifically is that these clouds the

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.240 
specifically is that these clouds the
light<00:01:41.829> is<00:01:42.009> shining<00:01:42.039> upwards<00:01:43.920> into<00:01:44.920> them<00:01:45.069> so

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
light is shining upwards into them so

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.469 
light is shining upwards into them so
what<00:01:45.340> we're<00:01:45.459> gonna<00:01:45.520> have<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.819> do<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.240> we're

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
what we're gonna have to do is we're

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.640 
what we're gonna have to do is we're
gonna<00:01:46.539> have<00:01:46.689> to<00:01:46.840> flip<00:01:47.140> this<00:01:47.289> around

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.940 

to<00:01:50.250> make<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.120> more<00:01:51.240> accurate<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:52.740> far

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
to make it a little more accurate as far

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.490 
to make it a little more accurate as far
as<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.130> sun<00:01:53.370> shining<00:01:53.730> down<00:01:54.260> just<00:01:55.260> bring<00:01:55.470> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
as the sun shining down just bring that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.020 
as the sun shining down just bring that
up<00:01:55.650> see<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.250> looks<00:01:56.430> much<00:01:56.610> better

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
up see that looks much better

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.370 
up see that looks much better
and<00:01:57.290> we're<00:01:58.290> gonna<00:01:58.410> do<00:01:58.620> one<00:01:58.830> better<00:01:59.720> and<00:02:00.720> we're

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
and we're gonna do one better and we're

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.520 
and we're gonna do one better and we're
going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.360> duplicate<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.690> layer<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:04.380> you're

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
going to duplicate this layer if you're

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.440 
going to duplicate this layer if you're
doing<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.950> using<00:02:05.460> normal<00:02:05.760> clouds<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.300> might

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
doing like using normal clouds you might

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
doing like using normal clouds you might
want<00:02:06.660> to<00:02:06.750> duplicate<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.260> few<00:02:07.590> layers<00:02:07.800> of<00:02:08.100> clouds

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
want to duplicate a few layers of clouds

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.540 
want to duplicate a few layers of clouds
and<00:02:09.320> we're<00:02:10.320> just<00:02:10.410> gonna<00:02:10.560> duplicate<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and we're just gonna duplicate it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.150 
and we're just gonna duplicate it
rotate<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> second<00:02:13.050> one<00:02:13.200> I'm<00:02:13.710> gonna<00:02:13.890> rotate

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
rotate the second one I'm gonna rotate

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.740 
rotate the second one I'm gonna rotate
it<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.580> direction<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.390> actual

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it in the direction of the actual

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.580 
it in the direction of the actual
sunlight

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
sunlight

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.350 
sunlight
I<00:02:16.620> think<00:02:17.070> that'll<00:02:17.310> help<00:02:17.430> bring<00:02:17.730> together<00:02:17.970> this

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
I think that'll help bring together this

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.060 
I think that'll help bring together this
painting<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.900> little<00:02:19.140> more<00:02:19.260> realistic<00:02:19.590> and

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
painting a little more realistic and

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.699 
painting a little more realistic and
then<00:02:20.850> bring<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.570> opacity<00:02:21.840> down<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.380> bit<00:02:24.709> I'm

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
then bring the opacity down a bit I'm

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.730 
then bring the opacity down a bit I'm
gonna<00:02:26.010> put<00:02:26.459> mine<00:02:26.730> at<00:02:27.620> about<00:02:28.620> 50%<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:30.500> now<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
gonna put mine at about 50% and now that

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.770 
gonna put mine at about 50% and now that
adds<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.040> little<00:02:32.190> bit<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.459> randomness<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.360> so

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
adds a little bit of randomness to it so

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.810 
adds a little bit of randomness to it so
it<00:02:33.930> doesn't<00:02:34.230> look<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:34.770> like<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.100> same<00:02:37.820> adds

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
it doesn't look just like the same adds

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.820 
it doesn't look just like the same adds
a<00:02:38.910> little<00:02:39.060> bit<00:02:39.180> more<00:02:39.270> character<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.470> it

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
a little bit more character to it

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.710 
a little bit more character to it
just<00:02:41.160> move<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.400> around<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.480> place<00:02:42.690> that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
just move this around to the place that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.850 
just move this around to the place that
you<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:47.360> I'm<00:02:48.360> going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.840> put<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.500> layer

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
you like and I'm going to put this layer

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.229 
you like and I'm going to put this layer
on<00:02:50.160> top<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> other<00:02:50.970> layer<00:02:51.980> by<00:02:53.030> what<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.120> do

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
on top of the other layer by what you do

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.900 
on top of the other layer by what you do
is<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.390> hold<00:02:54.510> down<00:02:54.690> alt<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:56.519> click

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
is you hold down alt and you click

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.380 
is you hold down alt and you click
between<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.019> two<00:02:58.230> layers<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.970> stack<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.239> one

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
between the two layers to stack the one

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.259 
between the two layers to stack the one
layer<00:03:00.570> on<00:03:00.660> top<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.200> other<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.880> won't<00:03:03.090> be

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
layer on top of the other and I won't be

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.590 
layer on top of the other and I won't be
needing<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:05.220> layer<00:03:05.519> mask<00:03:05.850> anymore<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.510> I'm

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
needing this layer mask anymore so I'm

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.770 
needing this layer mask anymore so I'm
just<00:03:06.720> gonna<00:03:06.840> go<00:03:07.019> ahead<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.260> delete<00:03:07.500> it

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.800 

delete<00:03:12.620> there<00:03:13.340> we<00:03:13.430> go<00:03:14.140> yes

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
delete there we go yes

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.900 
delete there we go yes
okay<00:03:17.810> now<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.410> looks<00:03:18.620> pretty<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:19.730> is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
okay now this looks pretty this is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.820 
okay now this looks pretty this is
looking<00:03:20.209> better<00:03:20.569> but<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.410> color<00:03:21.709> is

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
looking better but the color is

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.640 
looking better but the color is
definitely<00:03:22.459> off<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.690> what<00:03:24.020> I'm<00:03:24.140> gonna<00:03:24.260> do<00:03:24.500> is

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
definitely off so what I'm gonna do is

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.080 
definitely off so what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:03:24.800> gonna<00:03:24.920> make<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.190> solid<00:03:25.700> color<00:03:27.010> layer<00:03:28.090> stack

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
I'm gonna make a solid color layer stack

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.990 
I'm gonna make a solid color layer stack
it<00:03:29.270> on<00:03:29.330> top<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:30.020> also<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:31.459> we're<00:03:31.880> gonna

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
it on top of this also and we're gonna

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.030 
it on top of this also and we're gonna
adjust<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.569> color<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.230> matches<00:03:33.440> the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
adjust the color so it matches the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.070 
adjust the color so it matches the
background<00:03:34.280> vaguely<00:03:34.850> so<00:03:35.450> I'm<00:03:35.660> gonna<00:03:35.810> color

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
background vaguely so I'm gonna color

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.160 
background vaguely so I'm gonna color
sample<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:36.830> right<00:03:37.160> here<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:37.690> this<00:03:38.690> forest

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
sample this right here this this forest

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.710 
sample this right here this this forest
in<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.440> back<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.340> that's<00:03:40.520> way<00:03:40.880> too<00:03:40.910> dark<00:03:41.330> but

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
in the back and that's way too dark but

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.540 
in the back and that's way too dark but
we're<00:03:41.870> gonna<00:03:41.989> put<00:03:42.260> on<00:03:42.410> an<00:03:42.530> overlay<00:03:42.980> adjustment

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
we're gonna put on an overlay adjustment

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.729 
we're gonna put on an overlay adjustment
layer<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.970> see<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:44.989> kind<00:03:45.110> of<00:03:45.200> adds<00:03:45.410> like

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
layer and see that kind of adds like

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.380 
layer and see that kind of adds like
this<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:47.570> brings<00:03:47.930> out<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.140> color<00:03:48.290> in<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.860> and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
this it brings out the color in it and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:56.170 
this it brings out the color in it and
then<00:03:50.390> turn<00:03:50.750> down<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.019> opacity<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:53.500> nice<00:03:55.180> I'm

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
then turn down the opacity to nice I'm

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:05.110 
then turn down the opacity to nice I'm
gonna<00:03:56.300> say<00:03:56.600> for<00:03:56.989> mine<00:03:58.269> about<00:03:59.269> 85%<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.760> just

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
gonna say for mine about 85% and just

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.490 
gonna say for mine about 85% and just
these<00:04:05.269> guys<00:04:05.480> down<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.810> little<00:04:06.080> bit<00:04:06.260> more

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
these guys down a little bit more

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.130 
these guys down a little bit more
looking<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.280> little<00:04:07.940> bit<00:04:08.209> it's<00:04:08.540> too<00:04:08.720> dark<00:04:08.989> at

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
looking a little bit it's too dark at

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.509 
looking a little bit it's too dark at
the<00:04:09.230> bottom<00:04:09.560> I'm<00:04:09.680> not<00:04:10.310> really<00:04:10.519> digging<00:04:10.700> that

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:30.050 

yeah

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.210 

okay<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:31.110> now<00:04:31.440> once<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:31.740> have<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.920> at<00:04:32.040> this

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
okay so now once you have it at this

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.330 
okay so now once you have it at this
point<00:04:32.520> you're<00:04:32.730> you're<00:04:33.630> ready<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.340> start

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
point you're you're ready to start

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.630 
point you're you're ready to start
actually<00:04:35.520> creating<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.750> smoke<00:04:37.110> itself

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
actually creating the smoke itself

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.380 
actually creating the smoke itself
because<00:04:38.640> this<00:04:38.850> smoke<00:04:39.150> looks<00:04:39.420> pretty<00:04:40.020> fake<00:04:41.390> and

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
because this smoke looks pretty fake and

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.670 
because this smoke looks pretty fake and
I'm<00:04:42.480> just<00:04:42.660> using<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.990> standard<00:04:43.460> fluffy<00:04:44.460> brush

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
I'm just using a standard fluffy brush

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.490 
I'm just using a standard fluffy brush
it'll<00:04:46.680> definitely<00:04:46.890> work<00:04:47.190> better<00:04:48.500> it'll

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
it'll definitely work better it'll

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.830 
it'll definitely work better it'll
definitely<00:04:49.620> work<00:04:49.860> better<00:04:50.190> if<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.580> use<00:04:50.840> an

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
definitely work better if you use an

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.310 
definitely work better if you use an
actual<00:04:52.140> cloud<00:04:52.470> brush<00:04:52.920> but<00:04:53.370> for<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.700> sake<00:04:53.940> of

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
actual cloud brush but for the sake of

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.930 
actual cloud brush but for the sake of
be<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.350> little<00:04:55.710> did<00:04:55.950> this<00:04:56.100> easily<00:04:56.580> I'm<00:04:56.730> not

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940
