the end of the straight underneath their

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.640 
the end of the straight underneath their
camera<00:05:47.460> point<00:05:47.699> here<00:05:47.969> with<00:05:48.719> nothing<00:05:48.869> more<00:05:49.080> than

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
camera point here with nothing more than

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.590 
camera point here with nothing more than
damn<00:05:50.040> on<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.400> brakes<00:05:50.639> lift<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.120> pedal<00:05:51.449> then

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
damn on the brakes lift the pedal then

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.999 
damn on the brakes lift the pedal then
right<00:05:51.810> back<00:05:51.960> into<00:05:52.139> again<00:05:52.410> that's<00:05:52.560> why<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:52.740> car

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
right back into again that's why the car

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:54.950 
right back into again that's why the car
is<00:05:53.160> bumping<00:05:53.490> around<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:54.000> much<00:05:54.150> then<00:05:54.780> it's<00:05:54.900> a

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
is bumping around so much then it's a

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.960 
is bumping around so much then it's a
very<00:05:55.139> hard<00:05:55.410> stop<00:05:55.680> again<00:05:55.949> in<00:05:56.100> some<00:05:56.310> cases<00:05:56.580> back

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
very hard stop again in some cases back

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.510 
very hard stop again in some cases back
to<00:05:57.259> third<00:05:58.259> or<00:05:58.440> even<00:05:58.470> second<00:05:59.009> gear<00:05:59.130> in<00:05:59.280> some<00:05:59.430> of

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
to third or even second gear in some of

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.330 
to third or even second gear in some of
the<00:05:59.580> cars<00:05:59.820> through<00:06:00.449> the<00:06:00.509> tight<00:06:00.750> right-hander

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
the cars through the tight right-hander

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.740 
the cars through the tight right-hander
so<00:06:02.340> again<00:06:02.639> it's<00:06:02.789> the<00:06:02.910> left-hand<00:06:03.300> side<00:06:03.539> of<00:06:03.570> the

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
so again it's the left-hand side of the

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.450 
so again it's the left-hand side of the
car<00:06:03.930> that<00:06:04.139> loads<00:06:04.350> up

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
car that loads up

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.670 
car that loads up
and<00:06:06.580> the<00:06:06.789> only<00:06:07.030> relief<00:06:07.300> from<00:06:07.569> that<00:06:07.630> oh<00:06:08.020> and<00:06:08.590> I

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
and the only relief from that oh and I

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.590 
and the only relief from that oh and I
think<00:06:08.889> that<00:06:09.100> our<00:06:09.550> race<00:06:09.789> leader<00:06:09.819> is<00:06:10.270> in<00:06:10.389> trouble

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
think that our race leader is in trouble

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.990

one<00:06:25.539> I<00:06:25.569> would<00:06:25.840> suggest<00:06:25.990> but<00:06:26.410> Brock<00:06:26.949> has<00:06:27.190> come

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
one I would suggest but Brock has come

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.710
