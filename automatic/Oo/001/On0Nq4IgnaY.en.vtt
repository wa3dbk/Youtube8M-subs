00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.540
 in the pavilion of inexmodable knowledge 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.520
 but we find ourselves like art callas 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.590
 she is the director of the laboratory 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.760
 inexpensive fashion of inexhaustible marten 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.130
 welcome to the pavilion of knowledge 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.720
 inexpensive upv and you offer a 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.470
 conference that revolved around the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.900
 challenges of the fashion market in colombia 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.240
 specifically with this what arguments 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.019
 in now the industry the sector 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.910
 textile-confection to say to the 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.560
 society that suddenly demystify the 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.970
 concept of crisis and precisely 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.820
 face these challenges of matter 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.500
 economic good the truth is that the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.809
 new challenges arise from the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.480
 transformation that the market has suffered 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.360
 Colombian with the arrival of brands 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.620
 most important in the world to the country 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.359
 they are only reaching the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.699
 major cities but also to 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.739
 intermediate cities and we have already been 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.680
 come to a lot of brands and 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.210
 every day we will continue to arrive more 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.230
 then some brands that are arriving 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.780
 with very clear strategies from its 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.730
 brand identity as such and with 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.770
 communication strategies put into 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.110
 scene at the 20 points instead of 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.110
 very defined sale 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.740
 which really make the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.140
 companies in the sector begin 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.940
 questioning how they are doing 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.820
 doing the processes within the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.400
 companies because the truth is to achieve 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.320
 recognition and differentiation and 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.410
 Brand positioning in the market 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.790
 It is not so easy with the arrival of 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.790
 these companies the issue of crisis 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.790
 Finally 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.780
 we as a Latin American have been 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.800
 so impacted by the global crisis and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.720
 that makes us continue at this time 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.670
 having as an interest for the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.920
 international markets towards colombia 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.290
 then it means that those brands 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.570
 the consumer will continue to arrive 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.790
 today is not looking for cheap price 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.800
 is looking for a product with value 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.630
 added with design 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.330
 obviously that is related to the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.360
 price but anyway he wants 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.020
 be current the investigations 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.000
 have shown us that the 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.190
 consumer is spending more on 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.350
 wardrobe and in fashion then this we 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.880
 It also generates the challenges of satisfying 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.890
 really the need of our 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.690
 consumers to what tools should 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.500
 come suddenly those new companies 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.270
 that are dedicated to the sector 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.310
 textile-confection for precisely 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.110
 bring it to everything that is this this 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.820
 great sector and good and obviously go out 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.990
 go ahead with your brands with your 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.990
 collections 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.730
 Well, we are focusing the issue on 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.760
 brand building truly and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.370
 we treat four fundamental points that 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.370
 are having a target consumer 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.220
 defined to study it know each 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.350
 more day where that information that 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.100
 get will be very valid tools 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.940
 to apply fashion trends the 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.940
 another point is 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.260
 be very clear about what the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.739
 brand communication 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.890
 how will those be in the expected language 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.230
 by that target consumer the product 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.180
 It is also another of the key points that 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.860
 we're not talking about doing blue jeans or 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.890
 T-shirts but to develop 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.700
 collections that truly 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.370
 satisfy the need of 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.400
 consumers today and the fourth point is 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.920
 the stage or point of sale to which 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.629
 many of our brands do not give you the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.180
 true importance that has 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.239
 because that's where the company presents 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.010
 the final exam with the final consumer 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.659
 marta finally what is then 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.489
 also that contribution that the 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.139
 academy that joins in this case with the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.389
 ex-fashion the pontifical university 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.459
 inexpensive bolivariana to offer them 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.590
 a reflective analytical point of view 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.150
 those issues of the textile-clothing sector 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.340
 the academy is fundamental and for me 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.720
 would be super valid and I think that a 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.120
 through the diplomas we are 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.299
 achieving is to raise awareness 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.300
 companies of these new ways of looking 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.120
 fashion the business as such 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.630
 and structure to help structure the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.000
 companies with truly areas 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.650
 strong and with a very strong address 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.960
 clear then I think all this 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.020
 part from the academy to generate that 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.750
 awareness of being updated in 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.530
 trends in technology in new 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.490
 tools so that they remain 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.340
 competitive not only in the market 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.470
 national but also reach markets 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.350
 international and now with the new 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.420
 challenges we face with the tlc 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.890
 the European community of marta many 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.870

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.040
