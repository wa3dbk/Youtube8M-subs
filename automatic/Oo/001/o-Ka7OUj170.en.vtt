which<00:00:44.309> comes<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.030> little<00:00:45.450> foil<00:00:46.460> package

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
which comes in this little foil package

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.920

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
boot so just go into recovery garbage is

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.250 
boot so just go into recovery garbage is
your<00:02:54.380> cd-rom<00:02:54.740> whichever<00:02:55.340> Drive<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:56.260> decide

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
to put it on and just go in obviously

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.140 
to put it on and just go in obviously
mind<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.220> my<00:03:04.460> first<00:03:04.730> time<00:03:04.880> doing

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
mind you this is my first time doing

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.690 
mind you this is my first time doing
this<00:03:05.420> as<00:03:05.630> well<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:07.370> going<00:03:07.550> to<00:03:07.610> be

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
this as well so it's going to be

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.050 
this as well so it's going to be
probably<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.480> few<00:03:08.690> food<00:03:09.140> bars<00:03:09.380> here<00:03:09.910> click<00:03:10.910> on

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
probably a few food bars here click on

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.980 
probably a few food bars here click on
setup<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.690> would<00:03:11.870> assume<00:03:12.940> supporting<00:03:13.940> OS<00:03:14.330> which

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990

would<00:03:15.200> be<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:16.010> know<00:03:16.130> our<00:03:16.790> XP<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:18.170> sir

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.199 

and<00:03:24.360> obviously<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:25.930> was<00:03:26.049> quick

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.470
