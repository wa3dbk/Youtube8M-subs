think once I get done with the final
fairing<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> side<00:01:53.790> which<00:01:54.180> way<00:01:54.600> I'm<00:01:54.780> going

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
fairing on the side which way I'm going

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.770 
fairing on the side which way I'm going
to<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:56.310> might<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.060> over<00:01:57.299> building<00:01:57.659> these

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
to go I might be over building these

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.010 
to go I might be over building these
things<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.409> might<00:01:58.680> be

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
things and I might be

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.410 
things and I might be
way<00:01:59.799> more<00:02:00.070> work<00:02:00.369> than<00:02:00.399> what<00:02:00.789> I<00:02:00.820> need<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.179> be

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
way more work than what I need to be

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.499 
way more work than what I need to be
doing<00:02:01.450> so<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.770> lot<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.280> think<00:02:03.399> about<00:02:03.549> that<00:02:03.880> but

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
doing so a lot to think about that but

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:05.969 
doing so a lot to think about that but
right<00:02:04.630> now<00:02:04.810> I've<00:02:04.990> got<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.350> all<00:02:05.530> marked<00:02:05.829> up

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
right now I've got this all marked up

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.089

wood out on the other end started the
bend<00:05:46.690> off<00:05:46.930> I<00:05:47.230> should<00:05:47.740> have<00:05:47.860> stopped<00:05:48.190> walk

around to the other side and pulled it

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.250 
around to the other side and pulled it
through<00:05:50.350> but<00:05:51.420> it<00:05:52.420> doesn't<00:05:52.720> look<00:05:52.840> like<00:05:53.050> it's

table saw now i will take the two pieces
and<00:06:45.880> put<00:06:46.270> them<00:06:46.300> on<00:06:46.480> the<00:06:46.540> side<00:06:46.900> of<00:06:46.930> the<00:06:47.110> barn<00:06:47.290> on

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
and put them on the side of the barn on

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.350 
and put them on the side of the barn on
the<00:06:47.560> nails<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:48.190> give<00:06:48.310> them<00:06:48.520> a<00:06:48.550> little<00:06:48.850> bit<00:06:49.150> of

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
the nails to give them a little bit of

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.690 
the nails to give them a little bit of
curb<00:06:50.140> but<00:06:50.470> i<00:06:50.530> have<00:06:50.800> to<00:06:50.830> remember<00:06:51.160> you<00:06:51.520> have<00:06:51.640> to

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
curb but i have to remember you have to

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.700 
curb but i have to remember you have to
mark<00:06:51.970> inside<00:06:52.330> and<00:06:52.540> outside<00:06:52.630> because<00:06:53.080> the

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
mark inside and outside because the

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.360 
mark inside and outside because the
inside<00:06:53.830> curve<00:06:54.370> on<00:06:54.550> one<00:06:54.790> is<00:06:55.000> the<00:06:55.120> out

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
inside curve on one is the out

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.210 
inside curve on one is the out
site<00:06:55.520> curve<00:06:55.790> on<00:06:56.030> the<00:06:56.150> other<00:06:56.300> one<00:06:56.479> so<00:06:57.040> we<00:06:58.040> need

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
site curve on the other one so we need

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.969 
site curve on the other one so we need
to<00:06:58.419> mark<00:06:59.419> them<00:06:59.570> so<00:06:59.780> which<00:06:59.960> way<00:07:00.139> you're<00:07:00.680> doing

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
to mark them so which way you're doing

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.980 
to mark them so which way you're doing
them<00:07:01.100> so<00:07:01.310> I'll<00:07:01.580> put<00:07:01.760> that<00:07:01.820> in<00:07:02.150> that<00:07:02.300> on<00:07:02.510> the

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
them so I'll put that in that on the

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.469 
them so I'll put that in that on the
barn<00:07:03.199> and<00:07:03.470> let<00:07:03.650> them<00:07:03.830> get<00:07:04.010> a<00:07:04.070> pre<00:07:04.340> curve<00:07:04.610> I<00:07:04.880> was

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 
barn and let them get a pre curve I was

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.180 
barn and let them get a pre curve I was
a<00:07:05.510> little<00:07:05.780> worried<00:07:05.990> but<00:07:06.139> first<00:07:06.440> whether<00:07:06.979> or

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
a little worried but first whether or

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.510 
a little worried but first whether or
not<00:07:07.310> these<00:07:07.520> things<00:07:07.580> would<00:07:08.000> be<00:07:09.400> resistant<00:07:10.400> to

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
not these things would be resistant to

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.430 
not these things would be resistant to
the<00:07:10.639> twist<00:07:10.910> is<00:07:11.120> up<00:07:11.270> near<00:07:11.479> the<00:07:11.510> bow<00:07:11.750> I'd<00:07:11.990> held<00:07:12.260> us

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
the twist is up near the bow I'd held us

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.870 
the twist is up near the bow I'd held us
another<00:07:12.710> piece<00:07:13.010> up<00:07:13.250> there<00:07:13.280> and<00:07:13.520> it<00:07:13.610> didn't

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
another piece up there and it didn't

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.280 
another piece up there and it didn't
seem<00:07:14.030> like<00:07:14.060> it<00:07:14.210> wanted<00:07:14.540> to<00:07:14.660> twist<00:07:14.900> in<00:07:15.050> but<00:07:15.229> I

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.290 
seem like it wanted to twist in but I

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.870 
seem like it wanted to twist in but I
think<00:07:15.500> a<00:07:15.590> little<00:07:15.740> bit<00:07:15.889> everything<00:07:16.370> will<00:07:16.550> twist

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
think a little bit everything will twist

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.480 
think a little bit everything will twist
fine<00:07:17.150> as<00:07:17.540> long<00:07:17.600> as<00:07:17.900> I<00:07:17.960> prebendant<00:07:18.530> and<00:07:19.370> if

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
fine as long as I prebendant and if

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.040 
fine as long as I prebendant and if
you'll<00:07:19.639> notice<00:07:19.729> it's<00:07:20.240> probably<00:07:20.720> going<00:07:20.870> to<00:07:20.930> be

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
you'll notice it's probably going to be

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.640 
you'll notice it's probably going to be
in<00:07:21.139> the<00:07:21.199> mid<00:07:21.350> 90s<00:07:21.710> today<00:07:21.800> we've<00:07:22.100> had<00:07:22.130> her<00:07:22.490> for

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.650 
in the mid 90s today we've had her for

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.260 
in the mid 90s today we've had her for
four<00:07:24.650> days<00:07:24.830> of<00:07:25.070> summer<00:07:25.250> now<00:07:25.490> so<00:07:25.760> it'll<00:07:26.030> turn

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
four days of summer now so it'll turn

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.080 
four days of summer now so it'll turn
rainy<00:07:26.600> here<00:07:26.930> probably<00:07:27.199> next<00:07:27.500> week<00:07:27.910> in<00:07:28.910> case

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
rainy here probably next week in case

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.270 
rainy here probably next week in case
you're<00:07:29.240> wondering
