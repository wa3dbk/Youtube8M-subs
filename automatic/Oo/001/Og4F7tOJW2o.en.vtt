don't<00:01:40.539> know<00:01:40.659> TLS<00:01:41.259> is<00:01:41.439> by<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:41.950> sculpey<00:01:42.369> brand

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
don't know TLS is by the sculpey brand

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.190 
don't know TLS is by the sculpey brand
and<00:01:42.849> female<00:01:43.149> deco<00:01:43.329> gel<00:01:43.569> is<00:01:43.750> by<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:43.959> female

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
and female deco gel is by the female

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.709 
and female deco gel is by the female
brand<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:45.579> just<00:01:45.849> kinda<00:01:46.000> wanted<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.299> see<00:01:46.509> how

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
brand and I just kinda wanted to see how

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.109 
brand and I just kinda wanted to see how
it<00:01:46.899> would<00:01:47.020> work<00:01:47.079> so<00:01:47.829> this<00:01:48.219> one<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.579> more<00:01:48.759> creamy

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
it would work so this one is more creamy

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.209 
it would work so this one is more creamy
I<00:01:49.420> use<00:01:49.840> TLS<00:01:50.079> for<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:50.560> because<00:01:50.739> I<00:01:50.920> found<00:01:51.129> that

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
I use TLS for that because I found that

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.010 
I use TLS for that because I found that
female<00:01:51.369> deco<00:01:51.700> gel<00:01:51.849> just<00:01:52.060> didn't<00:01:52.329> make<00:01:52.659> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
female deco gel just didn't make the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.649 
female deco gel just didn't make the
clay<00:01:53.860> soft<00:01:54.280> enough<00:01:54.640> with<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.209> female<00:01:55.479> deco

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
clay soft enough with the female deco

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.959 
clay soft enough with the female deco
gel<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.110> actually<00:01:56.770> use<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:56.979> on<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:57.459> purple

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
gel and actually use it on this purple

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.459 
gel and actually use it on this purple
jam<00:01:58.179> right<00:01:58.360> here<00:01:58.420> because<00:01:58.899> I<00:01:58.989> found<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.319> made

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
jam right here because I found it made

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:00.749 
jam right here because I found it made
it<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.619> little<00:01:59.739> more<00:01:59.890> liquidy<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.340> little<00:02:00.610> more

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
it a little more liquidy a little more

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.089 
it a little more liquidy a little more
Jam<00:02:01.179> like<00:02:01.450> so<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:02.319> is<00:02:02.439> what<00:02:02.590> these<00:02:02.770> two<00:02:02.950> look

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
Jam like so this is what these two look

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.580 
Jam like so this is what these two look
like<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.549> I'm<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.239> did<00:02:04.509> try<00:02:04.959> to<00:02:04.989> texture<00:02:05.469> the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
like and I'm I did try to texture the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.080 
like and I'm I did try to texture the
bread<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:05.979> make<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.129> little<00:02:06.549> more<00:02:06.670> bread<00:02:06.879> leg

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
bread to make a little more bread leg

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.719 
bread to make a little more bread leg
and<00:02:07.359> I<00:02:07.750> also<00:02:07.959> shaded<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.679> sides<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.310> make<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
and I also shaded the sides to make the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.280 
and I also shaded the sides to make the
bread<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.239> this<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:10.690> what<00:02:10.840> these<00:02:10.989> two<00:02:11.170> look

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
bread so this is what these two look

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.470 
bread so this is what these two look
like<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.769> don't<00:02:12.190> entirely<00:02:12.700> like<00:02:13.000> how<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.209> jam

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
like I don't entirely like how the jam

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.420 
like I don't entirely like how the jam
turned<00:02:13.930> out<00:02:14.140> because<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:14.590> does<00:02:14.739> look<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.190> little

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
turned out because it does look a little

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.960 
turned out because it does look a little
too<00:02:15.940> translucent<00:02:16.390> for<00:02:16.900> me<00:02:17.049> but<00:02:17.859> I<00:02:18.099> will<00:02:18.430> work

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
too translucent for me but I will work

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.610 
too translucent for me but I will work
on<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.540> see<00:02:19.750> how<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.930> turns<00:02:20.170> out<00:02:20.349> in<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
on it and see how it turns out in the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.160 
on it and see how it turns out in the
future<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.160> wanted<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.030> film<00:02:22.329> this<00:02:22.630> clip<00:02:22.900> very

this is pretty much what it looks like

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.450 
this is pretty much what it looks like
and<00:04:56.780> if<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.470> didn't<00:04:57.740> want<00:04:57.920> to<00:04:57.980> add<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.310> black

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
and if you didn't want to add the black

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.910 
and if you didn't want to add the black
paint<00:04:58.790> you<00:04:59.480> can<00:04:59.630> definitely<00:04:59.840> just<00:05:00.410> omit<00:05:00.890> that

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
paint you can definitely just omit that

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.130 
paint you can definitely just omit that
this<00:05:01.790> is<00:05:01.970> just<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.210> show<00:05:02.270> you<00:05:02.420> that<00:05:02.540> none<00:05:03.110> of

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.740 

then<00:05:09.070> I<00:05:09.100> made<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.520> medium<00:05:09.850> ones<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.360> this<00:05:10.570> was

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
then I made to medium ones and this was

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.650 
then I made to medium ones and this was
the<00:05:10.840> first<00:05:11.140> one<00:05:11.380> that<00:05:11.410> I<00:05:11.560> ever<00:05:11.770> made<00:05:12.010> using

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
the first one that I ever made using

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.990 
the first one that I ever made using
pfcs<00:05:13.660> tutorial<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.470> there's<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.490> little<00:05:15.700> more

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
pfcs tutorial and there's a little more

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.940 
pfcs tutorial and there's a little more
black<00:05:16.330> paint<00:05:16.660> than<00:05:16.990> all<00:05:17.260> the<00:05:17.380> other<00:05:17.500> ones<00:05:17.710> and

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
black paint than all the other ones and

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.280 
black paint than all the other ones and
this<00:05:18.070> is<00:05:18.160> what<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.370> back<00:05:18.640> looks<00:05:18.670> like<00:05:19.150> i<00:05:19.570> have

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
this is what the back looks like i have

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.840 
this is what the back looks like i have
a<00:05:20.500> little<00:05:20.710> eye<00:05:20.830> pin<00:05:21.070> in<00:05:21.190> there<00:05:21.340> so<00:05:21.580> this<00:05:21.730> could

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
a little eye pin in there so this could

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.120 
a little eye pin in there so this could
definitely<00:05:22.000> be<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.390> phone<00:05:22.630> charm<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.830> this<00:05:24.010> is

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
definitely be a phone charm so this is

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.490 
definitely be a phone charm so this is
what<00:05:24.250> it<00:05:24.370> looks<00:05:24.550> like<00:05:24.700> and<00:05:25.030> then<00:05:25.690> this<00:05:26.200> one<00:05:26.260> is

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
what it looks like and then this one is

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.260 
what it looks like and then this one is
just<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:27.010> second<00:05:27.370> one<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:27.880> I<00:05:27.910> made<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:30.270> then

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
just a second one that I made and then

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.850 
just a second one that I made and then
the<00:05:31.630> last<00:05:31.660> one<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.140> I<00:05:32.320> made<00:05:32.500> was<00:05:32.680> this

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
the last one that I made was this

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.980 
the last one that I made was this
ginormous<00:05:33.130> one<00:05:33.700> so<00:05:34.030> as<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.330> can<00:05:34.450> see<00:05:34.600> i<00:05:34.630> did<00:05:34.960> a

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
ginormous one so as you can see i did a

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.120 
ginormous one so as you can see i did a
little<00:05:35.200> more<00:05:35.320> texturing<00:05:35.710> was<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:35.920> little

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
little more texturing was a little

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.440 
little more texturing was a little
easier<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.550> make<00:05:36.700> this<00:05:36.820> one<00:05:37.030> because<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.360> was

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
easier to make this one because it was

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.600 
easier to make this one because it was
so<00:05:37.570> big<00:05:37.840> so<00:05:38.440> i<00:05:38.470> could<00:05:38.980> texture<00:05:39.340> it<00:05:39.430> a<00:05:39.460> little

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
so big so i could texture it a little

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.450 
so big so i could texture it a little
more<00:05:39.820> so<00:05:40.150> i<00:05:40.390> definitely<00:05:40.930> did<00:05:41.410> try<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.740> texture

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
more so i definitely did try to texture

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.380 
more so i definitely did try to texture
the<00:05:42.820> artery<00:05:43.600> and<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:43.990> little<00:05:44.530> veins<00:05:45.060> so<00:05:46.060> made

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
the artery and the little veins so made

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.210 
the artery and the little veins so made
a<00:05:46.420> little<00:05:46.600> more<00:05:46.810> crevices<00:05:47.320> added<00:05:47.980> some<00:05:48.130> more

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
a little more crevices added some more

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.160 
a little more crevices added some more
paint<00:05:48.520> it's<00:05:49.450> pretty<00:05:49.660> much<00:05:49.720> what<00:05:49.780> it<00:05:50.020> looks
