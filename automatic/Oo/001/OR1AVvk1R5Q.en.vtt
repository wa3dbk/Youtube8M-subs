00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.740
 people who complained that she 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.350
 could not open the pores I 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.690
 decided to make this little tutorial that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.330
 will last what from 3 to 4 minutes 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.760
 just to show you how you 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.990
 go open its ports so already 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.000
 I would like to thank you because 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.929

 199 view soon 205 I like my 19 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.850
 comments in space 2 in the space of 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 six days 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.260
 so I think it's still 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.910
 pretty awesome so thank you 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 thank you very much so I'm going 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.950
 already show you how to do so me 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.469
 it's future livebox so those who are 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.760
 on neufbox 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.530
 should you find one either 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.809
 our sooner is that you listen to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.760
 well what I'm telling you so it's 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.079
 simple type livebox so I have it 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.430
 recorded here is actually after you 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.430
 go to advanced configuration 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.100
 yes advanced configuration and its 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 port configurations so after you 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.520
 are going to have his voice tired and identify 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 you to continue so was identified 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.040
 launched admin and the password is 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.299
 admitted so here you do that was 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 made for a few minutes 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.439
 so in fact no it's not configuration 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.659
 ports will excuse me I got there 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.939
 so I got pissed off it's 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.659
 how are these networks so I apologize 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.240
 but 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.479
 these are networks once you are 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.049
 in network you go in 11 to tesla 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.969
 chp is atheist so that's the same 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.039
 for neufbox and it's the same for bbox 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.250
 enormously you have configuration 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.509
 advanced network and dates etc and so has it 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.429
 there I'm not going to do them because 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.240
 I have already done you are going to have that 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.369
 here the custom rule and so you 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.840
 go put application services you 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.530
 go make new that is all the way down 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.940
 is created minecraft by a terrain you 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.640
 put 25 125 56 5 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.290
 same for the external port the protocol 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.450
 you put both and your device 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.099
 you will put your pc then you do 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.150
 activated finally added so that's so 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.650
 it's for the livebox 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.430
 so I hope they understood and 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.650
 that it will be already a two then simple 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:34.109
 then for the neufbox or neufbox 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.579
 so you're going to have to put the 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.090
 name of the service application so but 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.609
 kraft 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.780
 you will have an external port I believe you 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.799
 do not have internal ports but you 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.810
 have an external port 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.160
 you will have to put 25,5 5 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.530
 you're going to have protocol too 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.209
 will be before the external port seems so 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.250
 you 're going to put both your 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.910
 device in you are going to have something 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.109
 who pays who appears in addition and the other 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.060
 team and that appears in addition 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.519
 normally it's either it's from your 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.169
 ip this is your local ip it's a 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.400
 of both indies and doubt you try 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.829
 with both but I think it's 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.450
 more typical local and for bbox is 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.680
 like nineboxes 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.049
 So here we are, so here I hope that 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.160
 this tutorial that last only a few small 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.989
 minutes helped you a lot 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.560
 so I know I went very very fast 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.569
