as<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:51.960> comparing<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:52.710> very

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
as you can see comparing the two very

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.090 
as you can see comparing the two very
very<00:00:53.399> different<00:00:53.699> devices<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.840> also<00:00:55.649> very

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
very different devices here also very

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.700 
very different devices here also very
very<00:00:56.340> different<00:00:56.579> displays<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.620> get

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
very different displays and if I can get

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.049 
very different displays and if I can get
them<00:00:58.859> all<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.039> stay<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.370> at<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.670> time<00:00:59.879> that

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
them all to stay on at one time that

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.549 
them all to stay on at one time that
would<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:00.510> nice<00:01:00.840> probably

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
would be really really nice probably

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.959 
would be really really nice probably
should<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.770> set<00:01:01.980> them<00:01:02.100> all<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.370> time<00:01:02.609> out<00:01:02.789> for

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
should have set them all to time out for

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.179 
should have set them all to time out for
like<00:01:03.059> 10<00:01:03.270> minutes<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.750> regardless<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
like 10 minutes but regardless as you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.250 
like 10 minutes but regardless as you
can<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.060> side<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.659> qHD

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
can see so on one side we have a qHD

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.990 
can see so on one side we have a qHD
display<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> other<00:01:08.010> side<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
display and on the other side we have a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.600 
display and on the other side we have a
Super<00:01:09.360> AMOLED<00:01:09.390> HD<00:01:09.869> display<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.310> difference

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
Super AMOLED HD display the difference

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
Super AMOLED HD display the difference
is<00:01:11.700> between<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.150> two<00:01:12.299> Super<00:01:12.990> AMOLED<00:01:13.020> blows

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
is between the two Super AMOLED blows

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
is between the two Super AMOLED blows

videos as i'm recording you know because
of<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> high<00:01:43.560> quality<00:01:43.890> nature<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> camera

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
of the high quality nature of the camera

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.330 
of the high quality nature of the camera
recording<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.320> lower<00:01:46.740> quality

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
recording with and the lower quality

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.120 
recording with and the lower quality
nature<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.329> display<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.439> i<00:01:49.530> am<00:01:49.619> that's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
nature of the display that i am that's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
nature of the display that i am that's
on<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> motorola<00:01:50.790> atrix<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.390> there

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
on the motorola atrix right now there

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.910 
on the motorola atrix right now there
seemed<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.380> been<00:01:52.500> some<00:01:52.710> sort<00:01:52.829> of

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
seemed to have been some sort of

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.649 
seemed to have been some sort of
distortions<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.850> past<00:01:54.119> videos<00:01:54.540> i've

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
distortions and past videos i've

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
distortions and past videos i've
actually<00:01:54.840> noticed<00:01:55.290> some<00:01:55.500> color<00:01:55.740> distortions

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
actually noticed some color distortions

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.069 
actually noticed some color distortions
things<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.360> drove<00:01:57.719> me<00:01:57.780> nuts

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
things like that it really drove me nuts

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.050 
things like that it really drove me nuts
also<00:01:58.680> graininess<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.700> pick<00:01:59.909> up

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
also graininess is if you can pick up

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.609 
also graininess is if you can pick up
the<00:02:00.180> pen<00:02:00.360> tile<00:02:00.600> matrix<00:02:00.960> display<00:02:01.110> or<00:02:01.409> something

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the pen tile matrix display or something

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.510 
the pen tile matrix display or something
like<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:02.280> actually

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
like that it was it was actually

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.670 
like that it was it was actually
starting<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.759> get<00:02:02.909> me<00:02:03.060> upset<00:02:03.320> which<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.500> why<00:02:04.649> i

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
starting to get me upset which is why i

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.560 
starting to get me upset which is why i
was<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.250> really<00:02:05.430> looking<00:02:05.610> forward<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
was really really looking forward to the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
was really really looking forward to the
Super<00:02:07.350> AMOLED<00:02:07.409> HD<00:02:07.710> display<00:02:08.220> because<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.580> shows

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
Super AMOLED HD display because it shows

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.540 
Super AMOLED HD display because it shows
up<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.000> brilliantly<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.200> camera<00:02:10.830> I'm<00:02:11.280> still

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
up just brilliantly on camera I'm still

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.070 
up just brilliantly on camera I'm still
throwing<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.940> off<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> side<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
throwing that off to the side now so

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.910 
throwing that off to the side now so
let's<00:02:13.230> take<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.410> look<00:02:13.650> at

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
let's take a look at

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.010 
let's take a look at
viewing<00:02:14.190> angles<00:02:14.520> viewing<00:02:15.180> angles<00:02:15.480> not<00:02:15.750> too

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
viewing angles viewing angles not too

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.910 
viewing angles viewing angles not too
bad<00:02:16.640> as<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.819> see<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.330> holds<00:02:18.720> its<00:02:18.810> own<00:02:19.050> tell

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
bad as you can see it holds its own tell

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.510 
bad as you can see it holds its own tell
about<00:02:21.050> well<00:02:22.050> that's<00:02:22.440> mostly<00:02:22.770> just<00:02:22.980> reflection

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
about well that's mostly just reflection

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.690 
about well that's mostly just reflection
there<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.569> not<00:02:24.840> too<00:02:25.080> bad<00:02:25.290> at<00:02:25.470> all<00:02:25.590> not<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> whole

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
there but not too bad at all not a whole

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.910 
there but not too bad at all not a whole
lot<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.970> color<00:02:27.360> distortion<00:02:28.110> when<00:02:28.800> you're

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
lot of color distortion when you're

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.130 
lot of color distortion when you're
tilting<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.489> things<00:02:29.849> like<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.239> now<00:02:30.989> let's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
tilting it things like that now let's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.690 
tilting it things like that now let's
take<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.290> look<00:02:31.350> at<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.100> have<00:02:32.310> noticed

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
take a look at this and I have noticed

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.420 
take a look at this and I have noticed
over<00:02:32.880> time<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.300> there<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:34.230> lot<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.190> people

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
over time that there is a lot of people

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.680 
over time that there is a lot of people
are<00:02:35.640> basically<00:02:35.760> saying<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.450> got<00:02:36.569> some

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
are basically saying it's got some

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.150 
are basically saying it's got some
pretty<00:02:36.840> fantastic<00:02:37.140> viewing<00:02:37.830> angles<00:02:38.069> I'm

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
pretty fantastic viewing angles I'm

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.710 
pretty fantastic viewing angles I'm
going<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.489> disagree<00:02:38.850> with<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.300> head

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
going to have to disagree with them head

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.509 
going to have to disagree with them head
on<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:40.050> looks<00:02:40.230> fantastic<00:02:40.650> even<00:02:41.130> at<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> slight

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
on it looks fantastic even at a slight

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.979 
on it looks fantastic even at a slight
angle<00:02:41.550> like<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.209> still<00:02:42.420> looks<00:02:42.600> fantastic

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
angle like that it still looks fantastic

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.170 
angle like that it still looks fantastic

right not not too bad but as soon as you

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.250 
right not not too bad but as soon as you
start<00:03:02.400> tilting<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.150> start<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.450> see<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> blue

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
start tilting it you start to see a blue

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.430 
start tilting it you start to see a blue
tint<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.970> don't<00:03:06.150> like<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:07.110> you

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
tint and I don't like that that you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.710 
tint and I don't like that that you
won't<00:03:07.620> find<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.310> say<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.940> instance<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.269> qhd

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
won't find on say for instance the qhd

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.259 
won't find on say for instance the qhd
displayed<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.680> motorola<00:03:11.069> atrix<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.760> of

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
displayed of the motorola atrix and of

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.120 
displayed of the motorola atrix and of
course<00:03:12.299> moving<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.019> side<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.440> again<00:03:13.680> you

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
course moving on the side here again you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.190 
course moving on the side here again you
can<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:15.120> viewing<00:03:15.480> angle<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.840> starting<00:03:16.110> to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
can see the viewing angle is starting to

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.170 
can see the viewing angle is starting to
distort<00:03:16.590> right<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.130> we<00:03:17.280> immediately<00:03:17.670> right

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
distort right so we immediately right

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.000

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
and the more we turn it the harder it is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.800 
and the more we turn it the harder it is
