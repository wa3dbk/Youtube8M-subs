in the color Roberta

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.000 
in the color Roberta
this<00:05:39.210> is<00:05:39.330> kind<00:05:39.600> of<00:05:39.690> like<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:39.960> baby<00:05:40.229> doll<00:05:40.620> pink

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
this is kind of like a baby doll pink

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.430 
this is kind of like a baby doll pink
and<00:05:41.340> it's<00:05:41.820> very<00:05:42.120> moisturizing<00:05:42.720> at<00:05:43.140> the<00:05:43.229> same

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.620 
and it's very moisturizing at the same
time<00:05:43.680> so<00:05:43.890> if<00:05:43.979> you<00:05:44.160> really<00:05:44.790> like<00:05:44.940> that<00:05:45.150> I<00:05:45.210> really

time so if you really like that I really

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.210 
time so if you really like that I really
recommend<00:05:45.750> these<00:05:46.320> colors<00:05:46.740> because<00:05:46.890> they're

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
recommend these colors because they're

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.970 
recommend these colors because they're
all<00:05:47.460> really<00:05:48.120> moisturize

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980
