00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:23.399 
I use my thumb to hold the call where

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.790 
I use my thumb to hold the call where
this<00:00:23.820> side<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:24.599> only<00:00:24.720> thing<00:00:24.989> vibrating

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
this side is the only thing vibrating

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.290 
this side is the only thing vibrating
and<00:00:25.950> what's<00:00:26.099> causing<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.610> is<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.090> lid

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and what's causing that is the lid

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.729 
and what's causing that is the lid
coming<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.800> make<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.040> vibrate<00:00:29.750> so<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.439> find

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
coming up to make it vibrate so to find

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.460 
coming up to make it vibrate so to find
that<00:00:31.860> smooth<00:00:32.570> just<00:00:33.800> growly<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.920> across<00:00:36.260> but<00:00:37.260> no

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
that smooth just growly it across but no

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.920 
that smooth just growly it across but no
pressure<00:00:37.800> will<00:00:38.160> make<00:00:38.310> it<00:00:38.520> sound<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.540> put

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
pressure will make it sound so I put

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.740 
pressure will make it sound so I put
these<00:00:40.590> two<00:00:40.890> fingers<00:00:41.190> together<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.060> this<00:00:42.480> one

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
these two fingers together and this one

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
these two fingers together and this one
and<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.050> use<00:00:43.080> it<00:00:43.380> to<00:00:43.680> let<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.610> car<00:00:44.850> roll<00:00:46.550> don't

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and I use it to let the car roll don't

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.480 
and I use it to let the car roll don't
live<00:00:47.820> Bros<00:00:48.210> over<00:00:48.780> because<00:00:48.990> this<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.710> rounded

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
live Bros over because this is rounded

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.900 
live Bros over because this is rounded
and<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.410> but<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> make<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.740> clip<00:00:53.190> just

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and you can see but to make a clip just

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.940 
and you can see but to make a clip just
set<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.450> down<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:57.050> lift<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.380> with<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
set it down on it and lift up with a

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.240 
set it down on it and lift up with a
little<00:00:59.430> falling<00:00:59.850> motion<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:01.560> shorter<00:01:02.010> for

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
little falling motion the shorter for

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.880 
little falling motion the shorter for
the<00:01:02.399> forward<00:01:03.149> motion<00:01:03.480> gives<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.259> a<00:01:04.290> softer

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the forward motion gives you a softer

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
the forward motion gives you a softer
cook<00:01:05.189> okay<00:01:06.079> alright<00:01:07.079> to<00:01:07.200> make<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> yep<00:01:08.150> you<00:01:09.150> want

sound out here so when you yep this

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.619 
sound out here so when you yep this
sound<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.129> actually<00:02:29.519> being<00:02:29.730> probed<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.480> the

sound is actually being probed to the

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.319 
sound is actually being probed to the

right if you hold it straight up the
sound<00:02:33.629> it's<00:02:33.870> kind<00:02:34.139> of<00:02:34.230> pinpointing<00:02:34.799> user

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
sound it's kind of pinpointing user

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.699 
sound it's kind of pinpointing user
