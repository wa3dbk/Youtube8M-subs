 with them a lot and bad 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.820
 if you analyze we have our shopping carts we would see that we filled with 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.320
 foods rich in carbohydrates proteins and lipids that our 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.069
 organism does not spend 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:17.140
 It is a great energy contribution for our body and sedentary life 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.150
 that we carry the most makes us spend all that energy 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.269
 for the first time in history in the western world there are more people with 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.269
 overweight problems that people in your house 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.880
 America is already a classic of obesity 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.050
 60 percent are overweight and 31 are obese 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.490
 eat a lot of mantilla tim little exercise 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.270
 that is the american way of play and globalization has made it spread 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 all over the planet 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.510
 in Spain, obesity is a problem 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.880
 According to public authorities, 15% of Spaniards are obese 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.720
 if we also add the people who are overweight it turns out that more than half 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.720
 of the Spaniards eat others 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.020
 and the worst of all is that we are incubating obese 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.610
 Spain is the European country with the most obese children with 16% 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.270
 in your diet there are too few fats vegetables and fruits and especially eat 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.320
 a lot between meals 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.850
 bed bugs and jewelry are their downfall 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.850
 Indian drinking water take sweetened refreshing drinks 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.409
 an example let's review the life of a 10-year-old child 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.450
 need a day about 2 thousand 200 kilocalories imagine that takes 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.410
 a can of soda that are 130 kilos category 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.360
 a croissant with a contribution of 300 kilocalories 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.670
 a small appetizer judge with 200 kilocalories and a handful of sweets 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.840
 with 120 kilos Canary 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.060
 In total it will have taken 750 kilos calories a third of what 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.060
 you need a day and you still have to add the remains of food 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.280
 if every day he takes this for sure he will have plenty of kilocalories 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.220
 surely they do not get to burn because today children are 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.690
 increasingly quiet 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.890
 they spend asÃ­n hours in front of the television and the computer without moving 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.109
 and you can say that the TV fattening 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.229
 We are also exporting this lifestyle to countries in the process of 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.439
 developing 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.379
 it's an irony 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.709
 but as they struggle to end hunger at the same time they face 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.709
 obesity opposite problem 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.079
 more and more people live in cities because the countryside can not earn the 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.249
 lifetime 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.459
 komen the same fatty food that does not require to be given the same drinks 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.539
 sweetened because it is also fashionable 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.539
 they have also become as sedentary as we are 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.459
 It is estimated that in less developed countries there could be neither more nor 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.459
 less than about 115 million obese 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.980
 and the worst is that obesity is another model of malnutrition 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.680
 although some poor people are overweight that does not mean that 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.449
 are better fed 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.039
 Obesity often covers deficiencies in the consumption of vitamins and 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.039
 minerals 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.519
 taking stock the statistics say that in the world there are so many people that 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.829
 they go hungry like overweight people 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.110
 a billion people go hungry 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.629
 another billion are overweight and 300 million are obese 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.779
 they are figures to reflect
