hi guys I'm Jess honey and this is the
unboxing<00:00:06.800> of<00:00:07.250> SDC<00:00:07.790> desired<00:00:08.469> 3<00:00:09.469> 110<00:00:10.100> as<00:00:10.280> you<00:00:10.520> can

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
unboxing of SDC desired 3 110 as you can

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.619 
unboxing of SDC desired 3 110 as you can
see<00:00:11.200> dual<00:00:12.200> sim<00:00:12.559> is<00:00:12.740> just<00:00:13.400> launched<00:00:13.879> in<00:00:14.119> India<00:00:14.570> I

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
see dual sim is just launched in India I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.170 
see dual sim is just launched in India I
thought<00:00:15.080> that<00:00:15.350> this<00:00:15.590> is<00:00:15.740> going<00:00:16.039> to<00:00:16.309> have<00:00:16.760> 1gb

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
thought that this is going to have 1gb

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.900 
thought that this is going to have 1gb
of<00:00:17.510> RAM<00:00:17.960> because<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:18.800> specifications<00:00:19.640> on<00:00:19.880> the

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
of RAM because the specifications on the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.320 
of RAM because the specifications on the
snap<00:00:20.300> did<00:00:20.509> come<00:00:21.019> on<00:00:21.500> which<00:00:22.070> I<00:00:22.220> bought<00:00:22.460> it<00:00:22.670> they

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
snap did come on which I bought it they

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.140 
snap did come on which I bought it they
say<00:00:23.570> it<00:00:23.810> says<00:00:24.199> that<00:00:24.529> it<00:00:24.800> has<00:00:24.830> 1gb<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.550> RAM<00:00:25.939> but

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
say it says that it has 1gb of RAM but

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.419 
say it says that it has 1gb of RAM but
it<00:00:26.570> doesn't<00:00:27.759> as<00:00:28.759> you<00:00:28.939> can<00:00:29.179> see<00:00:29.449> it<00:00:30.320> says<00:00:30.800> Ram<00:00:31.099> 5

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
it doesn't as you can see it says Ram 5
