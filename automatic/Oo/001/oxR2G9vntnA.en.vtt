finishing in the context of building a
found<00:00:19.169> object<00:00:19.320> sculpture<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.730> when<00:00:20.970> we're

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
found object sculpture so when we're

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.089 
found object sculpture so when we're
building<00:00:21.300> found<00:00:21.750> object<00:00:22.169> sculptures<00:00:22.619> we're

building found object sculptures we're

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.620 
building found object sculptures we're
dealing<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:23.610> all<00:00:23.880> different<00:00:24.300> types<00:00:24.480> of

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
dealing with all different types of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.720 
dealing with all different types of
metal<00:00:24.989> at<00:00:25.199> all<00:00:25.890> different<00:00:26.129> stages<00:00:26.520> of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
metal at all different stages of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.799 
metal at all different stages of
deterioration<00:00:27.590> so<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.860> today's<00:00:29.540> demo<00:00:30.540> I've

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:30.809 
deterioration so for today's demo I've

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.660 
deterioration so for today's demo I've
picked<00:00:31.800> out<00:00:31.919> a<00:00:31.980> very<00:00:32.369> rusty<00:00:33.180> piece<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:34.670> square

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
picked out a very rusty piece of square

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.790 
picked out a very rusty piece of square
tubing<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.809> has<00:00:36.989> quite<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> bit<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> rust<00:00:37.649> on

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
tubing and it has quite a bit of rust on

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.319 
tubing and it has quite a bit of rust on
it<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.039> can<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.700> already<00:00:38.910> flaking

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
it you can see that it's already flaking

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.530 
it you can see that it's already flaking
off<00:00:39.739> rust<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.949> problem<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:41.760> when<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.420> go

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
off rust is a problem because when we go

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.710 
off rust is a problem because when we go
to<00:00:42.600> weld<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.050> piece<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:44.579> ground<00:00:44.970> will<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.390> be

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
to weld the piece the ground will not be

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.120 
to weld the piece the ground will not be
able<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.989> reach<00:00:46.320> through<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> metal<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.040> we

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
able to reach through the metal and we

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.040 
able to reach through the metal and we
won't<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.520> able<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.850> strike<00:00:48.120> an<00:00:48.300> arc<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.780> we

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
won't be able to strike an arc so we

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.620 
won't be able to strike an arc so we
need<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> remove<00:00:49.620> rust<00:00:50.100> from<00:00:50.310> the<00:00:51.060> piece<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.540> at

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
need to remove rust from the piece or at

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.020 
need to remove rust from the piece or at
least<00:00:51.810> where<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.350> weld<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:53.030> this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
least where we're going to weld it this

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.229 
least where we're going to weld it this
piece<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.450> pipe<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.899> covered<00:00:55.470> with<00:00:55.500> paint

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
piece of pipe is covered with paint

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.049 
piece of pipe is covered with paint
paint<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.750> rust<00:00:58.050> keeps<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.059> ground

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
paint just like rust keeps the ground

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.200 
paint just like rust keeps the ground
from<00:01:00.450> having<00:01:01.020> an<00:01:01.110> effect<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.880> deters<00:01:02.880> our

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
from having an effect and deters our

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
from having an effect and deters our
ability<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.719> strike<00:01:04.170> an<00:01:04.350> arc<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.829> we'll<00:01:05.040> be

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
ability to strike an arc so we'll be

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.539 
ability to strike an arc so we'll be
cleaning<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:08.070> piece<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
cleaning this one as well this piece of

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.060 
cleaning this one as well this piece of
pipe<00:01:08.729> actually<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.719> fairly<00:01:10.320> clean<00:01:10.799> what

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
pipe actually is fairly clean what

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.059 
pipe actually is fairly clean what
you're<00:01:11.219> seeing<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> mill<00:01:12.450> scale

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
you're seeing on here is the mill scale

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:16.399 
you're seeing on here is the mill scale
but<00:01:14.069> on<00:01:14.249> this<00:01:14.459> cut<00:01:14.729> edge<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.179> have<00:01:15.209> a<00:01:15.359> bur<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
but on this cut edge we have a bur and
of<00:01:16.530> course<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:16.979> we're<00:01:17.100> making<00:01:17.219> sculptures

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
of course when we're making sculptures

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.179 
of course when we're making sculptures
and<00:01:18.090> encouraging<00:01:18.600> people<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.020> touch<00:01:19.229> them<00:01:19.499> we

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
and encouraging people to touch them we

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.270 
and encouraging people to touch them we
want<00:01:20.399> to<00:01:20.490> remove<00:01:20.789> all<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.209> sharp<00:01:21.479> edges<00:01:22.280> and

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
where we've had this torch cut line that

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.559 
where we've had this torch cut line that
are<00:01:44.249> kind<00:01:44.639> of<00:01:44.700> rough<00:01:44.939> we're<00:01:45.149> gonna<00:01:45.240> smooth

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
are kind of rough we're gonna smooth

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.050 
are kind of rough we're gonna smooth
those<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.289> remove<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> rust<00:01:47.039> but<00:01:47.969> I'm

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
those out and remove the rust but I'm

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.319 
those out and remove the rust but I'm
going<00:01:48.209> to<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.599> with<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.049> variety<00:01:49.499> of

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
going to do that with a variety of

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
going to do that with a variety of
grinding<00:01:51.329> discs<00:01:51.749> and<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.349> first<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
grinding discs and the first one you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.159 
grinding discs and the first one you
need<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.249> learn<00:01:53.369> about<00:01:53.659> is<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.990> rough

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:55.169 
need to learn about is the rough

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:57.529 
need to learn about is the rough
grinding<00:01:55.619> disk<00:01:55.889> this<00:01:56.279> is<00:01:56.490> an<00:01:56.609> aluminum<00:01:56.849> oxide

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
grinding disk this is an aluminum oxide

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.919 
grinding disk this is an aluminum oxide
abrasive<00:01:58.579> it<00:01:59.579> is<00:02:00.179> about<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.249> 40<00:02:02.249> grit<00:02:02.749> this<00:02:03.749> is

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
abrasive it is about a 40 grit this is

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.379 
abrasive it is about a 40 grit this is
for<00:02:04.139> removing<00:02:04.310> lots<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.549> lots<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.819> material

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
for removing lots and lots of material

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.589 
for removing lots and lots of material
and<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.049> leaves<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.590> rough<00:02:08.130> mark<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
and it leaves a rough mark so for the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.390 
and it leaves a rough mark so for the
most<00:02:09.840> part<00:02:10.170> when<00:02:10.709> we're<00:02:10.920> doing<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.250> majority

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
most part when we're doing the majority

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.210 
most part when we're doing the majority
of<00:02:11.790> rough<00:02:12.150> rough<00:02:12.420> grinding<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.770> having

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
of rough rough grinding and having

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.570 
of rough rough grinding and having
material<00:02:14.849> removal

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
material removal

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.180 
material removal
using<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.210> one<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.530> I'm<00:02:17.800> going<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:17.980> go<00:02:18.100> ahead

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
using this one so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.590 
using this one so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:18.400> start<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:19.060> course<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.450> most

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
and start and of course the most

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.230 
and start and of course the most
important<00:02:20.110> thing<00:02:20.190> when<00:02:21.190> you're<00:02:21.670> working<00:02:22.090> with

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
important thing when you're working with

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.090 
important thing when you're working with
metal<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.930> make<00:02:23.140> sure<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.770> have<00:02:23.950> all

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
metal is to make sure that you have all

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.490 
metal is to make sure that you have all
the<00:02:24.250> necessary<00:02:24.460> safety<00:02:25.000> gear<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.080> have<00:02:26.290> my

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the necessary safety gear so I have my

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.650 
the necessary safety gear so I have my
head<00:02:26.740> covered<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:27.610> safety<00:02:27.940> glasses<00:02:28.180> that

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
head covered I have safety glasses that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.440 
head covered I have safety glasses that
are<00:02:28.780> OSHA<00:02:28.960> approved<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.890> have<00:02:30.520> gloves<00:02:30.790> on<00:02:31.090> and

are OSHA approved I have gloves on and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.960 
are OSHA approved I have gloves on and
then<00:02:32.170> with<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.710> grinders<00:02:33.130> most<00:02:33.400> importantly

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
then with the grinders most importantly

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.470 
then with the grinders most importantly
I<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.960> hearing<00:02:35.380> protection<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.550> we're<00:02:37.390> gonna

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
I have hearing protection so we're gonna

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.920 
I have hearing protection so we're gonna
put<00:02:37.750> all<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.520> then<00:02:39.520> I'll<00:02:40.300> probably<00:02:40.540> talk

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
put all that on then I'll probably talk

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.470 
put all that on then I'll probably talk
a<00:02:40.990> little<00:02:41.350> bit<00:02:41.500> louder<00:02:41.740> or<00:02:42.190> softer<00:02:42.300> will<00:02:43.300> have

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
a little bit louder or softer will have

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.950 
a little bit louder or softer will have
to<00:02:43.950> regulate<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.330> start<00:02:46.330> with<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.690> piece

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
to regulate that start with this piece

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.260 
to regulate that start with this piece
right<00:02:47.230> here<00:02:47.290> because<00:02:48.070> this<00:02:48.310> represents<00:02:48.550> the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
right here because this represents the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.210 
right here because this represents the
most<00:02:49.510> amount<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:50.020> material<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.770> have<00:02:50.980> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
most amount of material that I have to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.760 
most amount of material that I have to
remove<00:02:51.690> whenever<00:02:52.690> I'm<00:02:52.840> writing<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.350> piece<00:02:53.530> I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
remove whenever I'm writing a piece I

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.250 
remove whenever I'm writing a piece I
want<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.070> make<00:02:54.220> sure<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.390> have<00:02:55.630> both<00:02:55.900> hands

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
want to make sure that I have both hands

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.560 
want to make sure that I have both hands

we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.800 
we're going to do is we're going to
concentrate<00:03:17.380> on<00:03:17.680> using<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.970> leading<00:03:19.420> edge<00:03:19.600> of

concentrate on using the leading edge of
this<00:03:20.050> and<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.830> belly<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:22.360> do<00:03:22.540> most<00:03:22.780> of

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
this and the belly of this to do most of

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:59.740 
this and the belly of this to do most of
our<00:03:23.110> work<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:23.650> if<00:03:23.769> you're<00:03:23.950> ready<00:03:24.160> here<00:03:24.430> we<00:03:24.459> go

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.750 

there's<00:04:00.750> one<00:04:01.050> side<00:04:01.350> then<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.250> course<00:04:02.460> you<00:04:02.610> can

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
there's one side then of course you can

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.250 
there's one side then of course you can
see<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.180> we've<00:04:03.330> got

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
see that we've got

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.130 
see that we've got
ruff-ruff<00:04:05.190> marks<00:04:05.610> here<00:04:05.880> but<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.660> rust<00:04:06.930> was

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
ruff-ruff marks here but that rust was

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.810 
ruff-ruff marks here but that rust was
so<00:04:07.380> thick<00:04:07.710> that<00:04:07.740> we<00:04:08.070> haven't<00:04:08.400> even<00:04:08.490> gotten

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
so thick that we haven't even gotten

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.460 
so thick that we haven't even gotten
through<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.390> majority<00:04:09.990> of<00:04:10.020> it

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
through the majority of it

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.640 
through the majority of it
I<00:04:10.500> took<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.460> gross<00:04:11.730> amount<00:04:12.030> off<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.900> then

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
I took the gross amount off and then

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.870 
I took the gross amount off and then
left<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.790> rest<00:04:15.030> for<00:04:15.360> our<00:04:15.600> polishing<00:04:16.230> later

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
left the rest for our polishing later

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.490 
left the rest for our polishing later
this<00:04:17.880> side<00:04:18.180> represents<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.870> challenge<00:04:19.080> because

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
this side represents a challenge because

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.730 
this side represents a challenge because
not<00:04:19.860> only<00:04:19.890> have<00:04:20.610> have<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:21.060> oxidation<00:04:23.960> burs<00:04:24.960> so

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
not only have have you oxidation burs so

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:48.370 
not only have have you oxidation burs so
I'll<00:04:25.860> be<00:04:26.040> taking<00:04:26.430> those<00:04:26.580> off

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.900

then again I'm making sure to turn my
piece<00:04:51.180> I<00:04:51.420> don't<00:04:51.600> want<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.810> have<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.110> grind

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290

sideways or upside down you want to

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.270 
sideways or upside down you want to
avoid<00:04:54.660> doing<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.170> hokey-pokey<00:04:55.560> while<00:04:56.100> you're

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
avoid doing the hokey-pokey while you're

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.580 
avoid doing the hokey-pokey while you're
grinding<00:04:56.540> grind<00:04:57.540> in<00:04:57.750> front<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.020> yourself<00:04:58.410> at

another important thing to point out
about<00:05:16.949> the<00:05:17.250> grinder<00:05:17.699> is<00:05:17.729> that<00:05:18.389> we<00:05:19.080> want<00:05:19.289> to<00:05:19.349> be

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
about the grinder is that we want to be

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.230 
about the grinder is that we want to be
aware<00:05:19.800> of<00:05:19.979> what's<00:05:20.220> around<00:05:20.550> us<00:05:20.759> because<00:05:21.060> we<00:05:21.210> are

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
aware of what's around us because we are

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.959 
aware of what's around us because we are
throwing<00:05:21.599> sparks<00:05:22.050> so<00:05:22.469> be<00:05:23.159> a<00:05:23.189> bad<00:05:23.430> idea<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.939> have

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
throwing sparks so be a bad idea to have

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:45.150 
throwing sparks so be a bad idea to have
a<00:05:24.090> bucket<00:05:24.389> of<00:05:24.629> gasoline<00:05:24.780> right<00:05:25.379> next<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.860> me

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.680 

to<00:05:46.160> the<00:05:46.280> inside<00:05:46.729> of<00:05:46.759> the<00:05:47.030> pieces<00:05:47.449> sometimes

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
to the inside of the pieces sometimes

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.409 
to the inside of the pieces sometimes
becomes<00:05:48.290> problematic<00:05:48.590> because<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:50.000> grinders

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
becomes problematic because the grinders

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.980 
becomes problematic because the grinders
sometimes<00:05:50.960> won't<00:05:51.229> reach<00:05:52.180> in<00:05:53.180> that<00:05:53.479> case<00:05:53.750> we're

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
sometimes won't reach in that case we're

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.570 
sometimes won't reach in that case we're
gonna<00:05:54.110> have<00:05:54.320> to<00:05:54.440> go<00:05:54.560> on<00:05:54.710> to<00:05:54.919> another<00:05:55.039> lesson

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
gonna have to go on to another lesson

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.210 
gonna have to go on to another lesson
with<00:05:55.850> a<00:05:55.910> different<00:05:56.389> set<00:05:56.600> of<00:05:56.630> tools<00:05:56.990> but<00:05:57.259> for

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
with a different set of tools but for

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.969 
with a different set of tools but for
now<00:05:58.340> I<00:05:58.370> think<00:05:58.580> we<00:05:58.910> can<00:05:59.240> we<00:05:59.960> can<00:06:00.169> get<00:06:00.410> this<00:06:00.650> one

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
now I think we can we can get this one

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.060 
now I think we can we can get this one
so<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.520> works<00:06:01.820> they<00:06:02.630> say<00:06:02.870> that<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.320> measure<00:06:03.860> of

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
so it works they say that the measure of

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.430 
so it works they say that the measure of
a<00:06:04.400> craftsman<00:06:05.150> is<00:06:05.300> by<00:06:05.630> his<00:06:05.840> stamp<00:06:06.289> collection

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
a craftsman is by his stamp collection

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.700 
a craftsman is by his stamp collection
and<00:06:07.340> I<00:06:07.940> do<00:06:08.000> believe<00:06:08.270> that<00:06:08.479> we<00:06:09.080> definitely<00:06:09.320> need

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
and I do believe that we definitely need

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.360 
and I do believe that we definitely need
a<00:06:10.190> lot<00:06:11.060> of<00:06:11.090> different<00:06:11.720> clamps<00:06:12.139> for<00:06:15.370> productive

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
a lot of different clamps for productive

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:37.800 
a lot of different clamps for productive
and<00:06:16.729> efficient<00:06:17.270> metalworking
