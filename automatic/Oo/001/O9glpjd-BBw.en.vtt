00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello to all and welcome to my 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.010
 chain so today I 'm going to you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.820
 show how do I think the 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.820
 perfect butter cream 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.160
 so to do this you will need to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 sweet butter butter and you'll 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 really need to leave pretty much 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.359
 one to two hours at room temperature 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.609
 for it to be enough world so there I 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.029
 wanted everything if you swipe your finger 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.179
 on the outside it really needs a little 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.030
 melt icing sugar under your finger 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:37.590
 vanilla and will incite my case I 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.469
 left in the comment space 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.420
 down the quantities of ingredients 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.410
 the most months in what I do 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.450
 it's for whatever quantity 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.850
 because I'm not going every time 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.610
 do we say 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.680
 300 g butter cream if 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.530
 I only need to decorate 3 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.539
 cupcakes we'll say it's that it's to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.190
 pretty much proportional so what I 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.510
 do it is that every time I take 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.700
 my butter the quantity I want so 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.420
 there for example it's 250 g of butter and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.830
 I add 250 g of icing sugar plus 100 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.040
 g of icing sugar every time 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.659
 I make 100 g of icing sugar more than 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.030
 that of butter I do not know if you 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.630
 have really understood but good everything is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.439
 downstairs so you have to make your 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.500
 softened butter 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.939
 we just know how to beat him and the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.189
 make it soft enough to actually get in 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:39.540
 air in to have this this 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:42.600
 beautiful and light textures for either 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.790
 really safe so unlike this 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.950
 that others have thought 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.119
 it is absolutely not necessary to put the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.960
 butter in the microwave 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.340
 butter cream this fact is done 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.250
 hers will say there's no need for cooking 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.810
 there is absolutely nothing need be 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.810
 that the ingredients are at temperature 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.500
 ambient that's all so add small to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.210
 little icing sugar and so at the beginning 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.700
 for sure it will look a little 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.619
 anything but do not worry 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.000
 you just have to keep mixing me 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.440
 I prefer to do it with a fork 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.310
 I do not advise you to do it at 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.020
 drummer because the rendering it will be a 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.620
 little more complicated and especially the whole 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.770
 dough is going to just grab the drummer 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:32.370
 and will not be as you would like 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.470
 therefore must continue to do his tour 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.599
 turn until actually a kind 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.819
 of ball form and that all is 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.950
 more and more homogeneous 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.180
 then m traces of icing sugar 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.459
 keep on mixing again and again 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.220
 so here you could stop 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.319
 there because there it is the cream 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.340
 butter and well I would advise you 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.470
 just go back to the mixer a little bit for 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.330
 to bring in some more air so 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.950
 there the texture was really good but 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.590
 me the butter cream is really 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.599
 practical because for the toppings 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.370
 after that you know a little when you 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.769
 leaves at room temperature or in the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.780
 refrigerator so it's really 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.069
 something that I recommend to myself 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.720
 after that depends on the tastes of each 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.019
 because I know that the taste of butter 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.980
 and squeeze present and can put off 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.940
 some people that's why I 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.129
 put each time the essence of 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.230
 vanilla a little round the taste of lemon 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.340
 obviously it's optional vanilla 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.340
 also if you want to do it at 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.900
 chocolate strawberry pistachio 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.310
 it's up to you to see me I think 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.110
 it's a little basic recipe and that 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.290
 the taste of vanilla is it's just 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.580
 reported this little sweet touch 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.690
 so here is how to achieve the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.819
 perfect 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.960
 remember man delicious young slayer 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.940
 it's just a 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.340
 thank you very much for watching this
