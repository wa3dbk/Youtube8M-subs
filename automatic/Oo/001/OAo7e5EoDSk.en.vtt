 Y 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.910
 Y 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.910
 good kids how are you doing today we are going to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.980
 see some of the gold missions of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.660
 battlefield 4 in particular those that we 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.220
 they will unlock weapons in addition to 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.600
 tell you how they will unlock I will make a 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.460
 small comment about each one 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.870
 with my opinion that I advance the truth 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.430
 it's not too favorable for all 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.780
 except for one that is evident if you 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.670
 you have looked a little at the missions of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.989
 battlelog where by the way of looked at me 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.370
 the missions for these weapons and os 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.350
 I recommend you visit if you have any doubt 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.150
 about them or if you want to complete 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.980
 all as well as little advice but 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.480
 well let's go to what we care about I'll 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.220
 talk about them in the order in which 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.470
 I unlocked them first and I think 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.180
 which is what we did first is all 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.440
 the expert assault mission to 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.450
 perform we must have completed 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 previously those of basic and veteran who 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.290
 of basic and bronze 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.820
 consists of seven casualties with any 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.110
 assault rifle and configurations already 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.580
 you see that this one is totally easy and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 we will probably have done it until 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 unintentionally after this we will unblock the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.340
 of a veteran that will consist of a mission 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.590
 very original that will be 8 casualties with 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.540
 triple assault and 12 cures had the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.950
 creative day with the missions you see and 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.020
 last in the gold section 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.180
 we will have to perform the expert's 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 will consist of getting 50 gallons of 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.560
 first aid kit that will be 8 cures each 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.240
 doing a total of 400 cures 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.979
 although it seems a lot I think they are 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.990
 easy after we will make 200 casualties with 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.850
 any assault rifle and finally 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.860
 10 gallons of assault that really is what 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.210
 same as the previous requirement 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.280
 since we will get the 10 gallons 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.200
 before doing the 200 casualties for 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.580
 All these missions I will recommend the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 same map as many expect 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.640
 'aces' that locker operation to do 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.310
 the gallons of healing ammunition 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.659
 etcetera put in conquest 64 puts of 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.390
 1 on the floor the rings of the panopticon 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.280
 and just put purple on it will be in 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.869
 question of one or two good games and 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.220
 for the eliminations the truth is that 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.390
 it's going to be the same only instead of 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.979
 do it in conquest we will do it in 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.080
 domination or tct that is the way more 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.549
 easy and quick to make them and good after 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.200
 do all these things that sincerely 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.970
 they are quite easy you will have yours 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.100
 23 this weapon has been crossed out by 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.720
 very many with the best weapons in the game and 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.519
 is relatively little retro c is a 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.410
 decent precision and if he dominated the micro 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.519
 bursts we will dominate it there also in 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.930
 this video we are not going to try 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.580
 statistics about it but if you 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.080
 This weapon is very interesting, I invite you to 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.030
 see in my previous video that goes about 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.890
 she the next one that unlocked was the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.600
 from expert to support for which 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.130
 we will do the basic ones that consists of 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.959
 seven casualties with any machine gun 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.580
 light and 16 supplies 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.080
 very easy following the same line as 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.819
 the missions of the next island will be 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.549
 of 8 stopwatch lows were light 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.840
 and 17 refills after these two are 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.700
 will unlock the expert's 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.920
 will consist of 50 gallons of ammunition that 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.260
 will be 8 refills and 400 in total 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.359
 as before houses are the 200 casualties and 10 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.280
 gallons of light shrapnel what before 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.629
 the truth is that seen this mission the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.340
 easier simply because it's very 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.040
 easy to replenish someone thinking of 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.629
 how much a mess you spend a single bullet you go 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.340
 to replenish and who does not lack 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.500
 never a bullet a few seconds after 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.090
 answer you lack ammo but good 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.709
 happening from that when we make these 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.870
 missions we will get our precious 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.909
 rp is 12 is the truth is that in my 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.230
 opinion is not too good only 10 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.310
 six hundred rounds per minute with what 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.319
 which has practically the same 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.060
 cadence of the option however not 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.769
 moves neither nor is it as accurate as 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.510
 she with which I do not see the slightest reason 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.680
 to play with her the truth is that 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.930
 I wanted to like it because its 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.219
 appearance is very very nice however 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.019
 the truth is that it has been a great 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:27.629
 disappointment given the abundant and better 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.790
 weapons of its kind and after this says a 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.199
 of the most difficult missions rage 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.609
 talk and disproportionate I 've seen 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.079
 in a very long time but good at first 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.849
 instead we go to the previous missions 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.829
 to unlock the recognition 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.510
 basic we will do seven casualties with francs and 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.579
 four reappearances on your beacon radio 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.840
 after this for the veteran we will have 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.489
 get a number 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.870
 I was expecting eight casualties with francs and five 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.910
 respawns on your beacon radio when 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.370
 let's get to do this prepare our 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.170
 vice mind who go FARC 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.760
 we will have to make 200 casualties with a rifle 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.310
 of franc and 10 gallons 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.900
 ok easy and now the good thing 50 gallons of 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.370
 shooter and at first sight you say it's worth a 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.349
 gallon of shooter will be that you get the 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.080
 Shooter bonus a gesture of 50 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.610
 meters but you do not have to do 250 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.870
 meters senses to the head that is 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.470
 basically to complete this 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.180
 we will have to add 12 thousand 500 meters of 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.650
 headshots to get over 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.630
 a weapon that simply does not have to 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.479
 offer us over the ducks kills 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.130
 lf and js the truth that considered this 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.720
 weapon very pointless because it is the weapon 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.040
 with less bullet fall of the whole game 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.870
 but it will not kill a long shot 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.600
 distances because your damage fall will go 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.830
 from 100 damage to some ridiculous 36 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.440
 percent and this is what makes me 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.700
 ask me what reasoning did the 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.320
 of dais when they did not give a 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.910
 sniper bolt-action capacity 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.650
 Kill a head shot from afar 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.240
 when it turns out that its biggest advantage 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.280
 in front of any other type of weapon 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.630
 also think about this weapon if we are not 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.250
 able to hit the head 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.289
 we will have to give three times to a 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.600
 same uncle to kill him and if he's at a 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.470
 greater distance of about 80 meters more or 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.840
 less and if we have 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.120
 in the head we will have to guess 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.040
 twice to kill him is simply 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.350
 ridiculous and moving to the last place 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.970
 we finally expert mission 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.080
 in engineer to perform the basic 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.060
 we will have to make seven 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.800
 eliminations with a carbine and 16 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.600
 repairs for the veteran as not 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.500
 we will make eight casualties with carbine and the 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.720
 I really can not stop thinking 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.760
 because with carbines and own weapons 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.710
 of the class are the submachine guns but ok and 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.300
 17 repairs and now get ready because 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.190
 before I told you that the mission of the IMF said 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.360
 This is difficult and that's why I had 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.250
 difficulty but this one has its difficulty 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.230
 because during its development we will have to 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.540
 resist the very attractive temptation of 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.920
 suicide while we make ourselves 50 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.740
 gallons of tools that come 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.000
 being 400 repairs in addition to that 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.680
 as before there will always be 10 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.480
 gallons and the 200 casualties but let's focus 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.610
 in the worst to which I faced everything 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.680
 battlefield 4 because at least the fbi 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.750
 js had his grace because it required 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.100
 skill basically for this mission 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.720
 what you will have to do is sit in 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.120
 a little bird for 20 games 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.220
 repairing non-stop without killing reducing 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.350
 boring ratio you as if there was no 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.100
 one morning and to top it all down the 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.860
 battlelog skill 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.360
 everything is that mission is very bad 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.540
 realize this the only thing they will give us 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.160
 will be a 9mm mp with 700 rounds of 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.660
 cadence and a model normal damage 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.280
 which we will start knowing that it will not go 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.590
 well to short then it will go well to long 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.450
 not because the fall of the damage goes down 12 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.400
 with 1 with which we will have to give 89 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.930
 shots to kill them and to give them that 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.060
 we will need precision and have 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.740
 precision not because it's a submachine gun with 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.240
 which of course I would not recommend this 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.830
 arm anybody at least not above 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.420
 the cbhe jm that I like 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.850
 pretty and good it seems that I've 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.530
 been scratching a good time but is that 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.060
 I really do not see any incentive to 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.010
 beat you beatings that I 've stuck myself 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.170
 for days just to get things 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.940
 practically useless without many many
