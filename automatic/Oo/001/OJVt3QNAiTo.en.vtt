00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.750
 it is a fundamental element for life 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.080
 two thirds of the planet are racing compounds and this quantity remains 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.020
 steadily 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.719
 photo 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.180
 the water does not increase it decreases it transforms continuously originating 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.580
 what is defined 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.009
 water cycle 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.669
 but perhaps not everyone knows that they are 2% of this and drinking at the state 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.319
 natural indeed 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.579
 raindrops before falling 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.579
 they absorb crates strongly not there 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.710
 to these same precipitations depositing images lakes and rivers and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.130
 aquifers come into contact with other sources of pollution 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.380
 but if the quantity 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.630
 how are you portable over the thousand 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.550
 this is not the ride for its quality 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.220
 in the last two centuries of industrialization 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.150
 man has been forced to purify the flowing water 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.430
 for its people for food 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.500
 counting the urban aqueducts systems that ensure drinking water to the whole 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.090
 collectivity 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.239
 like the planet our body too 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.390
 cost about two thirds away 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.550
 its main role is to purify the organism 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.960
 therefore it is important to first reuse water in the kitchen 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 absolutely san is controlled 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.160
 the commonly defined drinking water and the one defined by the legislation 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.290
 intended for human consumption 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.030
 and is distributed through public aqueducts now taken in cisterns 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.670
 controlled its requirements are evaluated based on rigorous parameters 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.280
 bacteriological physical chemists that define their quality compared to 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.260
 need of our body 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.830
 in Italy the drinking water sector is isolated by the decree 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.810
 legislative number thirty-one of 2 February 2001 which aims to 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.360
 protect health by indicating the concentration limits of the substances 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.560
 dissolved in water hey believed to kill me 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.990
 exists common to all and legislation on the criteria of drinking water 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.990
 network compared to that of mineral waters in fact the latter are 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.010
 governed by specific laws, they allow me concentration limits 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.499
 different 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.769
 compared to those allowed for mains water as for arsenic tolerated 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.199
 even higher concentrations of bottled water 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.179
 the provisions of the law on mains water are applied by means of a long one 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.529
 series of analyzes and checks to guarantee public health 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:25.909
 the water is monitored in real time by control units operating 24 hours a day and is 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.219
 controlled channeled every day to the internal laboratories and facilities of 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.119
 purification there is uncertain external qualified you receive withdrawals 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.590
 carried out in the pipelines 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.720
 It also has information to the region's healthcare companies 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.349
 15 if the water of our aqueducts is sat 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.909
 rolled and cheap because we are the population with the highest consumption 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.650
 mineral water in Europe and third parties, with a consumption of 190 liters per capita 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.110
 alarm 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.310
 let's feed a turnover of 2 billion euros 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:01.209
 according to legambiente, the beauty of 300,000 say every year in Italy 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.119
 just to transport mineral water 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:08.609
 moreover, to produce 30 bottles, a 17 kg of t &amp; t is required 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.639
 water in addition to emissions into the atmosphere for processing, finally after that 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.699
 mineral water has been sold, it takes another 10 cents to dispose of 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.329
 each bottle provided that this is not abandoned in the environment of which 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.329
 means a time of over a century before it disappears 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.769
 moreover, the season is no less important 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.109
 mineral waters in fact have specific curative functions are distinguished by 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.760
 its chemical-physical characteristics that represent a remedy for 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.620
 hoc to be used to respond to individual therapeutic needs e 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.869
 for periods of time control 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.569
 Medea. this is the reason why even today 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.760
 the law allows a different regulatory treatment for concentration limits 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.139
 of substances present in bottled mineral water compared to water 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.129
 drinking from the tap 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.120
 however the water we drink represents a small part of all that 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.719
 we use daily 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.290
 an Italian consumes the surprising amount of 200 13 liters per day 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:07.369
 the equivalent of two bathtubs a huge amount especially considering that 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:11.200
 also the cost of tap water is an environmental impact the cost concerns the 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.400
 necessary economic resources for you it speaks of it stocked distributed from and for 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.309
 purified even before arrays put it into nature 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:22.269
 the environmental impact and instead the price paid by nature to move 

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:25.680
 that water from its original water system to other places a 

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:28.849
 the detriment of animal and vegetable organisms but which films the first one 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:29.860
 clicked draw 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.180
 here therefore type every liter of water is fully precious small 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.580
 tricks could save you thousands of liters of water 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.580
 obvious head 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.830
 rai 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.710
 hahaha 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.879
 hahaha
