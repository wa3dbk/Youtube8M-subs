00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
backing or some tape underneath it so

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.960 
backing or some tape underneath it so
the<00:03:02.820> line<00:03:03.060> doesn't<00:03:03.510> slip<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.959> your<00:03:04.140> armor

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.699 
anyway the cost of power Pro the Buy in
is<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.550> little<00:03:08.819> more<00:03:08.970> expensive<00:03:09.660> but<00:03:10.410> it's

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
is a little more expensive but it's

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.729 
is a little more expensive but it's
ultraviolet<00:03:11.250> protected<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:13.350> can<00:03:13.380> get

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
ultraviolet protected and you can get

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.710 
ultraviolet protected and you can get
several<00:03:14.190> seasons<00:03:14.489> out<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.510> long

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
several seasons out of it so the long

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.870 
several seasons out of it so the long
run<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.110> might<00:03:16.290> actually<00:03:16.470> be<00:03:16.829> less<00:03:17.670> expensive

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
run it might actually be less expensive

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.979
