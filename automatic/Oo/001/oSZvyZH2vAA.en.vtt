a new layer really quick stairs getting
outliers<00:00:18.630> new<00:00:19.170> raster<00:00:19.380> layer<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.250> hit<00:00:20.430> ok<00:00:20.689> so

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
outliers new raster layer and hit ok so

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.269 
outliers new raster layer and hit ok so
now<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:21.960> your<00:00:22.080> layers<00:00:22.260> palette<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.130> should

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
now on your layers palette you should

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.370 
now on your layers palette you should
have<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.730> raster<00:00:24.119> layer<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.930> background

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
have the raster layer in the background

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500 
have the raster layer in the background
which<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.619> your<00:00:25.859> picture<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.970> next<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.359> you're

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
going out of the lasso tool right here

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.430 
going out of the lasso tool right here
on<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> side<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.840> make<00:00:36.840> sure<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.200> set<00:00:37.380> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
on the side and make sure it's set to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.110 
on the side and make sure it's set to
point<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.010> point<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:38.460> that's<00:00:38.610> what's<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120

messy<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.809> doing<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.260> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
messy I'm just kind of doing kind of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:57.600 
messy I'm just kind of doing kind of
fast

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.450 

and<00:00:57.850> some<00:00:58.540> shirts<00:00:59.170> are<00:00:59.710> harder<00:01:00.100> than<00:01:00.190> others

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
and some shirts are harder than others

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.270 
and some shirts are harder than others
um<00:01:01.240> because<00:01:01.990> you<00:01:02.440> know<00:01:02.560> like<00:01:02.830> site<00:01:03.010> models

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
um because you know like site models

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.790 
um because you know like site models
Harrigan's<00:01:03.760> site<00:01:04.660> models<00:01:05.050> hair<00:01:05.320> gets<00:01:05.560> in<00:01:05.680> the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
Harrigan's site models hair gets in the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.860 
Harrigan's site models hair gets in the
way<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:06.010> everything<00:01:06.160> but<00:01:07.150> this<00:01:07.420> one<00:01:07.630> is<00:01:07.720> pretty

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
way in everything but this one is pretty

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.570 
way in everything but this one is pretty
easy<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:08.440> I<00:01:08.470> try<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.710> usually<00:01:09.040> pick<00:01:09.220> easier

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
easy so I try to usually pick easier

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.969 
easy so I try to usually pick easier
ones<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.390> it<00:01:13.630> looks<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:14.020> lot<00:01:14.200> better<00:01:14.470> when<00:01:14.830> you

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
ones and it looks a lot better when you

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.610 
ones and it looks a lot better when you
take<00:01:15.190> your<00:01:15.220> time<00:01:15.670> because<00:01:16.210> if<00:01:16.450> not<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:17.380> just

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
take your time because if not it just

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.130 
take your time because if not it just
looks<00:01:17.860> like<00:01:18.100> her<00:01:19.060> shirt<00:01:19.360> was<00:01:19.390> just<00:01:19.840> other

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
looks like her shirt was just other

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.900 
looks like her shirt was just other
color<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.530> you<00:01:20.620> kind<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:20.950> did<00:01:21.400> whatever<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.880> it

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
color and you kind of did whatever to it

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.040 
color and you kind of did whatever to it
but<00:01:24.910> as<00:01:25.030> you<00:01:25.150> can<00:01:25.270> see<00:01:25.479> I'm<00:01:25.570> not<00:01:25.720> really<00:01:25.810> taking

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
but as you can see I'm not really taking

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:35.219 
but as you can see I'm not really taking
back<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.250> once<00:01:33.430> you<00:01:33.520> have<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:35.140> going

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
back so once you have that you're going

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.080 
back so once you have that you're going

to go over here and you're going to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.790 
to go over here and you're going to
change<00:01:37.390> this<00:01:37.750> color<00:01:38.020> right<00:01:38.140> here<00:01:38.320> which<00:01:38.650> is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
change this color right here which is

the<00:01:38.920> foreground<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.460> short<00:01:39.759> color<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.630> the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
the foreground and short color to the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.180 
the foreground and short color to the
gradient<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.290> want<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:41.710> I'm<00:01:41.800> just<00:01:41.979> going<00:01:42.130> to
