please check out channel here today I
we're<00:00:02.790> gonna<00:00:02.850> play<00:00:03.120> with<00:00:03.330> two<00:00:03.570> different

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
we're gonna play with two different

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.249 
we're gonna play with two different
engines<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:05.400> it's<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:06.060> mega<00:00:06.299> block<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:06.960> let's

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
engines and it's a mega block so let's

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.930 
engines and it's a mega block so let's
go<00:00:07.440> make<00:00:07.680> some<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.160> know<00:00:08.250> background<00:00:08.490> because

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
go make some you know background because

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.240 
go make some you know background because
otherwise<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.450> doesn't<00:00:09.719> look<00:00:09.870> good<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.769> this

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
otherwise it doesn't look good so this

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.370 
otherwise it doesn't look good so this
is<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.700> know<00:00:11.790> kind<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.120> wood<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.809> I'm

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
is the you know kind of wood and I'm

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.890 
is the you know kind of wood and I'm
gonna<00:00:13.500> make<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.710> tree<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.599> you<00:00:15.599> might<00:00:15.780> be

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
gonna make a tree out of it you might be

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.630 
gonna make a tree out of it you might be
familiar<00:00:16.080> with<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.680> kind<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.980> tree<00:00:17.279> it's

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
familiar with this kind of tree it's

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.990 
familiar with this kind of tree it's
pretty<00:00:17.910> simple<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.449> easy<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.990> make<00:00:19.730> it's<00:00:20.730> done

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
pretty simple and easy to make it's done

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.189 
pretty simple and easy to make it's done
and<00:00:21.840> now<00:00:22.039> I'm<00:00:23.039> gonna<00:00:23.189> make<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.460> different<00:00:24.199> tree

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and now I'm gonna make a different tree

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.429 
and now I'm gonna make a different tree
here<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.710> see<00:00:25.920> two<00:00:26.279> more<00:00:26.460> pieces<00:00:27.439> pretty

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
here you can see two more pieces pretty

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.180 
here you can see two more pieces pretty
easy<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.330> put<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:34.190> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
easy so you just put it here and the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.850 
easy so you just put it here and the
tree<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.430> done<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.840> see<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.680> let's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
tree is done here you can see so let's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.670 
tree is done here you can see so let's
go<00:00:38.070> put<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.420> way<00:00:39.570> back<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.440> one

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
go put it all the way back and this one

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.170 
go put it all the way back and this one
here<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:42.629> look<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.340> same

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
here and look at this this is like same

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.529 
here and look at this this is like same
shape<00:00:45.680> here<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.270> here<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> can

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
shape here you can see one here you can

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299 
shape here you can see one here you can
see<00:00:48.719> another<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.190> know

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
see another one these are the you know

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.020 
see another one these are the you know
big<00:00:50.789> engines<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.629> Sodor<00:00:51.989> island<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.710> see

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
big engines of Sodor island you can see

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.049 
big engines of Sodor island you can see
so<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.210> II<00:00:54.239> guess<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.780> engineer<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.760> big

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
so can II guess what engineer is the big

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.599 
so can II guess what engineer is the big
one<00:00:57.360> two<00:00:57.780> big<00:00:57.989> engines<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.500> same<00:00:58.829> size<00:00:59.160> why<00:00:59.430> did

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
one two big engines of same size why did

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.750 
one two big engines of same size why did
I<00:00:59.730> pick<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.410> same<00:01:01.440> size<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.430> big

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
I pick this they are of same size of big

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.100 
I pick this they are of same size of big
they're<00:01:03.180> big<00:01:03.539> look<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.810> first

so we're gonna try to add both of them

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.709 
so we're gonna try to add both of them
together<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> same<00:01:59.250> base<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.850> let's<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.420> try

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
together on a same base so let's go try

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.819 
together on a same base so let's go try
it<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.200> let's<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.280> how<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.820> looks<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.829> can

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
see this is the mega block so here is

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.680 
see this is the mega block so here is
the<00:02:10.009> head

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
the head

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.460 
the head
one<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.350> mega<00:02:12.530> bloks<00:02:12.800> here<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.130> can<00:02:13.280> see

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
one of the mega bloks here you can see
