00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.660
 I will start by applying a pearl color on 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.940
 the area of ​​the lacrimal 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 and then choose the orange colors 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.530
 starting with the lightest shade 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.629
 then I added some orange 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.710
 darker 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.790
 with a guide intensify the angles 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 outside of the eyes 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.910
 with black color if you do not want color 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.050
 also black to orange is very 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.940
 beautiful brown tones 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.460
 yes 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:20.020
 chantilly color tone steak pan 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.020
 fundation for the dark circles area 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.700
 enter the tabs to then put 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.700
 These two styles of false eyelashes 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.340
 once the glue is completely 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.570
 dry intensify dark colors of 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.570
 outer area of ​​the eyes using the guide 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.570
 again 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.570
 with help of cappuccino color we are going to 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.100
 apply generously all over the face 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.130
 as you want 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.939
 if you want with sponge or brushes 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.479
 but remember that it is very uniform and 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.479
 equal 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.220
 i 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.740
 I had not apply trainer or moisturizer 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.340
 to the skin of the aura because the product is 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.230
 creamy enough to hydrate the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.230
 normal skin of our model 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.530
 a general look at our place at 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.690
 Summer as we are staying observed 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.020
 that there is no difference in color between 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.420
 face and neck 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.430
 now with the cappuccino color we are going to 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.520
 do the outline and a brush more 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.970
 small starting from the middle of the 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.810
 ear with direction to the voice 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.720
 the nose on the sides 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.390
 and on the forehead at the hairline 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.450
 I do this so that the face has 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.450
 more warmth moment for the photos that 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.950
 helps us check how the registry is 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.980
 in photography now with a brush more 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.349
 soft and big we blur the color 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.349
 cappuccino which is the outline 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.590
 if necessary after blurring 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.860
 add a little more to make it more 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.420
 dramatic since the lashes gives us 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.420
 to achieve this look 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:04.439
 We seal with loose powder of the same 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.750
 marks tones in the area of ​​dark circles 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:11.040

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.950
 that I am using this de l'oréal 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.829
 well attached to the false eyelashes if 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.850
 you want to lengthen it a bit more in the 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:26.260
 exterior angles also remember that 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:34.960
 the eyeliner is very necessary inside 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:37.990
 the false eyelashes we make the 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.389
 liner in the water line and before 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.930
 that it dries we go back to the 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.720

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.180

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.550

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.590
 Y 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.440
 we seal and clean the skin with 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.130
 same brand white loose powder 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.130
