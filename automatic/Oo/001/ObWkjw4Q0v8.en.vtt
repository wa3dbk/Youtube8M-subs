 subway lightly this is not even this 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.070
 departure of tdt team bazaar channels and 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.619
 let's see how it is given to us because 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.560
 As you know, I am reacting to 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.039
 long for the light ones but did not finish 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.110
 catch the dot the fact 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.010
 the category of matter told the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.630
 which belongs the 1249 is the one that started 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 for those who delay reloading the whore 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.180
 shit is there and it does not take as long as 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 you should imagine in a real combat 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.780
 recharging a light submachine gun should be 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.259
 of the most terrifying things that you 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.259
 they can pass 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 sometimes and today yes sir 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.510
 my mother I love doctors I love you 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.580
 I love that doctors comply with 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.619
 his job or to take care of his colleagues 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.110
 talking about doctors and being in tc's 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.670
 team 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.640
 we should all be doctors I 'm not going to 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.770
 back in which is 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.610
 I wrote down uncle twice 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.610
 here there is marzipan 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.970
 and that they do not give you the fucking bullets that 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.240
 we had 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.450
 'I'm crazy shit a bullet 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.450
 remains 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.780
 because nothing kill me after all the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.780
 bitch battle and often fagot 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.000
 I tell you to enter this team 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.000
 there are no vehicles 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.080
 there is nothing to do 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.970
 a lot of work, to say nothing 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.030
 of support good perhaps the one of the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.310
 ammunition yes that is 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.790
 let's say necessary in a very quantities 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.980
 basic very minimal but the rich either 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.470
 is it necessary because you do not need 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.030
 any kind of 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.040
 radio faroni well I do not know I do not see it 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.270
 very necessary unless obviously 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.470
 Well, if you want to play with him but 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.690
 let's say that in practice what is 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.210
 being practical being practical not 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.720
 doing what he wants but what he does best 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.900
 go to your team 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.610
 I should be a medical doctor or support the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.890
 Ammo theme but let's go 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.620
 and I tell you support in very large amounts 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.860
 very very low basically all 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.430
 all of doctor but hey it would be a pain in the ass 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.340
 of the host we are all the same young 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.900
 I'm getting purple mom good at 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.290

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.290

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.790

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.180
 make a streak and I'm nothing 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.300
 to make me shit you're shit is what 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.590
 you're dead do not open the fucking mouth in the 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.160
 moment when you think about the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.420
 shit you're going to take everything for ass 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.110
 It is not like this 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.110
 it's like that 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.150
 Let's see where you go Tarzan Tarzan of the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.530
 monkeys take the eggs better said 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.530
 they take of the games 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.620
 to see your colleague 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.450
 but here is a corpse 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.310
 but it's a corpse but here still 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.310
 it smells to fear some of here 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.340
 besides fuck let's go we can hear and hear 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.780
 the pomegranate also takes a gift 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.260
 let's go, my god, mark on the whore 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.260
 call 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.730
 in the little flame today 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.600
 if someone thinks that this is normal in 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.800
 my light column 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.830
 he is very wrong 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.300
 I'm pretty boorish with the light ones but 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.430
 for those who have told me today in 249 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.070
 Now it's already gone 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.190
 I have been told sides 49 is very easy to 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.190
 use 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.340
 what I think of the 49 is that it has 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.500
 Less damage than a rubber band 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.500
 but today you see that emma is fine 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.680
 Let's see 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.230
 come on let's go there we are and it would be a good 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.960
 time to recharge but 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.640
 do not fuck me I had four whores bullets and 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.970
 I give in the fucking head and I charge 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.860
 let's go this game after this 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.100
 game I'm going to play lottery is what 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.100
 I already say 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.050
 I'm going to play lottery after this 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.050
 departure 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.330
 we can that it will be by bullets I shit on 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.669
 God can not someone explain to me where 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.300
 balls are giving the bullets when 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.300
 had notes 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.350
 come on let's go let's shoot more with a 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.230
 light the good peephole the whole weapon 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.900
 ascend 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.750
 There comes a moment that stops rising and 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.150
 it stays fixed where the balls are giving 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.760
 the bullets is that I do not understand why the 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.080
 Peephole does not fold I do not bend 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.270
 bullets are in the same place 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.360
 they should go to the center of america but I 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.950
 point to the center of the peephole and do not go 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.870
 the bullets to the trunk because it does not give 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.070
 a fucking bullet someone explain to me 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.730
 someone who controls a little bit of 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.480
 light we go there we go there trip 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.920
 someone who controls a little bit of 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.240
 light to explain to me where the fuck 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.090
 they are giving the bullets 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.920
 in short, your team has won this beautiful 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:21.020
 departure of this team in channels of no 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:24.770
 be with the 249 and to recognize that the 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.440
 competition was not very fierce in the end 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.160
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.460
 next 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.460
 chao chao
