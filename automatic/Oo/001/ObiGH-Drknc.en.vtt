00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 the fashion of this fall winter 2013 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.000
 2014 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.939
 I waited to make this video up 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.760
 precisely more or less half of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.439
 September because in short the real fashion le 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.230
 true trends are seen first of all 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.900
 on the road in the street through now with 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.940
 internet as a web through social media too 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 network to the photos of outfits tracks 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.260
 which are also made from the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.120
 people around the world see lookbook 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.040
 see what the trends are 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.690
 been taken out of the catwalks 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.789
 to be placed that later in life 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.260
 real because obviously the catwalk 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.520
 proposes a route but obviously not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.699
 must follow it to make it possible 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.789
 take things and then do them 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.469
 become that trend but I hope there is a 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.149
 mishmash of Rome to say in 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.059
 let's start right away because 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.640
 basically the keyword le 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.229
 keywords because there are different 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.030
 they are above all color prints 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.110
 fabric combinations different mix of things 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.869
 so that you have more 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.200
 in the sense that it is absolutely not a 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.150
 hallucinatory thing to see I don't know the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.330
 lace combined with leather and studs 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.520
 combined with the finest fabric 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.340
 finally precisely because there is this mix the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.530
 mix is ​​perhaps the key word of everything 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.720
 so it was a winter so let's talk 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.420
 is there boys mix of colors 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.000
 really things that I would never have 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.530
 dreamed of putting together are together 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.590
 there are things I like 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.479
 very much other things than just not 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.090
 like them but this is only mine 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.189
 opinion and don't give a damn 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.630
 let's start with the style that maybe will be 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.020
 certainly adopted more by 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.640
 very young then 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.630
 for those who still go to school or otherwise 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.820
 very young girls or otherwise 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.460
 short talk about wanting to put in short 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.579
 which is the grunge style in the true sense 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.830
 of the word therefore obviously a style 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.730
 mtv very street style so let's talk 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.129
 of things torn prints and leather things 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.190
 mixed with other fabrics in various lengths 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.959
 of tires with three good longs with 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.670
 boots in short, a style that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.830
 represents a generation even a 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.900
 partner's own cultural movement 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.660
 cultural that also comes 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.340
 in clothing then already existed 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.650
 now it has become somewhat common 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 when the deaths only belonged 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.610
 limited to the metalheads true that tare 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.819
 now they are also used in the sky also uses 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.510
 the princess is very much thought of 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.099
 but on the poems it almost seems that the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.900
 person is put persons of one thing 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.329
 who knows what he has in the closet but is not 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.860
 much thought important that promise 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.870
 I didn't say at the beginning each one a 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.360
 regardless of fads by betting on 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.010
 what we want of course we frame 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.769
 just what the trend for those who can 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.139
 be interested in the examination of all 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.780
 typical girls there is no limit to 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.120
 prints with floral prints 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.160
 we bring from summer also in autumn 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.980
 winter seen jackets and sweaters with 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.200
 the flowers will yield to animal prints and 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.000
 then zebra-striped leopard but own 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.859
 animals and also because there is dad face 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.590
 of the tiger face of the gods 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.430
 cheetahs and prints also background 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.019
 religious crosses but also own 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.819
 sacred images just real 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.950
 sacred images print on maio in 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.780
 china here is a mixture of the sacred and the profane 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:38.049
 leatherette leather studded skulls 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.150
 prefer you put the jemia and all 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.400
 I rest of course if we carry it 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.500
 since last year and we report it also 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.930
 this year from the Northern League on mib l alle 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.520
 shoes with studs on the boots 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.440
 in biker style leather 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.680
 but very very very seedy i 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.700
 colors then are the shades of gray 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.470
 the 50 shades of gray that is not one 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.840
 in short, the gray and winter I have 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.820
 discovered the hot water however it will be 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.000
 really the populace 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.800
 there is in all the shades combined 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.720
 in short, light gray and 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.960
 dark gray almost gray anthracite 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.160
 we would really be there 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.840
 so many this does not mean that there is 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.140
 the other extreme is that of colors 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.170
 most acces was not even the 15th of August 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.570
 yellow and green blue and orange you know what 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.150
 it reminded me so much and I didn't 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.130
 lived the eighties and unfortunately there 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.780
 I was born at the end of the 80s though 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.430
 in short, I didn't experience them 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.410
 watching that I lived as much as the series 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.840
 also of sex and seek we are beccaris 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.870
 diaries us the carrie diaries of when 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.330
 young carrie ra and we are in there 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.800
 80's I think the costume designers have 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.930
 precisely made if the piece tribes 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.390
 last year we did n't have any 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.060
 difficulty finding the costume because 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.710
 I'm not saying everything but most 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.140
 the very same things that will be worn 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.940
 also this winter your bow 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.730
 prints those eyes bon ton prints 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.640
 aggressive prints the peplum that is precisely 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.890
 the flounces at the level of the hips very much 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.100
 vintage vintage has cost something 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.410
 which instead is more modern leggins a 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.770
 google that exactly reflect the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.950
 itself 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:20.000
 the trend therefore colors of all of 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.200
 plus the hand of the lines therefore in rows 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.830
 both horizontally and vertically 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.780
 then and then the reason par excellence a 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.270
 fabric level and will be tartan 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.540
 then check to go go as if not there 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.449
 it was tomorrow in the miur la campagnola 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.479
 cancel the lumberjack 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.439
 to the one with squares instead 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.059
 cut in this way is here 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.689
 really there is no limit to the 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.219
 fantasy 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:43.779
 another thing for so much for 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.669
 what about the jeans that will go 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.830
 ripping again like so many years ago 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.529
 will be the boyfriend jeans hall both and 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.449
 men's jeans model type of love 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.639
 that I am from a man but I am recalling the 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.520
 model for men life obviously a 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.919
 a little bit loud and above all soft 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.599
 soft on the already adherent sides invites 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.059
 then maybe soft on the sides that 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.039
 they go straight down to the ankles 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:08.020
 turn up just above the ankles 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.629
 fringed needless to talk about there frangi 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.339
 everywhere both on the bags and on the 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:14.319
 sweaters will be very much also 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.909
 winter shorts maybe what I say about 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.150
 leggings of the Parisian stockings 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:21.729
 really there is everything this winter 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.699
 a bit for all tastes I hope to have you 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.139
 I went some ideas there are 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.139
 surely other things I didn't say 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.879
 but a lot of things and we 'll see them going 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:33.099
 ahead of course in the season is not 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:34.509
 that now you know everything obviously has me 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.639
 given a little what I've seen around 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:39.129
 what you are seeing the most 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.629
 styles, colors, etc. etc. 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.189
 however let me know if there is 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:44.499
 something that you especially like I want 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:47.199
 to know that there is something I don't like 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:49.240
 let me know what your trend will be 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.979
 is what the thing that is in fashion 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.289
 or that is not fashionable that 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.879
 make the most of this winter or me 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.949
