00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
top of slow some part of me enjoyed the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
sorrow of the ending but I felt like a

huge fight just needed to happen and I
personally<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.210> kaneki<00:01:06.690> should<00:01:06.840> have

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
personally think that kaneki should have

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.389 
personally think that kaneki should have
been<00:01:07.110> way<00:01:07.320> stronger<00:01:07.619> than<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> Monde<00:01:08.190> in<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
been way stronger than a Monde in the

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.920 
been way stronger than a Monde in the
previous<00:01:08.759> episodes<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.600> should<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.840> been

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
previous episodes there should have been

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.719 
previous episodes there should have been
a<00:01:10.050> better<00:01:10.200> fight<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.890> didn't<00:01:11.220> connect<00:01:11.550> very

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
a better fight it didn't connect very

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
a better fight it didn't connect very
well<00:01:11.789> honestly<00:01:12.539> at<00:01:12.660> this<00:01:12.780> point<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.229> gotta<00:01:13.410> read

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
unquestionably took the ending of a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.470 
unquestionably took the ending of a
knotch<00:02:13.410> still<00:02:14.069> with<00:02:14.220> Amon<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.730> Akira<00:02:15.060> with

with<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.030> many<00:02:18.150> slow<00:02:18.450> moments<00:02:18.690> they<00:02:19.050> have

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
with so many slow moments they have

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.690 
with so many slow moments they have
plenty<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.590> time<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.830> focus<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.370> few<00:02:20.430> other

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
