installed on the aircraft just getting
dialed<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.490> it's<00:00:17.490> got<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> throttle<00:00:17.940> body

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
dialed in it's got the throttle body

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.540 
dialed in it's got the throttle body
camera<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.800> side's<00:00:20.039> got<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> throttle

body fuel injection mounted under there

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.050 
body fuel injection mounted under there
nicely<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:23.039> temporary<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.699> moment<00:00:24.000> or

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
nicely just temporary for the moment or

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.820 
nicely just temporary for the moment or
the<00:00:24.119> cables<00:00:24.510> will<00:00:24.840> sort<00:00:25.080> them<00:00:25.199> out<00:00:25.320> properly

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the cables will sort them out properly

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.370 
the cables will sort them out properly
but<00:00:25.890> everyone's<00:00:26.340> working<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.880> least<00:00:27.289> you<00:00:28.289> can

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
but everyone's working at least you can

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.490 
but everyone's working at least you can
see<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> liquid<00:00:28.769> cooled<00:00:29.099> heads<00:00:29.310> there<00:00:30.500> you've

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
see the liquid cooled heads there you've

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.459 
see the liquid cooled heads there you've
got<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> nice<00:00:31.830> little<00:00:32.009> plenum<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.610> here

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
got a nice little plenum up here

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.220 
got a nice little plenum up here
standard<00:00:34.469> jabiru<00:00:34.770> 3300<00:00:35.960> good<00:00:36.960> look<00:00:37.079> at<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
standard jabiru 3300 good look at the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750 
standard jabiru 3300 good look at the
plane<00:00:37.469> back<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.160> looks<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
plane back here so it looks like the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.910 
plane back here so it looks like the
Spitfire<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.350> he's<00:00:43.469> done<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.770> he's<00:00:43.890> put

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
Spitfire and what he's done is he's put

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.500 
Spitfire and what he's done is he's put
the<00:00:44.160> radiator<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:44.879> underneath<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> wing

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the radiator right underneath the wing

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.970 
the radiator right underneath the wing
here<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.960> absolutely<00:00:46.379> perfect<00:00:46.469> that'll

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
here which is absolutely perfect that'll

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
here which is absolutely perfect that'll
have<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> nice<00:00:47.340> Spitfire<00:00:47.910> shaped<00:00:48.239> scoop<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
have a nice Spitfire shaped scoop on it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.060 
have a nice Spitfire shaped scoop on it
which<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.020> already<00:00:49.289> made<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
which is already made but that's the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
which is already made but that's the
radiator<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:51.989> very

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
radiator as you can see it's not very

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.910 
radiator as you can see it's not very
big<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> nice<00:00:54.930> custom-made<00:00:55.559> element

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
big and it is a nice custom-made element

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.650 
big and it is a nice custom-made element
your<00:00:56.010> radiator<00:00:56.340> those<00:00:56.520> two<00:00:56.850> blue<00:00:57.090> lines<00:00:57.420> there

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
your radiator those two blue lines there

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
your radiator those two blue lines there
those<00:00:57.840> hoses<00:00:58.289> that's<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> water<00:00:58.770> hoses<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
those hoses that's the water hoses and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.299 
those hoses that's the water hoses and
this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.600> interesting<00:01:00.840> he's<00:01:01.199> got<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.680> tiny

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
this is interesting he's got a tiny

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
this is interesting he's got a tiny
little<00:01:02.699> electric<00:01:03.359> water<00:01:03.539> pump<00:01:03.629> Davies<00:01:04.199> Craig

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
little electric water pump Davies Craig

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.609 
little electric water pump Davies Craig
and<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.760> hard<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.180> believe<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.869> can

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and it's hard to believe that that can

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.050 
and it's hard to believe that that can
do<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> job<00:01:08.130> compared<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.850> we

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
do the job compared to the one that we

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.539 
do the job compared to the one that we
were<00:01:09.240> using<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.600> row<00:01:09.750> tech<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.950> he's<00:01:11.100> tested

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
were using at row tech but he's tested

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
were using at row tech but he's tested
it<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.510> moving<00:01:12.900> plenty<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.260> water

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
it and it it's moving plenty of water

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.399 
it and it it's moving plenty of water
and<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:14.850> calling<00:01:15.150> adequately<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:16.259> is

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and it's calling adequately which is

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.410 
and it's calling adequately which is
really<00:01:16.799> good<00:01:17.040> news<00:01:17.250> because<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.119> very

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
really good news because that's a very

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.070 
really good news because that's a very
small<00:01:18.720> pump<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.729> stay<00:01:21.330> underneath<00:01:21.570> there<00:01:21.930> all

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
small pump and stay underneath there all

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.539 
small pump and stay underneath there all
the<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> three<00:01:24.299> inlet<00:01:24.600> lines<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.549> one

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the the three inlet lines there is one

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.539 
the the three inlet lines there is one
there<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.320> one<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.189> there's<00:01:29.400> my

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
there is one there and then there's my

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.600 
there is one there and then there's my
thing<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.770> coming<00:01:32.100> out<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> top

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
thing and then coming out of the top

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.030 
thing and then coming out of the top
side<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> head<00:01:33.380> there's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> common<00:01:34.860> rail

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
side of the head there's a common rail

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
side of the head there's a common rail
here<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.869> two<00:01:37.040> three<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.600> hose

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
here one two three and then that hose

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.020 
here one two three and then that hose
comes<00:01:40.200> together<00:01:41.780> here<00:01:43.040> on<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> common<00:01:44.490> pipe<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
comes together here on a common pipe and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.620 
comes together here on a common pipe and
then<00:01:45.869> back<00:01:46.079> down<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.530> blue<00:01:46.770> line<00:01:47.040> here<00:01:47.630> all

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
then back down this blue line here all

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
then back down this blue line here all
the<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:48.899> back<00:01:49.140> down<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.070> radiator

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the way back down to the radiator

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.710 
the way back down to the radiator
through<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> firewall<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> there's<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
through the firewall and there's the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.679 
through the firewall and there's the
water<00:01:51.930> coming<00:01:52.200> from<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.530> radiator

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
water coming from the radiator

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.109 
water coming from the radiator
so<00:01:54.560> that's<00:01:54.740> all<00:01:54.920> very<00:01:54.950> nice<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:58.369> then<00:01:58.880> round

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
so that's all very nice and then round

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.429 
so that's all very nice and then round
this<00:01:59.240> side<00:01:59.450> we've<00:01:59.689> got<00:01:59.719> the<00:01:59.929> same<00:02:00.140> thing

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
this side we've got the same thing

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.200 
this side we've got the same thing
there's<00:02:00.859> the<00:02:01.009> common<00:02:01.310> rail<00:02:01.490> water<00:02:01.729> exiting

cylinders there on the right-hand bank
and<00:02:19.549> there's<00:02:19.760> he's<00:02:19.879> come<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.269> rail<00:02:20.420> which<00:02:20.629> is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
and there's he's come and rail which is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.890 
and there's he's come and rail which is
being<00:02:20.989> fed<00:02:21.319> from<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.160> water<00:02:22.340> pump<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.970> this

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
being fed from the water pump and this

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.720 
being fed from the water pump and this
is<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.140> relocation<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.950> oil<00:02:25.160> cooler<00:02:25.400> and

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
is the relocation of the oil cooler and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.500 
is the relocation of the oil cooler and
here's<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.540> nice<00:02:26.720> little<00:02:26.750> touch<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:29.299> got<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
here's a nice little touch it's got a

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.990 
here's a nice little touch it's got a
nice<00:02:29.920> five<00:02:30.920> liters<00:02:31.310> some<00:02:31.519> powder<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
nice five liters some powder to the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.670 
nice five liters some powder to the
bottom<00:02:32.299> so<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.540> got<00:02:32.660> bucket<00:02:33.110> loads<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.500> oil

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
bottom so it's got bucket loads of oil

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.050 
bottom so it's got bucket loads of oil
now<00:02:33.920> which<00:02:34.099> has<00:02:34.220> always<00:02:34.370> been<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.670> little<00:02:34.970> bit

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
now which has always been a little bit

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.430 
now which has always been a little bit
of<00:02:35.150> an<00:02:35.209> issue<00:02:35.329> with<00:02:35.510> jabs<00:02:35.750> only<00:02:36.019> being<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.290> hole

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
of an issue with jabs only being a hole

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.069 
of an issue with jabs only being a hole
able<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.010> hold<00:02:37.190> about<00:02:37.450> one<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.599> half<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.930> two

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
able to hold about one and a half to two

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.330 
able to hold about one and a half to two
liters<00:02:39.260> effective<00:02:39.860> oval<00:02:40.129> of<00:02:40.340> oil<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:42.829> also

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
liters effective oval of oil and also

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.360 
liters effective oval of oil and also
what's<00:02:43.579> nice<00:02:43.819> is<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:45.170> worked<00:02:45.410> on<00:02:45.650> with<00:02:45.829> Jim<00:02:46.160> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
what's nice is we worked on with Jim a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.520 
what's nice is we worked on with Jim a
new<00:02:47.090> plenum<00:02:47.900> chamber<00:02:48.879> for<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:49.910> jabiru<00:02:50.810> 3,300

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
new plenum chamber for the jabiru 3,300

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.259 
new plenum chamber for the jabiru 3,300
it's<00:02:51.680> just<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:52.010> spider<00:02:52.280> box<00:02:52.609> here<00:02:52.879> you<00:02:53.680> see<00:02:54.680> that

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
it's just a spider box here you see that

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.180 
it's just a spider box here you see that
and<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.569> TV<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.049> feeding<00:02:57.620> directly<00:02:57.829> into<00:02:58.160> a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
and so the TV is feeding directly into a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.240 
and so the TV is feeding directly into a
plenum<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.650> right<00:03:00.650> in<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.829> bottom<00:03:00.980> like<00:03:01.220> a

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
plenum and right in the bottom like a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250 
plenum and right in the bottom like a
lot<00:03:01.489> combing<00:03:01.849> wood<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.209> it's<00:03:02.720> feeding<00:03:02.959> more

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
lot combing wood and it's feeding more

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.059 
lot combing wood and it's feeding more
evenly<00:03:03.970> he's<00:03:04.970> like<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.209> horse

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.180
