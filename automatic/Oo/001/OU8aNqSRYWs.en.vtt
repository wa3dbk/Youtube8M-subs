course in the second step we talk and go

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.900 
course in the second step we talk and go
heavy<00:03:10.200> into<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> need<00:03:10.709> analysis<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.430> call<00:03:11.880> it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
heavy into the need analysis I call it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.820 
heavy into the need analysis I call it
digging<00:03:12.300> for<00:03:12.630> purpose<00:03:12.989> finding<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.650> their

the third thing is how to design a

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.890 
the third thing is how to design a
presentation<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:21.060> impossible<00:03:21.390> to

and why they are buying and the fourth

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.199 
and why they are buying and the fourth
part<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.570> real<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:33.180> real

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
part is and this is the real the real

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.380 
part is and this is the real the real
thing<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.410> separates<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.820> five<00:03:36.150> and

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
thing that separates the the five and

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.390 
thing that separates the the five and
ten<00:03:36.570> million<00:03:36.780> dollar<00:03:37.049> practices<00:03:37.769> from<00:03:38.220> the
