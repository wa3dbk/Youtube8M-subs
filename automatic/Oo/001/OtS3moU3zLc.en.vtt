the<00:03:32.840> money<00:03:33.020> may<00:03:37.420> trying<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.510> take<00:03:38.660> advantage

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
of the double points we build sits in

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
of the double points we build sits in
between<00:03:43.190> levels<00:03:45.310> it's<00:03:46.310> probably<00:03:46.610> best<00:03:46.910> to

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
between levels it's probably best to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.380 
between levels it's probably best to
wait<00:03:47.300> until<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:48.550> zombies<00:03:49.550> start<00:03:49.700> coming<00:03:50.180> to

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
wait until the zombies start coming to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.910 
wait until the zombies start coming to
pick<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.780> up<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.200> going<00:03:51.410> away<00:03:51.560> too<00:03:51.709> long

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
pick that up and going away too long

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.440 
pick that up and going away too long
because<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.090> have<00:03:53.300> seen<00:03:53.570> them<00:03:53.800> disappear<00:03:55.450> if

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
because I have seen them disappear if

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.240 
because I have seen them disappear if
there's<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.959> certain<00:03:57.320> time<00:03:57.650> limit<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:58.010> pick

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
there's a certain time limit to pick

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.400 
there's a certain time limit to pick
those<00:03:58.459> things<00:03:58.489> up<00:03:58.910> I<00:04:01.030> did<00:04:02.030> play<00:04:02.260> zombies<00:04:03.260> on

those things up I did play zombies on

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.790 
those things up I did play zombies on
world<00:04:03.650> of<00:04:03.800> war<00:04:04.780> didn't<00:04:05.780> play<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.930> lot<00:04:06.020> of<00:04:06.350> it<00:04:06.470> but

world of war didn't play a lot of it but

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.930 
world of war didn't play a lot of it but

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.390 
automatically so you see the hammer pick
it<00:05:04.820> up<00:05:05.289> it's<00:05:06.289> gonna<00:05:06.440> help<00:05:06.650> keep<00:05:06.889> the<00:05:07.009> zombies

so dark i wish i could find how to turn
the<00:05:13.440> power<00:05:13.620> on<00:05:13.770> it'd<00:05:14.010> be<00:05:14.160> so<00:05:14.310> much<00:05:14.370> easier<00:05:14.490> i

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
the power on it'd be so much easier i

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.160 
the power on it'd be so much easier i
could<00:05:15.690> actually<00:05:15.780> see<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.290> zombies<00:05:18.170> like

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170

there you must turn on power there's a
lot<00:05:21.510> of<00:05:21.630> stuff<00:05:21.930> he<00:05:22.020> could<00:05:22.170> turn<00:05:22.320> on<00:05:22.530> if<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:22.890> had

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
lot of stuff he could turn on if you had

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.210 
lot of stuff he could turn on if you had
power<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.700> i<00:05:24.240> found<00:05:24.480> a<00:05:24.600> fuse<00:05:24.960> box<00:05:25.230> but<00:05:25.590> it<00:05:25.800> was

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.460 
like all the wood burn out or something
I'm<00:05:28.620> trying<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.860> look<00:05:28.980> at<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.160> map<00:05:29.370> see<00:05:29.670> like

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
I'm trying to look at the map see like

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.130 
I'm trying to look at the map see like
where<00:05:31.470> is<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:32.280> fuse<00:05:33.090> box<00:05:33.300> that<00:05:33.720> I've<00:05:33.840> turned

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
where is the fuse box that I've turned

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:41.860 
where is the fuse box that I've turned
on<00:05:34.260> on<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.530> map<00:05:35.720> didn't<00:05:36.720> help<00:05:36.870> me<00:05:36.960> though

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.410 

guess<00:05:42.870> I'll<00:05:43.020> just<00:05:43.110> have<00:05:43.350> to<00:05:43.940> walk<00:05:44.940> around<00:05:45.000> the

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
guess I'll just have to walk around the

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.920 
guess I'll just have to walk around the
house<00:05:45.600> until<00:05:45.930> I<00:05:45.990> find<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:47.630> so<00:05:48.630> I'm<00:05:48.720> sure

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
house until I find it so I'm sure

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.540 
house until I find it so I'm sure
there's<00:05:49.140> certain<00:05:49.830> doors<00:05:50.040> that<00:05:50.280> you<00:05:50.340> should

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
there's certain doors that you should

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.160 
there's certain doors that you should
open<00:05:50.760> first<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.330> this<00:05:51.420> might<00:05:51.630> not<00:05:51.780> be<00:05:51.840> hit

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
open first and this might not be hit

00:05:52.170 --> 00:06:00.340 
open first and this might not be hit
since<00:05:53.480> there's<00:05:54.480> no<00:05:54.630> fuse<00:05:54.930> box<00:05:55.170> in<00:05:55.320> here<00:05:55.590> I

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.720 

should<00:06:01.350> have<00:06:01.470> been<00:06:01.590> rushed<00:06:01.950> in<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.160> game<00:06:02.430> over

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
should have been rushed in the game over

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:09.110 
should have been rushed in the game over
here<00:06:02.940> dude<00:06:03.450> get<00:06:03.600> a<00:06:03.690> mo<00:06:07.190> but<00:06:08.190> it<00:06:08.280> gets<00:06:08.310> hard<00:06:08.730> fast

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
here dude get a mo but it gets hard fast

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.970 
here dude get a mo but it gets hard fast
I<00:06:09.570> think<00:06:10.640> level<00:06:11.900> this<00:06:12.900> one<00:06:13.110> is<00:06:13.230> the<00:06:13.530> farthest<00:06:13.860> i

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
I think level this one is the farthest i

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.160 
I think level this one is the farthest i
got<00:06:14.190> so<00:06:14.370> far<00:06:14.610> which<00:06:15.000> is<00:06:15.150> round<00:06:15.870> six<00:06:18.140> mostly<00:06:19.140> I

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
got so far which is round six mostly I

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.510 
got so far which is round six mostly I
would<00:06:19.500> die<00:06:19.740> on<00:06:20.130> this<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:21.060> fifth<00:06:21.360> round

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.040 

probably<00:06:26.520> be<00:06:26.610> a<00:06:26.640> lot<00:06:26.760> easier<00:06:26.820> with<00:06:27.330> multiple

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
probably be a lot easier with multiple

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.420 
probably be a lot easier with multiple
people

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430
