00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
the face there is a bit of a problem

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.940 
the face there is a bit of a problem
with<00:04:36.060> this<00:04:36.240> figure<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.870> if<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.740> haven't

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
with this figure and if you haven't

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.840 
with this figure and if you haven't
noticed<00:04:38.370> already

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
noticed already

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.980 
noticed already
it's<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.780> stand<00:04:40.170> it's<00:04:41.040> really<00:04:41.850> really<00:04:42.780> big

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
it's the stand it's really really big

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.250 
it's the stand it's really really big
and<00:04:43.430> quite<00:04:44.430> horrible<00:04:44.880> there's<00:04:45.180> no<00:04:45.420> design<00:04:45.960> on

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
and quite horrible there's no design on

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.190 
and quite horrible there's no design on
it<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.650> it's<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:47.120> it's<00:04:48.120> like<00:04:48.210> it's<00:04:48.480> really

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
it and it's like it's like it's really

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.570 
it and it's like it's like it's really
like<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.500> stand<00:04:49.950> you<00:04:50.130> would<00:04:50.250> get<00:04:50.430> with<00:04:50.520> a

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
like a stand you would get with a

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.010 
like a stand you would get with a
bootleg<00:04:51.090> figure<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.660> it's<00:04:51.780> got<00:04:51.900> this<00:04:51.960> little

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
bootleg figure and it's got this little

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.120 
bootleg figure and it's got this little
lump<00:04:52.410> here<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:54.020> mean<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.290> would<00:04:55.440> be<00:04:55.470> much<00:04:55.860> better

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
lump here I mean it would be much better

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.940 
lump here I mean it would be much better
if<00:04:56.670> they<00:04:57.120> done<00:04:57.720> what<00:04:57.930> they<00:04:58.110> ask<00:04:58.320> on<00:04:58.560> Tuesdays

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
if they done what they ask on Tuesdays

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.510 
if they done what they ask on Tuesdays
and<00:04:59.490> had<00:04:59.700> the<00:04:59.850> pins<00:05:00.320> on<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.620> stand<00:05:01.980> rather

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
and had the pins on the stand rather

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.550 
and had the pins on the stand rather
than<00:05:02.730> on<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.090> feet<00:05:03.330> because<00:05:04.050> if<00:05:04.170> I<00:05:04.230> take<00:05:04.440> this

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
than on the feet because if I take this

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.110 
than on the feet because if I take this
off<00:05:04.770> I'll<00:05:05.520> show<00:05:05.760> you

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
off I'll show you

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.590 
off I'll show you
so<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.990> pins<00:05:07.260> are<00:05:07.470> on<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.740> feet<00:05:08.120> so<00:05:09.120> you<00:05:09.300> can't

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
so the pins are on the feet so you can't

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.980 
so the pins are on the feet so you can't
like<00:05:09.870> stand<00:05:10.470> him<00:05:10.620> up<00:05:11.330> if<00:05:12.330> your<00:05:12.480> pins<00:05:12.720> will

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
like stand him up if your pins will

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.170 
like stand him up if your pins will
understand<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:14.010> would<00:05:14.220> just<00:05:14.490> like<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:15.000> could

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
understand it would just like you could

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.790 
understand it would just like you could
be<00:05:15.300> it<00:05:15.360> we<00:05:15.750> understand<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.410> figure<00:05:16.680> out

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
be it we understand the figure out

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.409 
be it we understand the figure out
without<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.310> stand<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.850> it<00:05:17.940> was<00:05:18.060> just<00:05:18.240> little

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
without the stand and it was just little

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.159 
without the stand and it was just little
bit<00:05:18.600> much<00:05:18.840> better<00:05:20.510> I'll<00:05:21.510> just<00:05:21.780> show<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.020> a

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
bit much better I'll just show you a

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.040 
bit much better I'll just show you a
size<00:05:22.680> comparison<00:05:22.760> next<00:05:23.760> to<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.120> s<00:05:24.480> cultures

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
size comparison next to the s cultures

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.420 
size comparison next to the s cultures

figure<00:05:30.350> how<00:05:31.350> weird<00:05:31.979> is<00:05:32.220> that

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
figure how weird is that

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.240 
figure how weird is that
like<00:05:32.910> I<00:05:33.210> thought<00:05:34.110> this<00:05:34.500> would<00:05:34.710> be<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.919> biggest

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
like I thought this would be the biggest

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.409 
like I thought this would be the biggest
like<00:05:36.180> one<00:05:36.450> really<00:05:37.310> but<00:05:38.310> I<00:05:38.640> just<00:05:39.090> didn't<00:05:39.330> expect

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
like one really but I just didn't expect

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.490 
like one really but I just didn't expect
the<00:05:39.870> hqd<00:05:40.560> actor<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:40.950> be<00:05:41.070> this<00:05:41.250> big<00:05:41.550> um<00:05:42.500> The

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
the hqd actor to be this big um The

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.460 
the hqd actor to be this big um The
Stand<00:05:43.830> obviously<00:05:44.490> is<00:05:44.610> bigger<00:05:44.850> so<00:05:45.300> really<00:05:46.110> it's

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
Stand obviously is bigger so really it's

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.270 
Stand obviously is bigger so really it's
probably<00:05:47.340> about<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:48.150> same<00:05:48.360> size<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.890> HQ

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
probably about the same size and the HQ

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.780 
probably about the same size and the HQ
DX<00:05:50.550> figure<00:05:50.910> is<00:05:51.140> like<00:05:52.140> a<00:05:52.350> thicker<00:05:53.690> you<00:05:54.690> can<00:05:54.750> see

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
DX figure is like a thicker you can see

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.330 
DX figure is like a thicker you can see
yeah<00:05:56.790> obviously<00:05:57.140> this<00:05:58.140> has<00:05:58.380> much<00:05:58.620> more<00:05:58.830> detail

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
yeah obviously this has much more detail

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.560 
yeah obviously this has much more detail
but<00:06:00.020> it<00:06:01.020> doesn't<00:06:01.410> really<00:06:02.400> look<00:06:02.910> a<00:06:03.180> lot<00:06:03.419> like

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
but it doesn't really look a lot like

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.860 
but it doesn't really look a lot like
the<00:06:03.720> anime<00:06:04.110> well<00:06:04.350> it<00:06:04.530> does<00:06:04.740> but<00:06:05.490> it's<00:06:06.150> like<00:06:06.660> it

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
the anime well it does but it's like it

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.990 
the anime well it does but it's like it
doesn't<00:06:07.050> like<00:06:07.560> look<00:06:07.919> much<00:06:08.340> like<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:08.669> anime

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
doesn't like look much like the anime

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.330 
doesn't like look much like the anime
because<00:06:09.419> the<00:06:09.810> colors<00:06:10.169> this<00:06:10.890> if<00:06:11.220> you're

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
because the colors this if you're

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.280 
because the colors this if you're
looking<00:06:11.460> for<00:06:11.880> a<00:06:11.940> figure<00:06:12.270> which<00:06:12.510> looks<00:06:12.780> a<00:06:12.960> lot

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
looking for a figure which looks a lot

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.890 
looking for a figure which looks a lot
like<00:06:13.500> the<00:06:13.680> anime<00:06:14.040> then<00:06:14.430> it's<00:06:14.760> this<00:06:15.060> one<00:06:15.330> if

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
like the anime then it's this one if

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.719 
like the anime then it's this one if
you're<00:06:16.080> looking<00:06:16.380> one<00:06:16.560> for<00:06:16.770> detail<00:06:17.190> then<00:06:17.550> it's

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
you're looking one for detail then it's

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.840 
you're looking one for detail then it's
this<00:06:17.940> on<00:06:18.180> really<00:06:18.570> I<00:06:19.530> have<00:06:20.190> got<00:06:20.340> a<00:06:20.370> review<00:06:20.700> of

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
this on really I have got a review of

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.370 
this on really I have got a review of
this<00:06:21.000> if<00:06:21.210> you<00:06:21.330> want<00:06:21.479> to<00:06:21.570> see<00:06:21.750> it<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:22.020> I'll<00:06:22.080> put

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
this if you want to see it and I'll put

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.790 
this if you want to see it and I'll put
annotation<00:06:23.100> here<00:06:23.960> so<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:25.230> do<00:06:25.290> recommend<00:06:25.680> this<00:06:26.250> I

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
annotation here so I do recommend this I

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.880 
annotation here so I do recommend this I
feel<00:06:28.800> like<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:30.120> non<00:06:30.690> clear<00:06:31.080> version<00:06:31.380> would

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
feel like the non clear version would

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.010 
feel like the non clear version would
probably<00:06:32.310> look<00:06:32.550> better<00:06:32.760> I<00:06:33.210> don't<00:06:33.570> I<00:06:33.840> don't

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
probably look better I don't I don't

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.100 
probably look better I don't I don't
personally<00:06:34.950> particularly<00:06:35.670> like<00:06:35.910> how<00:06:36.660> this<00:06:37.050> is

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
personally particularly like how this is

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.640 
personally particularly like how this is
quite<00:06:37.590> see-through<00:06:38.220> or<00:06:38.550> the<00:06:38.790> shirt<00:06:39.650> because

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
quite see-through or the shirt because
