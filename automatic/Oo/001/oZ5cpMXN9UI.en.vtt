00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.559
 About this in the meantime 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.570
 The other day I think I want to see it 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:11.930
 Do I have vital capacity 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.850
 Toka I base that will up 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:20.880
 That there is no vital capacity, so the quality will go down 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.270
 If you say quite from customers 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.300
 In the wind 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.900
 Kedomo I think that the have been told the pitch and the real of Ocarina of Tteyuu pitch of Western musical instruments 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.940
 Is 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.350
 What will be the sun 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.280
 In fact, it is right here some people who do not know much 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.360
 As I went on the other day the piano 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.840
 Even if you hit the door hard, the piano will make any sound 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.180
 But if you get strong with money 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 The pitch is 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.510
 go up 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.150
 If it blows weakly, it will rise and fall 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.530
 So say I Ocarina 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.800
 It is not so if it is a bad instrument 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.710
 Western musical instruments with the concept of pitch 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:13.840
 Interpret it as if it were something different 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:19.229
 It has good Kicha' definitely if it is possible to catch the pitch 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.229
 For example, c here I think I'll blow this bird normally 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.730
 I think that it is secreted Chi as it was 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.730
 However get off well 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 how is it 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.530
 Whether this will be music or not 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:53.930
 Going up probably edition Ogura I have a pretty pitcher 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.670
 So this is a sea pipe so I can get it in between 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.980
 I mean that 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.590
 Such a thing is I'm actually not be there for me Western Statement 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.490
 How strong you are 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.280
 Even if you play strongly with a violin, it does not rise 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.990
 However 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.350
 Ocarina has its width 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.740
 So the difference escape useless instrument 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:23.460
 Please change the concept of the pitch 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:26.360
 So please keep a bit down for those who want to be strong 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.050
 It is the one who will go down the base because it is weak 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.570
 Please give me a star in front 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:38.990
 And please come to our store to achieve it if you have a certain commitment 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.310
 I always have my own 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.610
 I think there is something 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.470
 In the other day I received an email by Mr. Kada 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.640
 Say Toka Please play between the cat by these 4 c 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.010
 Own 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.010
 Chlorine method or your own 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.380
 Do you think how to put on a song I have never learned to my teacher 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.390
 You told me that 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.480
 That's right 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.200
 Do you know what it is 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.290
 I 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.350
 Because it is a craftsman who is making this 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.890
 Hmm 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.560
 This 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.330
 From year 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.230
 I understand because I'm making it 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.370
 We teachers are not made from is no reason that can be seen year 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.239
 So 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.300
 Teachers are music plans 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.590
 In me 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:40.130
 A pro for how much this instrument sounds like 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.620
 So I put that together 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:50.500
 For example of the teacher's trio 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:55.450
 If you line up the technique or if you have 8 machines Shonan or something like that to the teachers 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.530
 This is not something that suits me, of course I have a backyard like that 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.770
 Because it is 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:05.670
 So please do a good fusion 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.670
 I was issued a There you'll only response is correct not the eyes of 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:15.390
 Please listen to me because this is my behavior too 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.410
 That's it for now, in fact 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.840
 a 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:26.780
 Kedomo has taken a feel buy really simple it is now 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:32.810
 We will try to provide you with a little dvd and money or content 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.820
 So I thought to Fu say'll watch also by all means if you have all means the opportunity 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.860
 I'm thinking 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:45.200
 Don't worry about the pitch 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:48.260
 What or the Iiii music be staring and this also but you have this kind of tuner 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.280
 The pitch is a guide only 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.280
 Then it was Hiramoto
