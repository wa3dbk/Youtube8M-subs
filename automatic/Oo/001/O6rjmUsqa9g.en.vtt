00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
actually Pilates tip but I've had a

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.350 
actually Pilates tip but I've had a
couple<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.619> requests<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:23.400> some<00:00:23.820> additional

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
couple of requests for some additional

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.570 
couple of requests for some additional
exercises<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.830> things<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.490> don't

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
exercises for things that we don't

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.670 
exercises for things that we don't
normally<00:00:27.029> work<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.570> somebody<00:00:28.110> requested

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
normally work and somebody requested

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.010 
normally work and somebody requested
some<00:00:28.860> hand<00:00:29.189> exercises<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:30.810> hand

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
some hand exercises and I think hand

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.780 
some hand exercises and I think hand
exercises<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.739> really<00:00:31.770> a<00:00:32.099> great<00:00:32.489> thing

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
exercises are really a great thing

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.030 
exercises are really a great thing
because<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.239> don't<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> lot<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.440> our<00:00:34.470> hands

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
because we don't do a lot with our hands

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.970 
because we don't do a lot with our hands
other<00:00:35.489> than<00:00:35.610> claw<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.720> shut<00:00:37.050> or<00:00:37.320> type<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.860> our

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
other than claw them shut or type on our

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.800 
other than claw them shut or type on our
keyboards<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.450> do<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> lot<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
keyboards but we don't do a lot of

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.020 
keyboards but we don't do a lot of
things<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.200> actually<00:00:40.680> stretch<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.310> help<00:00:41.489> open

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
hands quite as much as much as I think

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
hands quite as much as much as I think
about<00:00:58.920> my<00:00:59.160> toes<00:00:59.490> our<00:00:59.970> hands<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.360> our<00:01:00.450> feet

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
about my toes our hands on our feet

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.570 
about my toes our hands on our feet
should<00:01:00.810> do<00:01:00.990> very<00:01:01.440> similar<00:01:01.770> things<00:01:01.950> with<00:01:02.400> the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
should do very similar things with the

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.399 
should do very similar things with the
with<00:01:03.060> the<00:01:03.240> option<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:03.930> thumb<00:01:04.140> has<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
with the option of the thumb has a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.190 
with the option of the thumb has a
little<00:01:04.680> bit<00:01:04.799> more<00:01:04.949> more<00:01:05.729> movement<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
little bit more more movement but you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.630 
little bit more more movement but you
should<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.530> able<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> spread<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.340> fingers

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
should be able to spread your fingers

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.310 
should be able to spread your fingers
wide<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.909> bring<00:01:09.479> them<00:01:09.570> together<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.200> get

wide and bring them together and get

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
wide and bring them together and get
your<00:01:10.500> hands<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.920> move<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.369> lot<00:01:11.579> so<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.030> opening

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
your hands to move a lot so just opening

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.780

possible focusing on the opening part

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.160 
possible focusing on the opening part
more<00:01:18.090> than<00:01:18.149> the<00:01:18.390> closing<00:01:18.749> part<00:01:18.899> because<00:01:19.049> we

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
more than the closing part because we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.779 
more than the closing part because we
know<00:01:19.289> they'll<00:01:19.469> close<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.159> opening

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
the hands away helps to stretch out the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.270 
the hands away helps to stretch out the
muscles<00:01:48.389> underneath<00:01:48.810> those<00:01:49.109> fingers<00:01:49.679> where
