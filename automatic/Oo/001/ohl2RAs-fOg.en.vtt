00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.270
 hello everyone my name is gamer fox and 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.789
 this is the third episode of my guide 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.700
 ice weapons 4 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:33.980
 this time we will cover the assault rifle 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.250
 legendary in the halo universe has 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.810
 appeared in all except halo 2 and 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.560
 is the main weapon determined work 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.560
 of the game 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.489
 at stake the assault rifle is a rifle 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.820
 of very low power you will need for 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.760
 at least 22 shots to kill or 20 to 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.590
 the head is under power per shot 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.280
 do something that harms us too much 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.280
 in battle 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.930
 so we can see the fort of 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.540
 Assault rifle is not the damage therefore 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.770
 the penetration that this has is also 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.770
 very very low 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.420
 is in the firing rate where the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.280
 Assault rifle stands out from the others 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.210
 is the fastest human rifle in your 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.100
 shots with 375 shots per minute or 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.340
 if we have skill that makes us 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.909
 much more agile we will have the monstrous 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.710
 amount of 400 shots per minute is 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.039
 almost as fast as the rifle 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.869
 storm or the suppressor the cadence of 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.310
 Fire is definitely the most 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.310
 strong assault rifle 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.539
 as for the rich and this is very low 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.270
 because it could be used in combats to 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.670
 a long distance unfortunately the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.590
 low damage that the assault rifle has 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.280
 makes this type of combat be 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.079
 practically impossible to perform 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.270
 other small features with the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.360
 that counts the assault rifle is that it is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.380
 pretty easy to handle as almost 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.380
 any other main weapon 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.890
 as for the capacity of cartridges not 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.350
 they're not bad with 32 bullets per charger 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.070
 also has a rapid transition 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.200
 between them with 1.5 seconds or it is counted 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.860
 with dexterity only point two seconds 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.050
 for an effective recharge although with the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.360
 great rate of rifle fire you 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.510
 you will find constantly recharging 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.640
 luckily these frequent refills do not 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.410
 they should affect too much since they are 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.390
 pretty fast as we can see 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.460
 previously in the tables 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.740
 our equipment will not be very 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.270
 complicated as we observed by the 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.280
 characteristics of the assault rifle 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.530
 we must be a short distance away 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.110
 of our enemy and attack him 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.120
 quickly this equipment must 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.880
 turn our assault rifle into a 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.480
 bullet hose and make a support to the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.640
 aggressive style that this one has in the first 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.310
 place we will choose firepower 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.160
 as a tactical package that will serve us 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.660
 to have two main weapons 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.030
 substituting the secondary weapon for a 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.720
 main in this space 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.810
 we will choose the br ie the rifle 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.640
 battle this rifle from medium to long 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.340
 distance will give us the opportunity to 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.800
 cover absolutely all types of 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.840
 Game combat the medium and long short 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.670
 and thanks to this new advantage 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.670
 we will dominate the battlefield 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.970
 later we will have to choose how 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.680
 grenades the plasma grenades created 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.300
 for the ruler as we said 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.489
 previously we must be about 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.790
 combat warriors and with these 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.430
 grenades cars ships robots all 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.010
 type of vehicle will be annihilated very 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.010
 easily by us 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.660
 but to destroy the vehicles 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.849
 we need an armor skill 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.519
 to give us the complete vision in 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.340
 the whole battlefield for it 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.989
 we will use the rocket backpack again 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.180
 with it we can surprise both 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.950
 our enemies that walk on foot as 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.980
 those who have a vehicle 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.139
 last but not least 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.290
 our support improvement in this last 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.940
 space we will use dexterity so that 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.740
 that our refills and the change of 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.740
 soul be much faster and agile 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.000
 in short the assault rifle is 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.570
 fairly quick and very simple 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.750
 handle efficiently but the damage of 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.490
 Assault rifle will affect you a lot if 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.370
 is that you do not have much experience in 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.830
 battlefield 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.690
 in addition frequent refills also 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.910
 there has been a problem you will have to be 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.820
 undercover protected several times if it is 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.490
 you do not want to die while you reload 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.070
 he was frequently vulnerable 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.350
 to a long distance range the bass 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.510
 damage and the low distance at which the 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.960
 Assault rifle will operate 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.600
 conspiring against you yet 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.820
 these advantages can be invaded and 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.520
 be so you reap the rewards 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.880
 of the fast and furious performance of 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.210
 assault rifle in close combat 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.720
 this evolved arthropod skimps 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.770
 poison at its exit a fearsome harpoon to 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.840
 point to attack 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.050
 an enemy so foolish as to 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.569
 provoke it 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.569
 will feel the sting of this weapon
