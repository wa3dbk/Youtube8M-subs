00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.630
 hello love sunshine friends too 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.090
 a very normal Saturday 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.550
 Welcome to this new oversize 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.439
 oh yes that 's about format what everyone 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.550
 about formats about yes but the video 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.989
 come on Saturday reason is that 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.320
 normal saturday of the format of 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.029
 normal Saturday exactly that is loose 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.340
 this is for digital he is on or is 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.750
 hindu that felix but not and we are 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.910
 together at the melt festival and have 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.440
 we think we'll take you with us 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.059
 because that's where music is played 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.710
 Among other things, we are about to go right now 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.840
 Pictures still book very many 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.789
 other things and as far as we are in 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.929
 we take our opportunities to see 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.039
 Just take it with you now 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.320
 you might wonder why ours 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.940
 Hands around like this on the here 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.050
 Rossel crew nails the meetings idea that 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.489
 because of many weeks nail 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.780
 the man was just that I am surprised 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.610
 that's why he has sparkle like everyone else 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.050
 they do not like it but they would 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.090
 have really good in the shuttle to 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.850
 festival area has become season 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.240
 Welcome to Iron Town Diamond and Man 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.240
 listen already 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.549
 May 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.210
 that's the way it goes and here we come to 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.330
 our short 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.090
 concert 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.140
 It consists of three points the first 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.290
 sound is the second is performance and 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:53.330
 interest registry or the album 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.520
 the sound comes out longer 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.960
 pretty much everything is arranged in a contemporary way 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.760
 just does far was the one 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.260
 little show on moderate but totally good 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.690
 in this picture 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.310
 Incidentally, that comes by the way or 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.780
 People are good in performance over the guys 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.720
 have a really cool on the synonymous 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.050
 very extroverted very stage 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.050
 extravagant 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.840
 since I have the name 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.090
 the two persons 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.810
 effect on the stage and in the box 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.550
 surprised 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.670
 the so much of this 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.720
 with four-wheel over a difficult time 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.220
 we have 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.810
 concert can watch 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.130
 Unfortunately start because missed that is 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.510
 we have the bangle machines 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.340
 of course, the passers-by is completely 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.170
 wonderfully no idea but what 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.560
 In any case, can the need of the dumpling 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.690
 I have 3 3 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.760
 there is the goose bumps even from the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.470
 booking it even better than the old ones 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.430
 version 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.430
 neither book 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.380
 a recommendation now that 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.600
 festival area and we give ourselves then 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.020
 to the next 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.020
 Ceysens 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.040
 why politics over that was in ried sag 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.319
 I like thee times the sound is beautiful 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.140
 Brand happens behaved 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.180
 multi-faceted so gave somehow in part 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.790
 even so saltier also that is now clear 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.890
 The corporate management would be one 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.349
 transfer home give birth to last 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.030
 moderate stuff so then again totally tech 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.730
 Home said it is of course a dj set 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.209
 First, it is not to post for 1 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.859
 a mistake before with metal but experienced 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.109
 then simply attractive team on the 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.939
 checklist anja and 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.720
 on the visuals while looking at the 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.930
 super really nice so they were quite whole 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.790
 to detail 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.620
 that has a tale of getting ready 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.280
 are as i said in the im 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.689
 anger beautiful development but not 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.260
 can forgive who deal with the lot 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:16.030
 own way that was really nice 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.349
 We were all very sad and 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.380
 again we do not ask now 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:22.220
 go to it 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.220
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.460
 completely relaxed 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.070
 boah that was over faster than now 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.200
 thought was very cool anyway 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.290
 very very classic all over 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.400
 and a specialist in the pictures around 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.400
 are young mozart 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.949
 We just wanted to be at the very beginning 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.780
 replace it with fun and how it works 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.920
 at the beginning to you so far so once 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.080
 said 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.490
 Filmmusik you could also scary 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.430
 great if you enjoy the eye to 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.230
 waiting 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.240
 or also generally the field or the 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.000
 Point performance of the Jeep had one 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.130
 Giant construction at the height and was the 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.230
 you have to go all the way alone 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.930
 run between the individual 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.250
 almost surreal what would have mixed nicely 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.639
 they had a lot of fun just too 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.639
 listen 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:40.030
 louis over and I think now 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.770
 already hard criticism in hage yes I have 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.840
 I just wished a bit 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.520
 would have done after office 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.419
 Let's look at our structural 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.419
 score at the 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.520
 that there were difficulties start here 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.320
 Pretty japan does not belong to him yet 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.870
 further, I found 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.470
 the sound somehow not so balanced 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.760
 which also can live on the samples 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.100
 the stop now, for example, the mac 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.529
 before that and at mclaren we noticed 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.840
 good at the beginning 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.080
 everyone moved in 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.080
 apa 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.310
 it will still happen 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.650
 the Englishman has run dead this 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.320
 Of course, there was no dj set here 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.420
 but he be 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.220
 You also have to play whole songs 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.990
 but that's the case with his new single 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.980
 I caught it directly 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.660
 feeling 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.780
 Congratulations for making it 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.190
 to play back 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.560
 and me to play your new single goal 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.889
 I already stopped and the 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.010
 other people noticed 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:44.250
 many are waiting 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.250
 also with me 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:58.310
 performance was peppered by these 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:59.870
 hilarious is even right the 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:06.919
 music has become quieter when he does that 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:10.340
 but then I just want that 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:12.920
 Heard to bring along to be animated 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:18.920
 so yes 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:20.780
 only 98 percent supper say yes 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.220
 All the others were ex 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.280
 actually so horny 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.650
 so that he can say goodbye and with it 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.930
 we go for today we go now it is 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.330
 already half past three even 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.620
 later we are already at 4 o'clock 24 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.939
 In any case, all good things are 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.939
 four times 34
