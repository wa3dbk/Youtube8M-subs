00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.570
 Well, we are already in the month of February 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.459
 so I 'm going to talk about my favorites 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.200
 of the month of January are products that 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.000
 used throughout the month very much 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.320
 and that I think it's worth talking to you 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.850
 of them first of all I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.800
 of the makeup base that I've been 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.110
 using practically the whole month is the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.420
 date in mac body is a base that I 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.030
 I really like the finish 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.980
 leaves a very fresh look naturally is 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.629
 You can modulate if you want more coverage 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.280
 in some areas you can apply several 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.930
 layer one of the things that I like 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.940
 a lot of this base is that it does not dry up 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.370
 the skin that now in winter I have 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.140
 quite dry and others that lasts all 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.300
 the day I always apply it with this 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.100
 sigma gap which is the time 80 flag 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.839
 kabuki so if you have not tried it 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.579
 I never encourage you to try it because it goes 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.589
 phenomenal my next favorites are 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.989
 the celestials that came when they are 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.019
 these powders are illuminating and I 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.729
 they really like it has a texture 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.499
 incredibly creamy as you apply 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.079
 can be modulated to get a 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:04.970
 more subtle or more marked effect I think 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.740
 is the perfect illuminated to finish 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.810
 a look and I've been using it for 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.220
 all month very much I like it because I do not 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.750
 has glitter has a finish 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.870
 satin between 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.640
 Pearly champagne peach I think with 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.920
 the skin type combines very well and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.780
 it just gives me a good look 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.120
 face that I like very much next is 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.490
 a product of a ss ss bit that is a 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.190
 little of this fast broth when I 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.170
 I bought you what I teach a hall and opinions 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.210
 quite varied some stockings that well 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.100
 goes very well and other measures that we 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.530
 I liked it so much because when you put it 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.630
 on top of your enamel 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.060
 it's as if provoking a reaction and what 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.490
 will lift like strips and I can 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.830
 say that I've tried it with many 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.330
 nail polish and still has not 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.280
 after that, so after a few days 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.320
 some jose gets me up a little but that 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.090
 It always happens to me that you have noticed that 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.250
 go provoke me then I'm 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.750
 happy with him because for me he meets the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.750
 Basic function that is fast drying 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.340
 I am very patient so that the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.990
 enamel itself did not always finish me 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.520
 throwing the nail I read that it is not 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.710
 compatible with all glazes that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.140
 there is one that provokes a reaction and 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.729
 spoils all the enamel but you 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.520
 I can say that I change the color of 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.050
 nails quite frequently and good of 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.960
 all that used yet 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.490
 it has happened to me that it has given reaction if 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.260
 I passed it and I will tell you that of 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.350
 attention I think I've tried different 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.850
 brands and at the moment nothing so that the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.610
 minute I still use it right now 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.350
 I have put and it gives enough brightness when 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.080
 what you apply gives a lot of shine then when 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.030
 it dries does not stay so bright but 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.620
 still it gives enough I think so 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.570
 It makes the enamel last longer to me 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.790
 the only thing that lasted for many days 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.410
 it has a very strong smell so 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.970
 better that 's something that we like to me 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.860
 like the smell but that 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.540
 you do not like it so that's something 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.550
 to keep in mind and I'm crazy about 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.890
 fragrances of body perfumes 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.930
 sprays and this month I have been using 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.360
 very many three victories and I think that it 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.910
 flame psuv tentation between floral and 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.670
 fruity itself is a sweet smell but not 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.740
 only the burden to be very different then 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.480
 does not have does not have that intensity that 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.180
 I can have a perfume and I like it 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.520
 very much I was using it all month and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.610
 as it is a fairly large jar for 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.980
 I still have a lot to come 250 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.350
 milliliters so if you do not know the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.060
 guests of victories 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.580
 I highly recommend you that they have 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.100
 a huge range both in the bodies pres 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.350
 like butter or creams 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.330
 bodily I like a my last 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.280
 favorite of this month is a mask 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.350
 of which you already know are masks 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.850
 cool it's called the secret show me the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.400
 I bought here in England in Spain 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.170
 it is called the sacred truth and it is a 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.510
 moisturizing mask contains in 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.190
 screen that helps eliminate the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.870
 society and then it contains a lot of 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.330
 ingredients that are very moisturizing 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.850
 like a shea butter oil 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.920
 lavender coconut oil of roses and the 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.260
 egg so they are ingredients that in 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.900
 general besides purifying hydrate 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.450
 a lot and he's been using all the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.340
 month in fact the just finished more or 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.720
 less once a week you know that 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.040
 the masks of fresh lasts 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.140
 about a month is a mask 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.910
 I recommend it for normal skin with 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.590
 tendency to dry that is how I have it 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.300
