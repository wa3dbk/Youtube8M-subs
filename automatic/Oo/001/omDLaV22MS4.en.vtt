00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
for this figure it's just was just

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.000 
for this figure it's just was just
tremendous<00:02:03.370> during<00:02:03.850> its<00:02:04.000> day<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.870> it<00:02:05.830> was

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
tremendous during its day that it was

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.890 
tremendous during its day that it was
really<00:02:06.220> quite<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.520> breakthrough<00:02:06.820> from<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.540> a

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
really quite a breakthrough from the a

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.580 
really quite a breakthrough from the a
lot<00:02:08.350> of<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.560> g1<00:02:09.660> figures<00:02:10.660> back<00:02:11.020> then

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
lot of the g1 figures back then

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.710 
lot of the g1 figures back then
I<00:02:11.620> mean<00:02:12.130> I'm<00:02:12.250> compared<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> g1<00:02:13.420> figures

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
I mean I'm compared to the g1 figures

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.110 
I mean I'm compared to the g1 figures
back<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.140> eighties<00:02:14.440> these<00:02:14.940> figures<00:02:15.940> were

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
back in the eighties these figures were

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.910 
back in the eighties these figures were
really<00:02:16.390> such<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.600> breakthrough<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:20.050> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
really such a breakthrough but the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.520 
really such a breakthrough but the
advent<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.550> movie<00:02:22.210> figures<00:02:22.540> with<00:02:23.500> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
was just taken transformers to a whole

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.570 
was just taken transformers to a whole
new<00:02:27.910> level<00:02:28.120> same<00:02:29.020> thing<00:02:29.230> with<00:02:29.380> this<00:02:29.500> guy<00:02:30.690> -<00:02:31.690> our

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
new level same thing with this guy - our

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.760 
new level same thing with this guy - our
paints<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.670> each<00:02:33.790> other<00:02:34.030> not<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.230> best<00:02:35.470> but

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
paints of each other not the best but

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.950

mode<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.370> would<00:02:36.850> still<00:02:37.120> think<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.780> Power

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960

Shovel bot mode is still the best among

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.230 
Shovel bot mode is still the best among
all<00:02:42.210> this<00:02:43.210> guy<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:44.200> an<00:02:44.440> isometric<00:02:44.970> robot<00:02:45.970> mode

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
all this guy is an isometric robot mode

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.060 
all this guy is an isometric robot mode
it's<00:02:46.900> just<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.200> huge<00:02:47.680> arm<00:02:49.140> quite<00:02:50.140> perhaps<00:02:50.830> a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
it's just a huge arm quite perhaps a

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.490 
it's just a huge arm quite perhaps a
predecessor<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:52.300> some<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.080> Revenge<00:02:53.410> of

predecessor of some of the Revenge of
the<00:02:53.560> Fallen

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
the Fallen

the Fallen
figures<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.660> characters<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.290> arm<00:02:56.860> is<00:02:57.220> just

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
figures and characters the arm is just

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.740 
figures and characters the arm is just
sculpted<00:02:57.880> inside<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:58.540> particular<00:02:58.810> piece

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
sculpted inside this particular piece

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.240 
sculpted inside this particular piece
yeah<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.670> vehicle<00:03:04.120> modes<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.680> pieces

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
yeah as for the vehicle modes the pieces

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.250 
yeah as for the vehicle modes the pieces
are<00:03:06.370> pretty<00:03:06.610> compact<00:03:07.150> what's<00:03:07.810> nice<00:03:08.020> by<00:03:08.230> the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
are pretty compact what's nice by the

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.949 
are pretty compact what's nice by the
way<00:03:08.410> it's<00:03:09.100> just<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.400> Energon<00:03:09.820> weapons<00:03:10.270> are

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
way it's just the Energon weapons are

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.320 
way it's just the Energon weapons are
incorporated<00:03:11.890> in<00:03:12.010> both<00:03:12.190> modes<00:03:12.520> as<00:03:12.820> weapons

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
incorporated in both modes as weapons

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.410 
incorporated in both modes as weapons
for<00:03:14.040> bot<00:03:15.040> mode<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.610> as<00:03:16.260> accessories<00:03:17.260> for

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
for bot mode and as accessories for

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.180 
for bot mode and as accessories for
vehicle<00:03:19.420> mode<00:03:19.570> they<00:03:20.290> will<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.709> turn<00:03:20.950> become

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
vehicle mode they will in turn become

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.660 
vehicle mode they will in turn become
the<00:03:22.080> limbs<00:03:23.080> or<00:03:23.440> hands<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.310> feet<00:03:24.489> of

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
the limbs or hands and feet of

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.590 
the limbs or hands and feet of
Devastator

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
Devastator

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.229 
Devastator
so<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.830> one<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.040> think<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.489> still<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.820> best<00:03:28.030> of

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
so this one I think is still the best of

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.300 
so this one I think is still the best of
the<00:03:28.390> alt<00:03:28.540> modes<00:03:28.840> three<00:03:29.500> odd<00:03:29.800> modes

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
the alt modes three odd modes

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
the alt modes three odd modes
very<00:03:30.940> compact<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:33.519> thing<00:03:33.760> keeps<00:03:33.970> popping

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
very compact this thing keeps popping

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.420 
very compact this thing keeps popping
off<00:03:34.450> because<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:34.989> just<00:03:35.200> it's<00:03:35.950> just<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.220> peg

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
off because it's just it's just a peg

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.420 
off because it's just it's just a peg
hole<00:03:36.640> inner<00:03:36.940> grows<00:03:37.660> very<00:03:37.989> well<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.680> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
hole inner grows very well and the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.240 
hole inner grows very well and the
shovel<00:03:39.850> moves<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.560> it's<00:03:41.560> pretty<00:03:41.860> it's<00:03:42.160> pretty

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
shovel moves so it's pretty it's pretty

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.650 
shovel moves so it's pretty it's pretty
well<00:03:42.610> made

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
well made

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.680 
well made
well<00:03:44.200> design<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:45.670> can<00:03:45.820> even<00:03:45.970> display<00:03:46.270> it<00:03:46.540> and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
well design you can even display it and

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.750 
well design you can even display it and
be<00:03:46.810> good<00:03:47.080> if<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.440> want<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.680> this<00:03:48.340> one<00:03:48.520> on<00:03:48.640> the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
be good if you want to this one on the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.690 
be good if you want to this one on the
other<00:03:48.880> hand<00:03:49.590> looks<00:03:50.590> good<00:03:50.800> on<00:03:50.830> certain<00:03:51.310> angles

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
other hand looks good on certain angles

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.230 
other hand looks good on certain angles
it<00:03:51.760> has<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.940> working<00:03:52.180> crane<00:03:52.720> which<00:03:53.650> extends<00:03:54.240> the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
it has a working crane which extends the

it has a working crane which extends the
in<00:03:55.780> boss<00:03:56.020> mode<00:03:56.050> this<00:03:56.560> will<00:03:56.740> extend<00:03:57.070> this<00:03:57.460> will

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
in boss mode this will extend this will

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.700 
in boss mode this will extend this will
act<00:03:57.880> as<00:03:58.000> an<00:03:58.120> extendable<00:03:58.510> arm<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:59.170> can<00:03:59.290> lock<00:03:59.530> it

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
act as an extendable arm you can lock it

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.910 
act as an extendable arm you can lock it
in<00:03:59.800> place<00:03:59.920> right<00:04:00.160> here<00:04:01.500> there<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.680> this

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
in place right here there is this

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.270 
in place right here there is this
visible<00:04:03.280> head<00:04:03.490> syndrome<00:04:03.820> for<00:04:04.780> both<00:04:05.280> figures

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
visible head syndrome for both figures

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.980 
visible head syndrome for both figures
can<00:04:07.030> see<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.300> head<00:04:07.450> right<00:04:07.690> there

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
can see the head right there

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.930 
can see the head right there
you<00:04:08.620> know<00:04:08.770> much<00:04:08.980> you<00:04:09.130> can<00:04:09.310> do<00:04:09.460> you<00:04:09.640> can<00:04:09.760> rotate

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
you know much you can do you can rotate

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.270 
you know much you can do you can rotate
it<00:04:10.210> but<00:04:10.600> on<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.080> side<00:04:11.290> you'll<00:04:11.530> still<00:04:11.770> see<00:04:12.010> part

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
it but on the side you'll still see part

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.030 
it but on the side you'll still see part
of<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.460> face<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.620> that's<00:04:14.620> that's<00:04:14.830> probably

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
of the face so that's that's probably

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.290 
of the face so that's that's probably
the<00:04:15.310> only<00:04:15.520> drawback<00:04:16.120> with<00:04:16.330> this<00:04:18.000> it's<00:04:19.000> it's

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.300 
the only drawback with this it's it's

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:26.730 
the only drawback with this it's it's
fine<00:04:19.600> holds<00:04:20.050> very<00:04:20.260> well<00:04:22.890> side<00:04:24.690> now<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.960> talk

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
fine holds very well side now and talk

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.740 
fine holds very well side now and talk
about<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.130> main<00:04:27.310> body<00:04:27.610> this<00:04:28.030> one<00:04:28.270> is<00:04:28.390> a<00:04:28.420> deluxe

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
about the main body this one is a deluxe

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.270 
about the main body this one is a deluxe
class<00:04:29.190> steam<00:04:30.190> hammer<00:04:30.400> or<00:04:30.700> scavenger<00:04:31.980> not<00:04:32.980> the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
class steam hammer or scavenger not the

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.080 
class steam hammer or scavenger not the
best<00:04:33.550> this<00:04:34.210> is<00:04:34.420> probably<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.870> worst<00:04:36.090> although

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
best this is probably the worst although

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.210 
best this is probably the worst although
because<00:04:37.330> it's<00:04:37.600> not<00:04:37.980> too<00:04:38.980> compact<00:04:40.980> it's<00:04:41.980> like

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
because it's not too compact it's like

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.010 
because it's not too compact it's like
the<00:04:42.370> transformation<00:04:42.760> has<00:04:43.180> been<00:04:43.330> forced<00:04:43.630> upon

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
the transformation has been forced upon

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.280 
the transformation has been forced upon
it<00:04:44.230> but<00:04:44.500> I<00:04:44.530> think<00:04:44.890> it<00:04:45.190> was<00:04:45.460> necessary<00:04:46.000> because

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
it but I think it was necessary because

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.800 
it but I think it was necessary because
they<00:04:47.290> had<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.710> he<00:04:48.100> had<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.490> well<00:04:49.480> they<00:04:49.660> had<00:04:49.780> to

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
they had to he had to well they had to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.390 
they had to he had to well they had to
spend<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.350> lot<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.500> time<00:04:50.710> engineering<00:04:51.220> how<00:04:51.340> he

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
spend a lot of time engineering how he

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.420 
spend a lot of time engineering how he
would<00:04:51.640> form<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.030> body<00:04:52.240> so<00:04:53.430> equally

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
would form the body so equally

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.940 
would form the body so equally
forgivable<00:04:55.120> I<00:04:55.320> thought<00:04:56.320> he<00:04:56.500> does<00:04:56.710> have<00:04:56.920> a

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
forgivable I thought he does have a

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.830 
forgivable I thought he does have a
working<00:04:57.430> shovel<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.450> you<00:04:58.630> know<00:04:59.230> with<00:04:59.620> a

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
working shovel and you know with a

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.230 
working shovel and you know with a
dumping<00:05:01.840> mechanism<00:05:02.440> right<00:05:02.560> there<00:05:02.830> it's<00:05:06.240> okay

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
dumping mechanism right there it's okay

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.930 
dumping mechanism right there it's okay
to<00:05:08.020> transform<00:05:08.560> this<00:05:08.710> guy<00:05:08.890> into<00:05:09.310> robot<00:05:09.700> mode

to transform this guy into robot mode

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:22.219 
to transform this guy into robot mode
and<00:05:10.300> be<00:05:10.990> side

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:32.629 

okay<00:05:26.639> this<00:05:27.639> part<00:05:28.409> up<00:05:30.449> simple<00:05:31.449> as<00:05:31.539> that

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
okay this part up simple as that

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:39.689 
okay this part up simple as that
lock<00:05:33.639> in<00:05:33.849> their<00:05:34.029> hips<00:05:37.110> then<00:05:38.219> flip<00:05:39.219> open<00:05:39.430> the

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
feet if you have the universe Bruticus

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:45.389 
feet if you have the universe Bruticus
set<00:05:43.960> or<00:05:44.199> the<00:05:44.439> revenge<00:05:44.770> of<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.889> Fallen<00:05:45.189> booty

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:45.399 
set or the revenge of the Fallen booty

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:49.379 
set or the revenge of the Fallen booty
to<00:05:45.490> set<00:05:45.809> you<00:05:46.809> this<00:05:47.199> this<00:05:47.499> guy<00:05:47.740> will<00:05:48.699> be<00:05:48.909> similar

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
to set you this this guy will be similar

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.879 
to set you this this guy will be similar
in<00:05:49.599> some<00:05:50.080> ways<00:05:50.139> to<00:05:50.909> onslaught<00:05:51.909> the<00:05:52.180> feet<00:05:52.889> it's

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
in some ways to onslaught the feet it's

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.089 
in some ways to onslaught the feet it's
very<00:05:54.069> similar<00:05:54.339> because<00:05:54.759> they'll<00:05:54.939> need<00:05:55.180> to<00:05:55.210> be

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
very similar because they'll need to be

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.040 
very similar because they'll need to be
to<00:05:57.099> form<00:05:57.339> the<00:05:57.460> thighs<00:05:57.669> of<00:05:57.969> the<00:05:58.149> gestalt<00:05:58.779> figure

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
to form the thighs of the gestalt figure

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.649 
to form the thighs of the gestalt figure
yeah<00:06:02.110> even<00:06:03.069> the<00:06:03.189> size<00:06:03.399> is<00:06:03.759> relatively<00:06:04.539> the

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
yeah even the size is relatively the

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.260 
yeah even the size is relatively the
same<00:06:04.749> even<00:06:05.259> the<00:06:05.409> hinges<00:06:06.009> of<00:06:06.249> the<00:06:06.279> hips<00:06:06.639> are

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
same even the hinges of the hips are

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.779 
same even the hinges of the hips are
relatively<00:06:07.930> same<00:06:08.139> with<00:06:08.349> onslaught<00:06:08.710> so<00:06:09.009> he's

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
relatively same with onslaught so he's

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.689 
relatively same with onslaught so he's
also<00:06:09.969> again<00:06:10.449> as<00:06:10.659> symmetrical<00:06:11.349> as<00:06:11.550> with<00:06:12.550> the

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
also again as symmetrical as with the

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.269 
also again as symmetrical as with the
crane

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:14.279 
crane

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.889 
crane
unlike<00:06:15.279> the<00:06:15.430> Bruticus<00:06:15.879> or<00:06:15.999> Superion<00:06:16.479> molds

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:16.899 
unlike the Bruticus or Superion molds

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:18.689 
unlike the Bruticus or Superion molds
that<00:06:17.050> have<00:06:17.199> very<00:06:17.499> symmetrical<00:06:18.039> figures<00:06:18.370> this

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
that have very symmetrical figures this

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:24.929 
that have very symmetrical figures this
Constructicons<00:06:20.909> set<00:06:21.909> has<00:06:22.389> a<00:06:22.419> lot<00:06:22.629> of<00:06:23.939> figures

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
Constructicons set has a lot of figures

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.689 
Constructicons set has a lot of figures
with<00:06:25.240> a<00:06:25.449> symmetric<00:06:26.050> features<00:06:26.499> does<00:06:27.159> this<00:06:27.490> guy

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
with a symmetric features does this guy

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.089 
with a symmetric features does this guy
so<00:06:28.419> he<00:06:28.659> would<00:06:28.809> even<00:06:29.020> form<00:06:29.409> the<00:06:29.559> hands<00:06:29.949> by

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
so he would even form the hands by

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.699 
so he would even form the hands by
opening<00:06:30.459> and<00:06:30.639> opening<00:06:30.909> up<00:06:31.270> the<00:06:31.300> bucket<00:06:31.749> that's

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:32.709 
opening and opening up the bucket that's

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:36.559 
opening and opening up the bucket that's
about<00:06:33.129> it<00:06:33.370> not<00:06:33.639> too<00:06:33.879> much<00:06:34.029> possibility<00:06:35.020> there

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:36.569 
about it not too much possibility there

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:44.249 
about it not too much possibility there
that's<00:06:37.569> the<00:06:37.809> amateur<00:06:38.169> or<00:06:39.300> steam<00:06:40.300> hammer<00:06:43.259> okay

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259 
that's the amateur or steam hammer okay

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:49.469 
that's the amateur or steam hammer okay
I<00:06:45.089> still<00:06:46.089> think<00:06:46.469> this<00:06:47.469> guy<00:06:47.709> is<00:06:47.769> the<00:06:48.039> best<00:06:48.479> the

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
I still think this guy is the best the

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:53.759 
I still think this guy is the best the
Power<00:06:50.110> Shovel<00:06:50.879> is<00:06:52.139> still<00:06:53.139> really<00:06:53.469> the<00:06:53.589> best

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:53.769 
Power Shovel is still really the best

00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:58.019 
Power Shovel is still really the best
for<00:06:54.039> me<00:06:54.300> among<00:06:55.300> all<00:06:55.449> three<00:06:56.169> modes<00:06:56.559> so<00:06:57.550> all<00:06:57.849> in

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:58.029 
for me among all three modes so all in

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.860 
for me among all three modes so all in
all<00:06:58.649> it's<00:06:59.649> a<00:06:59.769> particularly<00:07:00.189> interesting<00:07:01.029> set

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
all it's a particularly interesting set

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.899 
all it's a particularly interesting set
it's<00:07:02.319> very<00:07:02.559> unique<00:07:02.769> I<00:07:03.129> think<00:07:03.159> among<00:07:03.550> all<00:07:03.729> the

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:03.909 
it's very unique I think among all the

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:05.549 
it's very unique I think among all the
three<00:07:04.089> sets<00:07:04.360> he<00:07:04.689> is<00:07:04.809> but<00:07:05.050> this<00:07:05.229> is<00:07:05.289> probably

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:05.559 
three sets he is but this is probably

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:08.639 
three sets he is but this is probably
the<00:07:05.800> most<00:07:06.009> unique<00:07:06.370> set<00:07:06.669> and<00:07:07.019> you<00:07:08.019> get<00:07:08.199> a<00:07:08.229> lot<00:07:08.529> of

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:08.649 
the most unique set and you get a lot of

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:12.689 
the most unique set and you get a lot of
nostalgia<00:07:08.979> for<00:07:09.279> the<00:07:09.639> g1<00:07:11.129> Devastator<00:07:12.129> I<00:07:12.370> think

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:12.699 
nostalgia for the g1 Devastator I think

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.820 
nostalgia for the g1 Devastator I think
this<00:07:12.849> is<00:07:12.969> a<00:07:12.999> big<00:07:13.360> upgrade<00:07:13.629> and<00:07:14.229> a<00:07:14.319> big<00:07:14.529> bit<00:07:14.740> of

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830 
this is a big upgrade and a big bit of

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.879 
this is a big upgrade and a big bit of
an<00:07:14.949> improvement<00:07:15.249> of<00:07:15.610> the<00:07:15.759> g1<00:07:16.180> toys<00:07:16.680> it<00:07:17.680> gives

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:17.889 
an improvement of the g1 toys it gives

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.189 
an improvement of the g1 toys it gives
you<00:07:18.009> a<00:07:18.039> lot<00:07:18.279> more<00:07:18.309> flexibility<00:07:19.209> if<00:07:19.870> you<00:07:20.019> want

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
you a lot more flexibility if you want

Devastator<00:07:39.110> said<00:07:39.770> and<00:07:40.160> just<00:07:40.430> trying<00:07:40.910> to<00:07:41.030> see

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210 
Devastator said and just trying to see

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.150 
Devastator said and just trying to see
if<00:07:41.419> you<00:07:41.840> can<00:07:41.960> live<00:07:42.199> with<00:07:42.349> it<00:07:42.470> with<00:07:43.039> the

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160 
if you can live with it with the

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.460 
if you can live with it with the
combined<00:07:43.880> mode<00:07:44.090> as<00:07:44.300> well<00:07:44.449> as<00:07:44.509> the<00:07:44.780> separated

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:45.470 
combined mode as well as the separated

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.210 
combined mode as well as the separated
mode<00:07:45.680> I<00:07:46.430> think<00:07:47.090> it's<00:07:47.479> still<00:07:47.660> the<00:07:47.720> best<00:07:48.229> just

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.220 
mode I think it's still the best just

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.390
