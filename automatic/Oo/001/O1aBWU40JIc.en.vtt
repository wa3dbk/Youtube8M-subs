00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.250
 and then we manage too 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.250
 that's the way it is 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.100
 we will not give that to the following Soest 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.170

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.290
 around 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.290
 and then we are downloaded 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 that is good for a moment 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.640
 Today, you can easily find the syndicates 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 that was the grouse dream 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.909
 in Worms that's how it looks 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.129
 Firebug limb back 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.719
 waiting 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.579

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.499
 our customers are buying again 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.659
 the dynamic about Bayerin 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.659
 three minutes 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.069
 Feedback which is short also provide these scenes 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.129
 of course very much 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.869
 What's not over yet is Clinton's sentence writing 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:18.589
 to it flew 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.589
 fruit 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.019
 So if you enter the second, that's enough 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.179
 the bayer elf is likely 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.179
 but us Brentwood 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:40.839

 last had loaded 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.729

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.799
 the slope 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.039
 and now 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.279
 now it looks like that 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.439
 that 7 5 3 can have next to each other 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.629
 but probably off 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.889
 at last they have many high school students bury it again bothering me that 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.110
