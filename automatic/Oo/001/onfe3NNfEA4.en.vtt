I<00:01:35.100> think<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.790> works<00:01:36.210> fairly<00:01:36.570> well

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
I think it actually works fairly well

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
I think it actually works fairly well
for<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> sections<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.860> miles<00:01:38.159> between<00:01:38.490> door

shoe<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.659> 11<00:02:04.110> ounces<00:02:04.229> which<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.430> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
shoe is 11 ounces which is a lot of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.889 
shoe is 11 ounces which is a lot of
weight<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.790> my<00:02:05.880> opinion<00:02:06.240> especially<00:02:06.750> for

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
weight in my opinion especially for

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
weight in my opinion especially for
something<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.560> kind<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.799> designed<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.340> be

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
something that is kind of designed to be

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.100 
something that is kind of designed to be
a<00:02:08.489> little<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.970> more<00:02:09.270> minimal<00:02:09.780> well<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.959> does

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
a little bit more minimal well it does

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.059 
a little bit more minimal well it does
give<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.410> extra<00:02:10.709> protection<00:02:11.069> that

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
give you that extra protection that

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.910 
give you that extra protection that
comes<00:02:12.280> at<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> huge<00:02:12.700> cost<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.269> wait<00:02:13.569> stiff<00:02:14.290> well

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
comes at a huge cost to wait stiff well

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.440 
comes at a huge cost to wait stiff well
I<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.430> responsive<00:02:15.879> nature<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.329> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
I like the responsive nature of the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.119 
I like the responsive nature of the
midsole<00:02:16.840> material<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.409> think<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.889> shoe

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
midsole material I think the shoe

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.160 
midsole material I think the shoe
overall<00:02:18.760> had<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> pretty<00:02:19.420> stiff<00:02:19.840> uncomfortable

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
overall had a pretty stiff uncomfortable

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.250 
overall had a pretty stiff uncomfortable
feel<00:02:21.159> for<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.489> large<00:02:21.939> portion<00:02:22.299> of<00:02:22.569> my<00:02:22.749> run<00:02:22.959> it's

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
feel for a large portion of my run it's

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.809 
feel for a large portion of my run it's
stiff<00:02:23.409> both<00:02:23.560> longitude<00:02:24.219> Lee<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:24.519> well<00:02:24.549> as

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
stiff both longitude Lee as well as

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.059 
stiff both longitude Lee as well as
laterally<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.659> really<00:02:25.989> barely<00:02:26.469> twist<00:02:26.920> the

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
laterally can really barely twist the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.709 
laterally can really barely twist the
thing<00:02:27.249> which<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.519> great<00:02:27.700> for<00:02:27.999> those<00:02:28.180> technical

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
thing which is great for those technical

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.899 
thing which is great for those technical
trails<00:02:29.019> but<00:02:29.290> not<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:29.950> great<00:02:30.099> for<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.639> trails

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
trails but not so great for the trails

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:31.770 
trails but not so great for the trails

right<00:02:42.040> now<00:02:42.159> narrow<00:02:42.609> now<00:02:42.879> I've<00:02:42.969> had<00:02:43.090> this

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
right now narrow now I've had this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.729 
right now narrow now I've had this

problem with a number of shoes some more

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.369 
problem with a number of shoes some more
so<00:02:44.950> than<00:02:44.980> others<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.700> isn't<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.379> drastically

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
so than others this isn't a drastically

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.140 
so than others this isn't a drastically

pushing your pinky toe underneath the
other<00:02:55.359> toes<00:02:55.659> it<00:02:55.870> wasn't<00:02:56.109> as<00:02:56.169> horrible<00:02:56.439> as

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
other toes it wasn't as horrible as

other toes it wasn't as horrible as
other<00:02:56.709> shoes<00:02:56.949> but<00:02:57.099> it<00:02:57.219> definitely<00:02:57.639> felt<00:02:57.939> a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
other shoes but it definitely felt a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.580 
other shoes but it definitely felt a

little too narrow for me and

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.839 
actually suffers from the same favor
just<00:03:08.319> as<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.530> lot<00:03:08.919> of<00:03:09.069> cushioning<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.639> on<00:03:09.760> in

just as a lot of cushioning going on in

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.309 
just as a lot of cushioning going on in
there<00:03:09.969> a<00:03:10.000> lot<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.180> layers<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.659> fabric<00:03:11.199> and

materials and while the fit was fine I
just<00:03:13.750> felt<00:03:14.169> it<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.379> a<00:03:14.409> really<00:03:14.620> cumbersome

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
just felt it was a really cumbersome

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.170 
heel and allow for some debris to get in
you<00:03:17.169> just<00:03:17.470> can't<00:03:17.769> get<00:03:17.979> a<00:03:18.189> tight<00:03:18.489> seal<00:03:18.849> around

you just can't get a tight seal around
the<00:03:19.569> ankle<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:20.139> that's<00:03:20.319> it<00:03:20.500> for<00:03:20.680> dislikes<00:03:21.340> so

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639

out<00:03:41.979> of<00:03:42.009> five<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.639> think<00:03:42.939> while<00:03:43.060> there<00:03:43.180> are<00:03:43.329> some

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:43.479 
out of five I think while there are some

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:44.849 
out of five I think while there are some
good<00:03:43.659> qualities<00:03:44.139> with<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.379> shoe<00:03:44.560> there<00:03:44.709> are

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
good qualities with the shoe there are

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.039 
good qualities with the shoe there are
some<00:03:45.250> drastic<00:03:45.729> things<00:03:46.449> that<00:03:46.689> need<00:03:46.870> addressing

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
some drastic things that need addressing

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.869 
some drastic things that need addressing
being<00:03:47.470> heavy<00:03:47.739> being<00:03:48.009> real<00:03:48.129> stiff<00:03:48.459> a<00:03:48.609> bit

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
being heavy being real stiff a bit

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.550 
being heavy being real stiff a bit
narrow<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.419> disproportionate<00:03:50.290> upper

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
materials comfort also three out of five

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.390 
materials comfort also three out of five
well<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.319> think<00:03:53.470> it's<00:03:53.650> gonna<00:03:53.739> be<00:03:53.829> really<00:03:54.129> great

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
well I think it's gonna be really great

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.429 
well I think it's gonna be really great
for<00:03:54.459> shorter<00:03:55.060> trail<00:03:55.329> runs<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:56.019> fact<00:03:56.229> that<00:03:56.349> it

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
for shorter trail runs the fact that it

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.020 
for shorter trail runs the fact that it
has<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.650> word<00:03:56.680> ultra<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.489> it<00:03:57.639> and<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.879> shoe

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
has the word ultra in it and the shoe

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.759 
has the word ultra in it and the shoe

run price I'm gonna get a four out of

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.349 
run price I'm gonna get a four out of
five<00:04:06.310> at<00:04:06.459> one<00:04:06.549> hundred<00:04:06.759> and<00:04:06.849> ten<00:04:07.000> dollars<00:04:07.269> I

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
five at one hundred and ten dollars I

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.999 
five at one hundred and ten dollars I
think<00:04:07.509> that's<00:04:07.629> a<00:04:07.719> reasonable<00:04:08.439> price<00:04:08.650> for<00:04:08.709> a

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
think that's a reasonable price for a

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.589 
think that's a reasonable price for a
shoe<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.489> maybe<00:04:09.639> you<00:04:09.789> can<00:04:09.909> wear<00:04:10.150> door<00:04:10.479> to

shoe that maybe you can wear door to

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.360 
shoe that maybe you can wear door to
trail<00:04:10.900> or<00:04:11.109> on<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.229> techie<00:04:11.530> trails<00:04:11.859> I've<00:04:12.099> seen

shoes<00:04:12.609> go<00:04:12.759> for<00:04:13.000> much<00:04:13.329> much<00:04:13.509> more<00:04:13.689> so<00:04:13.870> I<00:04:13.900> will

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
shoes go for much much more so I will

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.360
