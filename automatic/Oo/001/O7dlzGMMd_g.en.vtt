into<00:00:59.800> the<00:01:00.129> spring<00:01:00.430> months<00:01:00.640> we're<00:01:01.570> going<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.840> be

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
into the spring months we're going to be

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.170 
into the spring months we're going to be
very<00:01:02.170> critical<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.129> kind<00:01:03.520> of<00:01:03.609> fire<00:01:03.760> season

that<00:01:04.300> we<00:01:04.390> were<00:01:04.509> going<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.809> get<00:01:05.049> so<00:01:05.920> areas<00:01:06.280> like

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
that we were going to get so areas like

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.550 
that we were going to get so areas like
Colorado<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.150> Wyoming<00:01:07.270> where<00:01:08.260> they<00:01:08.350> had<00:01:08.530> a
