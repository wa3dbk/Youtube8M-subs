jack cover is in the headphone jack and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.890 
jack cover is in the headphone jack and
then<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.470> tightly<00:01:28.770> closed<00:01:29.450> now<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.509> are

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
then it is tightly closed now you are

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230 
then it is tightly closed now you are
ready<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> water<00:01:31.829> test<00:01:32.159> let's<00:01:32.970> fill

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
ready to do the water test let's fill

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.810 
ready to do the water test let's fill
the<00:01:33.390> sink<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.750> water<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:35.100> case<00:01:35.340> will<00:01:35.579> float

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the sink with water the case will float

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
the sink with water the case will float
so<00:01:36.060> you'll<00:01:36.240> need<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.600> weigh<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.900> down<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.350> coffee

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
so you'll need to weigh it down a coffee

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
so you'll need to weigh it down a coffee
cup<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.250> water<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.700> ideal<00:01:39.350> leave<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.590> the
