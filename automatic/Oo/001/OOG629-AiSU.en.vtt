it's<00:00:11.400> been<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> very<00:00:11.639> interesting<00:00:12.000> season<00:00:12.480> so

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
it's been a very interesting season so

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.870 
it's been a very interesting season so
far<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.259> season<00:00:13.340> four<00:00:14.340> different<00:00:14.670> winners

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
far this season four different winners

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.240 
far this season four different winners
in<00:00:14.969> four<00:00:15.179> different<00:00:15.330> races<00:00:15.690> why<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.859> why

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
in four different races why is that why

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.760 
in four different races why is that why
is<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.580> open<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:17.970> year<00:00:18.150> it's<00:00:19.080> partly

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
is it so open this year it's partly

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.980 
is it so open this year it's partly
because<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:21.240> teams<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.600> much<00:00:21.750> closer

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
because the teams are much closer

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.740 
because the teams are much closer
together<00:00:22.260> due<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.220> aerodynamic<00:00:24.150> restrictions

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
together due to aerodynamic restrictions

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.839 
together due to aerodynamic restrictions
and<00:00:25.320> new<00:00:25.830> rules<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.400> they<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.609> developed

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and new rules that they have developed

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.500 
and new rules that they have developed
that<00:00:27.300> teams<00:00:27.689> don't<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.650> much<00:00:28.769> freedom<00:00:29.039> to

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
that teams don't have so much freedom to

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.950 
that teams don't have so much freedom to
develop<00:00:30.510> specific<00:00:31.050> systems<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.160> allow<00:00:32.960> one

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
develop specific systems that allow one

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
develop specific systems that allow one
team<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> stand<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.190> then<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> other

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
team to stand out and then the other

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.170 
team to stand out and then the other
point<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.559> I'm<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.460> keen<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.700> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
point is that I'm not so keen about is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.970 
point is that I'm not so keen about is
these<00:00:39.629> tires<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.530> think<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.920> are

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
these tires I just think they are

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.459 
these tires I just think they are
playing<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.489> much<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.969> bigger<00:00:42.149> effect<00:00:42.469> because

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
playing a much to bigger effect because

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.790 
playing a much to bigger effect because
they<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.860> picky<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.910> special<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.989> we

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
they are so picky and so special that we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.380 
they are so picky and so special that we
don't<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> cars<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:47.730> ourselves<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
don't put the cars or ourselves to a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.100 
don't put the cars or ourselves to a
limit<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.989> drive<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.070> raw<00:00:50.280> eggs<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
limit we drive like on raw eggs and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.200 
limit we drive like on raw eggs and
don't<00:00:52.110> want<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> stress<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.649> ties<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:53.039> all

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
don't want to stress the ties at all

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.520 
don't want to stress the ties at all
otherwise<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.660> overdo<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.379> then

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
otherwise you just overdo it and then

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.860 
otherwise you just overdo it and then
you<00:00:55.710> go<00:00:55.860> nowhere

I've<00:01:45.970> got<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.149> bit<00:01:46.300> unlucky<00:01:46.539> in<00:01:46.810> that<00:01:46.929> race

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
I've got a bit unlucky in that race

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.609 
I've got a bit unlucky in that race
could<00:01:47.979> have<00:01:48.070> been<00:01:48.160> a<00:01:48.190> 12<00:01:48.750> without<00:01:49.750> doubt<00:01:49.960> but

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
could have been a 12 without doubt but

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.490 
could have been a 12 without doubt but
it<00:01:50.950> proves<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.640> we<00:01:52.300> have<00:01:52.630> made<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> huge<00:01:53.140> step

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
it proves that we have made a huge step

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.200 
it proves that we have made a huge step
because<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.369> have<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.610> consider<00:01:54.910> where<00:01:55.119> we

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
because you have to consider where we

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.380 
because you have to consider where we
come<00:01:55.390> from<00:01:55.420> last<00:01:56.110> year<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:57.210> wasn't<00:01:58.210> really

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
come from last year that wasn't really

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.600 
come from last year that wasn't really
what<00:01:58.509> we<00:01:58.810> were<00:01:58.929> looking<00:01:59.200> for<00:01:59.490> starting<00:02:00.490> the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
what we were looking for starting the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.930 
what we were looking for starting the
Silver<00:02:01.090> Arrow<00:02:01.300> new<00:02:02.200> generation<00:02:02.920> for<00:02:03.819> two

Silver Arrow new generation for two

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.469 
Silver Arrow new generation for two
years<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:04.840> had<00:02:04.989> media<00:02:05.380> success<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.479> finally

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
years we had media success and finally

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.020 
years we had media success and finally
we<00:02:08.259> manage<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.709> victory<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.670> I'm<00:02:09.819> pretty

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
we manage the victory and I'm pretty

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.839 
we manage the victory and I'm pretty
sure<00:02:10.119> we<00:02:10.509> can<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:11.110> other<00:02:11.680> good<00:02:11.950> races<00:02:12.400> this

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849
