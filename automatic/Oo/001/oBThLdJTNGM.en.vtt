00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
took me a little bit i'm not going to

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.699 
took me a little bit i'm not going to
lie<00:04:12.030> i<00:04:12.329> was<00:04:12.659> really<00:04:12.989> just<00:04:13.169> trying<00:04:13.379> to<00:04:13.500> be<00:04:13.680> a

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
lie i was really just trying to be a

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.619 
lie i was really just trying to be a
perfectionist<00:04:14.419> especially<00:04:15.419> when<00:04:15.509> it<00:04:15.569> comes

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
perfectionist especially when it comes

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.420 
perfectionist especially when it comes
to<00:04:15.720> things<00:04:15.930> like<00:04:15.989> this<00:04:16.259> I<00:04:16.470> can't<00:04:17.099> stand<00:04:17.280> if

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
to things like this I can't stand if

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.370 
to things like this I can't stand if
it's<00:04:17.549> uneven<00:04:17.940> or<00:04:18.120> crooked<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.019> was<00:04:19.199> really

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
it's uneven or crooked so I was really

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.300 
it's uneven or crooked so I was really
trying<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.889> line<00:04:20.159> up<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.549> but<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.870> think

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
trying to line up this but I think

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.620 
trying to line up this but I think
probably<00:04:23.310> most<00:04:23.520> people<00:04:23.909> will<00:04:24.000> probably<00:04:24.210> find

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
probably most people will probably find

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.010 
probably most people will probably find
it<00:04:24.719> easier<00:04:25.080> for<00:04:25.260> me<00:04:25.349> I'll<00:04:25.440> just

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
it easier for me I'll just

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.659 
it easier for me I'll just
I<00:04:26.080> get<00:04:26.500> paranoid<00:04:26.889> I<00:04:27.069> even<00:04:27.370> when<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.550> looks

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
I get paranoid I even when it looks

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.150 
I get paranoid I even when it looks
perfect<00:04:27.910> I<00:04:28.210> still<00:04:28.840> can't<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:29.530> kind<00:04:29.919> of<00:04:29.949> peeled

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
perfect I still can't I kind of peeled

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.040 
perfect I still can't I kind of peeled
it<00:04:30.220> off<00:04:30.340> which<00:04:30.970> brings<00:04:31.389> me<00:04:31.509> to<00:04:31.599> another<00:04:31.720> point

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
it off which brings me to another point

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.480 
it off which brings me to another point
that<00:04:32.259> I<00:04:32.379> may<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.560> want<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.860> make<00:04:32.979> sure<00:04:33.009> I<00:04:33.129> stress

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479
