00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Liam Neeson is not surprised today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.299
 a completely different environment than me 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.890
 I want you my new one today 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.670
 Wardrobe show live session 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.560
 do it yourself, we can already see 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 I have a corner in a room 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.010
 We are selected 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.630
 Now here in my bedroom 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.700
 or in our own 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.189
 bedroom and i wanted to mean mine 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.660
 cabinet somewhere else than do it 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.880
 I built this walk-in myself 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.550
 had a simple reason for me 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.230
 I noticed that with the shopping diet 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.700
 I have a lot of clothes 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 not at all and therefore have 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.540
 sorted out again and it is not 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.420
 much more about it and therefore 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.570
 I did not need the whole place anymore 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.940
 and now have here in the corner with us 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.820
 in the bedroom where yes as you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.769
 see a pillar through the room 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.969
 is so behind it are still so ca on 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.260
 the side so 30 cm behind it yes 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.090
 keep going pier long and i wanted 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.890
 just build around this 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.620
 corner a bit because you can 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 otherwise can not stand there and 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.290
 I just did not need that much anymore 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.220
 That's why he's here now 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.080
 I really like it, I want you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.670
 Just tell me how I do that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.500
 have made and how you are 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.509
 can build such a wardrobe yourself 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.549
 if you are interested in it and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.320
 Although first found and considered 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.299
 which system you want to have I have 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.460
 now taken 1 by bauhaus 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.200
 you will be back in the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.430
 Close look that is so afford 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.920
 I would say that one on the wall 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.439
 attach and then they have such a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.399
 Opening for a plug-in system 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.200
 that's just what you hook 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.930
 put in places where you then just boards 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.680
 put the boards you can in the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.680
 buy a hardware store 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.840
 I believe the systems are in there 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.229
 different lengths i have now 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.579
 Taken 40 cm deep boards which is 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.490
 I think so well so you get 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.380
 the clothes like you look good and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.689
 they are also a bit longer 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.649
 So when there simply for example yes 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.420
 It's so much bigger 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.159
 that has to be merged 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.049
 any case, there is a good mood 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.630
 similar system at ikea however 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.070
 the lengths are not given here 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.690
 It could just be completely self 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.060
 determine and it is completely 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.750
 simple words hole in the wall to the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.490
 put where 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.840
 who wants to make him so I want 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.840
 I now have four of these holders here 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.110
 behind you can see here 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.020
 and yes they are then doweled the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.150
 holes bolted the parts and then 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.580
 can you just the plug system 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.770
 because where you attach after the boards 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.800
 I want to have in my case is just here 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.180
 this bar middle bring them for and 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.030
 disguised wood from them 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.860
 fire safety regulations and therefore are 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.270
 the boards added a bit that 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.340
 they then fit around it and me yes 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.390
 ambush also still have space see 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.120
 but her again 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.739
 and yes, that's actually it 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.180
 whole magic I have my stuff now 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.980
 granted here and you can see that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.690
 it is already less than the last time 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.690
 but I still have 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.160
 enough to wear and mine 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.140
 wardrobe changes just like that 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.220
 a little bit because I noticed somehow 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.540
 I do not have that much 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.220
 can carry nearly as much as that 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.430
 what I own and me more so easy 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.610
 would like to have favorite clothes yes and 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.410
 I still want to show you something like 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.810
 I found totally good because we had my 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.130
 A very great idea and for that 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.650
 we have to go over here show that 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.320
 me now 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.900
 so we can see here now is 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.610
 here a weird as in the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.430
 probably noticed here in the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.110
 attic and there are very many 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.200
 weird and math a very great 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.560
 Idea and there are at ikea and also 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.540
 In the hardware store, that's the way Barth Stangen 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.459
 so stick on those towels 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.040
 hang or discount or not 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.019
 clue has such things and these too 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.640
 so normally we are two 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.190
 Stones on it if you only the outer one 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.079
 made on it and they are so ten 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.590
 inch I would say from the wall 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.970
 away and that's why there are now 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.470
 possibility if you are on the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.989
 right height brings so so that 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.940
 they just do not hit the wall here 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.410
 would 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.060
 hang up clothes so that just 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.530
 to use as a clothes rail I think 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.810
 It's totally awesome and that's the way it is 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.350
 So American used one of you so 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.500
 Africa has, above all, by 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.910
 oblique can use the super so me 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.360
 I really wanted to show you that because 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.820
 I think that's a very good way 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.170
 to mount and to climb 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.480
 also places to use which one actually 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.640
 in his apartment does not use from therefore 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.170
 This idea is also part of mine 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.760
 Wardrobe here now I'm sitting 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.580
 on the other side, so to speak 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.440
 not even fully because there come 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.650
 probably then the things 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.760
 Mobile are achievable and that was so now 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.410
 I will do this to you now 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.170
 once in the closet show it 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.940
 that get a bit of an impression 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.110
 here you can now the left part of the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.940
 see wardrobe 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.560
 there you see the suspension and you 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.590
 Look up there are two more 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.630
 fan so there you have to each other his 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.110
 do something purely 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.330
 and he does not have that much further 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.770
 Below is everything from me 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.610
 this theme likes to sort the pants 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.170
 down and then a few more bodies like that 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:24.560
 for the rest of the rest you just so 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:28.820
 yes, this side of the cabinet has the 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.000
 I then used pretty well so 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.040
 and on the other side 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.830
 Here you see the page limited 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.940
 is still empty so here is up 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.780
 if then just no burst in 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.970
 those of the oblique but on the other 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.510
 page stops here below so already 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.710
 through the bars and yes there is easy 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.180
 even more space to see what else 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.120
 I come in here now, too 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.160
 baskets and here you can now great 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.760
 see how it is designed and behind 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.500
 then two boards come together with it 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.040
 then the two of them in the middle of them 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.750
 place has here again the 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.340
 Clothes rack and here you see 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.020
 Once again , you can really take the place 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.520
 that's weird where else not 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.100
 would fit in really good again 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.050
 exploit and get a lot more 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.000
 Of course there was also clinging over the 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.230
 possibility just two next to each other 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.390
 So now hang next to one 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.430
 windows like here, for example, then 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.630
 even to use the second oblique 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.540
 and there's a pole to go 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.370
 do it that's it then it was me 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.440
 I hope that 's interesting 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.300
 find and maybe even yourself 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.040
 try yourself 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.410
 wardrobe to build the perfect in 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.169
 your room fits so much fun 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.060
 and I hope as I said that it 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.830
 you liked 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.850
 that you want to see something more than that 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.320
 it belongs more in the 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.490
 furnishing area then just give 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.590
 thumbs up on this video and 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.490
 otherwise if you are still interested 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.330
 you old in the wardrobe 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.330
 anzugucken 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.650
 which is a lot bigger than the one here then 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.700
 Just look in the 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.500
 video description 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.090
 I linked that again 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.050
 and maybe you also look at them 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.460
 shopping diet 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.160
 then you see what the reason 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:09.700
 that's why I'm a bit like that now 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.250
 go shopping differently than before 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.750
 Have fun with it in the video 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.460
 description and I wish you all 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.990
 have fun 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.169
 See you in the next video 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.169
 then
