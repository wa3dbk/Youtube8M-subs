00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
we found a product called GTECH that we

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.780 
we found a product called GTECH that we
are<00:00:45.670> very<00:00:46.630> very<00:00:46.960> excited<00:00:47.440> about<00:00:47.790> normal

of the bacteria

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.200 
of the bacteria
you<00:00:55.390> need<00:00:55.570> an<00:00:55.690> anti<00:00:55.930> microbial<00:00:56.500> type<00:00:56.740> spray<00:00:57.250> or

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
you need an anti microbial type spray or

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.070 
you need an anti microbial type spray or
detergent<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.350> we<00:00:59.620> use<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.790> GTECH<00:01:01.210> every<00:01:01.930> one

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080
