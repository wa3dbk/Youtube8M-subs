00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
45 that's good then put it back to zero

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.759 
45 that's good then put it back to zero
we<00:03:03.370> go

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
we go

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.759 
we go
and<00:03:05.879> then<00:03:06.879> like<00:03:07.269> 80<00:03:07.569> let's<00:03:08.230> say<00:03:08.349> about<00:03:08.500> there

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
and then like 80 let's say about there

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.399 
and then like 80 let's say about there
maybe<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:10.450> could<00:03:10.599> just<00:03:10.689> put<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.019> wherever<00:03:11.230> you

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
maybe you could just put it wherever you

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.369 
maybe you could just put it wherever you
want<00:03:11.620> on<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.980> keyframe<00:03:13.049> just<00:03:14.049> depends<00:03:14.349> how

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
want on the keyframe just depends how

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:24.199 
want on the keyframe just depends how
many<00:03:14.500> times<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:14.890> want<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.129> to<00:03:15.220> spin<00:03:17.489> 115<00:03:19.920> zero

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:36.230 

about<00:03:25.209> 150<00:03:26.139> I<00:03:26.170> go<00:03:26.409> there

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.120 

and<00:03:37.240> then<00:03:37.480> just<00:03:37.750> end<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.170> off<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.320> zero<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.950> is

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
and then just end it off a zero this is

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.380 
and then just end it off a zero this is
the<00:03:42.250> best<00:03:42.460> way<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.640> do<00:03:42.820> but<00:03:42.970> I'm<00:03:43.060> just<00:03:43.180> like

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
the best way to do but I'm just like

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.020 
the best way to do but I'm just like
showing<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.960> number<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.620> uncheck<00:03:44.920> this<00:03:45.220> go

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.040 

so<00:03:52.030> good<00:03:52.210> looks<00:03:52.450> pretty<00:03:52.630> nice

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
so good looks pretty nice

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.010 
so good looks pretty nice
and<00:03:53.950> then<00:03:54.220> yeah<00:03:54.580> all<00:03:55.360> right<00:03:55.480> now<00:03:55.750> what<00:03:55.900> we're

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
and then yeah all right now what we're

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.980 
and then yeah all right now what we're
going<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:56.320> is<00:03:56.880> just<00:03:57.880> click<00:03:58.090> on<00:03:58.270> I'll<00:03:58.840> just

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
going to do is just click on I'll just

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.820 
going to do is just click on I'll just
click<00:03:59.170> on<00:03:59.290> nothing

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
click on nothing

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.970 
click on nothing
go<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.370> square<00:04:00.870> hold<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:02.020> down<00:04:02.170> let<00:04:02.680> go<00:04:02.860> and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
go to the square hold it down let go and

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.790 
go to the square hold it down let go and
plain<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:04.810> make<00:04:04.960> sure<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.200> planes<00:04:05.410> under<00:04:05.650> it

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
plain just make sure the planes under it

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:16.350 
plain just make sure the planes under it
about<00:04:08.800> 9000<00:04:09.460> is<00:04:09.520> good<00:04:12.720> there<00:04:13.720> we<00:04:13.840> go<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:15.360> then

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
about 9000 is good there we go and then

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.360 
about 9000 is good there we go and then
just<00:04:16.390> make<00:04:16.750> cake<00:04:17.620> because<00:04:17.890> if<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.130> render

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
just make cake because if you render

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.120 
just make cake because if you render
it'll<00:04:18.760> be<00:04:18.850> blocked<00:04:19.090> there<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:19.450> just<00:04:20.100> make<00:04:21.100> sure

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
it'll be blocked there so just make sure

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.630 
it'll be blocked there so just make sure
you<00:04:21.370> don't<00:04:21.489> see<00:04:21.760> that<00:04:21.880> just<00:04:22.210> go<00:04:22.330> like<00:04:22.480> that<00:04:22.510> and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.670 

then<00:04:27.640> this<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.420> just<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.690> change<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.170> angle<00:04:29.350> of

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
then this is just to change the angle of

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.360 
then this is just to change the angle of
the<00:04:29.830> text<00:04:30.280> just<00:04:30.970> play<00:04:31.210> around<00:04:31.270> with<00:04:31.480> that<00:04:31.660> and

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
the text just play around with that and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.510 
the text just play around with that and
there<00:04:33.370> we<00:04:33.490> go<00:04:34.920> and<00:04:35.920> we're<00:04:36.190> going<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.340> add<00:04:36.490> a

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
there we go and we're going to add a

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.280 
there we go and we're going to add a
light<00:04:36.760> goes<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.600> and<00:04:37.810> click<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:39.000> sorry<00:04:40.000> and

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
light goes here and click that sorry and

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.020 
light goes here and click that sorry and
then<00:04:41.290> just<00:04:41.530> drag<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.830> light<00:04:41.980> and<00:04:42.160> position<00:04:42.940> it

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
then just drag the light and position it

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.680 
then just drag the light and position it
wherever<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:43.360> want

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
wherever you want

wherever you want
I<00:04:43.900> like<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.010> right<00:04:45.160> in<00:04:45.310> front<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.540> text<00:04:46.960> um

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.170 

just<00:04:51.100> drag<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.430> bit<00:04:51.550> more<00:04:51.670> forward<00:04:54.180> that's

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
just drag it a bit more forward that's

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.930 
just drag it a bit more forward that's
good<00:04:55.420> that's<00:04:56.050> good<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:57.460> then<00:04:57.580> there<00:04:57.760> we<00:04:57.820> go

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
good that's good and then there we go

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.490 
good that's good and then there we go
and<00:04:58.120> then<00:04:58.480> add<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.780> shadow<00:05:00.810> soft<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.170> then

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
and then add a shadow soft and then

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.320 
and then add a shadow soft and then
render<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:02.920> again<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.910> should<00:05:06.940> have<00:05:07.210> that

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
render it again and you should have that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.180 
render it again and you should have that
nice<00:05:07.630> nice<00:05:07.870> shadow<00:05:08.170> effect<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:08.740> then<00:05:08.980> what

we're going to want to do just bring the
text<00:05:12.160> a<00:05:12.310> bit<00:05:12.340> more<00:05:12.610> down

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.059 

and<00:05:25.960> never<00:05:26.960> got<00:05:27.110> that<00:05:27.169> looks<00:05:27.349> really<00:05:27.590> nice
