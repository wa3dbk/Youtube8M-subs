I<00:01:18.680> can<00:01:18.830> look<00:01:18.979> down<00:01:19.159> here<00:01:19.430> right<00:01:20.180> with<00:01:20.330> the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
I can look down here right with the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.370 
I can look down here right with the
trail<00:01:20.600> runner<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.899> can<00:01:20.990> see<00:01:21.110> what<00:01:21.200> there's<00:01:21.350> a

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
trail runner you can see what there's a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.660 
trail runner you can see what there's a
lot<00:01:21.500> of<00:01:21.530> fires<00:01:21.830> on<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.940> last<00:01:23.180> day<00:01:23.390> or<00:01:23.420> two<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:23.930> I

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
lot of fires on the last day or two so I

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.770 
lot of fires on the last day or two so I
guess<00:01:25.670> that's<00:01:25.820> what<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.030> have<00:01:26.180> us<00:01:26.299> up<00:01:26.450> here<00:01:26.630> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
guess that's what I have us up here and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.639 
guess that's what I have us up here and
I<00:01:26.899> guess<00:01:27.049> it's<00:01:27.229> better<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.530> be<00:01:27.729> up<00:01:28.729> here<00:01:28.909> and

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
I guess it's better to be up here and

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:40.499 
I guess it's better to be up here and
