00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.950
 let's go together we're cobra rolling more 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.199
 people will bring you all the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.619
 details of what is happening here in 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.619
 grÃªmio arena 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.910
 I'm before we access the part 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.340
 really from the stadium bleachers 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.469
 an interesting detail from the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.989
 lawn drainage that will be done is 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.420
 It has only grown the tape is the last to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.420
 last part of the work itself wants to do the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 and we have several toucans. 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 They say that they will use for 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.160
 How will drainage work that is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.840
 in fact the drainage system that was 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.940
 It was designed for sale 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.800
 it is a suction system is the system 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.710
 which calls vacuum drainage 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.160
 these studies are drilled pipes where 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.080
 water is to have 6 with the studies of a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.890
 suction system through large 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.729
 teachers 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.960
 sucks this water causing aaa to 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.270
 water passage 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.580
 the removal of water from the field is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.009
 with efficiency at much higher speed 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.869
 that happens when you have during the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.180
 I play a great storm 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.500
 speed is exactly the withdrawal from the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.210
 water and sewage recorded 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.759
 it increases such a large amount 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.590
 makes you able to make a game 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.570
 without having those big ones that yes of those 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.659
 things you normally see times 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.049
 at this stage is a technology 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.210
 today is perhaps only the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.909
 large data and the yew data at 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.829
 internationally and actually achieve is 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.990
 maintain this type of drainage and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.600
 projectors for their stadiums 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.659
 a detail antonini this is if this 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 period of the work, the last is the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.259
 of the lawn where it occurs before 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.270
 truth are several fronts of this phase 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.329
 end of work less than 100 days away 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.509
 as a whole to foreign investment 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.090
 drainage after seeding 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.829
 of the grass the electrical installations 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
 bathroom investment has a number of 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.960
 open fronts but what for us 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.180
 becomes more noticeable perhaps 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.380
 the installation of the chairs in the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.210
 lawn 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.210
 It's okay, check it out then let's go. 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.100
 a return and exactly arrive is a 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.550
 part of the grandstand that would give new 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.550
 Guild House 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.640
 the people on our tour of the 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.730
 We're on the grass here. 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.770
 the body of the games from the year 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.370
 come the lawn is still being made 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:04.670
 part of the drainage and if we look at 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.100
 Following the gap has placed right in 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.890
 sequence and the part of the bleachers where 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.650
 We will not have chairs in general. 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.480
 even because the fan that goes to general 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.819
 makes the avalanche and the areas of the team 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.690
 so it's being finalized here too 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.690
 in the work of legend 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.850
 this is the area where the artists are 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.730
 the players 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.740
 this entrance is from the locker room both the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.709
 how much of the opponents and the 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.280
 world cup style referee 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.890
 they all come together on the lawn and of course 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.170
 have easy access to the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.270
 ramp has nothing directly accessible from the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.270
 changing rooms until the lawn of the
