00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.890
 I have one again today 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.560
 Quicktipp for you so a short 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.810
 review or recommendation to one 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.210
 certain product from me to you and 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.609
 these as today give short form 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.380
 story about it i can not feel good 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.019
 the fingernails paint so I am 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.599
 it's really bad because I can do it 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.159
 Do not wait for my nails to dry 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.810
 So that the nail polish on my nails 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.130
 dry when I paint my nails 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.169
 have anything reasonably good 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.880
 I can just work this 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.879
 do not wait five or six minutes 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.260
 until the nail polish just really 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.940
 but i always have to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.710
 touch something I have to do something 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.359
 I have to do something 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.039
 put on and after that it actually looks 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.180
 always out as if I was five years old 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.160
 the nails are painted 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.420
 those are any dangles or 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.370
 in human life is the nail polish 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.350
 completely off or just a few and put 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.820
 that's terrible of course 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.589
 Of course, I had to get out of the situation 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.000
 on my last rossmann shopping at 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.679
 hang a very specific product 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.379
 stay and that's what it's all about today 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:05.010
 and that is from essens up close 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.760
 The express 3 drops dries nail polish 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.500
 in seconds 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.150
 and if I already hear that , I am 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.619
 already convinced and take it with and 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.650
 have in the trap, so to speak 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.990
 I have already tried a lot so 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.630
 fast- drying spree is yes for 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.829
 nail polish or even about the paint 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.210
 the nail polish really fast then 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.390
 should dry if you get it on time 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 it's just such jobs here 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 So here I am 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.770
 taken along and extensively tested on 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 the fingernails and also on the foot 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 and what I think of that 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.469
 I'll tell you a little bit at the back 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.810
 it says on it are just nail polish 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.729
 quick dry drip dries one 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.670
 drop of nail polish within seconds 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.899
 express three jobs in the fresh 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.850
 applied nail polish so you do 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.759
 each a point push of these 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.130
 Drop the nail on it as soon as the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.140
 have him painted and then it should be just 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.340
 possible to dry in seconds i 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.920
 I tried it and I can 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.140
 already say here are no drafts 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.780
 There are no smeared spots here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.880
 everything has remained as it should and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.710
 My nails are just beautiful 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.180
 I tried it with this one 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.369
 Nail polish I am also new to them 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.099
 I bought it from astor 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.000
 it is the fashion studio row 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.950
 color 460 yellow badkap and that is 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.019
 of course a difficult color anyway 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.470
 already to apply because I almost of it 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.330
 2 , three more are almost gone 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.920
 three layers need that 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.780
 really nice covers it is one 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.310
 very light color that's why I had to 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.110
 I realize that I have several layers 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.819
 I have to try it though 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.349
 tried and directly with these 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.030
 drop first I have flat 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.099
 relatively thin layer applied to the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.170
 first lower class so to speak and have 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.409
 Immediately after I get a hand 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.050
 the drops were painted on it 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.459
 on every nail so drop it 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.870
 is quite enough to be fast 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.970
 realize that this is a relatively difficult one 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.860
 The problem is because these drops 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.239
 of course not only stay on the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.610
 nail polish but euro finger 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.260
 then quite that of the stuff and 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.390
 by the consistency, it is honest 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.099
 I did not say a little oil 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.290
 quite as much as you like it is the only one 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.019
 manko what I've got here you will 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.190
 See it when you have the order 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.599
 only just once let her dealer 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.280
 or occasion nails 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.739
 That's why I would definitely do it for you 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.150
 always recommend that with the drops over 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.950
 to make the sink that I have 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.629
 then also made the same and then have 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.060
 I just waited a moment that really did 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.110
 So it did not take 30 seconds 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.670
 That's the first time I've heard about it 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.180
 caught and the first shift was 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.030
 dry 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.280
 then I have my hands first 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.530
 because of it as I said because it just 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.989
 pretty oily and difficult easy 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.939
 has really dried my hands off 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.549
 rubbed dry with the towel and 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.900
 it did not work then I have the 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.430
 second layer applied to me 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.700
 have made relatively thick because I just 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.959
 did not want to assign three layers 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.150
 and then I was unsure if that 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.530
 works on the second layer as 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.909
 it a bit thicker than it 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.110
 then it has also applied 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.069
 took a little longer 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.360
 about a minute until then 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.040
 was dried but that is of course 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.110
 also much faster though 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.700
 it is not in seconds now it is 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.200
 now takes less than three seconds, the 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.239
 I can not say but it works 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.280
 still much faster than you 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.840
 the nails without these drips 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.400
 I painted all over again then 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.870
 made for the toenails and there I am 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.430
 but nail polish taken from me 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.230
 knew that he covers in a layer 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.050
 So I applied this one layer 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.390
 and then the drops just on it 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.280
 and it's really super fast 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.450
 dried 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.710
 that you could have dried then 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.420
 I have my toes with me a bit 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.980
 a towel dry with it 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.810
 just not so wet from these 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.280
 Drops and hands I have just 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.690
 washed that it is the only one 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.040
 disadvantage that I would see that 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.110
 all a bit a difficult one 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.910
 But that is what I take in 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.020
 buy as I said if you over the 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.490
 This is not a sink 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.040
 problem you can get your hands on it 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.780
 just wash it 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.700
 I'll take that for the sake of that 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.230
 the effect is really great that me 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.700
 not have to wait so long forever 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.050
 that my nail polish dries but 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.050
 that it is really fast 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.260
 So the express 3 drops of essens 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.420
 really convinced me that 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.270
 result has just become great 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.740
 no traces no drafts no 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.830
 smeared nail 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.690
 everything is evenly even 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.920
 and really nice shiny there is 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.440
 by the way, no over paint on it 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.620
 So that's really just the nail polish 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.480
 and next to it the drobs on it best 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.910
 of course it really was with the 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.380
 Nail polish often nails my foot where I am 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.970
 only one layer had to be applied 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.530
 It was simply the fastest way 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.690
 but also with the two layers 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.370
 nail polish and the two layers of the 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.870
 drops was no problem at all 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.610
 just has a little longer 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.740
 lasted at the second layer just 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.390
 otherwise you would like to have a look 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.980
 happy times tried out, I think it's 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.870
 It may be the one or the other class 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.640
 others of you too will help as well 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.160
 impatient when marking is like me 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.690
 that was my quicktipp from today that 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.010
 next video comes on monday 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.080
 In any case, switched again 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.060
 I think that will be very interesting 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.650
 for you and yes then I wish you 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.180
 another nice weekend and we 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.180
 See you on monday
