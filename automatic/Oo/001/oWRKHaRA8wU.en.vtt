00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
powers already attached I'm just going

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.110 
powers already attached I'm just going
to<00:01:01.180> go<00:01:01.330> through<00:01:01.360> how<00:01:01.870> we<00:01:01.930> set<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.380> up<00:01:02.970> just<00:01:03.970> like

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
to go through how we set it up just like

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:13.740 
to go through how we set it up just like
a<00:01:04.239> conventional<00:01:04.839> Brawley<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:13.479> straight

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
a conventional Brawley really straight

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.590 
a conventional Brawley really straight
forwards<00:01:14.170> as<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:15.070> was<00:01:15.220> saying<00:01:15.460> about<00:01:16.060> if<00:01:16.420> it's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
forwards as I was saying about if it's

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.930 
forwards as I was saying about if it's
just<00:01:16.900> about<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.290> rain<00:01:17.530> or<00:01:17.770> something<00:01:18.010> it's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
just about to rain or something it's

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.840 
just about to rain or something it's
literally<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.600> quick<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.280> as<00:01:24.399> you<00:01:24.520> can<00:01:24.640> see

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
literally that quick and as you can see

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.120 
literally that quick and as you can see
I've<00:01:25.450> hardly<00:01:25.750> pushed<00:01:26.050> them<00:01:26.259> poles<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.770> at<00:01:26.890> all

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
I've hardly pushed them poles in at all

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.410 
I've hardly pushed them poles in at all
but<00:01:28.030> because<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.840> way<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.910> ribs<00:01:30.910> all

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
but because of the way the ribs all

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.290 
but because of the way the ribs all
touch<00:01:31.780> right<00:01:32.740> around<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.070> back<00:01:33.270> you've<00:01:34.270> got

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
touch right around the back you've got

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.090 
touch right around the back you've got
stability<00:01:34.690> straightaway<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.950> other

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
stability straightaway the other

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.830 
stability straightaway the other
features<00:01:36.610> I<00:01:36.729> like<00:01:36.880> about<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.330> Brawley<00:01:37.570> are

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
features I like about the Brawley are

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.950 
features I like about the Brawley are
their<00:01:38.440> fiber<00:01:38.770> color<00:01:39.039> strips<00:01:39.690> strong<00:01:40.690> but

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
their fiber color strips strong but

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.040 
their fiber color strips strong but
extremely<00:01:41.440> light<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.780> material<00:01:43.780> it's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
extremely light and the material it's

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.070 
extremely light and the material it's
the<00:01:44.229> new<00:01:44.380> extremis<00:01:44.920> HD<00:01:45.509> material<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.720> we're

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
the new extremis HD material and we're

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.410 
the new extremis HD material and we're
so<00:01:47.259> confident<00:01:47.770> in<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.550> we've<00:01:48.940> got<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.210> five

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
so confident in it that we've got a five

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.330 
so confident in it that we've got a five
year<00:01:49.690> guarantee<00:01:49.869> on<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.500> what<00:01:50.920> more<00:01:51.160> could<00:01:51.280> you

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
year guarantee on it what more could you

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.990 
year guarantee on it what more could you
ask<00:01:51.430> for

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
ask for

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.240 
ask for
okay<00:01:52.810> that's<00:01:53.080> how<00:01:53.200> I'd<00:01:53.320> usually<00:01:53.530> set<00:01:53.950> out<00:01:54.100> for

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
okay that's how I'd usually set out for

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.200 
okay that's how I'd usually set out for
a<00:01:54.340> quick<00:01:54.460> I've<00:01:54.670> Ania

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
a quick I've Ania

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.120 
a quick I've Ania
but<00:01:55.630> obviously<00:01:55.930> if<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.200> wind<00:01:56.409> gets<00:01:56.500> up<00:01:56.830> in<00:01:57.040> the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
but obviously if the wind gets up in the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.520 
but obviously if the wind gets up in the
night<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.580> want<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.760> peg<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.090> down<00:01:58.530> various

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
night you want to peg it down various

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.109 
night you want to peg it down various
pegging<00:01:59.920> points<00:02:00.280> right<00:02:00.430> around<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.820> broadly

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
pegging points right around the broadly

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.630 
pegging points right around the broadly
system<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:04.020> another<00:02:05.020> unique<00:02:05.530> feature<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
system and another unique feature is the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.199 
system and another unique feature is the
rain<00:02:06.850> bar<00:02:07.679> you<00:02:08.679> just<00:02:09.250> funnels<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.790> water<00:02:10.000> away

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
rain bar you just funnels the water away

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.660 
rain bar you just funnels the water away
from<00:02:10.630> all<00:02:10.750> your<00:02:10.899> kit<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:11.799> great<00:02:12.340> and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
from all your kit this is great and

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.810 
from all your kit this is great and
basically<00:02:13.510> good<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.320> go<00:02:14.470> we're<00:02:14.830> fishing

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
basically good to go we're fishing

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:31.210 
basically good to go we're fishing
