00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
good morning everyone um this morning I

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.450 
good morning everyone um this morning I
decided<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:06.029> mondays<00:00:06.420> are<00:00:06.629> going<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.960> be<00:00:07.109> my

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
decided that mondays are going to be my

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.530 
decided that mondays are going to be my
weight<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.490> measurement<00:00:09.330> day<00:00:09.630> um<00:00:10.790> I<00:00:11.790> thought

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
weight and measurement day um I thought

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.890 
weight and measurement day um I thought
of<00:00:12.690> doing<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:13.019> once<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.320> month<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.799> some<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.519> I

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
of doing it once a month like some but I

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.279 
of doing it once a month like some but I
don't<00:00:15.900> think<00:00:16.049> I'd<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> patience<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:18.289> I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
don't think I'd have the patience and I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.290 
don't think I'd have the patience and I
may<00:00:19.949> do<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> measurements<00:00:20.760> at<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> beginning

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
may do the measurements at the beginning

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.950 
may do the measurements at the beginning
of<00:00:21.359> each<00:00:21.510> month<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.050> then<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
of each month and then just do the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.800 
of each month and then just do the
weight<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.230> Mondays<00:00:26.090> because<00:00:27.090> measurements

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
weight on Mondays because measurements

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.299 
weight on Mondays because measurements
take<00:00:28.019> some<00:00:28.230> time<00:00:28.529> um<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.840> measured<00:00:31.309> basically

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
take some time um I measured basically

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
circumference would be nice of course a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
circumference would be nice of course a
little<00:00:49.920> less<00:00:50.100> nasty<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.180> sorry<00:00:51.420> um<00:00:52.489> I<00:00:53.489> am

i had have my weight to lose but did it
all<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.799> fat<00:01:18.020> actually<00:01:19.020> most<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.770> its

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
all have to be fat actually most of its

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
all have to be fat actually most of its
that<00:01:20.220> there's<00:01:20.520> still<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> tiny<00:01:21.030> percentage<00:01:21.659> in

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that there's still a tiny percentage in

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950 
that there's still a tiny percentage in
there<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.439> got<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.549> muscle<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.150> suppose

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
there that's got to be muscle I suppose

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.170 
there that's got to be muscle I suppose
of<00:01:25.860> course<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.189> don't<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.490> how<00:01:26.640> accurate

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
of course I don't know how accurate

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
of course I don't know how accurate
those<00:01:27.360> skills<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.680> are<00:01:29.070> anyhow<00:01:29.549> but

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
those skills like that are anyhow but

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.359 
those skills like that are anyhow but
let<00:01:30.810> go<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.979> gives<00:01:32.130> me

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
let go with it just because it gives me

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.770 
let go with it just because it gives me
a<00:01:32.400> measurement<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.150> measure<00:01:33.360> by<00:01:33.630> um<00:01:35.750> today<00:01:36.750> I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
a measurement to measure by um today I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.920 
a measurement to measure by um today I
stripped<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> rice<00:01:37.380> diet<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.920> Ernest<00:01:38.310> I've

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
stripped the rice diet and Ernest I've

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.950 
stripped the rice diet and Ernest I've
got<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:41.810> um<00:01:43.159> bananas<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.340> breakfast<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.270> I've

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
got a banana and some grapes for lunch
and<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:50.070> course<00:01:50.100> my<00:01:50.490> rice<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.350> then<00:01:52.579> for

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
and of course my rice and then for

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.310 
and of course my rice and then for
dinner<00:01:53.759> I'll<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.570> home<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> don't<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
dinner I'll be home so I don't have to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.340 
dinner I'll be home so I don't have to
worry<00:01:55.530> about<00:01:55.649> carrying<00:01:55.920> anything<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
worry about carrying anything for that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.539 
worry about carrying anything for that
it'll<00:01:58.350> probably<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.740> more<00:01:58.890> grapes<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.340> I

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it'll probably be more grapes because I

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.100 
it'll probably be more grapes because I
bought<00:02:00.180> tons<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.719> them<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:01.079> tasted<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.770> good

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
bought tons of them they tasted so good

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
bought tons of them they tasted so good
so<00:02:04.579> we'll<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.790> y'all<00:02:06.030> later<00:02:06.060> bye
