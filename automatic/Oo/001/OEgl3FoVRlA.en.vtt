just<00:03:12.769> here<00:03:14.019> in<00:03:15.019> actually<00:03:15.350> goes<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.620> pretty

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
just here in actually goes on pretty

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.920 
just here in actually goes on pretty
much<00:03:16.100> like<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.340> spring-loaded<00:03:16.850> capo<00:03:17.450> if<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.720> can

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
much like a spring-loaded capo if I can

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.570 
make you think you're really one second
oh<00:03:20.180> there<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:21.650> just<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.400> little<00:03:24.580> cat

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
oh there it's just like a little cat

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.210 
oh there it's just like a little cat
that<00:03:25.910> just<00:03:26.600> holds<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:26.930> in<00:03:27.019> position<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.650> the

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
that just holds it in position and the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.330 
that just holds it in position and the
way<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.459> works<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.989> as<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.350> piece<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.830> crystal<00:03:31.220> in

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
way it works is as a piece of crystal in

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.110 
way it works is as a piece of crystal in
their<00:03:31.580> tuner

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
their tuner

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.460 
their tuner
that<00:03:32.390> vibrates<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:35.060> when<00:03:35.420> your<00:03:35.570> guitar<00:03:36.140> or

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
that vibrates and when your guitar or

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.990 
that vibrates and when your guitar or
bass<00:03:37.459> vibrates<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:41.590> crystal<00:03:42.590> sense<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.730> a

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
bass vibrates the crystal sense this a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.150 
bass vibrates the crystal sense this a
signal<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.870> rest<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.350> machine<00:03:45.799> and

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
signal to the rest of the machine and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.130 
signal to the rest of the machine and
that<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:46.790> determines<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.630> children<00:03:47.959> from

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
that it determines the children from

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.960 
that it determines the children from
there<00:03:48.940> right<00:03:49.940> so<00:03:50.390> let's<00:03:50.600> turn<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:50.930> on<00:03:51.080> ooh<00:03:54.970> nice

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
there right so let's turn it on ooh nice

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.670 
there right so let's turn it on ooh nice
orange<00:03:56.420> display

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.850 

position

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.170 

so<00:04:06.910> that's<00:04:07.910> close<00:04:08.180> enough<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:10.280> I'm<00:04:10.820> just<00:04:11.000> gonna

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
so that's close enough so I'm just gonna

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.760 
so that's close enough so I'm just gonna
knock<00:04:11.450> one<00:04:12.230> of<00:04:12.350> my<00:04:12.470> strings<00:04:14.110> out<00:04:15.110> of<00:04:15.260> whack

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
knock one of my strings out of whack

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.490 
knock one of my strings out of whack
just<00:04:16.610> to<00:04:16.700> show<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.630> know<00:04:17.660> how<00:04:17.900> I<00:04:17.930> have<00:04:18.410> it

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
just to show that you know how I have it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.690 
just to show that you know how I have it
actually<00:04:18.560> works<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:21.190> as<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.310> can<00:04:22.400> see<00:04:22.460> it

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
actually works so as you can see it

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.780 
actually works so as you can see it

second a is way out of whack and E the
rest<00:04:37.700> of<00:04:37.850> it<00:04:37.970> should<00:04:38.000> go<00:04:38.240> back<00:04:38.270> into<00:04:38.630> tune<00:04:38.960> when

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
rest of it should go back into tune when

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:58.540 
rest of it should go back into tune when
I<00:04:39.200> have<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.150> string<00:04:41.630> tuned

there<00:04:59.479> you<00:04:59.569> go<00:04:59.900> that's<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:05.740> Virginia<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:06.860> like

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
there you go that's it Virginia I like

the<00:05:07.220> indicator<00:05:08.210> shows<00:05:08.539> as<00:05:08.810> well<00:05:08.979> where<00:05:09.979> they

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
the indicator shows as well where they

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.930 
the indicator shows as well where they

Hall where the machine turns green the
display<00:05:18.889> turns<00:05:19.159> green<00:05:19.490> is<00:05:19.819> very<00:05:20.270> cool<00:05:20.509> for

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
display turns green is very cool for

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.040 
display turns green is very cool for
down<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:22.190> situations<00:05:22.789> and<00:05:22.970> I<00:05:23.180> tend<00:05:23.449> to<00:05:23.479> pin<00:05:23.750> a

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
down the situations and I tend to pin a

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:36.670 
down the situations and I tend to pin a
lot<00:05:24.610> in<00:05:25.610> lower<00:05:25.879> legs<00:05:34.990> so<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.110> actually<00:05:36.289> works

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
lot in lower legs so it actually works

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:49.890 
lot in lower legs so it actually works
really<00:05:37.009> really<00:05:37.220> well<00:05:37.490> for<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:45.220> it's<00:05:46.220> like

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:06:00.730 

that's<00:05:50.900> like<00:05:51.319> a<00:05:51.380> sharp<00:05:58.000> that's<00:05:59.000> it<00:05:59.530> now<00:06:00.530> there

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
that's like a sharp that's it now there

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.809 
that's like a sharp that's it now there
