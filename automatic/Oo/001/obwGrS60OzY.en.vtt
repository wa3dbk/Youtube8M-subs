00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.740
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.680
 further update yes I am just 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.720
 I noticed that for over two years 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.580
 weeks have not made a video or 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.090
 But that does not necessarily hold 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.060
 its sometimes just 1 especially today i am 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.019
 At the beginning you have to build a new market 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.029
 As you can see I have already 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 started so should a basis of 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.460
 republic will be here with one 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.350
 pitch spot for so hct also 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.690
 it should be really big 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.030
 landscape outside so come here 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.739
 come also plates next to it then come 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.289
 here still two gray nevertheless trusts plate 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.000
 and even smaller green so I use 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.140
 most of the plates I have as well 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.270
 already thought about how I think that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.600
 plates cover the right colors 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.320
 So it can be done yes 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.890
 then I wanted to say that oh yes 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.080
 not what should i say 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.010
 is clear 11 and nochwas also to the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.900
 base were indeed so you can see this 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.840
 area for the at &amp; t to be 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 Here , this deterrence before there 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.259
 there is still a single roof on it 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.030
 either already at this altitude or 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.770
 maybe the same height as 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.170
 the next floor because of it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.369
 should be double digits 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.009
 I am not sure yet if I am 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.170
 this yes that is that this that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.740
 main building will be just as high 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:41.700
 like the tt iss to both about it 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:44.490
 because there are times 22 x 22 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.420
 stones is so high the ate 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.939
 So I had to build walls and then roof 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.710
 To put it that then if it 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.149
 this size can not span 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.100
 through beat in turn with his technique 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.140
 which would have to be built resistance 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.469
 So cost would introduce you 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.040
 All these walls would have to be at 22 meters high 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.180
 his 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.140
 and then two more roofs would have to come 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.270
 I will appreciate the stone 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.640
 gray stone 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.240
 are also in combination with the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.600
 light gray constantly here still have 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.130
 probably not possible 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.500
 I have now considered that I only 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.550
 time this top building a bit 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.380
 move higher 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.860
 and because you 'll be what I'm going to 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.330
 I've got that right now , yes 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.340
 even higher if I'm here if I am 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.230
 maybe just 23 here 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.610
 higher power and then there so input 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.980
 It does not really work that way around the outside 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.650
 Part of the building is just so simple 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.540
 son to the second pitch spot if you ever 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.610
 Write if you think that's okay 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.020
 if I'm not in stone because of me 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.690
 an art et ee like this 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.030
 base would make 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.110
 and yes if you ever write that too 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.270
 okay, emergency 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.200
 But I'll be there first 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.350
 maybe try it too 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.660
 use of light gray stones there and 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.740
 through installation of large windows seems 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.410
 save a few stones here 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:19.130
 Another problem is that when I am here 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:22.220
 those days on 22 high yes do that 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.910
 floors are getting high 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.440
 also the building department 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.090
 be a bit high do not like so 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.950
 if the ceiling and until then the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.300
 Room layout only so there it is 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.550
 then it has to be zero sooner 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:40.390
 which in turn many stone food so 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:42.830
 you will see this stone will cost you 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.420
 Sketches made simply still planned 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.250
 that up here on the roof of this 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.350
 the headquarters building twice as a 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.630
 small building on his will the 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.520
 probably do not do that while I'm not 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.980
 I know that I'm two here 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.209
 Do floors so it's for about 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.910
 difficult to understand in any case 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.660
 I have to look like I like the base 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.830
 I can realize that 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.880
 that will definitely be my opinion 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.270
 tantamount here that the two 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.590
 floors will be 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.120
 It was not over that for them 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.790
 its going to be such a hall or now and 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:27.690
 must pitch spot so let's see 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:29.670
 yes this is actually also to the still 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.320
 as far as it is so far so I have 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.640
 said that today started like before 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.890
 bit already installed the costings 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.370
 because I really can all tap here now 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:42.090
 maybe they give more too 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.340
 if you want to install animals in your box 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.500
 you build a base do not pay attention 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.930
 To pull up walls too early and things 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.360
 set and already too high 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.400
 to build 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.400
 clear and correct early details because 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.510
 just one share for such, the walls 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.070
 must install and the weight 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.800
 is frustrating than then the turn 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.680
 to have to tear down times so details 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.670
 detail holder stone left in berne 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:13.260
 to be able to install so that only as 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.030
 small tip good that finally, too 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.880
 Almost in the meantime as happened in 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.720
 Last time, too little moment because I 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.180
 actually select most boxes 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.390
 movie and from the series you so in 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.840
 phase two can do so 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.160
 It is still a komander 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.970
 in the sixth season now before 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.070
 a few weeks ago, club boss ran that 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.140
 but already a gray command 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.950
 I probably will turn up 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.990
 do not do it 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.160
 So did me some time ago that is 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.600
 already a few months ago 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.890
 So suggested the one note of 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:01.380
 baa3 on episode 3 maybe i do 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:05.730
 you still are not good at the moment 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.170
 that is so the current state was so nice 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.270
 that not so many videos are coming though 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.970
 I also have other things to do 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.430
 that's why i can only care about it 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.960
 To take care of 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.050
 So I'll go next time 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.800
 continue working on the basis here 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.530
 and we will still be myself 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.340
 times to the progress in a video 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.990
 I think I'll report well then that's it 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.470
 Thanks a lot for seeing and yeah 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.470
 next time bye
