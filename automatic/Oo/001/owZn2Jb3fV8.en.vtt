00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.030
 hello people youtube 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.010
 see review 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.570
 tripod that begins to deal with the photo 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.450
 or video filming 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:28.380
 sooner or later needs a tripod here 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.500
 there just will be helpful to consider 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.899
 this option in order to be able to 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 choose the one that you like so much 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.810
 the height of this tripod 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.810
 meter three hundred ten centimeters 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.970
 the minimum height that is out 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:57.820
 unfolded state 450 millimeters 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:02.890
 circumference is obtained diameter is 19 5 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:07.030
 millimeters 0 75 kg weighs itself 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:12.820
 the device in the description says that 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:18.390
 he stands up to three kilos that's his 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.390
 opportunities removed rotates 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.750
 height increases 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.750
 and rises like a winch let's open 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:45.850
 so we donâ€™t need a case 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:57.060
 Let's start with a cover case looks good on 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:57.060
 Shoulder and threw forward cellophane 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.440
 inside here we are not afraid of rain yes 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.320
 all souls are weak then not afraid 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.320
 omnipotent leaks 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:23.430
 Pakhomenko Pakhomenko will have to be most 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:29.430
 to stitch even differently with time man 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.430
 bring the right time 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.810
 but also in cellophane 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:46.050
 so to the touch 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.180
 cold aluminum shorter body this 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:54.440
 also aluminum but it is black it 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.440
 plastic so look at your trick 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:08.970
 head like two-sided 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:13.290
 and so you can put it right so to whom 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:22.950
 how to city level period back 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:36.470
 left right level no longtime head 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:41.550
 turns and so and so 2 then walks 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:49.230
 it is so spinning so if we are like that 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:52.010
 twist well, almost no jerking almost the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.010
 up down 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.700
 there is a jerk it will be necessary to be smeared 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.700
 and flying 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:10.220
 when we hold it holds normally when 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.220
 let loose 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:35.919
 then, in principle, as well as the holding 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:38.820
 swan to allow wedge trash already 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.820
 got you see 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:51.150
 otherwise remove the gear dispute whose here 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.150
 full of trash 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:58.660
 in short all jerky course this is not for me 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:03.450
 like with some kind of unreliable mass 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.450
 here the rays here this material is worse 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:19.510
 We will disassemble watch what's inside 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:25.780
 still here goes bad shot so if 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:27.430
 hold the hold well so if 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.260
 it is necessary during the shooting to raise and 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:35.320
 to lower 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:43.330
 walk smartly but who does not need it in 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:47.740
 principle get off brother get off here hook 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:52.090
 no, since it's easy to be here 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:55.229
 hook hook screw hang empty 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.229
 clean and 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:04.220
 In principle, everything is fixed normally 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.550
 buries well 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:26.900
 pressed well does not walk in principle 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:39.000
 no complaints so foot rubber foot 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:43.180
 will keep well in principle 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:49.030
 ok for your price 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:56.160
 quite normal not professional and 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:58.830
 amateur tripod think there are no complaints 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.630
 another one have a tripod 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:08.650
 but its description you can see the top 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:13.720
 Here is a reference a link like this 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.220
 say this is probably all of all 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:21.539
 good lucky shooting 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:21.539
 shopping and everything else for now
