00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.849
 one of the things that makes me feel bad 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.820
 it is the unconditional hatred of the people 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.370
 towards bats unjustified hatred 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.070
 and unjustifiable fruit of the usual 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.150
 stupid clichÃ©s and that's why 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.490
 I want to take care of a category 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.220
 detail of bats and foxes 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.300
 flying it comes see more steakhouses 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.890
 great of the world 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.930
 all belonging to the suborder of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.990
 mega chiroptera and the family of the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.750
 straight podiums of but don't panic for 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.329
 charity are wonderful animals 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.960
 let me explain why 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.690
 meanwhile let's take a look at the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.149
 diffusion of the family or body of that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.239
 includes southern sahara and africa 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.620
 Near East Southeast Asia the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.760
 northern and eastern coasts 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.219
 of Australia and Polynesia are 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.930
 splendid creatures so named for the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.629
 elongated narrow snout similar to that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.070
 foxes actually these mega 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.160
 bats have nothing to do 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.229
 with the foxes properly called them 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.840
 wings are a veritable prodigy of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.729
 nature engineering are established 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.250
 from the passage a membrane of beautiful 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.470
 thin and elastic supported by the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.299
 skeleton of the arm and hand in 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.420
 the latter case I do not speak only of 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.830
 fingers but also metacarpal bones 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.990
 all these bones are stretched e 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.090
 thinned but resistant to time 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.090
 itself modified by the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.799
 evolution to support the flight in 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.770
 many species of foxes flying the tails 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.900
 absent and almost all species 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.590
 unlike micro bats it does not 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.590
 use of ultrasound 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.579
 that means the most meaning 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 used during the flight is the le view 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.360
 flying foxes see us very well and 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.159
 this contrasts with the solid e 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.950
 cloying commonplace that the gist 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.860
 they would make the first finger blind 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.960
 of the hand the thumb is free and fitted 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.939
 of a strong union used by these 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.369
 animals to climb firmly to 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.930
 trees or even in the case of males for 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.490
 fight each other 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.830
 the index that in the micro bats and 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.920
 always included in the passage in 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.780
 flying foxes and partially free le 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.850
 dimensions are really remarkable 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.990
 some species reach one kilo e 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.040
 weight medium and in per opus vampirus 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.470
 considered the largest district to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.480
 world the forearm can measure up to 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.260
 22 cm from the wingspan can 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.590
 reach a glass and a half well 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.700
 dust we give another commonplace 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.490
 many of you will already be thinking 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.610
 these mega pd newsletters that you have to 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.140
 every night liters and liters of blood 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.570
 actually despite their size 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.340
 in flying faces I am absolutely 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.740
 harmless and harmless to humans 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.260
 it is pist rally that feed 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.940
 mainly sugary fruit if 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.660
 some species are also specialized 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.550
 to feed on putting flowers 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.050
 in this way these pistarelli 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.980
 they also become very precious 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.980
 pollinators you are surprised what true 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.300
 you expected from gulan even if you are 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.500
 solitary species 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.600
 most of the flying foxes 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.610
 they are gregarious and live in colonies e 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.110
 also very numerous 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.060
 in this case it is not difficult to see 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.590
 thousands of these mega bats 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.380
 hanging from the trees like so many umbrellas 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.890
 trying to cool off using the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.480
 wings like twenty years most 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.959
 of the species present an activity 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.880
 diurnal but others are crepuscular when 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.680
 the moment the whole colony leaves 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.690
 installers filling the sky to go 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.940
 to procure food 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.350
 there are some cave species but 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.810
 in most cases foxes 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.910
 flying populate the forests coming 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.470
 not infrequently to settle also in the 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.230
 near the city sometimes 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.780
 even from public parks during 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.000
 the breeding season is often for males 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.100
 larger than females struggle between 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.920
 them in a way never too bloody for 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.290
 grab the right to reproduce the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.760
 females have only one small per year e 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.519
 sometimes the animals are treated rather 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.870
 long-lived foxes in captivity 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.440
 they even reach the threshold of 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.870
 thirty years 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.160
 even if in nature life expectancy 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.390
 is certainly the lowest single case among 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.430
 all mammals 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.630
 in some species of flying faces also 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.670
 males are mammary glands 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.049
 active people who are able to breastfeed i 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.840
 little ones 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.400
 the phenomenon is still under study 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.070
 in some scholars suggest that 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.480
 may be an anomaly 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.280
 however the cases of nursing males 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.830
 they are too frequent for it to be 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.910
 of something anomalous 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.710
 could be an evolutionary strategy 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.240
 that would allow the little ones to 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.330
 survive more easily from the first 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.310
 weeks 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.240
 ok what i told you is just the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.130
 tip of the iceberg 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.370
 anyway I told you just a couple 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.680
 of little things on the flying faces of themes 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.120
 now if you think I should have it 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.120
 fear of creatures so incredible 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.430
 how harmless the districts are 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.770
 unique mammals capable of active flying e 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.140
 these in particular feed on 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.300
 fruit and put to get there where 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.650
 are now they have faced a story 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.960
 very special evolutionary ed 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.060
 exceptional coming to conquer i 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.040
 skies and to be unique creatures to the 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.600
 world 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.370
 despite all this now many species 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.770
 they are in danger of disappearing through guilt 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.600
 man who invented a whole 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.460
 series of absurd reasons for hating of 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.460
 distracting them seems fair
