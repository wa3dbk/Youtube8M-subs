00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.200
 hello how are football friends for the 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.090
 band a pleasure to greet you again in 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.300
 this Monday of soccer the subject of today is 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.310
 very simple but before I start 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.590
 I would like to ask you something that is what 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.390
 who want to see what they are interested in seeing in 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.880
 this football channel what I'm going to is that 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.250
 I raise a harlem shake and it has enough 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.289
 visits and I upload a tutorial and it does not have 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.300
 half the visits that the harlem that 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.000
 it makes me think that only you see what 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.400
 it is fashionable to be true will 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.980
 way my question is they want it to go up 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.840
 things like the harlem I follow the drama life 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.090
 or things that are only fashionable in a 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.730
 moment or want to upload content from 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.040
 soccer as the challenges the plays 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.899
 tutorials you tell me there are the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.030
 I leave homework and I wait for your answers 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.980
 so that I can check it and so I can do 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.840
 what you want to see but good 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.309
 after these very deep words 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.309
 let's give it the topic today not 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.360
 surely you have the ball removed by 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.430
 more that protects you if you protect it there's no 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.750
 exercises and very simple ways to 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.750
 Properly protect the ball 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.100
 at the entrance you must use both feet 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.500
 when you protect the ball this in case you 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.210
 rival wants to take it from you on the one hand 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.789
 it will be easier to go to the other side 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.590
 the two profiles are handled in this case 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.899
 the two players are very good in a 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.140
 handsome, which is impossible to take away the 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.140
 ball 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.550
 I do not 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.550
 no one 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.000
 or there's the classic back surcharge 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.680
 so that at least you miss this 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.320
 is the most used by the players since 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.300
 has two great advantages, one that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.220
 moment when you give the accolade the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.230
 otherwise it will heat up 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.620
 will try harder to take away the 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.660
 ball and the second is that due to its 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.640
 excessive force you with just putting 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.680
 soft your body will cause a lack 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.670
 and so you will win the duel to protect the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.830
 a little crafty ball but you won it 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.349
 Of course there are also some actions in 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.730
 the wide and this safe technique is applied 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.730
 they are going to mark a lack in favor 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.020
 ah 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.270
 although sometimes you do not know what foot you 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.270
 it hurt 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.489
 I do not know Basque 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.409
 but be careful because you heat up your 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.409
 rival and it can hurt you 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.349
 inside 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.580
 lowering the shorts sometimes result 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.440
 who has not used his hands to 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.600
 protecting the ball is also a bad 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.640
 because it is not allowed if the 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.620
 referee would like to mark missing but there 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.780
 some arbiters here in Mexico that stops 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.340
 I tell you, there must be a fracture 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.860
 exposed of tibia and fibula- so that 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.630
 Mark missing but this handy to use 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.400
 the hand also serves a lot because 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.740
 so you have more distance from the ball to your 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.840
 rival that that is the joke of protecting 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.120
 the ball keep as far away from the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.770
 ball to your opponent in some cases 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.490
 you can apply wrestling and 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.490
 come out ahead 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.460
 because if he is your rival he knows how to dance 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
 do not 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.260
 what I was telling you, you have to 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.270
 practically kill your rival so that 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.270
 I miss you if nobody saw anything 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.660
 no no 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.470
 now the hardest protects the ball 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.680
 without using the feet in order that everything 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.390
 your body use it to take care of the ball 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.440
 do what you can to not let 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.120
 take your ball 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.120
 remember the ball is your friend 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.729
 or you can apply mine or nobody's 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.320
 no no no 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.080
 yes 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.050
 i 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.660
 but there is a pretty flirty exercise 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.650
 to protect the ball 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.650
 search 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.360
 the exercise is about taking away or 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.940
 point the ball to your partner but 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.950
 without losing control of your ball or 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.960
 that everyone will have a ball to 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.300
 protect and everyone will take care of 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.520
 tap the other's ball without losing 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.520
 seen his among more players better 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.110
 And form 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.550
 yes 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.010
 practice this exercise with your friends 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.720
 in fact the exercise will be better if there 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.760
 more friends here in dotting them the value 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.470
 the more friends the better the more 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.210
 fun now that you know how to 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.160
 protect the ball and that this never 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.570
 Fashion will see you next 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.100
