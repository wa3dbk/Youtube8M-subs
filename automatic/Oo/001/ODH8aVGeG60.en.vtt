00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
the cup all the way so I tried to

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.619 
the cup all the way so I tried to
stretch<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.579> out<00:02:53.670> just<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:54.030> little<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.390> more

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
stretch it out just a little bit more

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.110 
stretch it out just a little bit more
and<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:56.040> time<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.459> went<00:02:56.609> a<00:02:56.760> little<00:02:56.879> bit<00:02:57.060> too

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
and this time it went a little bit too

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.300 
and this time it went a little bit too
far<00:02:57.569> so<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.260> took<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.470> scissors<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
far so I just took a scissors and I

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.960 
far so I just took a scissors and I
snipped<00:02:59.609> it<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.260> then<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.940> stick<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
snipped it and then you just stick the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.780 
snipped it and then you just stick the
two<00:03:03.359> ends<00:03:03.599> together<00:03:04.220> I'd<00:03:05.220> recommend<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
two ends together I'd recommend that

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.759 
two ends together I'd recommend that
once<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.180> start<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.599> wrap<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.200> Tootsie<00:03:07.500> Roll

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
it with cooking spray first because it

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.910 
it with cooking spray first because it
really<00:03:11.849> starts<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.329> stick<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> cup<00:03:13.140> now

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
at Walmart at first I thought that I

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.539 
at Walmart at first I thought that I
would<00:03:24.989> just<00:03:25.200> put<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.380> few<00:03:25.650> sprinkles<00:03:25.980> into<00:03:26.430> the

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
would just put a few sprinkles into the

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.759 
would just put a few sprinkles into the
bowl<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.030> then<00:03:27.060> put<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.870> tipsy<00:03:28.169> roll<00:03:28.349> in<00:03:28.560> it

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
bowl and then put the tipsy roll in it

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.710 
bowl and then put the tipsy roll in it
and<00:03:28.950> just<00:03:29.130> sprinkle<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.609> few<00:03:29.940> more<00:03:30.150> sprinkles

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
and just sprinkle a few more sprinkles

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.349 
and just sprinkle a few more sprinkles
on<00:03:30.989> top<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.680> get<00:03:31.859> it<00:03:31.950> coated<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.090> didn't

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
on top to get it coated but it didn't

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.680 
on top to get it coated but it didn't
turn<00:03:33.540> out<00:03:33.569> well<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:35.519> then<00:03:35.669> I<00:03:35.700> decided<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.269> just

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
turn out well so then I decided to just

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.900 
turn out well so then I decided to just
pour<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.500> ton<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.769> sprinkles<00:03:38.310> into<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.730> bowl

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
and then dip it in and that worked a lot

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.280 
and then dip it in and that worked a lot
