00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
in the game but I did do some research

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.850 
in the game but I did do some research
on<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.149> there's<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.420> picture<00:00:56.660> of<00:00:56.899> it<00:00:57.020> it

just says Hagel three hornet but does

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.590 
just says Hagel three hornet but does
say<00:01:00.200> police<00:01:00.530> on<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:01.879> might<00:01:02.210> be<00:01:02.239> in<00:01:02.510> the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
say police on it so it might be in the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.449 
say police on it so it might be in the
game<00:01:02.780> but<00:01:03.260> what<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.500> like<00:01:03.710> about<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:04.009> is<00:01:04.189> that<00:01:04.219> it

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:04.459 
game but what I like about it is that it

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.209 
game but what I like about it is that it
does<00:01:04.639> have<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.299> new<00:01:05.479> Mombasa<00:01:05.840> I<00:01:06.229> guess<00:01:06.979> look

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.219 
does have the new Mombasa I guess look

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.160 
does have the new Mombasa I guess look
to<00:01:07.399> it<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.700> police<00:01:08.389> look<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.719> it<00:01:08.810> because<00:01:09.049> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
to it a police look to it because the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.959 
to it a police look to it because the
police<00:01:09.289> pelican<00:01:09.829> is<00:01:10.009> that<00:01:10.219> nice<00:01:10.459> gray<00:01:10.729> color

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
police pelican is that nice gray color

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.849 
police pelican is that nice gray color
with<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.240> white<00:01:11.359> stuff<00:01:11.569> on<00:01:11.719> it<00:01:11.780> but<00:01:12.469> I<00:01:12.499> really

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
with the white stuff on it but I really

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.459 
with the white stuff on it but I really
wish<00:01:13.069> that<00:01:13.340> on<00:01:13.749> mega<00:01:14.749> bucks<00:01:15.020> made<00:01:15.229> something

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
wish that on mega bucks made something

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.190 
wish that on mega bucks made something
different<00:01:15.950> than<00:01:16.039> a<00:01:16.130> vehicle<00:01:16.749> for<00:01:17.749> new<00:01:17.869> Mombasa

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
different than a vehicle for new Mombasa

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.539 
different than a vehicle for new Mombasa
because<00:01:18.560> all<00:01:18.709> we're<00:01:18.829> getting<00:01:18.920> from<00:01:19.189> this<00:01:19.310> halo

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
because all we're getting from this halo

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.889 
because all we're getting from this halo
line<00:01:19.789> is<00:01:19.939> vehicles<00:01:20.389> and<00:01:20.569> vehicles<00:01:20.869> and

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
line is vehicles and vehicles and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.840 
line is vehicles and vehicles and
vehicles<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:21.529> believe<00:01:22.159> literally<00:01:22.520> like<00:01:22.729> the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
vehicles I believe literally like the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.399 
vehicles I believe literally like the
only<00:01:23.029> says<00:01:23.450> there<00:01:23.659> aren't<00:01:23.810> vehicles<00:01:24.289> that

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
only says there aren't vehicles that

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.309 
only says there aren't vehicles that
we've<00:01:24.529> gotten<00:01:25.569> have<00:01:26.569> been<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:26.959> the<00:01:27.139> high

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
we've gotten have been like the high

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.980 
we've gotten have been like the high
ground<00:01:27.590> set<00:01:27.889> in<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.039> ODST<00:01:28.549> ambush<00:01:28.999> so<00:01:29.630> those

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
ground set in the ODST ambush so those

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.269 
ground set in the ODST ambush so those
were<00:01:30.139> really<00:01:30.259> good<00:01:30.469> sets<00:01:30.679> honestly<00:01:31.099> so<00:01:31.249> I

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:31.279 
were really good sets honestly so I

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:33.069 
were really good sets honestly so I
really<00:01:31.819> wish<00:01:32.029> that<00:01:32.240> they<00:01:32.389> did<00:01:32.569> that<00:01:32.599> instead

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
really wish that they did that instead

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.980 
really wish that they did that instead
of<00:01:33.139> a<00:01:33.289> hornik<00:01:33.619> since<00:01:33.859> we<00:01:33.979> just<00:01:34.340> got<00:01:34.729> one<00:01:34.990> in

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
of a hornik since we just got one in

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.319 
of a hornik since we just got one in
2013<00:01:36.709> and<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.889> wish<00:01:37.279> that<00:01:37.490> they<00:01:37.700> would<00:01:37.819> have<00:01:37.939> but

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
2013 and I wish that they would have but

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.940 
2013 and I wish that they would have but
this<00:01:38.450> looks<00:01:38.630> brand<00:01:38.990> new<00:01:39.079> which<00:01:39.319> is<00:01:39.469> nice<00:01:39.649> but<00:01:39.889> I

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
this looks brand new which is nice but I

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.199 
this looks brand new which is nice but I
just<00:01:40.159> wish<00:01:40.340> they<00:01:40.520> would<00:01:40.670> given<00:01:40.880> us<00:01:41.060> some

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
just wish they would given us some

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.550 
just wish they would given us some
bootable<00:01:41.599> structure<00:01:41.990> like<00:01:42.079> a<00:01:42.139> building

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
bootable structure like a building

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.199 
bootable structure like a building
because<00:01:43.099> we<00:01:43.249> don't<00:01:43.399> really<00:01:43.520> get<00:01:43.789> that<00:01:43.849> from

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
because we don't really get that from

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.139 
because we don't really get that from
the<00:01:44.329> online<00:01:44.630> as<00:01:44.899> much<00:01:45.109> and<00:01:45.490> that's<00:01:46.490> basically

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
the online as much and that's basically

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.609 
the online as much and that's basically
my<00:01:47.389> only<00:01:47.689> complaints<00:01:48.139> about<00:01:48.229> this<00:01:48.469> I'm

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
my only complaints about this I'm

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.749 
my only complaints about this I'm
definitely<00:01:48.740> gonna<00:01:48.979> buy<00:01:49.219> it<00:01:49.279> because<00:01:49.429> it<00:01:49.609> looks

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
definitely gonna buy it because it looks

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.459 
definitely gonna buy it because it looks
really<00:01:49.939> cool<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:50.630> really<00:01:50.899> excited<00:01:51.079> to<00:01:51.319> see

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
the figures I just really wish that we

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.209 
the figures I just really wish that we
would<00:01:53.810> have<00:01:53.929> either<00:01:54.079> gotten<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.859> police

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219

Pelican and you know that would have

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.269 
Pelican and you know that would have
