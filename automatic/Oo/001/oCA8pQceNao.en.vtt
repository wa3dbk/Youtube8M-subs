00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hello there pass fans, I hope you can 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.980
 see me reasonably well behind this 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.580
 ungetüm you look at the rhine 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.080
 driven testberichte.de to the second 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.670
 version because the first version unfortunately 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.230
 I have absolutely nothing 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.779
 not to lose so much time 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.539
 im trying to save something 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.019
 but just a new version directly 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.930
 rotate 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.400
 I'm doing this now and want the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.529
 opportunity to use it very quickly 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.780
 three people to grow up with me 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.050
 always wanted and that are 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.300
 It could rosenberg the pattern and ramon 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.399
 dibovski and in a thing of mine 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 Now again quickly to alessandro 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.230
 thanks again for the motto 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.590
 this beautiful end time helms the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.850
 you sometimes see in the often pictures 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.579
 could 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.420
 that is the remnant of the first 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.010
 version of my rainer celebration 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.030
 We do not have time to drive 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.300
 We'll jump on it in my video 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.930
 you learn everything about the external 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.430
 the mode of operation the range and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.350
 the modding potential 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 The freedom of travel is a big one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.450
 heavy stationary protected with two 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.070
 Runs that are agile I come 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.049
 just 225 shot formula magazine 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.689
 a double pistol handle and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.380
 a thumbsome state of the engines 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.180
 function wise is similar to with 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.880
 another stay blaster we have one 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.310
 two-stage mechanism so to speak 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.439
 here it is integrated into a switch 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.390
 at rapid strike or streak then 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.460
 just two different buttons is the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.430
 same namely only times the motors on 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.490
 Run tours and then deduction 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.820
 gangs by pressing then really 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.990
 echoes and hunts through the runs 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.700
 Of course , it's the celebration that's special 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.210
 cool that people move when you 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.210
 man shoots 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.479
 who necessarily wants, the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:14.690
 Christmas party also use the mobile 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.580
 Three slaughterhouse appetit so 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.690
 However , it is in this direction and 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.890
 pretty much in that direction 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.530
 movable i therefore prefer that 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.240
 three legged to fold back here 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 It can be a bit of a snap 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.390
 you could make a rubber band room 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.209
 make it a little bit better 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.300
 is fixed 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.459
 in this position again one 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.280
 fixation desired better do not live 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.350
 worked out that way 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.730
 for mobile use, here 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.500
 front a grab handle 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.150
 That was in the election , however, one 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.650
 a little bit better here is pretty 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.840
 small and i have my finger here 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.120
 pure squeeze that is not so nice 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.750
 however, there are beautiful strap points around 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.640
 make a loop to tie that up 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.220
 Thing over the shoulder can throw that 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.870
 we are not very nice and the rail serves 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.330
 as a carry handle two short thing still the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.959
 nice long tactical because here I am 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.370
 mentions offers itself to 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.230
 Target device of the lonza or recall 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.660
 I think they pretty much take that up 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.580
 cool from what are these two little ones now 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.470
 rails on the magazine 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.420
 because now it does not strike me now 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.360
 not one which one it as effectively 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.709
 could build and finish the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.080
 known troubleshooting flap in 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:38.489
 Of course, I'm directly on the topic 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.350
 Technology and performance are the keywords 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.780
 technology and performance has with the 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.730
 Rainer scoured almost 900 because of two chances 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.099
 also about the sport 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.980
 Thank you, I invite you personally 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.750
 surprised himself de 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.330
 Really also read that there are people 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.750
 gives my freedom your problems 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.970
 do not take that fight 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.010
 the country may fix this and we 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.940
 lubricate and so on I recommend 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.739
 you who it is time to look around before 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.730
 not necessarily bastian wants and before that 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.310
 recoils this thing 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.370
 write down it should screw up 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.989
 really do not do that because it really does 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.810
 easier the thing easy too 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.160
 reclaim and exchange or 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.350
 just to put it back and say that 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.199
 The thing is broken because it is effective 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.389
 broken if it is constantly stuck so it 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.550
 seems to be that you pretty much 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.360
 many badly processed models on 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.729
 to come to the market 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.130
 I think it's new 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.740
 not unusual because here in the one 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.500
 4 mass must be produced and there 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.080
 stop in the quality control 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.250
 obviously comes to problems 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.490
 standard range on average so 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.800
 16 17 meters at one shot frequency 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.200
 from about 23 to 10 seconds 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.700
 that in the cut again in more detail if 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.300
 not then should stand in the 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.300
 subtitle 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.800
 to the mobbing potential i have the whole 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.480
 then I operated at 15 volts 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:36.380
 four lithium ion batteries were installed 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:39.340
 and 2 dami batteries and thus that in 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:44.720
 I have the battery compartment fits here 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:47.330
 double a built on b cell adapter 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.070
 the frequency would have doubled 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.500
 i say like i said i would like it 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.450
 cut again and pax in the 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.960
 subtitle also is different 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.790
 should 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.560
 The range has not been that strong 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.390
 I would say changed that speaks 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.940
 for me that in a flat 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.790
 The fire safety system has been installed 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.600
 lead to an increase in the 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.640
 voltage is not above a certain value 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.040
 exponentially mean more reach 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.170
 as was the case with the xbox 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.170
 I'm assuming that's here too 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:22.400
 for the parents this at the stairs 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:25.570
 Strikes are also going over 11 volts 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.070
 I want to get around one 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.260
 redistribution of electricity and then on 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.740
 best case even nine engines 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:37.010
 not high so the ring of fire review 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.520
 2.0 is through I hope he was eloquent 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:42.200
 and stringently recited and also in 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.340
 the length as compact as it only 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.100
 somehow was possible 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.650
 The series is not just a big team 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.510
 in terms of length but also what 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.400
 the price 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.940
 who values ​​style and something big 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.680
 needs to reinforce his arguments 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.130
 I look mainly in stock 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.160
 because as I said alone visually that is 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.180
 It's really a momentum and before me 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
 now the video and again 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.710
 Artificially pulling I say 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.150
 bye bye up and down to 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.680
 that's very good 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.680
 yes credits
