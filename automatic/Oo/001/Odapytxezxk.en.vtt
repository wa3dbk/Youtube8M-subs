have<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.199> eighth<00:00:19.380> scale<00:00:19.590> performance<00:00:20.250> what

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
have that eighth scale performance what

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.410 
have that eighth scale performance what
we<00:00:21.000> tried<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.750> take<00:00:22.380> our<00:00:22.619> eighth<00:00:23.130> scale

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
we tried to do is take our eighth scale

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.570 
we tried to do is take our eighth scale
chassis<00:00:24.420> scale<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.289> down<00:00:25.320> into<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> 10<00:00:26.310> scale

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580

platform<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.390> slightly<00:00:28.230> overpower<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.980> as

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
platform and slightly overpower it as

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.349 
platform and slightly overpower it as
the<00:00:29.310> eight<00:00:29.429> scales<00:00:29.730> are<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.179> basically

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the eight scales are so you basically

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
the eight scales are so you basically
you<00:00:30.750> get<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> 8th<00:00:31.349> scale<00:00:31.619> type<00:00:31.859> performance

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
you get that 8th scale type performance

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.030 
you get that 8th scale type performance
and<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> 10<00:00:32.730> scale<00:00:32.969> model<00:00:33.500> now<00:00:34.500> Gary<00:00:34.680> walk<00:00:34.890> us

going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> love<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.460> they<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:47.700> guess

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
going to love that and if they I guess

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
going to love that and if they I guess
if<00:01:48.060> they<00:01:48.149> stall<00:01:48.420> out<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> track<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.560> can

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
if they stall out on the track they can

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.020 
if they stall out on the track they can
easily<00:01:49.979> fire<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.399> engine<00:01:50.670> again<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
easily fire the engine again with that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.030 
easily fire the engine again with that
push<00:01:51.330> start<00:01:51.540> button<00:01:51.570> yeah<00:01:52.259> needless<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.860> say

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
push start button yeah needless to say

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.620 
push start button yeah needless to say
during<00:01:53.220> our<00:01:53.430> development<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.479> had

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
during our development you know we had

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.109 
during our development you know we had
Adam<00:01:55.290> Drake<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.770> I'm<00:01:55.830> Todd<00:01:56.460> Hodge<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.729> some

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
Adam Drake and I'm Todd Hodge and some

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.029 
Adam Drake and I'm Todd Hodge and some
of<00:01:57.210> our<00:01:57.270> drivers<00:01:57.690> helping<00:01:57.990> us<00:01:58.080> out<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.259> some

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
of our drivers helping us out with some

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.820 
of our drivers helping us out with some
of<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.190> durability<00:01:59.580> tests<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.240> whatnot<00:02:00.830> they

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
of the durability tests and whatnot they

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.880 
of the durability tests and whatnot they
found<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> their<00:02:02.550> liking<00:02:02.929> no<00:02:03.929> we<00:02:04.110> flame<00:02:04.710> out

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
found it to their liking no we flame out

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.070 
found it to their liking no we flame out
on<00:02:05.039> there<00:02:05.220> whatever<00:02:05.460> stop<00:02:06.060> died<00:02:06.330> being<00:02:06.750> upside

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
on there whatever stop died being upside

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.509 
on there whatever stop died being upside
down<00:02:07.289> or<00:02:07.470> whatever<00:02:07.590> by<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.950> time<00:02:08.190> somebody

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
down or whatever by the time somebody

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.740 
down or whatever by the time somebody
got<00:02:08.700> there<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> they<00:02:09.209> could<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.539> press<00:02:09.690> that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
got there and they could just press that

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.620 
got there and they could just press that
button<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.410> drive<00:02:11.069> away<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:12.180> Kari<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
button and drive away now Kari can you

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.059 
button and drive away now Kari can you
talk<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> little<00:02:12.989> bit<00:02:13.260> about<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.560> drivetrain

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
talk a little bit about the drivetrain

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.370 
talk a little bit about the drivetrain
they<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.519> three<00:02:14.550> oil<00:02:15.030> field

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
they just have three oil field

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.540 
they just have three oil field
differentials<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.620> see<00:02:16.769> in<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> 80<00:02:17.100> and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
differentials like you see in the 80 and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.130 
differentials like you see in the 80 and
the<00:02:17.610> losi<00:02:17.850> eight<00:02:18.000> yeah<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.600> got<00:02:18.780> its<00:02:18.989> got

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the losi eight yeah it's got its got

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.470 
the losi eight yeah it's got its got
three<00:02:19.380> gear<00:02:19.800> differentials<00:02:20.489> pretty<00:02:21.360> much

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
three gear differentials pretty much

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.630 
three gear differentials pretty much
just<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.050> eight<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.380> they<00:02:23.040> come<00:02:23.310> out<00:02:23.580> of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
just like the eight as they come out of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.809 
just like the eight as they come out of
the<00:02:23.760> box<00:02:24.060> they're<00:02:24.420> filled<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:24.720> grease

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
the box they're filled with grease

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.729 
the box they're filled with grease
grease<00:02:26.819> tends<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.209> be<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> little<00:02:27.450> more

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
grease tends to be a little more

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.289 
grease tends to be a little more
forgiving<00:02:28.739> it's<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.950> little<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.970> just

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
forgiving it's a little it's just

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.449 
forgiving it's a little it's just
basically<00:02:30.600> having<00:02:30.989> lightweight<00:02:31.890> silicone

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
basically having lightweight silicone

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.250 
basically having lightweight silicone
they<00:02:33.030> are<00:02:33.209> sealed<00:02:33.510> differentials<00:02:34.140> so

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
they are sealed differentials so

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.810 
they are sealed differentials so
obviously<00:02:34.560> they<00:02:34.709> can<00:02:34.920> be<00:02:35.070> made<00:02:35.250> viscous<00:02:35.640> if

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
obviously they can be made viscous if

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.020 
obviously they can be made viscous if
the<00:02:35.970> consumer<00:02:36.510> decides<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.200> do<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.760> front

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
the consumer decides to do so the front

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.850 
the consumer decides to do so the front
and<00:02:39.209> rear<00:02:39.510> ring<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.110> pinion<00:02:40.380> gears<00:02:40.620> are

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
and rear ring and pinion gears are

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.920 
and rear ring and pinion gears are
spiral<00:02:41.579> cut<00:02:41.850> they're<00:02:42.450> not<00:02:42.630> your<00:02:42.780> typical

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
spiral cut they're not your typical

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.020 
spiral cut they're not your typical
bevel<00:02:43.620> cut<00:02:43.829> gears<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.340> they're<00:02:44.489> capable<00:02:44.640> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
bevel cut gears so they're capable of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.650 
bevel cut gears so they're capable of
handling<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.900> horsepower<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.970> new<00:02:47.970> 3.4

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
handling the horsepower that the new 3.4

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.530 
handling the horsepower that the new 3.4
engine<00:02:48.989> produces<00:02:49.500> which<00:02:49.680> again<00:02:50.540> four-wheel

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
engine produces which again four-wheel

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.770 
engine produces which again four-wheel

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
drive a scale type platform slightly

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.199

be available for this truck is those
going<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.910> be<00:03:02.970> available<00:03:03.180> right<00:03:03.600> out<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> gate

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
going to be available right out the gate

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.360 
going to be available right out the gate

will<00:03:05.670> we<00:03:05.730> expect<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> see<00:03:06.239> some<00:03:06.269> items<00:03:06.780> no<00:03:07.170> it's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
will we expect to see some items no it's

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.509 
will we expect to see some items no it's
funny<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.680> ask<00:03:07.859> that<00:03:07.980> during<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
funny you ask that during the

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.690 
funny you ask that during the
development<00:03:09.060> we<00:03:09.780> started<00:03:10.470> using<00:03:10.680> we<00:03:10.950> got<00:03:11.489> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
development we started using we got the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.270 
development we started using we got the
many<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.810> option<00:03:13.290> parts<00:03:13.560> done<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.100> put

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
many of the option parts done and we put

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.000 
many of the option parts done and we put
them<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.609> truck<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.500> they<00:03:16.500> work<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:16.980> well

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
them on the truck and they work so well

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.940 
them on the truck and they work so well
and<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.640> really<00:03:18.109> upgraded<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.320> value<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.859> it

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
and that really upgraded the value of it

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.920 
and that really upgraded the value of it
so<00:03:20.160> much<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.730> pretty<00:03:20.940> much<00:03:21.030> opted<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.570> put<00:03:21.720> most

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
so much we pretty much opted to put most

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.020 
so much we pretty much opted to put most
of<00:03:22.109> those<00:03:22.200> options<00:03:22.739> on<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.190> truck<00:03:23.430> as<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.820> see
