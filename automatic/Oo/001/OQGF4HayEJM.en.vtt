just<00:00:05.940> push<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.330> washer<00:00:06.480> up<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:06.990> there<00:00:07.649> it

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
just push the washer up and there it

normally<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.369> flying<00:00:23.640> discs<00:00:24.060> are<00:00:24.210> spun<00:00:24.510> by

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
normally the flying discs are spun by

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.740 
normally the flying discs are spun by
hand<00:00:25.430> but<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> very<00:00:26.970> convenient<00:00:27.480> toy

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
hand but this is a very convenient toy

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.370 
hand but this is a very convenient toy
with<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> twisted<00:00:28.859> stick<00:00:29.630> we<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.810> insert<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
with a twisted stick we can insert the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.389 
with a twisted stick we can insert the
disc<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.460> twisted<00:00:32.969> stick<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.309> with<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
disc in this twisted stick and with the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.369 
disc in this twisted stick and with the
washer<00:00:35.840> when<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.989> push<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.260> disc<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:39.379> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
washer when we push the disc up the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.959 
washer when we push the disc up the
twist<00:00:40.739> causes<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> disc<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.329> spin<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.850> if<00:00:44.850> we

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
twist causes the disc to spin and if we

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.220 
twist causes the disc to spin and if we
push<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.450> washer<00:00:46.410> fast<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:48.270> disc<00:00:48.510> spins<00:00:48.899> very

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
push the washer fast the disc spins very

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.310 
push the washer fast the disc spins very
fast<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.579> toy<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.820> very<00:00:51.210> simple<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
fast the toy is very simple and the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
fast the toy is very simple and the
science<00:00:52.649> behind<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.070> extremely

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
science behind it is extremely

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.420 
science behind it is extremely
interesting<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.629> disc<00:00:54.870> spins<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.500> moves<00:00:56.100> in

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
interesting the disc spins and moves in

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.000 
interesting the disc spins and moves in
the<00:00:56.640> direction<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:57.149> push<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the direction we push it it is the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
the direction we push it it is the
angular<00:00:59.370> momentum<00:01:00.000> which<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.690> actually

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
angular momentum which is actually

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.560 
angular momentum which is actually
vertical<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.770> stabilizes<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.640> disc<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.480> if

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
vertical that stabilizes this disc so if

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.929 
vertical that stabilizes this disc so if
the<00:01:03.690> disc<00:01:03.899> were<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.320> spinning<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.700> just

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the disc were not spinning it will just

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.140 
the disc were not spinning it will just
crash<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> ground<00:01:07.760> just<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.090> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
crash on the ground just like in a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.960 
crash on the ground just like in a
helicopter<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> tail<00:01:11.280> rotor<00:01:11.520> which

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
helicopter we have a tail rotor which

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.780 
helicopter we have a tail rotor which
stabilizes<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:13.590> shape<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> disc<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> also

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
stabilizes the shape of the disc is also

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300 
stabilizes the shape of the disc is also
aerodynamic<00:01:15.590> like<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> wing<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> plane

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
aerodynamic like the wing of the plane

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.910 
aerodynamic like the wing of the plane
which<00:01:18.150> creates<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> low<00:01:18.780> pressure<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
which creates a low pressure so that the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.020 
which creates a low pressure so that the
disc<00:01:20.280> rises<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> air<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> go<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.310> like

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
disc rises up in the air so go out like

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.980 
disc rises up in the air so go out like
these<00:01:24.240> children<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.490> have<00:01:26.490> fun<00:01:27.060> with<00:01:27.780> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
these children and have fun with this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.300 
these children and have fun with this
simple<00:01:28.740> flying<00:01:29.100> disc

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.950 

I<00:01:34.430> hope<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.090> enjoy<00:01:35.360> playing<00:01:35.600> with<00:01:35.720> that

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
I hope you enjoy playing with that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.469 
I hope you enjoy playing with that
flying<00:01:36.710> disc<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.250> now<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:37.880> time<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.119> think

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
flying disc and now it's time to think

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.109 
flying disc and now it's time to think
we<00:01:39.110> had<00:01:39.259> this<00:01:39.439> twisted<00:01:39.950> stick<00:01:40.250> which<00:01:40.640> we<00:01:40.820> used

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
we had this twisted stick which we used

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.990 
we had this twisted stick which we used
to<00:01:41.299> make<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.630> disc<00:01:41.840> spin<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:43.460> basically<00:01:43.850> a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
to make the disc spin it is basically a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.510 
to make the disc spin it is basically a
rectangular<00:01:44.180> strip<00:01:44.770> one<00:01:45.770> centimeter<00:01:46.340> wide

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
rectangular strip one centimeter wide

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.840 
rectangular strip one centimeter wide
which<00:01:47.180> we<00:01:47.360> twisted<00:01:47.750> around<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:49.100> how<00:01:49.310> long<00:01:49.579> of<00:01:49.759> a

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
which we twisted around so how long of a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.730 
which we twisted around so how long of a
rectangular<00:01:50.390> strip<00:01:50.450> do<00:01:50.840> we<00:01:50.960> need<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.590> make

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
rectangular strip do we need to make

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.779 
rectangular strip do we need to make
this<00:01:51.950> twisted<00:01:52.820> spiral<00:01:53.390> stick<00:01:54.310> one<00:01:55.310> centimeter

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
this twisted spiral stick one centimeter

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.230 
this twisted spiral stick one centimeter
