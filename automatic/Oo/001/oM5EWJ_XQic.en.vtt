00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Heikkinen markus know here again 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.029
 Algarve in Portugal in Albufeira 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.470
 exactly at the same and partly own place has 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:14.009
 something changed for you or 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.599
 for the crew , well, the weather 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.080
 maybe little different than 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.519
 last time 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:28.369
 now does not have that much 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:32.309
 give sunshine and maybe also 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:37.340
 the theme is a little different in others 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:41.010
 side of awd- but otherwise everything was fine 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.309
 how are the trends going from 2 1 am 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.930
 day but again taken the same place 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.510
 The training looks more intense 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:56.670
 imagine the rulebook times yours 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:58.199
 Impressions for the players that the guests 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.190
 have played 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.610
 training is not so intense 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.490
 but the one who did not 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.080
 to have played is to see because she will 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.030
 Two days certainly yesterday the first 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.049
 test in conferences zero to zero 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.729
 went out 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.460
 Nevertheless, it was a very fast game 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.869
 maybe that surprised you or 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.640
 Do you think the next tests were 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:34.110
 Of course we do not have it that way 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.030
 Many of the games are done and training 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.570
 has been very intense in vienna so 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:47.450
 Think every game will be difficult 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.450
 because of tired legs and so on 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.159
 The quality of the opponent has a bit 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.899
 Surprised they were not so 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.869
 bad for third division 1 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.860
 technically very strong but we look 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.000
 like the wheel on sunday 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.890
 what do you expect of yourself 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.450
 training camp where do you want in the end 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.160
 of the training camp stand with the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.720
 Condition her fully fit for the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.250
 championship or needed one more 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:24.030
 bit and it is good that there is one more 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:27.720
 gap-back when we return 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.579
 in vienna there are only two weeks left 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:37.230
 championship so fitness has always been 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.519
 quite near from our best form 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.739
 his and then 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.450
 it's more about little things so here 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:52.650
 we will work very intensively and 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:55.410
 Then then the hardest phase is believed 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.489
 behind us we were back in vienna 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.780
 neither are they all right 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.870
 rapid-fans still say something no not 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.870
 really 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.200
 Thank you 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.950
 You're welcome
