00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
the biggest place we've seen the impact

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.780 
the biggest place we've seen the impact
of<00:02:26.379> that<00:02:26.439> inaudible<00:02:26.709> offense<00:02:27.129> is<00:02:27.249> on<00:02:27.370> defense

of that inaudible offense is on defense

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.640 
of that inaudible offense is on defense
where<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.599> Huskies<00:02:28.780> are<00:02:28.959> used<00:02:29.109> to<00:02:29.200> practicing

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
where the Huskies are used to practicing

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.929 
where the Huskies are used to practicing
against<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.189> type<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.400> offense<00:02:30.549> and

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
against that type of offense and

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.819 
against that type of offense and
practicing<00:02:31.389> at<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.659> pace<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.680> are

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
practicing at that pace and are

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.020 
practicing at that pace and are

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
that pace and that will I think continue

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.129 
that pace and that will I think continue

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.490

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
return after the safety in the second

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.730 
return after the safety in the second
corner<00:05:09.240> which<00:05:09.960> said<00:05:10.140> that<00:05:10.169> he's<00:05:10.500> up<00:05:10.590> for<00:05:10.710> the

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
corner which said that he's up for the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.409 
corner which said that he's up for the
field<00:05:10.980> of<00:05:11.100> all<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.280> put<00:05:11.400> him<00:05:11.490> up<00:05:11.550> 11<00:05:11.880> nothing<00:05:12.150> I

field of all to put him up 11 nothing I

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.880 
field of all to put him up 11 nothing I
think<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:12.930> was<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.110> big<00:05:13.230> jump<00:05:13.470> going<00:05:13.770> from

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
think that was a big jump going from

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.530 
think that was a big jump going from
eight<00:05:14.010> to<00:05:14.130> 11<00:05:14.430> making<00:05:14.640> it<00:05:14.700> she<00:05:14.910> score<00:05:15.150> game<00:05:15.300> for

eight to 11 making it she score game for

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.540 
eight to 11 making it she score game for
them<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:15.870> I<00:05:16.710> mean<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:16.950> crab<00:05:17.160> of<00:05:17.310> southern

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
them and I mean the crab of southern

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.890 
them and I mean the crab of southern
doing<00:05:17.730> at<00:05:17.790> that<00:05:17.820> point<00:05:18.180> before<00:05:18.360> everyone<00:05:18.750> left

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
doing at that point before everyone left

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.020 
doing at that point before everyone left
because<00:05:19.200> it<00:05:19.320> or<00:05:19.440> an<00:05:19.560> exact<00:05:19.919> I<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.790> kind<00:05:20.940> of

because it or an exact I that kind of

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.400 
because it or an exact I that kind of
that<00:05:21.180> was<00:05:21.270> really<00:05:21.510> a<00:05:21.540> big<00:05:21.720> plan<00:05:21.930> this<00:05:22.110> in<00:05:22.350> the

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
that was really a big plan this in the

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.560 
that was really a big plan this in the
first<00:05:22.650> half<00:05:22.770> kasen<00:05:23.610> williams<00:05:23.640> stepped<00:05:24.300> up<00:05:24.450> and

Kevin<00:05:41.490> what<00:05:41.669> do<00:05:41.729> you<00:05:41.790> think<00:05:41.970> we<00:05:42.060> can<00:05:42.120> expect

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
Kevin what do you think we can expect

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.719 
Kevin what do you think we can expect
against<00:05:42.960> these<00:05:43.140> two<00:05:43.290> powerhouse<00:05:43.770> teams<00:05:43.800> what

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
against these two powerhouse teams what

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.010 
against these two powerhouse teams what
will<00:05:44.820> be<00:05:44.880> interesting<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.419> think<00:05:45.479> no<00:05:45.900> matter

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
will be interesting I think no matter

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.330 
will be interesting I think no matter
what<00:05:46.229> happens<00:05:46.350> that's<00:05:46.680> for<00:05:46.919> sure<00:05:47.040> I<00:05:47.190> mean

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
what happens that's for sure I mean

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.250 
what happens that's for sure I mean
Huskies<00:05:47.760> last<00:05:47.940> year<00:05:48.120> they<00:05:48.450> beat<00:05:48.600> Stanford<00:05:49.050> we

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
Huskies last year they beat Stanford we

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.420 
Huskies last year they beat Stanford we
know<00:05:49.380> that<00:05:49.410> can<00:05:49.620> be<00:05:49.740> Stanford<00:05:50.160> that<00:05:50.280> was

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
know that can be Stanford that was

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.950 
know that can be Stanford that was
before<00:05:50.610> Kevin<00:05:51.060> I've<00:05:51.150> even<00:05:51.330> took<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.510> reins<00:05:51.810> a

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
before Kevin I've even took the reins a

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.750 
before Kevin I've even took the reins a
little<00:05:52.020> bit<00:05:52.260> of<00:05:52.380> different<00:05:52.650> offense<00:05:53.010> and<00:05:53.250> it

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
little bit of different offense and it

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.550 
little bit of different offense and it
wasn't<00:05:54.030> Seattle<00:05:54.450> so<00:05:55.140> I<00:05:55.169> think<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.410> big

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
wasn't Seattle so I think the big

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.820 
wasn't Seattle so I think the big
questions<00:05:55.950> for<00:05:56.130> that<00:05:56.220> are<00:05:56.310> going<00:05:56.430> to<00:05:56.490> be

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
questions for that are going to be

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.170 
questions for that are going to be

he tagged the plate on the road which

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.540 
he tagged the plate on the road which
has<00:05:58.480> been<00:05:58.690> rather<00:05:59.440> large<00:05:59.800> bugaboo<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.400> last

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
has been rather large bugaboo the last

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.920 
has been rather large bugaboo the last
couple<00:06:00.730> years<00:06:00.880> and<00:06:01.180> again<00:06:01.360> how<00:06:01.450> the<00:06:01.510> handle

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
couple years and again how the handle

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.230 
couple years and again how the handle
Stanford<00:06:02.680> saw<00:06:02.920> fence<00:06:03.160> kind<00:06:03.700> of<00:06:03.760> the<00:06:03.850> pits<00:06:04.090> in

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
Stanford saw fence kind of the pits in

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.760 
Stanford saw fence kind of the pits in
the<00:06:04.330> physicality<00:06:04.900> with<00:06:05.230> which<00:06:05.380> they're<00:06:05.590> going

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
the physicality with which they're going

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.990 
the physicality with which they're going
to<00:06:05.830> plug<00:06:06.010> because<00:06:06.280> haven't<00:06:06.670> really<00:06:06.820> seen<00:06:06.940> that

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
to plug because haven't really seen that

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.180 
to plug because haven't really seen that
at<00:06:07.210> this<00:06:07.330> year<00:06:07.540> let<00:06:08.230> me<00:06:08.290> guess<00:06:08.440> Oregon<00:06:08.800> I<00:06:08.980> think

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
at this year let me guess Oregon I think

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.070 
at this year let me guess Oregon I think
the<00:06:09.250> real<00:06:09.400> question<00:06:09.490> that<00:06:09.850> one<00:06:10.000> is<00:06:10.150> whether

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
the real question that one is whether

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.690 
the real question that one is whether
Washington<00:06:11.680> can<00:06:11.860> hang<00:06:11.980> around<00:06:12.100> with<00:06:12.370> Oregon

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
Washington can hang around with Oregon

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.580 
Washington can hang around with Oregon
for<00:06:12.970> a<00:06:13.000> full<00:06:13.300> 60<00:06:13.690> minutes<00:06:14.020> reached<00:06:14.260> to<00:06:14.350> haven't

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
for a full 60 minutes reached to haven't

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.430 
for a full 60 minutes reached to haven't
done<00:06:14.710> and<00:06:15.010> past<00:06:15.730> nine<00:06:15.880> years<00:06:15.910> or<00:06:16.240> so<00:06:16.390> I<00:06:16.630> goes

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
done and past nine years or so I goes

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.990 
done and past nine years or so I goes
about<00:06:17.650> the<00:06:17.800> interesting<00:06:18.100> games<00:06:18.310> I<00:06:18.640> think<00:06:18.910> the

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
about the interesting games I think the

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.760 
about the interesting games I think the
huskies<00:06:19.300> win<00:06:19.450> one<00:06:19.630> of<00:06:19.660> them<00:06:19.900> they<00:06:20.620> can

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
huskies win one of them they can

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.900 
huskies win one of them they can
probably<00:06:21.040> come<00:06:21.310> out<00:06:21.340> of<00:06:21.520> that<00:06:21.550> feeling<00:06:21.790> pretty
