00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:09.090
 At this year's Bongo e3 we saw several 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.210
 releases several titles from the last 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.670
 Finally, a lot of good things went 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.000
 close up view of dj 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.490
 but since they are not all flowers, it is clear that 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.420
 the biggest gaming event in the world 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.420
 could be perfect 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.720
 what scrolls is the following a lot 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.760
 expectation was created because of this 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.920
 be the first and three after 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.309
 Octave Islands Launch 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.559
 generation, that is, we expected a 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.140
 explosion of releases to want 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.960
 buy a new console, right? 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.809
 as it is in addition the gamers were 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.180
 eager for nintendo announcements 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.940
 the company still has many of its 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.010
 higher deductibles and needed 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.729
 leverage river sales 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.800
 But then what went wrong after all to the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.680
 most people the big problem 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.300
 was the fact that so much bazaar information 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.250
 before the event 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.170
 This ended a little with grace. 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.810
 excitement of those waiting for the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.020
 conferences on June 9 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.990
 large companies like microsoft 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.090
 electronic arts sony and ubisoft 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.910
 anticipated part of their novelties 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.280
 this has reduced the amount of surprises 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.280
 because what has not been advanced by 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 themselves reached the public in the form of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.320
 overcoming leaks loaded with rumors 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.320
 that ended up being confirmed in the event 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.660
 out the leaks what was meant to be 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.780
 surprise turned into disappointment 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.229
 Here, for example, I show several concepts and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.930
 little concrete thing in fact a lot of people 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.570
 already expected to see mass effect 4 but 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:12.720
 company's expectations and only 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:16.170
 showed the conceptual art of the game and there 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.090
 stayed that taste of want more 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.810
 As for Japanese studios, the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.360
 booths were not there those things 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.450
 the caco showed several games that people 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.510
 already knew and maybe its great 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.190
 emphasis has been even of them and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.190
 10 thousand reais in 31 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.659
 already konami looked like a ghost and was 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.030
 hitting the metal gear solid key and as 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.159
 if there were no tomorrow 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.590
 not even some of the great names of the 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.109
 country like fable fantasy 15 the kingdom 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.209
 hearts 3 appeared to remind us that 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.790
 square enix exists and bring good 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.120
 souvenirs of Japan and had game that 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.459
 appeared but the presentation was so so so 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.299
 A mouth that did not even give people permission to 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.569
 they excited 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.659
 is the case of hruby client 3 the only 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.329
 sony announcement that no one expected and 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.000
 who, despite being very familiar, brought 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.840
 new characters and even with new 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.730
 mechanical 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.310
 The lack of strong light caused the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.310
 book big planet three stay in the dark 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:43.290
 good worse than appearing and not being seen 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.569
 it does not even appear 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.269
 this is what happened to games with the 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.090
 last guardian that there are half excuses and 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.629
 more excuses kept going from nowhere to 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.629
 any place 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.660
 ef 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.590
 now there have been four and over schrage 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:27.430
 have not even been mentioned and the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.830
 long awaited gears of war xbox one only 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.120
 it appeared as soon as the end 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:37.389
 as was said at the beginning of the video at e3 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.300
 2014 Bongo but good goal only for 2015 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.970
 to get an idea or who was 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.789
 body present at the fair managed to play 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.740
 most of the games since most of the 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:51.100
 demonstrations were played by 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.150
 own developers but the good side 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.729
 this is all the certainty of 2015 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.289
 stuffed with releases is this huh 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.120
 We hope you have enjoyed it. 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.120
