00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
afterwards for the new water-cooled

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.539 
afterwards for the new water-cooled
engine<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.860> necessary<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
engine it's I think it's necessary to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.499 
engine it's I think it's necessary to
protect<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:31.409> radiators<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.939> for

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
protect the radiators and we have for

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.530 
protect the radiators and we have for
the<00:01:33.659> left<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> right<00:01:34.409> hand<00:01:34.740> radiator

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
the left and the right hand radiator

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.460 
the left and the right hand radiator
separate<00:01:36.619> aluminum<00:01:37.619> radiator<00:01:38.460> protections

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
separate aluminum radiator protections

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.660 
separate aluminum radiator protections
for<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> headlight<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> new

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
for the headlight we have a new

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.760 
for the headlight we have a new
headlight<00:01:42.060> protection<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.899> protects<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
headlight protection that protects the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.730 
headlight protection that protects the
new<00:01:43.979> LED<00:01:44.390> front<00:01:45.390> lights<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.380> think<00:01:46.619> it's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
new LED front lights and I think it's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.270 
new LED front lights and I think it's
the<00:01:46.860> first<00:01:47.130> bike<00:01:47.610> ever<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:49.170> light<00:01:49.770> emitting

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the day driving light and we also made

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.719 
the day driving light and we also made
some<00:01:59.790> fog<00:02:00.390> lights<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:01.460> LED<00:02:02.460> technology

accessories<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:45.280> will<00:02:45.790> be<00:02:46.209> shown<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
accessories that will be shown in the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.789 
accessories that will be shown in the
near<00:02:47.799> future<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:49.450> for<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.900> moment<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.380> think

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
near future but for the moment I think

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.789 
near future but for the moment I think
on<00:02:50.980> our<00:02:51.400> travel<00:02:51.910> that's<00:02:52.329> been<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.290> parts<00:02:53.709> that

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
on our travel that's been the parts that

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.190 
on our travel that's been the parts that
you<00:02:54.130> really<00:02:54.670> need<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.180> long<00:02:55.690> distance

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
you really need on long distance

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.130 
you really need on long distance
traveling<00:02:57.069> on<00:02:57.390> discovering<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.480> world<00:02:58.780> on

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
traveling on discovering the world on

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.400

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
this new bike and I'm sure after some

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.470 
this new bike and I'm sure after some
thousand<00:03:02.890> kilometres<00:03:03.489> here<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:03.910> Africa

thousand kilometres here in Africa
that's<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.799> bike<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.250> want<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.610> use<00:03:06.730> for<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
that's the bike I want to use for the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.250 
that's the bike I want to use for the
next<00:03:07.450> year's<00:03:08.910> after<00:03:09.910> some<00:03:10.329> thousand

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
next year's after some thousand

next year's after some thousand
kilometers<00:03:11.829> here<00:03:12.160> in<00:03:12.430> Madagascar<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.560> really

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
kilometers here in Madagascar I really

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.250 
kilometers here in Madagascar I really
feel<00:03:14.829> good<00:03:15.040> with<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.340> new<00:03:15.639> water-cooled<00:03:16.450> R

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
feel good with the new water-cooled R

feel good with the new water-cooled R
1200<00:03:17.799> GS

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
1200 GS

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.809 
1200 GS
it's<00:03:19.319> from<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.470> feeling<00:03:21.010> from<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.400> riding

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
it's from the feeling from the riding

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.500 
it's from the feeling from the riding
experience<00:03:21.910> it's<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:23.170> lot<00:03:23.560> lighter<00:03:24.100> even<00:03:24.880> if

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
experience it's a lot lighter even if

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.410 
experience it's a lot lighter even if
it's<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.900> same<00:03:26.079> weight<00:03:26.350> but<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:27.549> feels<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:28.180> lot

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
it's the same weight but it feels a lot

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.059 
it's the same weight but it feels a lot
lighter<00:03:28.870> than<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.620> older<00:03:29.889> version

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.420 

the<00:03:37.069> main<00:03:37.280> difference<00:03:37.819> is<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.750> more<00:03:38.959> powerful

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
the main difference is the more powerful

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.000 
the main difference is the more powerful
water-cooled<00:03:40.430> engine<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:42.500> know<00:03:42.680> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
water-cooled engine and you know the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.860 
water-cooled engine and you know the
sound<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.790> lot<00:03:44.659> different<00:03:44.840> there<00:03:46.629> yeah<00:03:47.629> it's

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
sound is a lot different there yeah it's

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.619 
sound is a lot different there yeah it's
more<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.709> sound<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.280> KTM<00:03:49.670> than<00:03:50.030> an<00:03:50.180> old

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
more the sound of a KTM than an old

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.619 
more the sound of a KTM than an old
boxer<00:03:51.290> engine<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.549> feels<00:03:52.909> a<00:03:53.150> little<00:03:53.269> more

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
boxer engine and it feels a little more

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.610 
boxer engine and it feels a little more
aggressive<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.829> engine<00:03:55.190> but<00:03:55.459> it's<00:03:55.760> always

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
aggressive the engine but it's always

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.710 
aggressive the engine but it's always
controllable<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:57.970> no<00:03:58.970> problem

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
controllable it's no problem

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.059 
controllable it's no problem
to<00:04:00.170> handle<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:01.010> bike<00:04:01.250> with<00:04:01.760> 125<00:04:02.690> horsepower

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
to handle the bike with 125 horsepower

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.000 
to handle the bike with 125 horsepower
even<00:04:04.069> in<00:04:04.340> difficult<00:04:05.090> off-road<00:04:05.510> sections<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
even in difficult off-road sections the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.830 
even in difficult off-road sections the
new<00:04:10.250> suspension<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.239> bike<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:11.780> think

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
new suspension of the bike I think

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.759 
new suspension of the bike I think
that's<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.769> main<00:04:13.099> advantage<00:04:14.079> it's<00:04:15.079> semi

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
that's the main advantage it's semi

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.710 
that's the main advantage it's semi
active<00:04:15.920> means<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.660> shock<00:04:18.380> absorber<00:04:19.720> can

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
active means that the shock absorber can

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.860 
active means that the shock absorber can
react<00:04:21.350> on<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.370> situation<00:04:23.150> while<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.720> are

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
react on the situation while you are

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.670 
react on the situation while you are
riding<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.800> can't<00:04:25.130> adjust<00:04:25.960> can<00:04:26.960> be<00:04:27.139> adjusted

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
riding it can't adjust can be adjusted

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.800 
riding it can't adjust can be adjusted
automatically<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:29.120> makes<00:04:29.449> the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
automatically and that makes the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.620 
automatically and that makes the
handling<00:04:30.289> so<00:04:30.650> much<00:04:31.220> more<00:04:33.820> reliable<00:04:34.820> for<00:04:35.479> the

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
handling so much more reliable for the

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.790 
handling so much more reliable for the
rider

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.250
