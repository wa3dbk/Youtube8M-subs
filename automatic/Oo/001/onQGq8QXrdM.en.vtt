 yes, we have learned that the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.740
 Reopening is and therefore wanted 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.000

 point with more on 9 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.110
 new and very practical as you can 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.170
 which is not so ideal if you want to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.989
 For example, word drying is nothing 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.640

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.900
 the room okay is also relatively new 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.900

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.650
 he would have to be done with it 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.940
 these stones and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.940
 not get up 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.970
 cool is very nice but that i have the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.100
 small because if many people here have it 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.100
 likely to stay if they say 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.289
 Basically we are very good 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.259
 We are also from other hotels 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.020

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.280

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.710
 astra clean class we will be great 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.860
 whether we know about them 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.860

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.560
