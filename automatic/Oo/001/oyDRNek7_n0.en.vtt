00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
see some things that neither of you know

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.760 
see some things that neither of you know
from<00:01:54.450> each<00:01:54.540> other<00:01:54.720> life<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.680> those

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
from each other life is one of those

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.679 
from each other life is one of those
players<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.850> knows<00:01:57.210> how<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
players that actually knows how to do a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.780 
players that actually knows how to do a
lot<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.380> different<00:01:58.829> styles<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.369> i<00:01:59.399> can't<00:01:59.700> i

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
lot of different styles so i can't i

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.249 
lot of different styles so i can't i
don't<00:01:59.969> think<00:02:00.119> i<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.240> actually<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.840> into<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
don't think i can actually go into the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
don't think i can actually go into the
series<00:02:01.469> thinking<00:02:01.979> he's<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.700> or

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
series thinking he's going to do this or

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.420 
series thinking he's going to do this or
that<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> think<00:02:04.740> I'll<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> be

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that so I think I'll just have to be

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.540 
that so I think I'll just have to be
very<00:02:05.579> prepared

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
very prepared

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.080 
very prepared
and<00:02:06.670> how<00:02:07.240> about<00:02:07.360> life<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:08.460> think<00:02:09.460> all<00:02:09.729> Zergs

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
and how about life I think all Zergs

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.020 
and how about life I think all Zergs
kind<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.390> play<00:02:10.630> kind<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.530> similar<00:02:11.710> so<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.670> don't

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
kind of play kind of similar so I don't

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.980 
kind of play kind of similar so I don't
really<00:02:13.060> think<00:02:13.360> just<00:02:13.600> because<00:02:13.690> he's<00:02:13.870> my

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
really think just because he's my

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.860 
really think just because he's my
teammate<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.500> really<00:02:14.710> changes<00:02:15.010> much<00:02:15.750> are<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
teammate it really changes much are you

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.720 
teammate it really changes much are you
guys<00:02:17.320> surprised<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:17.800> there's<00:02:18.190> no<00:02:18.280> Terrans

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
guys surprised that there's no Terrans

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.120 
guys surprised that there's no Terrans
in<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.940> top<00:02:19.120> eight<00:02:19.300> we're<00:02:20.290> okay<00:02:20.650> Ted<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:20.980> you

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
in the top eight we're okay Ted on you

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.100 
in the top eight we're okay Ted on you
Lindsay<00:02:21.670> bullion<00:02:22.000> oh<00:02:22.090> yeah<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.420> was<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> little

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
Lindsay bullion oh yeah I was a little

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.300 
Lindsay bullion oh yeah I was a little
surprised<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:23.890> weren't<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.190> many

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
surprised that there weren't that many

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.800 
surprised that there weren't that many
turns<00:02:24.850> but<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.060> saw<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.450> from<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> beginning

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
turns but I saw that from the beginning

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.420 
turns but I saw that from the beginning
there<00:02:26.140> weren't<00:02:26.350> many<00:02:26.410> turns<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.040> begin<00:02:27.250> with

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
there weren't many turns to begin with

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.400 
there weren't many turns to begin with
so<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.150> had<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.510> big<00:02:28.690> influence<00:02:28.870> and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
so I think that had a big influence and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.820 
so I think that had a big influence and
part<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:30.480> don't<00:02:31.480> want<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.780> thank<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.590> life

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
part of it don't want to thank you life

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.710 
part of it don't want to thank you life
and<00:02:33.100> thank<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.520> curious<00:02:33.970> good<00:02:34.270> walk<00:02:34.420> against

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
and thank you curious good walk against

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.370 
and thank you curious good walk against
