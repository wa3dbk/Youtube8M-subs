to harvest your birdhouse gourds or

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.290 
to harvest your birdhouse gourds or
Mexican<00:00:17.220> water<00:00:17.550> bottle<00:00:17.820> gourds<00:00:18.830> so<00:00:20.090> the<00:00:21.090> first

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
Mexican water bottle gourds so the first

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.859 
Mexican water bottle gourds so the first
step<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.900> when<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> stem<00:00:22.769> turns<00:00:23.130> brown<00:00:23.869> that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
step is when a stem turns brown that

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.390 
step is when a stem turns brown that
means<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.350> gourd<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.830> no<00:00:26.010> longer

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
means that you gourd is no longer

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.220 
means that you gourd is no longer
getting<00:00:26.609> any<00:00:26.939> nutrients<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.930> want<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
getting any nutrients and you want to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.790 
getting any nutrients and you want to
cut<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.560> off<00:00:28.680> not<00:00:29.460> twist<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.910> off<00:00:30.529> but<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.679> want

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
cut it off not twist it off but you want

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.180 
cut it off not twist it off but you want
to<00:00:31.859> leave<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> stem<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.700> long<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:33.420> possible

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
to leave the stem as long as possible

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.010 
to leave the stem as long as possible
because<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> drying<00:00:35.969> process<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.809> most

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
because in a drying process the most

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.860 
because in a drying process the most
important<00:00:37.530> factor<00:00:38.180> is<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.510> sure<00:00:39.540> your

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
important factor is to make sure your

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.190 
important factor is to make sure your
gourd<00:00:40.110> has<00:00:40.290> good<00:00:40.559> airflow<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:43.020> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
gourd has good airflow and I see this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.590 
gourd has good airflow and I see this
board<00:00:43.800> has<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.370> good<00:00:44.460> vine<00:00:44.730> governance

halfway<00:00:50.060> through<00:00:50.510> drying<00:00:50.840> is<00:00:51.140> by<00:00:51.410> shaking<00:00:58.059> now

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
halfway through drying is by shaking now

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.040 
halfway through drying is by shaking now
this<00:00:59.210> one<00:00:59.390> has<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.570> really<00:00:59.840> muffled<00:01:00.290> shake
