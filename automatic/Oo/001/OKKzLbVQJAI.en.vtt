sad<00:02:46.680> dwarfs<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.430> went<00:02:48.120> through<00:02:48.480> there<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
sad dwarfs and went through there and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.490 
sad dwarfs and went through there and
then<00:02:50.330> up<00:02:51.330> onto<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.810> little<00:02:52.110> area<00:02:52.230> right

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
then up onto that little area right

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.860 
then up onto that little area right
there<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.070> it's<00:02:53.190> kind<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.640> valley<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.300> Dwarfs

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
there so it's kind of a valley a Dwarfs

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.680 
there so it's kind of a valley a Dwarfs
as<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.200> left<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.530> little<00:02:55.860> pocket<00:02:56.040> open<00:02:56.690> did

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
as you left this little pocket open did

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.720 
as you left this little pocket open did
that<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:57.960> purpose<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:58.680> tried<00:02:59.460> something

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
different so we're going to continue to

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.280 
different so we're going to continue to
keep<00:03:02.790> rolling

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
keep rolling

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.470 
keep rolling
but<00:03:04.290> next<00:03:04.860> plant<00:03:05.190> do<00:03:06.060> some<00:03:06.240> crypts

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
but next plant do some crypts

at almost the finished product I still

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.000 
at almost the finished product I still
got<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.660> pick<00:03:15.810> up<00:03:15.900> some<00:03:15.960> window<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.440> java<00:03:16.710> fern

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
got to pick up some window the java fern

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.130 
got to pick up some window the java fern
I'll<00:03:17.340> probably<00:03:17.490> pick<00:03:18.030> up<00:03:18.180> two<00:03:18.420> maybe<00:03:18.810> three

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
I'll probably pick up two maybe three

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.650 
I'll probably pick up two maybe three
plants<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.650> break<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.100> up<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.730> fill<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.540> a

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
plants of that break it up and fill in a

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.770 
plants of that break it up and fill in a
few<00:03:21.900> areas<00:03:22.250> right<00:03:23.250> there's<00:03:24.180> where<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.600> have

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
few areas right there's where I have

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.710 
few areas right there's where I have
window<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.110> java<00:03:25.410> fern<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:26.040> right<00:03:26.280> there<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:26.790> I

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
window a java fern and right there and I

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.920 
window a java fern and right there and I
need<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:29.790> plug<00:03:30.120> through<00:03:30.420> there<00:03:30.660> and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
need to have that plug through there and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.220 
need to have that plug through there and
along<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:31.890> seam<00:03:32.460> right<00:03:33.210> there<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.810> then<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
along that seam right there and then the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.670 
along that seam right there and then the
tank<00:03:34.410> will<00:03:34.530> probably<00:03:34.860> be<00:03:35.010> pretty<00:03:35.310> much<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.610> dot

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680

look up the actual real name I always
screw<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.380> up<00:04:04.500> but<00:04:04.740> that's<00:04:04.950> through<00:04:05.220> there<00:04:05.460> and

this<00:04:10.230> was<00:04:10.470> theory<00:04:10.710> a<00:04:10.800> patch<00:04:11.070> right<00:04:11.100> here

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
this was theory a patch right here

this was theory a patch right here
that's<00:04:11.790> about<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.150> height<00:04:12.330> that<00:04:12.510> I'm<00:04:12.630> going

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
that's about the height that I'm going

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.840 
that's about the height that I'm going
to<00:04:12.780> keep<00:04:13.020> it<00:04:13.200> at

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
to keep it at

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.250 
to keep it at
as<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.120> grows<00:04:14.300> I'll<00:04:14.540> cut<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.810> back<00:04:14.900> down<00:04:15.110> to

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
as it grows I'll cut it back down to

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.050 
as it grows I'll cut it back down to
that<00:04:15.290> height<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.890> other<00:04:16.280> two<00:04:16.520> patches<00:04:16.760> along

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
that height the other two patches along

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.340 
that height the other two patches along
the<00:04:17.360> back<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.780> tank

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
the back of the tank

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.040 
the back of the tank
I'll<00:04:18.680> let<00:04:18.890> grow<00:04:19.130> up<00:04:19.780> probably<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
I'll let grow up probably to the

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.870 
I'll let grow up probably to the
waterline<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.740> then<00:04:21.830> trim<00:04:22.220> them<00:04:22.340> back<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.550> left

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
waterline and then trim them back I left

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.190 
waterline and then trim them back I left
middle<00:04:23.660> section<00:04:24.080> open<00:04:25.630> just<00:04:26.630> because<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.020> kind

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
middle section open just because it kind

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.710 
middle section open just because it kind
of<00:04:27.320> breaks<00:04:27.560> up<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.860> two<00:04:28.390> islands<00:04:29.390> of

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
of breaks up the two islands of

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.870 
of breaks up the two islands of
driftwood<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.590> it's<00:04:30.920> built<00:04:31.160> up<00:04:31.370> really<00:04:31.700> I

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
driftwood and it's built up really I

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.670 
driftwood and it's built up really I
mean<00:04:32.180> it's<00:04:32.360> it's<00:04:32.660> super<00:04:32.840> built<00:04:33.230> up<00:04:33.410> I'll<00:04:33.560> give

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
mean it's it's super built up I'll give

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.700 
mean it's it's super built up I'll give
you<00:04:33.770> guys<00:04:33.890> some<00:04:34.070> close-ups<00:04:35.320> so<00:04:36.320> you<00:04:36.380> can<00:04:36.530> kind

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
you guys some close-ups so you can kind

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.580 
you guys some close-ups so you can kind
of<00:04:36.740> take<00:04:36.920> a<00:04:36.950> look<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.370> see<00:04:37.580> what<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.390> did<00:04:39.280> but<00:04:40.280> it

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
of take a look and see what I did but it

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.440 
of take a look and see what I did but it
came<00:04:42.590> out<00:04:42.740> pretty<00:04:42.890> good<00:04:43.130> I'm<00:04:43.340> I'm<00:04:44.210> pretty

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
came out pretty good I'm I'm pretty
