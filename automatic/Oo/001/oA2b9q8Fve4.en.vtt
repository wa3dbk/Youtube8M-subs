00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.770 

all<00:02:01.660> right<00:02:01.870> so<00:02:02.080> it's<00:02:02.290> not<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.650> best<00:02:02.980> story<00:02:03.780> you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
all right so it's not the best story you

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.690 
all right so it's not the best story you
know<00:02:04.900> convoluted<00:02:05.500> stories<00:02:05.890> aren't<00:02:06.310> really<00:02:06.580> an

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
know convoluted stories aren't really an

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.250 
know convoluted stories aren't really an
NES<00:02:07.150> thing<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:08.310> points<00:02:09.310> for<00:02:09.490> that<00:02:09.990> not<00:02:10.990> really

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
NES thing so points for that not really

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.620 
NES thing so points for that not really
much<00:02:11.410> going<00:02:11.440> on<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.190> options<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:13.030> it's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
much going on in the options but it's

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.020 
much going on in the options but it's
serviceable<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:15.250> can<00:02:15.400> change<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.760> screen

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
serviceable you can change the screen

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.720 
serviceable you can change the screen
size<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.630> something<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.020> little<00:02:17.350> bit<00:02:17.470> bigger

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
size to something a little bit bigger

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.670 
size to something a little bit bigger
it's<00:02:18.730> not<00:02:18.970> completely<00:02:19.720> consistent<00:02:19.930> with<00:02:20.500> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
it's not completely consistent with the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.330 
it's not completely consistent with the
NES<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.620> like<00:02:23.860> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
NES is so I like that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.270 
NES is so I like that
also<00:02:24.940> there's<00:02:25.150> three<00:02:25.360> control<00:02:25.750> schemes<00:02:26.280> one

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
also there's three control schemes one

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:49.449 
also there's three control schemes one
that's<00:02:27.490> bound<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.820> work

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.970 

the<00:02:49.939> skin<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.269> easy<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.720> understand<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.799> have

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
the skin is easy to understand you have

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.210 
the skin is easy to understand you have
a<00:02:52.010> jump<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.610> shoot<00:02:53.379> your<00:02:54.379> jump<00:02:54.709> makes<00:02:54.980> you

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
a jump and shoot your jump makes you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.550 
a jump and shoot your jump makes you
actually<00:02:55.549> jetpack<00:02:56.510> around<00:02:56.959> if<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.349> keep

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
actually jetpack around if you keep

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.679 
actually jetpack around if you keep
pressing<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.790> can<00:02:58.970> do<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.269> as<00:02:59.450> long<00:02:59.659> as

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
pressing it and you can do it as long as

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.380 
pressing it and you can do it as long as
you<00:02:59.930> have<00:03:00.049> jetpack<00:03:00.470> power<00:03:00.799> which<00:03:01.760> does<00:03:02.060> run

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
you have jetpack power which does run

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.600 
you have jetpack power which does run
down<00:03:02.629> you<00:03:02.959> can<00:03:03.170> recharge<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.769> by<00:03:03.950> simply<00:03:04.400> not

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
down you can recharge it by simply not

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.500 
down you can recharge it by simply not
jumping<00:03:05.150> or<00:03:05.420> flying<00:03:05.659> around<00:03:05.959> for<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.290> little

is this and yes pit sport it's kind of

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.620 
is this and yes pit sport it's kind of
hard<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.980> differentiate<00:04:15.610> this<00:04:16.060> between

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
hard to differentiate this between

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.490 
hard to differentiate this between
today's<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.669> sunsoft<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:19.090> yes<00:04:19.329> game<00:04:19.630> or<00:04:20.049> an

American Sammy on the ice game they're
so<00:04:23.320> similar<00:04:24.600> it's<00:04:25.600> just<00:04:25.810> so<00:04:26.169> authentic<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:26.979> has

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
so similar it's just so authentic it has

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.430 
so similar it's just so authentic it has

glitches some of which I really hope are

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.570 
glitches some of which I really hope are
cleaned<00:04:48.990> up<00:04:49.230> in<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.560> steam<00:04:49.800> version<00:04:50.070> should

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
cleaned up in the steam version should

00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:04.370 
cleaned up in the steam version should
that<00:04:50.790> come<00:04:50.970> out<00:04:51.120> later

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
edge of screen weirdness that you'd

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:21.740 
edge of screen weirdness that you'd
expect<00:05:14.330> from<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.629> proper<00:05:15.020> NES<00:05:15.409> game

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.210

and wow it even has strength whickering
you<00:05:25.820> could<00:05:26.000> argue<00:05:26.180> that<00:05:26.360> this<00:05:26.660> stuff<00:05:26.930> is

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
you could argue that this stuff is

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.230 
you could argue that this stuff is
actually<00:05:27.260> kind<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:27.770> annoying<00:05:28.100> but<00:05:28.520> I<00:05:28.700> love<00:05:29.060> it

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
actually kind of annoying but I love it

actually kind of annoying but I love it
I<00:05:31.720> mean<00:05:32.720> think<00:05:33.260> about<00:05:33.350> it<00:05:33.590> like<00:05:33.710> this<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:34.880> guy

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
I mean think about it like this the guy

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.970 
I mean think about it like this the guy
had<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.270> go<00:05:35.510> way<00:05:35.750> now<00:05:35.900> this<00:05:36.170> way<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:36.410> add<00:05:36.680> this

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
had to go way now this way to add this

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.010 
had to go way now this way to add this
stuff<00:05:37.280> it<00:05:37.490> wasn't<00:05:37.670> just<00:05:37.940> a<00:05:38.030> byproduct<00:05:38.270> of
