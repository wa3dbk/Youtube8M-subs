I<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.970> dropped<00:02:35.180> one<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.900> only<00:02:36.140> thing<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.410> do

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
I just dropped one the only thing I do

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.760 
I just dropped one the only thing I do
have<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:37.040> say<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.850> drying<00:02:38.240> time<00:02:38.660> does<00:02:39.260> take

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
have to say is the drying time does take

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.700 
have to say is the drying time does take
quite<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.310> bit<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.670> time<00:02:41.000> before<00:02:41.300> they<00:02:42.260> become

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
quite a bit of time before they become

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.800 
quite a bit of time before they become
completely<00:02:43.310> matte<00:02:43.610> since<00:02:44.090> they<00:02:44.240> are<00:02:44.450> more<00:02:44.750> of

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
completely matte since they are more of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.830 
completely matte since they are more of
a<00:02:45.140> mousse<00:02:45.530> formula<00:02:46.360> they<00:02:47.360> feel<00:02:47.630> more

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
a mousse formula they feel more

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.199 
a mousse formula they feel more
moisturizing<00:02:48.830> on<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.250> lips<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.790> they

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
moisturizing on the lips and they

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.660 
moisturizing on the lips and they
definitely<00:02:50.450> take<00:02:50.930> longer<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.590> fully<00:02:51.890> set<00:02:52.370> I

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
definitely take longer to fully set I

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.660 
definitely take longer to fully set I
actually<00:02:53.420> timed<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:54.110> swatch<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.590> did<00:02:54.770> on<00:02:54.860> my<00:02:54.890> arm

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
actually timed a swatch I did on my arm

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.449 
actually timed a swatch I did on my arm
and<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.150> took<00:02:56.300> about<00:02:56.780> six<00:02:57.380> minutes<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:58.190> drive

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
and it took about six minutes to drive

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.060 
and it took about six minutes to drive
fully<00:02:58.970> matte<00:02:59.180> but<00:02:59.540> then<00:02:59.810> once<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.800> place

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
fully matte but then once it's in place

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.310 
fully matte but then once it's in place
it<00:03:01.430> ain't<00:03:02.150> going<00:03:02.510> nowhere

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
it ain't going nowhere

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.810

brightest whitest teeth to begin with

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.590 
brightest whitest teeth to begin with
and<00:05:04.380> that's<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.280> only<00:05:05.550> reason<00:05:05.580> why<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:05.940> kind<00:05:06.390> of

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
and that's the only reason why I kind of

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.560 
and that's the only reason why I kind of
stray<00:05:06.900> away<00:05:07.140> from<00:05:07.260> lavender<00:05:08.040> shades<00:05:08.570> usually

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
stray away from lavender shades usually

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.020 
stray away from lavender shades usually
is<00:05:09.780> because<00:05:10.350> it<00:05:10.740> makes<00:05:10.920> my<00:05:11.130> teeth<00:05:11.190> look<00:05:11.640> kind

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
is because it makes my teeth look kind

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.640 
is because it makes my teeth look kind
of<00:05:12.470> green<00:05:13.470> next<00:05:14.370> is<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:15.300> blue<00:05:15.840> shade<00:05:16.260> I'm

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.600 
it reminds me of OCC's poolboy which I
do<00:05:27.120> wear<00:05:27.570> sometimes<00:05:28.169> it's<00:05:28.560> a<00:05:28.710> very<00:05:28.740> daring

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.220 
friendly with my own complexion I think
it<00:05:37.890> kind<00:05:38.070> of<00:05:38.160> clashes<00:05:38.790> with<00:05:39.330> my<00:05:39.360> eyes<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.780> little

it kind of clashes with my eyes a little

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.550 
it kind of clashes with my eyes a little
bit<00:05:40.380> but<00:05:41.040> I<00:05:41.070> still<00:05:41.220> do<00:05:42.030> love<00:05:42.660> it<00:05:42.870> each<00:05:43.230> of<00:05:43.440> these

shades<00:05:43.919> pretty<00:05:44.370> much<00:05:44.580> dries<00:05:45.540> to<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.070> completely

matte<00:05:47.669> opaque<00:05:48.300> with<00:05:48.510> just<00:05:48.840> one<00:05:49.110> coat<00:05:49.410> it's

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
matte opaque with just one coat it's

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.460 
matte opaque with just one coat it's
just<00:05:50.460> this<00:05:50.850> one<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.540> the<00:05:51.600> next<00:05:51.630> one<00:05:52.050> and<00:05:52.200> I'm

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
just this one and the next one and I'm

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.380 
just this one and the next one and I'm
talking<00:05:52.980> about<00:05:53.040> I<00:05:53.490> almost<00:05:53.910> think<00:05:54.150> it's<00:05:54.330> a

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
talking about I almost think it's a

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.270 
talking about I almost think it's a
little<00:05:54.630> bit<00:05:54.840> better<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:55.260> touch<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.740> up<00:05:55.830> just<00:05:56.070> a

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
little bit better to touch it up just a

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.940 
little bit better to touch it up just a
little<00:05:56.310> bit<00:05:56.880> with<00:05:57.780> two<00:05:58.020> coats<00:05:58.320> so<00:05:58.590> you<00:05:58.710> get<00:05:58.919> a

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
little bit with two coats so you get a

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.020 
little bit with two coats so you get a
totally<00:05:59.700> opaque<00:06:00.630> look<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.980> last<00:06:02.550> color

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
totally opaque look and the last color

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.980 
totally opaque look and the last color
is<00:06:03.450> the<00:06:03.930> color<00:06:04.080> I<00:06:04.440> have<00:06:04.680> on<00:06:04.710> right<00:06:05.160> now<00:06:05.970> and<00:06:06.390> it

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
is the color I have on right now and it

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.390 
is the color I have on right now and it
is<00:06:07.190> Severus<00:06:08.190> and<00:06:08.460> it<00:06:09.210> is<00:06:09.330> a<00:06:09.570> light<00:06:10.110> green<00:06:10.950> it's

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
is Severus and it is a light green it's

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.060 
is Severus and it is a light green it's
almost<00:06:11.730> like<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:12.120> minty<00:06:12.930> green<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:13.530> think<00:06:13.830> this

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
almost like a minty green I think this

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.430 
almost like a minty green I think this
is<00:06:14.220> a<00:06:14.250> very<00:06:14.669> unique<00:06:15.000> color<00:06:15.570> most<00:06:15.990> of<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:16.230> time

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
is a very unique color most of the time

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.800 
is a very unique color most of the time
when<00:06:16.590> you<00:06:16.680> see<00:06:16.860> lipsticks<00:06:17.430> that<00:06:17.610> are<00:06:18.090> green
