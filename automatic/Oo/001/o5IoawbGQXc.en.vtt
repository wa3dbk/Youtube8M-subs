one<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.170> those<00:01:55.320> novels<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.369> really

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
one of those novels it's really really

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.179 
one of those novels it's really really
difficult<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.420> put<00:01:57.630> down<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.649> reason<00:01:59.009> for

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
difficult to put down one reason for

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160 
difficult to put down one reason for
this<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.969> chapters<00:02:00.360> are<00:02:00.479> short<00:02:00.750> some<00:02:01.110> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
this is the chapters are short some of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.840 
this is the chapters are short some of
them<00:02:01.290> are<00:02:01.350> only<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.560> couple<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.950> pages<00:02:02.100> long<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
them are only a couple of pages long and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.600 
them are only a couple of pages long and
so<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.119> you're<00:02:03.299> reading<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:04.110> yeah<00:02:04.950> yeah

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
so as you're reading you think yeah yeah

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.490 
so as you're reading you think yeah yeah
I<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.060> read<00:02:06.180> another<00:02:06.360> chapter<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
I can read another chapter and then the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.900 
I can read another chapter and then the
next<00:02:07.710> thing<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:08.069> you're<00:02:08.550> at<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.670> end<00:02:08.819> of

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
next thing you know you're at the end of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.639 
next thing you know you're at the end of
the<00:02:08.970> book<00:02:09.119> but<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.780> course<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.140> method<00:02:10.530> only

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the book but of course that method only

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.559 
the book but of course that method only
works<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.190> there<00:02:11.340> are<00:02:11.459> things<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.209> chapter

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
works if there are things in the chapter

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.120 
works if there are things in the chapter
that<00:02:12.660> make<00:02:12.840> you

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
that make you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.890 
that make you
to<00:02:13.340> keep<00:02:13.550> reading<00:02:13.910> another<00:02:14.060> chapter<00:02:14.480> and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
to keep reading another chapter and

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.080 
to keep reading another chapter and

naturally there are this book is
basically<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.600> mystery<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.230> each<00:02:18.470> chapter

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
basically a mystery and each chapter

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.100 
basically a mystery and each chapter
adds<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.580> new<00:02:19.730> puzzle<00:02:20.030> piece<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.720> mystery

adds a new puzzle piece to the mystery

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.110 
adds a new puzzle piece to the mystery
even<00:02:21.290> though<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.770> might<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.040> seem<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:23.060> at

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
even though it might not seem like it at

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.180 
even though it might not seem like it at
the<00:02:23.240> time<00:02:23.480> some<00:02:24.200> chapters<00:02:24.440> just<00:02:24.740> give<00:02:24.980> us<00:02:25.100> a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
the time some chapters just give us a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.710 
the time some chapters just give us a
little<00:02:25.310> tidbit<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.820> information<00:02:25.970> that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
little tidbit of information that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.110 
little tidbit of information that
doesn't<00:02:27.200> really<00:02:27.620> seem<00:02:28.040> relevant<00:02:28.730> at<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.880> time

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
doesn't really seem relevant at the time

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.750 
doesn't really seem relevant at the time
but<00:02:29.570> then<00:02:29.720> later<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.530> puzzle<00:02:30.890> piece<00:02:31.100> fits<00:02:31.550> in

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
but then later the puzzle piece fits in

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.090 
but then later the puzzle piece fits in
to<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> overall<00:02:32.570> story<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.440> if<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:33.980> know

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
looks like it's going to be a particular

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.060 
looks like it's going to be a particular
kind<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.780> story<00:03:12.050> based<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.440> his<00:03:12.560> premise<00:03:12.920> and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070

direction and then we find out that
Stanley's<00:03:16.460> story<00:03:16.580> is<00:03:17.030> not<00:03:17.210> the<00:03:17.240> only<00:03:17.600> story
