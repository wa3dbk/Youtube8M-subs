00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
order to be malleable a material must be

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.750 
order to be malleable a material must be
easily<00:02:14.110> bent<00:02:14.500> or<00:02:14.740> shaped<00:02:15.100> without<00:02:15.520> breaking

sometimes metals are shaped using lots
of<00:02:18.769> force<00:02:19.099> like<00:02:19.489> with<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.670> hammer<00:02:19.939> and

of force like with a hammer and

of force like with a hammer and
sometimes<00:02:21.379> they<00:02:21.680> are<00:02:21.829> so<00:02:22.129> malleable<00:02:22.459> they<00:02:23.420> can

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
sometimes they are so malleable they can

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.589 
sometimes they are so malleable they can
be<00:02:23.720> shaped<00:02:23.959> using<00:02:24.620> just<00:02:24.950> your<00:02:25.159> hands<00:02:25.519> think<00:02:26.480> of

a marble out of iron which is a pretty

a marble out of iron which is a pretty

nonmetals that you normally see now for

nonmetals that you normally see now for
the<00:03:01.670> nonmetals<00:03:02.290> basically<00:03:03.290> all<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.530> their

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
the nonmetals basically all of their

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.800 
the nonmetals basically all of their
physical<00:03:04.280> properties<00:03:04.909> are<00:03:05.090> opposite<00:03:05.720> of

physical properties are opposite of

physical properties are opposite of
metal<00:03:06.139> properties<00:03:06.349> but<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.400> course<00:03:07.639> we<00:03:07.879> need

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
metal properties but of course we need

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.940 
metal properties but of course we need
to<00:03:08.060> use<00:03:08.239> some<00:03:08.450> fancy<00:03:08.599> words<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:09.200> describe<00:03:09.440> them

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
to use some fancy words to describe them

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.509 
to use some fancy words to describe them
so<00:03:10.549> here<00:03:10.730> we<00:03:10.819> go<00:03:10.970> first<00:03:11.980> nonmetals<00:03:12.980> are<00:03:13.159> dull

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
so here we go first nonmetals are dull

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.849 
so here we go first nonmetals are dull
and<00:03:13.849> I<00:03:14.269> don't<00:03:14.329> mean<00:03:14.690> their<00:03:14.959> personalities<00:03:15.680> I

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
and I don't mean their personalities I

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.520 
and I don't mean their personalities I
mean<00:03:16.579> that<00:03:17.000> they<00:03:17.120> do<00:03:17.180> not<00:03:17.450> reflect<00:03:17.720> light<00:03:18.049> very

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
mean that they do not reflect light very

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.849 
mean that they do not reflect light very
well<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:19.040> are<00:03:19.340> therefore<00:03:19.609> not<00:03:19.879> shiny<00:03:20.510> an
