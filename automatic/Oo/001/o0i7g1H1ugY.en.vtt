00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.890 
braids and um I comb through my hair
just<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:55.520> it'll<00:01:56.030> be<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.150> little<00:01:56.420> bit<00:01:56.689> much

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
just so it'll be a little bit much

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.249 
just so it'll be a little bit much
easier<00:01:57.439> for<00:01:57.619> me<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.740> detangle<00:01:58.159> in<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.549> shower

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
easier for me to detangle in the shower

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.200 
easier for me to detangle in the shower
you<00:02:00.259> know<00:02:00.409> detangling<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.280> before<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:01.820> get<00:02:02.090> in

there<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.689> detangler<00:02:03.229> will<00:02:03.380> take<00:02:03.619> forever

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
there so the detangler will take forever

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.070 
there so the detangler will take forever
but<00:02:05.150> I'm<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.420> shower<00:02:05.689> cuz<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.049> takes

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
I mean when I would measure it'll seem

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.059 
I mean when I would measure it'll seem
like<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.750> same<00:02:16.019> length<00:02:16.290> but<00:02:16.409> it

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
like it it's the same length but it

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.610 
like it it's the same length but it
stops<00:02:17.370> right<00:02:17.610> here<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:18.659> past<00:02:19.049> my<00:02:19.379> own
