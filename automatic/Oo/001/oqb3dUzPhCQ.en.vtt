my<00:01:03.890> media<00:01:04.890> stored<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.580> don't<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.150> want<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
my media stored I don't really want to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.060 
my media stored I don't really want to
have<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:06.990> through<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.320> tag<00:01:07.560> absolutely

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
have to go through and tag absolutely

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.789 
have to go through and tag absolutely
everything<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:08.549> metadata<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.710> an

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
everything with metadata so it's it's an

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.410 
everything with metadata so it's it's an
awful<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.070> easier<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> go<00:01:12.270> in

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
awful lot easier for me just to go in

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.990 
awful lot easier for me just to go in
and<00:01:12.600> search<00:01:13.110> by<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> files<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> folders<00:01:14.280> one

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and search by the files and folders one

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
and search by the files and folders one
of<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> nice<00:01:15.330> things<00:01:15.360> about<00:01:15.659> kuru<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
of the nice things about kuru is that it

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460 
of the nice things about kuru is that it
actually<00:01:17.100> tells<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.850> doing<00:01:18.470> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
actually tells you what it's doing so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.170 
actually tells you what it's doing so
you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.799> see<00:01:20.009> here<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.520> scanning<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
you can see here when it's scanning the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.270 
you can see here when it's scanning the
media<00:01:21.509> libraries<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.070> how<00:01:23.250> many

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
media libraries you can see how many

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.920 
media libraries you can see how many
files<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.939> added<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.780> whether

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
files it's added you can see whether

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
files it's added you can see whether
it's<00:01:25.080> actively<00:01:25.380> working<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.979> scan<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.090> can

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it's actively working to scan you can

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.550 
it's actively working to scan you can
see<00:01:27.360> whether<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.750> streaming<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.409> see

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
see whether it's streaming you can see

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.890 
see whether it's streaming you can see
whether<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.890> transcoding<00:01:29.630> each<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
whether it's transcoding each of the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.390 
whether it's transcoding each of the
devices<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.560> connecting<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.130> these<00:01:32.250> are

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
devices that are connecting so these are

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490 
devices that are connecting so these are
the<00:01:32.430> DNA<00:01:32.880> clients<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.720> actually<00:01:34.020> configured

the DNA clients are actually configured

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.649 
the DNA clients are actually configured
independently<00:01:35.040> or<00:01:35.130> they<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.299> can

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
independently or they can be so you can

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450

having a quick look browsing through
some<00:02:28.530> audio<00:02:31.520> will<00:02:32.520> very<00:02:32.730> quickly<00:02:32.820> play<00:02:33.300> an

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
some audio will very quickly play an

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.310 
some audio will very quickly play an
audio<00:02:33.510> file<00:02:35.540> just<00:02:36.540> ready<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.870> show<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.170> it

audio file just ready to show that it

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.660 
audio file just ready to show that it

can leave it's not normally the case

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.690 
can leave it's not normally the case
that<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.420> you're<00:02:42.810> using<00:02:42.960> TVs<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.620> play<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:44.100> huge

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that if you're using TVs to play a huge

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.270 
that if you're using TVs to play a huge
amount<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.480> audio<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.800> nice<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> know

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
amount of of audio but it's nice to know

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.700 
amount of of audio but it's nice to know
that<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.520> absolutely<00:02:47.670> does<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:49.380> can<00:02:49.500> see

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
that it absolutely does that you can see

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.290 
that it absolutely does that you can see
here<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.220> word<00:02:50.340> trial<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.880> appended<00:02:51.270> to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
here that the word trial is appended to

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.900 
here that the word trial is appended to
most<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.630> these<00:02:51.750> files<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.230> folders<00:02:52.590> and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
most of these files and folders and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.040 
most of these files and folders and
that's<00:02:53.910> essentially<00:02:54.330> because<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:54.960> the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that's essentially because this is the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
that's essentially because this is the
trial<00:02:55.320> version<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.860> kuru<00:02:56.400> media<00:02:57.860> let's<00:02:58.860> go<00:02:58.980> and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
trial version of kuru media let's go and

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.330 
trial version of kuru media let's go and
have<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.220> look<00:02:59.250> at<00:02:59.430> some<00:02:59.580> photos<00:03:01.280> let's<00:03:02.280> just

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
have a look at some photos let's just

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.980 
have a look at some photos let's just
browse<00:03:02.700> through<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.210> see<00:03:03.330> if<00:03:03.390> we<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.600> find<00:03:03.780> a

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
browse through and see if we can find a

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.580 
browse through and see if we can find a
a<00:03:04.170> JPEG<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.100> can<00:03:05.250> have<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.430> look<00:03:05.580> at<00:03:09.590> here's

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
a JPEG that we can have a look at here's

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.740 
a JPEG that we can have a look at here's
a<00:03:10.680> nice<00:03:10.830> one<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.270> red<00:03:12.450> arrows

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
a nice one it's of the the red arrows

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.860 
a nice one it's of the the red arrows
flying<00:03:13.050> in<00:03:13.260> formation<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:14.390> took<00:03:15.390> this<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.660> couple

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
flying in formation I took this a couple

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.120 
flying in formation I took this a couple
of<00:03:15.990> years<00:03:16.050> ago<00:03:18.560> streamed<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.710> a<00:03:19.830> little<00:03:20.040> bit

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
of years ago streamed with a little bit

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.410 
of years ago streamed with a little bit
of<00:03:20.220> background<00:03:20.340> music<00:03:20.850> there<00:03:21.000> too<00:03:21.180> straight

of background music there too straight
to<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.600> Panasonic<00:03:23.720> transitions<00:03:24.720> then

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
to the Panasonic transitions then

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.810 
to the Panasonic transitions then
through<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:27.740> shot<00:03:28.740> of<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.980> local<00:03:29.280> golf<00:03:29.550> club

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
through to a shot of a local golf club

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.260 
through to a shot of a local golf club
Clubhouse<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:33.080> let's<00:03:34.940> have<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> quick<00:03:36.240> look

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
Clubhouse and let's have a quick look

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.380 
Clubhouse and let's have a quick look
now<00:03:36.570> at<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:37.310> more<00:03:38.310> important<00:03:38.730> aspect<00:03:39.120> which<00:03:39.270> i

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
now at the more important aspect which i

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.050 
now at the more important aspect which i
think<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.720> video<00:03:40.260> streaming<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.730> we've<00:03:41.850> seen

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
think is video streaming so we've seen

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.290 
think is video streaming so we've seen
music<00:03:42.660> we've<00:03:42.900> seen<00:03:43.170> photographs<00:03:44.180> let's<00:03:45.180> have

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
music we've seen photographs let's have

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.700 
music we've seen photographs let's have
a<00:03:45.330> look<00:03:45.510> now<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:45.990> what<00:03:46.200> we<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.410> do<00:03:46.590> when

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
a look now and see what we can do when

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.990 
a look now and see what we can do when
it<00:03:46.860> comes<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.160> video<00:03:47.310> streaming<00:03:49.850> cure<00:03:50.850> our

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
it comes to video streaming cure our

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.120 
it comes to video streaming cure our
room<00:03:51.210> knows<00:03:51.450> exactly<00:03:52.140> what<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> device<00:03:52.920> is

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
room knows exactly what the device is

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.500 
room knows exactly what the device is
that<00:03:53.160> it's<00:03:53.400> streaming<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.940> who<00:03:54.210> knows<00:03:54.420> the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
that it's streaming to who knows the

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.620 
that it's streaming to who knows the
device<00:03:54.780> capabilities<00:03:55.250> if<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.760> can<00:03:56.940> absolutely

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
device capabilities if it can absolutely

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.870 
device capabilities if it can absolutely
stream<00:03:58.260> natively<00:03:58.920> than<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.250> will<00:03:59.340> do<00:03:59.550> if<00:03:59.760> it

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
stream natively than it will do if it

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.030 
stream natively than it will do if it
needs<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.120> transfer<00:04:00.570> then<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.840> will<00:04:00.930> do<00:04:01.050> so<00:04:01.290> so

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
needs to transfer then it will do so so

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
needs to transfer then it will do so so
