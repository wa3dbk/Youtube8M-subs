00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:08.189
 Allegory Ball Theme 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:11.930
 The track began to play an active part in Japan during the Meiji era, more than 100 years ago 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:17.290
 Currently Mitsukoshi imports trucks from France 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.290
 It is said that the beginning used as a product delivery car 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.970
 Production of domestic trucks also started thereafter 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.300
 It has spread as a car to deliver things since 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.199
 Ah 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.199
 Truck transportation now accounts for 90% of Japan's logistics 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.850
 Why did we come to support our lives so far ? 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:54.050
 We talked with Shigeru Chikada who is a motor journalist who is familiar with the track 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:01:00.530
 The point is that unlike a passenger car for personal demand, a truck is necessary and developed as a mayor in society 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:06.900
 If it is my interpretation and it is one of the development of the lantern network and it is the order of the consigner 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:10.220
 Is that is whether etc. lock and agility mobility a little even, for example, medicine against 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.220
 I think it helped the song 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:18.319
 Truck transportation boon supporting life 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.319
 It says that there is a case to symbolize it 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.330
 The Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred in March 2011 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.890
 Actually there was a problem at this time 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.890
 Support supplies of the sun which hears damage and arrives from the whole country 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.000
 However 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:46.160
 At that time all road and rail distribution routes were cut off 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.160
 There is no way to deliver things to the disaster area 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:57.520
 Lock is the best way to deliver more pussy 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.950
 People in the Orthodox Church also volunteered and cooperated as volunteers 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.670
 Each prefecture in Tohoku asks the Trucking Association for cooperation 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.680
 Call on national shipping companies 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.680
 Logistics professionals gathered 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:19.400
 Immediately pick up support supplies 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.400
 We started transportation by truck towards disaster area by volunteer 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.099
 While transportation is limited by this 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.099
 We were able to deliver the supplies to the victims 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.019
 What a truck could do with its mobility 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.970
 Furthermore , it helped to collect the debris that overflowed all over the city 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.690
 Now what is required of the truck industry 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.410
 If you talk so far, it's a little bit like a trap It's a story 10 years 20 years ago 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:10.390
 But I did not have a good image too 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:13.750
 The grounds are that the exhaust gas spews dirty smoke, and there are also talks such as driving is rough and so on 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:20.920
 In the manufacturer's firmly An 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:25.960
 When I was led, let's keep away from hicas New technologies that can contribute there 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:31.920
 Is trying to take in more and more 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.920
 What is now required is environmental technology that contributes to society
