00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.419
 hello I hope you are super well we are going to 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.540
 be starting with a clean face and 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:11.210
 with hair horribly 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.010
 unitary and redundant as I have the 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.690
 hair of the second day or third day not 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.890
 I remember well you are organizing a 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.539
 football betrayal that is your 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.300
 preference you can also use 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.220
 Talc can use this sense and 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.439
 ermua bird I like it because you do not give me the 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.439
 very hard hair like that of soft 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.199
 keratin so if it does its function that 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.489
 it is the important thing if they have any 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.370
 preferred from the bottom 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.840
 basically what I'm doing is 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.989
 gathering it at the roots so that 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.629
 oils are absorbed for a period 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.960
 from 5 to 10 minutes what I wear 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.179
 It seems that is the first thing I do next 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.379
 of that and that is to do so absorb 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.379
 the oils I'm going to 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.330
 I'm going to move my hair so that it diffuses 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.190
 of all that white and we're going to start 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:03.980
 with a makeup I'm super fast and 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.960
 moisturizing the lips and now in the 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.770
 face just in case I had cleaned myself 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.480
 hands after shining with hair 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.100
 well then if you believe me of my 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.280
 problems of the face with same instant 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.560
 to give you time and clear with everyone 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.790
 clock phone calls there when 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.990
 something do not do hundreds of hurry 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.780
 and I'm going to dodge the step of the base 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.810
 to use only correctors with 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.930
 corrector finally I maybelline in 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.550
 medium color as I was then say 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.080
 there 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.060
 and I will place the leather area 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.610
 my face this only to match 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.430
 the tone of my skin and to illuminate it a 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.240
 little to give you a little more 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.280
 weakness 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.740
 I'm going to be blurring all this with 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.820
 an angular sigma plan brush that the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.820
 68 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.920
 and all this I'm going to be dreaming of 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.380
 a single powder this time I'm just going to 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.010
 be using that body and mate 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.590
 I write and you see 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.200
 I do not expect that much product my face 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.670
 this is nothing but a make - up for it 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.849
 when we are press that we want 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.560
 revive our face a bit because 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.420
 we have to sir that if you puff up 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.750
 example my circles are under study 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.690
 hassan followed so well to see a 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.060
 little bit more finished our face 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.620
 let's put a little more 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.450
 you take with the makeup 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.250
 I'm producing my face I'm not 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.260
 outlining or nothing is only 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.220
 doing a little bit like day to give 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.220
 life to my face 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.970
 in the full face I'm using 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.000
 this bronzer that is he who are me 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.090
 of mac and how is it orange so we have 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.340
 those pronounced in the bolton in miserable 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.610
 I'm using my god I do not 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.720
 agreement what is a mac line air that 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.790
 I think it's called stripper and it's not strip 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.900
 town on our lips and every time I do not 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.860
 da home can be seen in the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.700
 screen right now and it's 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.800
 and basically what I do is the little 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.960
 stroke my eyebrows and then blur the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.650
 or an eyebrow brush to make it 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.650
 as natural as possible 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.760
 This step is optional but always 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.569
 I do use some men sombre quotes 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.450
 in automatic lojas that confusion is 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.569
 this a champagne shadow or a 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.870
 illuminator the one you want and has 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.930
 more by hand is that of mervin womanizer 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.190
 since the payment and I like this is for me 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.989
 tear and a little more is not 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.000
 extending a little bit more because I 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.170
 like that light that you take to 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.500
 what do you prefer? 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.760
 and if you put shadow in your eye and that's why 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.760
 you are those strange faces 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.939
 or medical of you in a bowl and they are very 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.030
 at night because you hear the 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:19.220
 coquillos my loves excuse me then 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.900
 to enlighten our eyes we are going to 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.729
 use this mask that is let me 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.639
 where grief fit is I love for this 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.669
 today is a hurry because only with one 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.680
 layer they go up because it gives me volume and 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.470
 mazda lengthens a little bit a big thing 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.740
 because I only have not many 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.539
 eyelashes but I do not have many 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.220
 eyelashes but if you make me differences and 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.990
 that's why I like it and of course the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.860
 from below also because I like to do it 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.860
 almost doll 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:58.189
 hand out kisses is also illuminating my 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.989
 face as I said this is also 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.689
 optional but I love my loves 

00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:04.489
 always be illuminated a face 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:06.110
 bright it's like that cooler in 

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:07.459
 juvenile so that's why I do it 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.289
 forever 

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:11.030
 I recommend that you see them 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.760
 so radiant 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.030
 and of course spread the light 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.010
 now I had loved this 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.080
 optional also a vibrant color makes 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.730
 that you look like you look like 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.280

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.050

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.320
 heroine of mac is a video ticket 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.590
 vibrant mate and I say that a lipstick 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.450
 vibrant complements you so brutal in what 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.190
 that you do not need much because of that 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.990

 Now going back to the hair 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.850
 if after squeezing me but like who 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:18.150
 says so that all the spray is diffused 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.740
 that had the white 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.040
