00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.970 
it's suffer the crib death I'm not sure
that<00:00:32.969> that's<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.270> case<00:00:33.300> especially<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.739> more

people take the time to read the report

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
people take the time to read the report
over<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> Christmas<00:00:39.090> period<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:40.020> has<00:00:40.110> been

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
over the Christmas period there has been

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.310 
over the Christmas period there has been
a<00:00:40.290> well<00:00:40.559> orchestrated<00:00:40.800> effort<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.730> make<00:00:41.910> sure

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
a well orchestrated effort to make sure

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.799 
a well orchestrated effort to make sure
that<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.469> report<00:00:44.180> does<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.210> gather

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that that report does not gather

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.139 
that that report does not gather
momentum<00:00:46.640> unfortunately<00:00:47.640> there<00:00:47.789> hasn't<00:00:47.969> been

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
momentum unfortunately there hasn't been

momentum unfortunately there hasn't been
much<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.660> counter<00:00:49.140> effort<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.579> think

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
much of a counter effort but I think

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.430 
much of a counter effort but I think
that<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.329> too<00:00:51.660> late<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that is not too late and I think it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
that is not too late and I think it
would<00:00:52.530> serve<00:00:52.739> us<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:53.039> well<00:00:53.840> not<00:00:54.840> least<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.850> few

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
would serve us all well not least a few

would serve us all well not least a few

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.559 
looking at we get a little desk to that
and<00:02:12.480> there<00:02:12.780> are<00:02:12.900> three

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
and there are three

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.869 
and there are three
actions<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.140> report<00:02:14.609> there<00:02:15.609> is<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
actions to the report there is the

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.420 
actions to the report there is the
assessment<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.689> situation<00:02:16.719> and<00:02:17.469> then

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
assessment of the situation and then

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.149 
assessment of the situation and then
there<00:02:18.639> is<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.909> way<00:02:19.060> forward<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.810> new<00:02:20.799> approach

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
there is the way forward a new approach

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.729 
there is the way forward a new approach
which<00:02:21.939> is<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.209> external<00:02:22.840> approach<00:02:23.349> the

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
which is the external approach the

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.780 
which is the external approach the
second<00:02:24.159> section<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.480> internal<00:02:26.079> approach

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
second section and the internal approach

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.599 
second section and the internal approach
and<00:02:27.790> those<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.450> are<00:02:28.659> attuned<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
and those that are attuned to the

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.199 
and those that are attuned to the
nuances<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.810> subtleties<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:33.000> think<00:02:34.000> at

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
nuances and the subtleties I think at

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.309 
nuances and the subtleties I think at
least<00:02:34.389> would<00:02:34.689> have<00:02:34.780> heard<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.109> following<00:02:37.319> the

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
least would have heard the following the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.619 
least would have heard the following the
internal<00:02:39.189> approach<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.909> that's<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.329> third

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
internal approach and that's the third

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.050 
internal approach and that's the third
part<00:02:41.079> of<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.290> report<00:02:43.169> does<00:02:44.169> not<00:02:44.200> admit<00:02:44.680> to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
part of the report does not admit to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.970 
part of the report does not admit to
easy<00:02:46.060> solutions<00:02:46.810> there<00:02:47.109> are<00:02:47.260> plenty<00:02:47.620> of

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
easy solutions there are plenty of

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.069 
easy solutions there are plenty of
things<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.549> study<00:02:48.790> group<00:02:49.000> says<00:02:49.419> but<00:02:49.989> I

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
things that the study group says but I

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.319 
things that the study group says but I
think<00:02:50.319> they're<00:02:50.469> come<00:02:50.680> over<00:02:51.250> over<00:02:52.120> rising

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
think they're come over over rising

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.780 
think they're come over over rising
messages<00:02:53.139> there<00:02:54.069> is<00:02:54.189> going<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.579> be<00:02:54.609> an

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
messages there is going to be an

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.240 
messages there is going to be an
interaction<00:02:55.540> between<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.439> politics<00:02:56.919> of<00:02:57.099> this

the public opinion of this and the

the public opinion of this and the
reality<00:03:00.340> on<00:03:00.609> the<00:03:00.730> ground<00:03:00.900> which<00:03:01.900> may<00:03:02.139> drive<00:03:02.469> it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
reality on the ground which may drive it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.349 
reality on the ground which may drive it
more<00:03:02.919> than<00:03:03.069> anything<00:03:03.340> else<00:03:03.639> which<00:03:04.209> is

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
more than anything else which is

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.689 
more than anything else which is
ultimately<00:03:04.599> going<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.500> lead<00:03:05.680> American<00:03:06.310> policy

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:06.699 
ultimately going to lead American policy

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.500 
ultimately going to lead American policy
in<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.879> certain<00:03:07.120> direction<00:03:07.859> unless<00:03:09.329> which<00:03:10.329> is<00:03:10.480> a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
in a certain direction unless which is a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.990 
in a certain direction unless which is a
big<00:03:10.750> unless<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.739> stubbornness<00:03:12.219> continues

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
big unless the stubbornness continues

nevertheless<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:14.109> think<00:03:14.319> are<00:03:14.469> enough<00:03:14.829> hints

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
nevertheless I think are enough hints

nevertheless I think are enough hints
out<00:03:15.340> there<00:03:15.609> I<00:03:15.849> don't<00:03:16.449> think<00:03:16.540> it's

out there I don't think it's

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.449

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
first quarter of 08 I don't think it's

in other parts of the world by the way

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.890 
in other parts of the world by the way
on<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.959> internal<00:03:35.379> approach<00:03:35.889> start<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.900> again

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
on the internal approach start and again

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.289 
on the internal approach start and again
it<00:03:38.109> requires<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.590> detailed<00:03:39.069> reading<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.759> I

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
it requires a detailed reading that I

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.490 
it requires a detailed reading that I
hope<00:03:40.569> people<00:03:40.889> indulge<00:03:41.889> in<00:03:42.900> there's<00:03:43.900> much<00:03:44.229> in

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
hope people indulge in there's much in

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.789 
hope people indulge in there's much in
here<00:03:44.909> but<00:03:45.909> that<00:03:46.180> says<00:03:46.810> he's<00:03:46.959> worth<00:03:47.169> looking<00:03:47.680> at

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
here but that says he's worth looking at

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.580 
here but that says he's worth looking at
whether<00:03:48.489> it's<00:03:48.729> the<00:03:48.909> notion<00:03:49.299> that<00:03:50.139> the<00:03:50.319> US

whether it's the notion that the US
