you don't feel the hierarchal content I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.660 
you don't feel the hierarchal content I
mean<00:01:39.250> between<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.060> dry<00:01:41.300> hair<00:01:41.570> or<00:01:42.520> with<00:01:43.520> the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
mean between the dry hair or with the

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
pilsner and the four and a half this is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.370 
pilsner and the four and a half this is
six<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.970> half<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.510> you<00:01:47.630> really<00:01:47.960> can't<00:01:48.200> feel

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the difference tasting and I guess when

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.750 
the difference tasting and I guess when
you<00:01:50.720> drink<00:01:50.930> four<00:01:51.590> or<00:01:51.710> five<00:01:51.890> bottles<00:01:52.190> of<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.610> it

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
you drink four or five bottles of it it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.590 
you drink four or five bottles of it it
does<00:01:53.050> have<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> different<00:01:54.530> effect<00:01:54.620> after<00:01:55.070> that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
does have a different effect after that

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.690 
does have a different effect after that
