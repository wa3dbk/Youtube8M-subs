00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.870
 Moscow Championship Moscow Championship 

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:51.739

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:59.369
 promising start funny and vigorous music 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:02.069
 go to in for the cast spoke

 obediently enough behaves good 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:12.930
 massage showed good piaf and transitions 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:15.140
 and now added trot added 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.240
 lynx many times was uneven 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.630
 high marks of course and chopsticks for 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.630
 experiment 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.570
 well marriott i have to say to the viewers 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.150
 very difficult horse a lot very much 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.310
 need to make a hodgepodge in order to 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.190
 earn his trust and in order to 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.660
 he started to have him everywhere 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.660
 showed what you want 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.079
 with attention to the trot is done let's say 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:57.430
 Left take and not quite well battery 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:02:03.280
 with mom was right better seen here 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.200
 that lying house distracted added 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.380
 lynx driven into that pipe world now 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.119
 evenly and you will see when fits 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.119
 letters and a little distracted 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:33.510
 transition collected step good rhythmic 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:33.510
 collected step transition added 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:43.090
 made gave a clear transition 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:48.310
 shown increasing the frame also stayed 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.620
 let the rhythm step over but a little 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.500
 she is constantly and she is seen that too 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.940
 stretches 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.380
 before the rise you have to drink going and 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.380
 forecast at a gallop 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:14.580
 some misunderstanding happened by 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:16.380
 my on there with lari eye on double 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.030
 the primer was conceived but on the second feather and 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.030
 the same is our real contact 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.070
 then there is no 2 tempo well executed kv-2 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.380
 tempo a little bit at first can be 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.130
 dangling from behind we could see it straight 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.160
 line that's unfortunately that's for sure 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.770
 first heroes won't get high marks 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:49.110
 despite the fact that at the same place 2 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:50.820
 perform well received utterly 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.970
 very well done 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.540
 by impulse promotion lies and moves 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.540
 uphill 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:13.299
 a bunch forward again 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.449
 come on but you probably yes double tours well 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.060
 let's say it performed well of course 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:22.780
 it was evident that it was a lie at no point 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.669
 it all made moved a little bit and 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.740
 so incomplete obey let's say so 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.440
 It was the first time these people said this yet. 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:35.190
 exit for a minute one 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.190
 the market in one with a failure was performed 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.630
 with a bar heads well performer 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.630
 bunny gave 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.840
 moving forward in front of us was visible 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:56.950
 so that the straightforward poked in small 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:05.770
 by this ruling natalie repeat 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:08.890
 mental one is good the last is very sorry 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.970
 last tempo 5 framed for heap 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.590
 come with experience already this here is the athlete 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.630
 repeated it turned out it's time to finish 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.630
 now the main thing is not to overdo it 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:36.160
 good midline massage good 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:41.640
 but at first slightly faded away 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.640
 picked up was able to make a good income 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.180
 and good passage 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:58.439
 2 2 1 5 on average received all 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.330
 said too much planted back he 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:02.580
 confused hind legs to stop 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.339
 the latter is certainly not done as 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.349
 I would like a horse stretched natalya 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.849
 probably worry, I think, but I think 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.740
 that I should not worry there what is common 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.050
 impression of food left enough 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.289
 good many items many items 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.169
 It was performed qualitatively without errors 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:22.319
 Naturally our sport is such that all 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:25.139
 court comes goodbye dear
