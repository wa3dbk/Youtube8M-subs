00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello today is a few tips like a 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.450
 bit calmer and more relaxed 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.340
 you can do it first and foremost 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.920
 I would recommend the bag to pack 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.120
 so they can do the 90 and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.809
 sleep at least a little bit longer 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.789
 could and then as a second tip would 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.609
 I do not say what you all possible 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.199
 at it and too bright lights because you 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.269
 then just get a bit tired 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.539
 and yes, those are the lights I'm on 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.539
 leave 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.840
 maybe you upset you also still 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.880
 Start full on dessert because you 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.800
 because of the light i do it because of that 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.390
 I have one and somehow enough 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.930
 have water and then I'm still 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.790
 a tea 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 I will not do any green topics 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.150
 if I'm going to pull on too long then 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.590
 he woke up as tired and yes she says 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:56.100
 I also really cozy and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.900
 bottle said i would like to start now 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.790
 always from before I sleep her one 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.200
 nice to go and with nice my 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.840
 I now a book that you do not read 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.399
 must for such a textbook or so 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.880
 and then catch a bit of yes 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.880
 to live 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.530
 would kasan 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.530
 do you have 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.720
 I think if you read that then 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.670
 The body relaxes and when 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.190
 Now you can do the homework 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.200
 you switch off what, so to speak and yes then 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.060
 a girl is not allowed in the book either 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.330
 only with a hand cream the one 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.280
 nice fragrance but not too strong and 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.300
 the judge has the way brave and night 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.300
 with healthy 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.640
 and then of course I know what means 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.640
 their 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.280
 I only sleep my baker 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.930
 and several more so I know that I am 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.180
 I'll wake up someday and I will not 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.080
 sleep more and then you get stuck 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.760
 still on the piste 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.010
 so that I can not be disturbed 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.410
 to be limp and not from bachern and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.000
 Of course, it is still possible to go away because you 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.740
 still other things memorable 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.370
 not short of sleeping on the phone 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.200
 type in 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.910
 but maybe I can know music 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.500
 I can not stop with good music 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.120
 some people do not and that is with 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.790
 far the worst asked go 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.380
 I have made target I hope it had 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.380
 like the fall hopefully to the mark
