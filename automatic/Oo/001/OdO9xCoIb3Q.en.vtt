00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that this is easy as that now I have a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.319 
that this is easy as that now I have a
skillet<00:02:01.170> over<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.680> um<00:02:04.759> on<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> medium

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
skillet over here that is um on a medium

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.900 
skillet over here that is um on a medium
heat<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.140> found<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.009> do<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> little<00:02:08.610> bit

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
heat I found if you do it a little bit

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.309 
heat I found if you do it a little bit
like<00:02:09.780> straight<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.560> down<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
like straight up and down on the

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.610 
like straight up and down on the
it<00:02:11.760> cooks<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.939> little<00:02:13.120> slower<00:02:13.599> but<00:02:16.560> kind<00:02:17.560> of

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
it cooks a little slower but kind of

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.199 
it cooks a little slower but kind of
want<00:02:17.829> that<00:02:18.040> because<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.579> sugar<00:02:18.849> will

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
want that because the sugar will

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.429 
want that because the sugar will
actually<00:02:19.540> kind<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.810> burn<00:02:20.049> from<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:20.530> banana

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
actually kind of burn from the banana

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.050 
actually kind of burn from the banana
sugar<00:02:23.439> will<00:02:23.650> actually<00:02:23.980> burn<00:02:24.250> from<00:02:24.609> the<00:02:24.700> banana

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
sugar will actually burn from the banana

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.819 
sugar will actually burn from the banana
if<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:27.420> put<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.510> too<00:02:28.689> high<00:02:28.720> before<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.500> inside

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
if you put it too high before the inside

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.240

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
don't like to make them too big because

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.830 
don't like to make them too big because
they<00:02:55.659> are<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> little<00:02:57.239> not<00:02:58.239> really<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.569> good
