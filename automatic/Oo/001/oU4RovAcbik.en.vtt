00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
really wasn't focused on if I'm going to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.130 
really wasn't focused on if I'm going to
win<00:02:23.790> or<00:02:24.030> lose<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.390> was<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.630> seeking<00:02:24.780> really

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
win or lose I was just seeking really

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.920 
win or lose I was just seeking really
one<00:02:25.860> point<00:02:26.099> at<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.310> time<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.849> staying<00:02:27.630> positive

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
one point at a time and staying positive

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.510 
one point at a time and staying positive
and<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:30.319> trying<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.470> keep<00:02:31.620> my<00:02:31.680> focus<00:02:34.520> it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
and just trying to keep my focus it

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.600 
and just trying to keep my focus it
seemed<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.239> be<00:02:36.390> difficult<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> stretch

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
seemed to be difficult to see a stretch

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.820 
seemed to be difficult to see a stretch
of<00:02:38.640> points<00:02:39.360> that's<00:02:39.600> why<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:39.930> match<00:02:40.410> was<00:02:40.650> so

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
of points that's why they match was so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
of points that's why they match was so
tight<00:02:41.269> we<00:02:42.269> were<00:02:42.390> made<00:02:42.630> my<00:02:42.840> point<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.850> together

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
tight we were made my point and together

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.710

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
and you away nice series of points and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.979 
and you away nice series of points and
you<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.890> was<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.340> was<00:02:50.459> weird<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:50.989> now

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
you know it was it was weird because now

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.479 
you know it was it was weird because now
we<00:02:52.049> were<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:52.680> discussing<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.280> played

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
so long but at the end I felt because I

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.940 
so long but at the end I felt because I
just<00:02:57.239> came<00:02:57.390> from<00:02:57.420> clay<00:02:57.900> season<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.739> claim

very<00:03:00.780> long<00:03:00.930> but<00:03:01.080> tonight<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.560> seemed<00:03:01.739> we<00:03:02.190> were

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
very long but tonight it seemed we were

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.550 
very long but tonight it seemed we were
going<00:03:02.610> points<00:03:02.970> for<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.150> point<00:03:03.420> but<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.200> wasn't

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
going points for a point but it wasn't

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.750 
going points for a point but it wasn't
like<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.950> doesn't<00:03:05.160> seem<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.640> were

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
feel like if I start looking too much

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.830 
feel like if I start looking too much
ahead<00:05:12.310> of<00:05:12.460> myself<00:05:12.640> then<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.000> lose<00:05:13.210> my<00:05:13.360> focus<00:05:13.570> on

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
ahead of myself then I lose my focus on

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.930 
ahead of myself then I lose my focus on
my<00:05:13.960> modulus<00:05:14.380> in<00:05:14.500> front<00:05:14.710> of<00:05:14.800> me<00:05:14.920> so<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:15.160> just<00:05:15.820> look

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
my modulus in front of me so I just look

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.980 
my modulus in front of me so I just look
at<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.120> schedule<00:05:16.360> a<00:05:16.510> see<00:05:16.570> who<00:05:16.750> I'm<00:05:16.840> playing

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.380 
at the schedule a see who I'm playing
and<00:05:17.260> then<00:05:17.380> I<00:05:17.620> go<00:05:18.480> specifically<00:05:19.480> to<00:05:19.930> say<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:22.150> lot

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
and then I go specifically to say a lot

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.880 
and then I go specifically to say a lot
of<00:05:22.540> players<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:23.230> this<00:05:23.710> just<00:05:24.010> by<00:05:24.190> positional

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
of players of this just by positional

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.290 
of players of this just by positional
many<00:05:26.890> pairs<00:05:27.160> of<00:05:27.250> men's<00:05:27.490> singles<00:05:27.880> adults

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
many pairs of men's singles adults

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.600 
many pairs of men's singles adults
usually<00:05:28.750> there<00:05:29.200> was<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.470> few<00:05:29.830> pay<00:05:30.010> doubles<00:05:30.400> and

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
usually there was a few pay doubles and

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.990 
usually there was a few pay doubles and
now<00:05:31.000> specialise<00:05:31.780> in<00:05:31.810> doubles<00:05:32.290> and<00:05:32.470> now<00:05:32.590> so<00:05:33.580> we

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
now specialise in doubles and now so we

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.090 
now specialise in doubles and now so we
