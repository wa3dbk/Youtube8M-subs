00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.490 

so<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.220> one<00:02:48.400> isn't<00:02:48.610> at<00:02:48.940> its<00:02:49.000> full<00:02:49.500> potential

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
so this one isn't at its full potential

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.740 
so this one isn't at its full potential
anymore<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.820> still<00:02:52.150> very<00:02:53.130> very<00:02:54.130> sharp

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
anymore but it is still very very sharp

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:03.840 
anymore but it is still very very sharp
so<00:02:55.750> from<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.110> viewfinder<00:02:56.710> background<00:03:02.850> so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
so from the viewfinder background so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.960 
so from the viewfinder background so
compared<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.690> length<00:03:05.020> of<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.290> 42<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:06.520> kind

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
compared to the length of a 42 is kind

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.480 
compared to the length of a 42 is kind
of<00:03:07.030> small<00:03:07.150> um<00:03:07.770> that's<00:03:08.770> one<00:03:09.190> thing<00:03:09.220> i<00:03:09.430> don't

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
of small um that's one thing i don't

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.880 
of small um that's one thing i don't
like<00:03:09.670> about<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:12.300> will<00:03:13.300> turn<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.020> up<00:03:14.110> bottom

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
like about it will turn it up bottom

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:23.160 
like about it will turn it up bottom
here<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:19.150> as<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.510> can<00:03:19.660> see<00:03:19.930> there<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.990> other

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
here so as you can see there the other

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.090 
here so as you can see there the other
42<00:03:23.830> does<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.550> some<00:03:24.760> links<00:03:25.060> on<00:03:25.180> it

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.220 

so<00:03:31.100> all<00:03:31.490> this<00:03:32.300> blade<00:03:32.660> in<00:03:33.050> my<00:03:33.110> opinion<00:03:33.710> is<00:03:35.230> not

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
so all this blade in my opinion is not

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.600 
so all this blade in my opinion is not
the<00:03:36.380> best<00:03:36.500> looking<00:03:36.620> blade<00:03:37.070> but<00:03:37.250> it's<00:03:37.400> kind<00:03:37.580> of

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
the best looking blade but it's kind of

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.400 
the best looking blade but it's kind of
grown<00:03:37.820> on<00:03:37.850> me<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.360> don't<00:03:38.630> really<00:03:38.870> mind<00:03:39.020> it<00:03:39.200> too

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
grown on me I don't really mind it too

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.620 
grown on me I don't really mind it too
much<00:03:39.440> now<00:03:39.800> but<00:03:40.070> like<00:03:40.250> first<00:03:41.030> time<00:03:41.210> I<00:03:41.270> saw<00:03:41.420> it's

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
much now but like first time I saw it's

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.060 
much now but like first time I saw it's
like<00:03:41.780> oh<00:03:41.810> that's<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.320> believe<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.680> now<00:03:42.800> that<00:03:42.980> I'm

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
like oh that's I believe it now that I'm

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.580 
like oh that's I believe it now that I'm
actually<00:03:43.220> seeing<00:03:43.550> it<00:03:43.670> in<00:03:43.820> person<00:03:44.170> it's<00:03:45.170> not<00:03:45.410> as

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
actually seeing it in person it's not as

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.460 
actually seeing it in person it's not as
bad<00:03:45.830> as<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.280> looks<00:03:46.580> or<00:03:47.570> as<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.930> did<00:03:48.110> look<00:03:48.260> but<00:03:49.130> um

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
you know so I on online I'd be able to

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.920 
you know so I on online I'd be able to
tantalate<00:03:54.790> via<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.000> same<00:03:56.209> handle<00:03:56.570> pattern

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
and these don't really have a lot of

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.160 
and these don't really have a lot of
weight<00:04:00.380> in<00:04:00.500> about<00:04:00.680> handles<00:04:01.190> um<00:04:01.900> but<00:04:02.900> again

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170
