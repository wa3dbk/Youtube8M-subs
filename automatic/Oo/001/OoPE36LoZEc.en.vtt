00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.990
 Welcome to the top choice 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.179
 just over past ten follow a gta 5 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.130
 special episode this time and I have mine 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.349
 thought come you have so many gta 5 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.389
 clips that were used for 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.650
 commander warrior you unfortunately not 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.630
 can use or you unfortunately 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.220
 can not use and I have that 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.820
 come here has a little here 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.430
 special result out and we just lay 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.230
 Let's go 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.880
 so get going with room number 5 of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.840
 Sarah Gray has a nice shootout with you 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.700
 the bulls 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.360
 Of course, this is nothing new he commits 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.280
 think what happens that is 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.989
 this is a bit different than you are 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 Of course it has to be very cool 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.160
 gangster also a really cool departure 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.309
 lie down when the deaf cops 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.410
 of course, has to be stylish too 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.360
 run away from the scene 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.910
 unfortunately this does not work here 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.160
 let's hope that's his 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.730
 Home has not seen the departure 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.129
 because that would be quite embarrassing place 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.049
 number four also from sarah gray and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.659
 unfortunately something very common he 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.220
 just drives over a motorcyclist 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.170
 I know what he should be so exciting yes 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 Sarah Gray was able to get ranked 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.520
 three save with a click where I am 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.590
 Also thought again where I am again 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.610
 thought why should I because 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 unfortunately happens again is now 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.229
 not too funny either 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.540
 Something special is flying here 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.790
 out of the car and is then still 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.409
 a few meters and then dead as often 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.770
 that has happened to us innumerable 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:46.380
 Male and place number two goes to Prince 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.689
 dirk ii is also a net name and man 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.240
 we just see underwater here 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.250
 runs around a bit and is 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.590
 not as the fruit and water wet 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.780
 understand what I mean 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.520
 I do not know how to get here now 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.380
 the monkeys are made these little bells 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.960
 or so I have no idea how to 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.490
 However, this is the case 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.140
 now nothing exciting fraser 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.090
 river 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.060
 that uses the world to see that has to be 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.250
 send in for commander warrior that must 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.019
 you just saw it is here 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.629
 unfortunately not the case because of that we have 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.150
 yes, the top 5 just over because there 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.150
 we show something like that, though 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.129
 next cliff you something of the socks 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.019
 hew that that is crazy but 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.340
 no sticky square number two do you have 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.480
 sure you have an underwater here 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.599
 adventure so place number one goes 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.340
 jonas the whole here high tech moderately 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.200
 with a handy camera or digital 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.019
 Camera has filmed and the clip is like that 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.440
 that has to show again 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.879
 Look at that a very steady hand 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.190
 the young man has her and the clip is 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.000
 I have never expressed that 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.810
 seen life 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.450
 I have to take a deep breath for so long 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.090
 that was the top five just over gta 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.819
 5 special episode as I said I have one 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.600
 few gta 5 clubs seen behind ademi 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.250
 were sent 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.910
 There it had to show now 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.620
 unfortunately not her and certainly not 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.690
 filmed with the cameramen how can 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.790
 to send something I am glad that 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.530
 over and over again and I do not come like that 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.060
 many people send that in there anyway 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.180
 can and then the clip was synonymous 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.519
 so fun and pointless that just right 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.079
 I just wonder what they what they 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.239
 what's going on then he does not own 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.579
 everything was bad the broken in yours 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.620
 head but thank you very much for 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.389
