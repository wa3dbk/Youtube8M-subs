to<00:02:18.870> announce<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.410> season<00:02:19.800> two<00:02:19.980> most<00:02:20.550> likely

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
to announce the season two most likely

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.980 
to announce the season two most likely
they're<00:02:21.120> gonna<00:02:21.180> end<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> cliffhanger

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
they're gonna end it on a cliffhanger

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.080 
they're gonna end it on a cliffhanger
right<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.800> end<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> second<00:02:23.670> day<00:02:23.820> I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
right on the end of the second day I

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.150 
right on the end of the second day I
think<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.480> would<00:02:24.660> be<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> best<00:02:25.050> part<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.950> end

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
think that would be the best part to end

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.520 
think that would be the best part to end

getting to see the team or getting to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.130 
getting to see the team or getting to
see<00:02:41.910> all<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.210> like<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.570> hard<00:02:42.780> work<00:02:42.960> they've

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
see all that like the hard work they've

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.540 
see all that like the hard work they've
had<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.380> accomplish<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.950> get<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.310> point

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
had to accomplish to get to this point

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.940 
had to accomplish to get to this point
that's<00:02:45.090> pretty<00:02:45.450> much<00:02:45.600> what<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:45.990> episode<00:02:46.200> was

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
that's pretty much what this episode was

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.680 
that's pretty much what this episode was
about<00:02:47.250> besides<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.910> beginning<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.390> ending

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
about besides the beginning and ending

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.380 
about besides the beginning and ending
segments<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.710> episode<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:50.940> guess

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
segments of this episode and so I guess

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.000 
segments of this episode and so I guess
at<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.690> same<00:02:51.900> time<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.440> was<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> good<00:02:52.830> episode

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
at the same time it was a good episode

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.740 
at the same time it was a good episode
it's<00:02:53.790> just<00:02:53.940> probably<00:02:54.090> some<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.450> these<00:02:54.540> scenes

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
it's just probably some of these scenes

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.260 
it's just probably some of these scenes
were<00:02:55.070> overdramatic<00:02:56.070> way<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.310> warm<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.090> am

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
were overdramatic way to warm but I am

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.160 
were overdramatic way to warm but I am
fine<00:02:57.600> with<00:02:57.810> that

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
fine with that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.830 
fine with that
one<00:02:58.530> thing<00:02:58.860> though<00:02:59.010> okay<00:02:59.370> now<00:02:59.970> as<00:03:00.390> we<00:03:00.540> know<00:03:00.570> how

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
one thing though okay now as we know how

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.120 
one thing though okay now as we know how
to<00:03:00.900> make<00:03:01.080> academies<00:03:01.440> break<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.710> up<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:01.890> so

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
would be really interesting if it turns

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.980 
would be really interesting if it turns
out<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.120> how<00:03:18.360> can<00:03:18.510> they<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.600> get<00:03:18.870> to

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
out like that how can they just get to

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.150 
out like that how can they just get to
off<00:03:19.050> throw<00:03:19.260> them<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.530> backburner<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:19.980> put

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
off throw them to the backburner and put

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.500 
off throw them to the backburner and put
in<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.280> third<00:03:20.490> place<00:03:20.790> because<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.420> would

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
in the third place because it would

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.580 
in the third place because it would
definitely<00:03:21.630> change<00:03:22.020> up<00:03:22.320> all<00:03:22.500> our
