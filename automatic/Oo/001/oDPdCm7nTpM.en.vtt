and the glass doesn't show the very top
top<00:01:53.850> anyway<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.869> want<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> take<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> balk

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

top anyway you want to take a balk
bucket<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.219> lava<00:01:56.399> next<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.960> way<00:01:58.079> lava

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
bucket of lava next and the way lava

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.709 
bucket of lava next and the way lava
works<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> source<00:02:00.090> block<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
works is from the source block it

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.209 
works is from the source block it
spreads<00:02:01.229> out<00:02:01.439> 3aw<00:02:02.479> both<00:02:03.479> ways<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
spreads out 3aw both ways so you want to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.499 
spreads out 3aw both ways so you want to
find<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> middle<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.119> see<00:02:06.270> here

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
find the middle as you can see here

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.029 
find the middle as you can see here
here's<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> middle<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:07.920> two

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
here's the middle then you have one two

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.729 
here's the middle then you have one two
three<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:09.030> two<00:02:09.149> three<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.869> drop<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.530> here

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
three one two three so you drop it here

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.790 
three one two three so you drop it here
and<00:02:10.940> watch<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:11.970> slowly<00:02:12.569> spreads<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
and watch it slowly spreads to the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.340 
and watch it slowly spreads to the
and<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:15.360> checked<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.750> before<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.200> doesn't

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and I checked this before it doesn't

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.260 
and I checked this before it doesn't
spread<00:02:16.680> past<00:02:16.950> three<00:02:17.630> as<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.620> see<00:02:19.800> here

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
spread past three as you can see here

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.640 
spread past three as you can see here
you<00:02:21.270> can<00:02:21.300> see<00:02:21.480> exactly<00:02:21.750> where<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.350> put<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
you can see exactly where I put the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.060 
you can see exactly where I put the
blocks<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.900> don't<00:02:25.050> see<00:02:25.230> any<00:02:25.350> lava<00:02:25.530> yet<00:02:25.770> so

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
blocks and you don't see any lava yet so

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.020 
blocks and you don't see any lava yet so
let's<00:02:26.280> go<00:02:26.430> ahead<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.790> remove<00:02:27.540> those<00:02:27.900> blocks

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
let's go ahead and remove those blocks

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.810 
let's go ahead and remove those blocks
just<00:02:30.110> whack<00:02:31.110> at<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.350> until<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:32.220> think<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
just whack at it until you think the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.770 
just whack at it until you think the
block<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.210> gone<00:02:33.420> should<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:34.380> pretty<00:02:34.560> obvious

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
block is gone should be pretty obvious

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.720 
block is gone should be pretty obvious
just<00:02:36.780> keep<00:02:37.080> removing<00:02:37.890> all<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.370> blocks<00:02:38.610> from

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
just keep removing all the blocks from

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.480 
just keep removing all the blocks from
under<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.270> lava<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.650> set<00:02:40.890> there<00:02:41.070> before

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
under the lava that you set there before

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.820 
under the lava that you set there before
and<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:43.560> should<00:02:43.800> be<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:45.140> yeah<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.650> can

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
and that should be it yeah as you can

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.610 
and that should be it yeah as you can
see<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:48.030> lava<00:02:48.240> fall<00:02:48.510> works<00:02:48.780> perfect<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.530> you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
see the lava fall works perfect and you

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.470 
see the lava fall works perfect and you
have<00:02:49.800> your<00:02:49.950> own<00:02:50.100> nice<00:02:50.460> little<00:02:50.760> lava<00:02:53.480> glass

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
have your own nice little lava glass

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.040 
have your own nice little lava glass
awful<00:02:54.840> lot<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.050> thing<00:02:55.310> as<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.450> see<00:02:57.720> here

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
awful lot of a thing as you can see here

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.960 
awful lot of a thing as you can see here
it's<00:02:58.320> perfectly<00:02:58.980> walled<00:02:59.220> off<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.760> course

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
it's perfectly walled off and of course

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.440 
it's perfectly walled off and of course
if<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.900> ever<00:03:00.930> want<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.940> want<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.210> block

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
if you ever want to you want to block

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.610 
if you ever want to you want to block
this<00:03:03.630> off<00:03:03.780> eventually<00:03:04.260> because<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.500> don't

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
this off eventually because you don't

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.610 
this off eventually because you don't
want<00:03:04.740> people<00:03:04.770> see<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.550> mechanics<00:03:06.000> behind<00:03:06.180> it

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
want people see the mechanics behind it

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.860 
want people see the mechanics behind it
so<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.650> would<00:03:07.980> be<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.310> your<00:03:08.850> ceiling<00:03:09.660> and

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
so that would be like your ceiling and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.630 
so that would be like your ceiling and
then<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:10.050> just<00:03:10.320> come<00:03:10.710> across<00:03:11.010> or<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.490> can

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
then you just come across or you can

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.140 
then you just come across or you can
even<00:03:11.760> start<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.240> ceiling<00:03:12.540> across<00:03:12.840> here<00:03:14.150> just

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
even start the ceiling across here just

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.570 
even start the ceiling across here just
depends<00:03:15.770> also<00:03:16.770> if<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.100> notice<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
depends also if you notice all the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.640 
depends also if you notice all the
torches<00:03:17.850> my<00:03:18.390> last<00:03:18.570> video<00:03:18.870> wasn't<00:03:19.260> lit

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
torches my last video wasn't lit

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.960 
torches my last video wasn't lit
properly<00:03:19.860> through<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.490> entire<00:03:20.730> thing

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
properly through the entire thing

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.340 
properly through the entire thing
because<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.300> started<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.660> get<00:03:21.720> dark<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
because it started to get dark in the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.560 
because it started to get dark in the
middle<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.850> went<00:03:23.970> ahead<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.390> put

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
middle of it so I went ahead and put

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.160 
middle of it so I went ahead and put
torches<00:03:24.840> while<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.410> was<00:03:25.590> there<00:03:26.690> but<00:03:27.690> yeah<00:03:27.870> as

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
torches while I was there but yeah as

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.280 
torches while I was there but yeah as
you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.320> see<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:29.490> pretty<00:03:30.300> simple<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.260> can

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
you can see it pretty simple and you can

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.290 
you can see it pretty simple and you can
do<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.709> with<00:03:32.010> multiple<00:03:32.220> walls<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.150> even

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
do it with multiple walls you can even

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.040 
do it with multiple walls you can even
make<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.690> where<00:03:33.900> even<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.530> pillars<00:03:35.130> are<00:03:35.310> glass

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
make it where even the pillars are glass

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.280 
make it where even the pillars are glass
but<00:03:37.050> uh<00:03:37.670> if<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.820> really<00:03:39.360> want<00:03:39.540> me<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.810> get<00:03:40.080> more

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
but uh if you really want me to get more

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.020 
but uh if you really want me to get more
into<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:41.190> can<00:03:41.670> always<00:03:41.850> make<00:03:42.000> another

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
into that I can always make another

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.940 
into that I can always make another
video<00:03:42.540> showing<00:03:42.780> more<00:03:43.050> advanced<00:03:43.530> lava

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
video showing more advanced lava

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.670 
video showing more advanced lava
techniques<00:03:44.870> anyway<00:03:45.870> next<00:03:46.140> I'll<00:03:46.380> be<00:03:46.410> showing

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
techniques anyway next I'll be showing

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.410 
techniques anyway next I'll be showing
you<00:03:46.830> how<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.040> make<00:03:47.220> your<00:03:47.340> own<00:03:47.400> lava<00:03:47.910> place<00:03:48.209> as

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
you how to make your own lava place as

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.780 
you how to make your own lava place as
well<00:03:48.600> as<00:03:48.750> secrets<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.860> can<00:03:50.040> hide<00:03:50.280> behind<00:03:50.459> it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
well as secrets you can hide behind it

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.220 
well as secrets you can hide behind it
first<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.660> all<00:03:51.800> how<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.860> lava<00:03:53.220> place<00:03:53.520> works<00:03:53.820> is

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
first of all how the lava place works is

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.890 
first of all how the lava place works is
you<00:03:55.230> basically<00:03:55.410> put<00:03:56.040> blocks<00:03:56.340> here<00:03:56.820> get<00:03:57.720> rid<00:03:57.840> of

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
you basically put blocks here get rid of

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.530 
you basically put blocks here get rid of
that<00:03:58.050> torch<00:03:59.060> then<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.180> take<00:04:01.250> these<00:04:02.330> but<00:04:03.330> those

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
that torch then you take these but those

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.040 
that torch then you take these but those
here<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:05.100> your<00:04:05.490> lava<00:04:05.670> fall<00:04:06.000> your<00:04:06.300> lava<00:04:06.720> place

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
here so your lava fall your lava place

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.290 
here so your lava fall your lava place
will<00:04:07.230> look<00:04:07.350> like<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.709> right<00:04:07.950> now<00:04:08.250> then<00:04:09.150> you

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
will look like this right now then you

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.260 
will look like this right now then you
just<00:04:09.540> take<00:04:09.959> two<00:04:10.320> buckets<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.770> lava<00:04:11.120> put<00:04:12.120> one

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
just take two buckets of lava put one

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.110 
just take two buckets of lava put one
there<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.780> one<00:04:12.840> there<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.100> then

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
there and one there and then

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.069 
there and one there and then

seen in my first video I show you my own
panic<00:06:08.180> room<00:06:08.390> and<00:06:08.780> it<00:06:09.170> has<00:06:09.380> a<00:06:09.410> secret<00:06:09.920> level

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
panic room and it has a secret level

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.430 
panic room and it has a secret level
lever<00:06:11.030> right<00:06:11.570> here<00:06:13.090> you<00:06:14.090> can<00:06:14.270> basically<00:06:14.750> put

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
lever right here you can basically put

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.570 
lever right here you can basically put
things<00:06:15.650> in<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:15.890> side<00:06:16.070> of<00:06:16.100> the<00:06:16.280> wall<00:06:16.400> you<00:06:16.550> can

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
things in the side of the wall you can

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.030 
things in the side of the wall you can
even<00:06:16.790> put<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.680> well<00:06:18.680> I<00:06:18.710> don't<00:06:18.830> think<00:06:18.980> you

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
even put the well I don't think you

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.170 
even put the well I don't think you
could<00:06:19.160> put<00:06:19.250> the<00:06:19.370> lever<00:06:19.550> down<00:06:19.730> here<00:06:19.790> because

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
could put the lever down here because

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.850 
could put the lever down here because
the<00:06:20.300> lava<00:06:20.540> would<00:06:20.690> flow<00:06:20.870> on<00:06:21.050> to<00:06:21.200> it<00:06:21.320> and<00:06:21.440> destroy

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
the lava would flow on to it and destroy

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.020 
the lava would flow on to it and destroy
it<00:06:21.890> but<00:06:22.270> if<00:06:23.270> you<00:06:23.360> want<00:06:23.510> to<00:06:23.570> put<00:06:23.690> a<00:06:23.720> lever<00:06:24.560> or<00:06:25.030> any

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
it but if you want to put a lever or any

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.700 
it but if you want to put a lever or any
other<00:06:26.240> kind<00:06:26.540> of<00:06:26.660> secret<00:06:27.140> things<00:06:27.320> you<00:06:27.590> would
