the<00:00:06.330> academic<00:00:06.960> approach<00:00:07.290> at<00:00:07.470> st.<00:00:07.710> James<00:00:08.010> is

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
the academic approach at st. James is

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.650 
the academic approach at st. James is
that<00:00:08.220> we<00:00:08.460> realize<00:00:08.700> where<00:00:09.179> college

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
that we realize where college

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.039 
that we realize where college
preparatory<00:00:10.080> school<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.670> really<00:00:12.509> grab

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
preparatory school and so we really grab

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.320 
preparatory school and so we really grab
hold<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> idea<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:14.190> preparation<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
hold of the idea of preparation and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.260

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
everybody just kind of has this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250 
everybody just kind of has this
different<00:00:45.059> attitude<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.780> guess<00:00:45.840> towards

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
different attitude I guess towards

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.139 
different attitude I guess towards
school<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.550> place<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
school it's not like a place you have to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.420 
school it's not like a place you have to
go<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.469> more<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.129> place

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
go you have to be it's more like a place

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490 
go you have to be it's more like a place
you<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.629> think<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.170> thing<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
you want to go I think one thing that

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.819 
you want to go I think one thing that
sets<00:00:52.770> st.<00:00:53.070> James<00:00:53.309> apart<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.059> its<00:00:54.600> size<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.410> we

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
sets st. James apart is its size that we

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.040 
sets st. James apart is its size that we
really<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.550> focus<00:00:56.820> individually<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.719> kids

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
really can focus individually on kids

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.290 
really can focus individually on kids

there's a student to teacher ratio is

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
there's a student to teacher ratio is
like<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.750> small<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.250> like

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
like really small so it's more of a like

I'm gonna do it now so I don't have to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
I'm gonna do it now so I don't have to
worry<00:01:30.210> about<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.509> later<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.960> I'm<00:01:31.350> gonna<00:01:31.470> study

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
worry about it later and I'm gonna study

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.230 
worry about it later and I'm gonna study
for<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.009> test<00:01:32.220> harder<00:01:32.610> because<00:01:32.759> last<00:01:33.090> time

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
for this test harder because last time

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.819 
for this test harder because last time
it<00:01:33.390> didn't<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:33.840> well<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
it didn't go so well I think it's a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.740 
it didn't go so well I think it's a
challenging<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> academic<00:01:36.119> environment<00:01:36.270> but

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
challenging the academic environment but

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.109 
challenging the academic environment but
it's<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.960> very<00:01:37.170> doable<00:01:37.650> academic<00:01:38.640> environment

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it's a very doable academic environment

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.420 
it's a very doable academic environment

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.860 
school should always be fun in physics
last<00:03:18.920> week<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.310> had<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.459> lab<00:03:19.700> where<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.180> rolled<00:03:20.750> on

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
last week I had a lab where I rolled on

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.810 
last week I had a lab where I rolled on
a<00:03:20.959> skateboard<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:21.859> learned<00:03:22.160> how<00:03:22.370> physics

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
a skateboard and I learned how physics

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.330 
a skateboard and I learned how physics
work<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.239> frankly<00:03:23.989> if<00:03:24.170> my<00:03:24.650> students<00:03:25.040> can<00:03:25.160> take

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
work and frankly if my students can take

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.770 
work and frankly if my students can take
that<00:03:25.459> out<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.820> classroom<00:03:26.269> that<00:03:26.299> going<00:03:26.660> out

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
that out of the classroom that going out

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.210 
that out of the classroom that going out
into<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.959> world<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.350> finding<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.799> learning

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
into the world and finding that learning

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.390 
into the world and finding that learning
is<00:03:28.340> fun<00:03:29.230> that's<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.410> best<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.769> can<00:03:30.829> ask<00:03:31.100> for

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
is fun that's the best I can ask for

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.520 
is fun that's the best I can ask for
them

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530
