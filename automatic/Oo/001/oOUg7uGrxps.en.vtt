00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.790
 and we go back and now we go with our 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.109
 fellow fernando would be heron that we 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.819
 talks about the threat that looms 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.440
 over the valley of cuatrociénegas in the 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.440
 chihuahua desert 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.300
 the valley of cuatrociénegas is famous in 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.800
 everyone for its geology hydrology 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.360
 and biodiversity 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.669
 unfortunately the valley has been 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.740
 environmentally besieged by a 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.689
 overexploitation of the water you have put 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.689
 endangered this fabulous site 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.460
 cuatrociénegas is a great valley inside 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.520
 of the immense famous Chihuahuan desert 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.649
 for the series of scattered marshes 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.660
 all over the valley these things are 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.910
 assorted water from the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.540
 subsoil things are a natural treasure 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.309
 with fish and reptile species 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.690
 exclusive of these rare marshes in 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.940
 middle of the desert 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.790
 also the oldest living beings of the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.769
 planet still live here forming the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.809
 calcareous structures called 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.330
 stromatolites things are very 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.640
 fragile because in some places its 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.979
 Depth is less than 30 centimeters 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.259
 of depth unfortunately from 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.330
 decades ago an immense 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.179
 extraction of water from cuatrociénegas 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.340
 to take it out of the valley to use 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.770
 agricultural mainly water 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.830
 underground is extracted by powerful 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.530
 bombs and driven kilometers out of the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.539
 valley by several channels another form of 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.330
 extract the water is through the 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.000
 abundant ferris wheels or kites for the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.159
 irrigation of nearby lands the valley 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.140
 of cuatrociénegas and their wives 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.869
 fed by water from the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.659
 subsoil however when sucking the 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.090
 water in large quantities and take it out 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.880
 through channels has caused that little 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.420
 little by little the water levels drop which 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 has already dried some things and to continue 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.219
 overexploitation would condemn the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.049
 the very existence of all sciences 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.130
 with which it would be a catastrophe 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.099
 environmental 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.829
 cuatrociénegas is an oasis of life but 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.939
 It is also a threatened oasis 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.429
 Cuatro Ciénegas is a wetland in the 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.890
 desert that depends on a cycle of 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.040
 local water where you need the wetland 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.379
 it is humid and the water stays in 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.170
 its floors the water is going to a 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.049
 astronomical speed through wells 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.569
 deep and above all through 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.090
 channels that extract water directly 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.609
 from its springs this has to stop 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.530
 the reason for the excess extraction of 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:37.069
 water is due to a productive system 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.260
 agricultural that is not sustainable at all 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.750
 much of the water is destined to 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.570
 produce large quantities of alfalfa 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.040
 for cattle 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.750
 unfortunately the alfalfa is a 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.630
 plant that requires a lot of water for its 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.880
 grow and produce a highly crop 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.550
 plaintiff of water in the middle of the desert 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.310
 is precisely where the 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.890
 inconsistency plus a lot of water is 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.920
 easily lost by evaporation in 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.200
 this place so dry is just the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.120
 overexploitation of water the main 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.370
 environmental problem of the extraordinary 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.590
 valley of cuatrocienegas problem that 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.960
 it could be disappearing one of the 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.150
 laboratories and natural crops more 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.520
 extraordinary things of the world is important 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.770
 point out that the conservation of 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.300
 nature is not at odds with the 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.520
 human development 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.340
 four-quarters for example is an area 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.860
 producer of wine and the vines are a 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.260
 crop perfectly adapted to a 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.480
 arid zone and low water claimant 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.730
 Four Canegas also had important 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.550
 walnut crops in areas where there were 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.280
 more humidity today many walnuts are 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.140
 killed by lowering water levels by 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.430
 the undeniable overexploitation of 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.069
 resource the problem still has a solution 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.319
 It is urgent and necessary to allow the 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.450
 four-quarters water flow in a way 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.329
 natural to fulfill its functions 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.090
 to keep the valuable ones alive 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.370
 ecosystems of the valley turn the 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.180
 healthy ecosystems will provide water 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.180
 indefinitely to the human being 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.430
 today is a golden opportunity to be able 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.799
 show that Mexicans know what 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.320
 that we have and that we know how to take advantage of and 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.070
 conserve our natural areas there 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.070
 I leave them homework
