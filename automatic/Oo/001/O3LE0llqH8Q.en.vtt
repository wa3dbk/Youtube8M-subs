through<00:01:49.170> Z<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.270> that's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.540> tower<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.930> there

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
through Z so that's a tower right there

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.480 
through Z so that's a tower right there
so<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.409> had<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> move<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> place<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.369> could

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
so I had to move out to a place we could

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.230 
so I had to move out to a place we could
see<00:01:53.670> me<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> whatever<00:01:56.580> I'm<00:01:56.729> feeling<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.180> now

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
see me so whatever I'm feeling right now

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.050 
see me so whatever I'm feeling right now
is<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.659> propeller<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.320> wind<00:01:59.060> there's

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
is the propeller is wind there's

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.280 
is the propeller is wind there's
probably<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.479> little<00:02:00.570> bit<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:00.960> wind<00:02:01.110> but

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
probably a little bit of the wind but

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.090 
probably a little bit of the wind but
it's<00:02:01.380> mostly<00:02:01.619> propeller

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it's mostly propeller

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.109 
it's mostly propeller
I<00:02:02.659> think<00:02:03.659> generates<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.170> lot<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:05.970> what

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
I think generates a lot of you know what

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.910 
I think generates a lot of you know what
it's<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.360> idling<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.350> throws<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it's just idling like that it throws a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.109 
it's just idling like that it throws a
lot<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.189> air<00:02:08.250> behind<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> airplane<00:02:08.759> that's

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
lot of air behind the airplane that's

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.279 
lot of air behind the airplane that's
what<00:02:09.239> makes<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.479> flyer<00:02:09.720> right<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:10.019> maze<00:02:10.259> just

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
what makes a flyer right a maze just

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.350 
what makes a flyer right a maze just
pushing<00:02:10.769> air<00:02:10.920> over<00:02:11.159> all<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> air<00:02:11.549> falls<00:02:14.569> okay

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
pushing air over all the air falls okay

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.610 
pushing air over all the air falls okay
so<00:02:18.360> we're<00:02:18.510> gonna<00:02:18.599> go<00:02:18.810> there's<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.200> runway<00:02:19.470> right

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
so we're gonna go there's a runway right

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.080 
so we're gonna go there's a runway right
there<00:02:19.829> we're<00:02:20.010> gonna<00:02:20.099> take<00:02:20.340> off<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.819> south

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and we're gonna stop over here right

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.699 
and we're gonna stop over here right
