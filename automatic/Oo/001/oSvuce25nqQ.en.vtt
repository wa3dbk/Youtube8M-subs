trials victory I'm let's talk about how

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.070 
trials victory I'm let's talk about how
difficult<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.090> was<00:01:30.330> because<00:01:30.690> not<00:01:30.720> too<00:01:31.050> many

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
difficult that was because not too many

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.080 
difficult that was because not too many
people<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.740> age<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.920> had<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.940> opportunity

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
people your age have had the opportunity

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.150 
people your age have had the opportunity
to<00:01:33.660> make<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:33.930> senior<00:01:34.380> world<00:01:34.560> team<00:01:34.880> well<00:01:35.880> i<00:01:36.210> think

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
to make a senior world team well i think

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.130 
to make a senior world team well i think
you<00:01:38.160> know<00:01:38.190> it's<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.020> put<00:01:40.020> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you know it's kind of just put in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
you know it's kind of just put in
perspective<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:41.130> other<00:01:41.280> events<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.850> mean<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
perspective to other events I mean it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
perspective to other events I mean it
was<00:01:42.149> probably<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.899> difficult<00:01:43.080> as<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
was probably just as difficult as the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.990 
was probably just as difficult as the
first<00:01:43.770> time<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> made<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> junior<00:01:44.610> roll<00:01:44.759> team

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
first time I made the junior roll team

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.480 
first time I made the junior roll team
but<00:01:45.660> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.530> I'm<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.920> little<00:01:47.160> bit

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
but you know now I'm just a little bit

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.790 
but you know now I'm just a little bit
older<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.210> bit<00:01:48.420> stronger<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:49.020> little<00:01:49.590> bit

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
older a little bit stronger a little bit

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.999 
older a little bit stronger a little bit
technically<00:01:50.310> more<00:01:50.460> sound<00:01:50.789> so<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.920> was

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
technically more sound so it was

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.740 
technically more sound so it was
definitely<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.399> tough<00:01:53.610> very<00:01:54.060> tough<00:01:54.210> tournament

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
