00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.340 
three and the fourth finger number four
however<00:00:17.789> when<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> right<00:00:18.900> hand

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
however when we get to the right hand

however when we get to the right hand
there's<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.189> different<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.570> fingers<00:00:21.930> are

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
there's a different this the fingers are

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.230 
there's a different this the fingers are
called<00:00:22.320> differently<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.670> thumb<00:00:24.000> would<00:00:24.180> be

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
called differently the thumb would be

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.040 
called differently the thumb would be
would<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.720> called<00:00:25.109> P<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:26.099> index<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> middle

would be called P the index I the middle

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.240 
would be called P the index I the middle
M<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:29.550> ring<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.689> pinky<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.080> C<00:00:31.590> all

M the ring a and the pinky is C all
right<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.059> case<00:00:33.329> we'll<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
right so in this case we'll see the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
them because when we get to the finger

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.139 
them because when we get to the finger
picking<00:00:49.079> then<00:00:49.739> you'll<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.820> what

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
alright so now you know how to to read

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.709 
alright so now you know how to to read
these<00:00:56.010> finger<00:00:56.370> picking<00:00:56.550> patterns<00:00:57.030> right<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
these finger picking patterns right and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.389 
these finger picking patterns right and
you<00:00:57.809> know<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> read<00:00:58.199> tab<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.309> the

you know to read tab you know with the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.650 
you know to read tab you know with the
fingers<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.760> called<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.210> hand<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
fingers are called the right hand and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.330 
fingers are called the right hand and
all<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.989> good<00:01:01.170> stuff<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.250> get

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
all that good stuff so now we can get

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
all that good stuff so now we can get
stuck<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> pattern<00:01:03.510> number<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.930> let

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
stuck in with a pattern number one let

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.750 
stuck in with a pattern number one let
me<00:01:04.559> play<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.129> once<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:05.670> I'll

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
me play it for you once and then I'll

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.760 
me play it for you once and then I'll
break<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.240> afterwards

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.730 

I<00:01:12.929> cannot<00:01:13.929> don't<00:01:14.200> be<00:01:14.320> fooled<00:01:14.560> by<00:01:14.619> the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
I cannot don't be fooled by the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.700 
I cannot don't be fooled by the
simplicity<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.549> this<00:01:15.700> exercise<00:01:16.119> it's<00:01:16.990> just

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
simplicity of this exercise it's just

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.349 
simplicity of this exercise it's just
there<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.159> get<00:01:18.340> their<00:01:18.520> fingers<00:01:18.850> going<00:01:19.030> on<00:01:19.270> the

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
there to get their fingers going on the

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.480 
there to get their fingers going on the
guitar<00:01:19.689> right<00:01:19.899> so<00:01:20.469> what<00:01:20.679> we're<00:01:20.860> doing<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:21.310> this

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
guitar right so what we're doing is this

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.310 
guitar right so what we're doing is this
is<00:01:21.700> known<00:01:21.909> as<00:01:21.939> an<00:01:22.149> arpeggio<00:01:22.780> right<00:01:23.049> because

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
is known as an arpeggio right because

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.380 
is known as an arpeggio right because
I'm<00:01:23.439> playing<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.979> notes<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.000> chords

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
I'm playing the notes of the chords

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.809 
I'm playing the notes of the chords
separately<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:26.319> our<00:01:26.710> pager<00:01:26.979> basically<00:01:27.609> means

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
separately and our pager basically means

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.700 
separately and our pager basically means
a<00:01:27.969> broken<00:01:28.569> chord<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.110> instead<00:01:29.319> of<00:01:29.380> strumming

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
a broken chord so instead of strumming

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.429 
a broken chord so instead of strumming
the<00:01:29.950> chord<00:01:30.750> I'm<00:01:31.750> just<00:01:32.140> picking<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.530> notes

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.919 

okay<00:01:36.249> and<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.549> gives<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:36.850> really<00:01:37.210> nice<00:01:37.329> flavor

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
okay and it gives a really nice flavor

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.289 
okay and it gives a really nice flavor
to<00:01:38.109> the<00:01:38.289> guitar<00:01:38.590> just<00:01:38.619> sounds<00:01:39.130> great<00:01:39.340> when<00:01:40.179> you

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
to the guitar just sounds great when you

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.849 
to the guitar just sounds great when you
really<00:01:40.539> do<00:01:40.689> finger<00:01:40.960> picking<00:01:41.170> stuff<00:01:41.499> so<00:01:41.679> now

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
really do finger picking stuff so now

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.459 
really do finger picking stuff so now
with<00:01:42.069> this<00:01:42.159> pattern<00:01:42.810> let<00:01:43.810> me<00:01:43.929> show<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.289> what's
