what's<00:00:03.870> happening<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.500> worth<00:00:04.620> my<00:00:04.650> power<00:00:05.009> I

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
what's happening is it worth my power I

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.070 
what's happening is it worth my power I

couple of benchmarks on the new micromax
funbook<00:00:09.360> talk<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:10.500> let's<00:00:10.650> begin<00:00:10.830> with<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
funbook talk so let's begin with the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.240 
funbook talk so let's begin with the
quadrant<00:00:12.509> standard<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.620> before<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.920> begin

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
quadrant standard so before we begin

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.799 
quadrant standard so before we begin
with<00:00:14.429> benchmarks<00:00:15.030> i'm<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> show<00:00:15.780> you

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
with benchmarks i'm going to show you

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.840 
with benchmarks i'm going to show you
what<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.650> system<00:00:16.800> information<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:19.699> you<00:00:20.699> can

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
what the system information is you can

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.599 
what the system information is you can
see<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:22.010> the<00:00:23.010> micromax<00:00:24.050> p350<00:00:25.050> has<00:00:25.949> an<00:00:26.130> arm<00:00:26.369> v7

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
see that the micromax p350 has an arm v7

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279 
see that the micromax p350 has an arm v7

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
specified in terms of memory we have

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.590 
specified in terms of memory we have
three<00:00:35.040> 1392<00:00:35.670> kilobyte<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.230> which<00:00:37.430> only<00:00:38.600> 16

9<00:00:39.840> 88<00:00:40.410> kilobyte<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.280> free<00:00:42.410> if<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.590> jump<00:00:43.829> over

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
9 88 kilobyte is free if we jump over

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.920 
9 88 kilobyte is free if we jump over
here<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.820> GPU<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.390> an<00:00:45.719> arm

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
here we can see the GPU is an arm

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.369 
here we can see the GPU is an arm
mali-400<00:00:46.530> GPU<00:00:47.480> which<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:48.780> again<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
mali-400 GPU which is what again is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.540 
mali-400 GPU which is what again is
specified<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.250> see<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
specified you can see that the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.439 
specified you can see that the
resolution<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> 800<00:00:52.020> x<00:00:52.140> 4<00:00:52.350> 44<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.940> DPI<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
resolution is 800 x 4 44 and the DPI is

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.740 
resolution is 800 x 4 44 and the DPI is
160<00:00:55.140> x<00:00:55.260> 116<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> without<00:00:59.699> further<00:00:59.850> ado<00:01:00.420> let's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
160 x 116 so without further ado let's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:13.330 
160 x 116 so without further ado let's
run<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> full<00:01:01.170> benchmark

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.310 

so<00:01:14.340> let's<00:01:14.520> take<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> look<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.690> final<00:01:15.990> result

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so let's take a look at the final result

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.080 
so let's take a look at the final result
it's<00:01:16.590> goes<00:01:16.800> in<00:01:17.010> or<00:01:17.220> sixteen<00:01:17.640> hundred<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it's goes in or sixteen hundred and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.500 
it's goes in or sixteen hundred and
seven<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.590> benchmark<00:01:20.100> result<00:01:20.760> card<00:01:21.120> and

going to run a graphics performance test

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.980 
going to run a graphics performance test
to<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> guys<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.690> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.900> be<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
to you guys so this is going to be a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.130 
to you guys so this is going to be a
first<00:01:43.290> even<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.040> us<00:01:44.510> you<00:01:45.510> can<00:01:45.660> see<00:01:45.840> viewing

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
first even for us you can see viewing

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
first even for us you can see viewing
angles<00:01:46.440> are<00:01:46.530> quite<00:01:46.710> disappointing<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
angles are quite disappointing on the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.609 
angles are quite disappointing on the
screen<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.300> if<00:01:48.510> i<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.869> clicked<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.260> back<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
screen so if i just clicked it back to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.160 
screen so if i just clicked it back to
you<00:01:49.710> guys<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:51.240> will<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.510> able<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
you guys you will be able to see the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.840 
you guys you will be able to see the
screen<00:01:52.440> so<00:01:52.619> i'm<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> hold<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.460> while

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
screen so i'm going to hold it up while

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:28.460 
screen so i'm going to hold it up while
I<00:01:53.880> light<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.270> benchmark<00:01:54.860> hello

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.560 

so<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.130> can<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.610> device<00:02:29.940> goes<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.450> a

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
so you can see that the device goes in a

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.460 
so you can see that the device goes in a
decent<00:02:30.990> 31.1<00:02:31.700> FPS<00:02:32.750> which<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.900> actually<00:02:34.080> not

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
decent 31.1 FPS which is actually not

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.840 
decent 31.1 FPS which is actually not
bad<00:02:34.710> for<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.820> nena<00:02:36.120> mark<00:02:36.330> benchmark<00:02:37.790> now<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
bad for the nena mark benchmark now the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.450 
bad for the nena mark benchmark now the
last<00:02:39.180> thing<00:02:39.300> I'm<00:02:39.450> going<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.630> do<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.320> run<00:02:41.190> an

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
last thing I'm going to do now is run an

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:49.700 
last thing I'm going to do now is run an
ad<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:41.970> benchmark

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:58.759 

you

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.190 

so<00:02:59.769> you<00:02:59.829> should<00:03:00.040> be<00:03:00.069> able<00:03:00.159> to<00:03:00.400> see<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.639> result

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
