00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 on the beach tricks beach in perth 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.299
 whatever the time of the year 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.429
 wave lovers are always at 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.559
 rendezvous in Australian waters 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.019
 many have already seen 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.330
 squales yet no trauma 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.890
 in surfers the love of sport goes 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.420
 first and foremost I have already seen a few 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.189
 but you have to keep surfing and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.260
 try to take the maximum two waves 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 before the tatra shark is in 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.189
 a corner of my mind but I try to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.630
 do not think about it too much I've seen 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.210
 great white shark not far from the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.690
 TV coast 16 my dad tells me that it's 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.969
 their house 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.390
 if I go out I have to do with wadis 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.430
 a sense despite the five attacks 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.920
 lethal in less than a year between 2011 and 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.420
 2012 on the west coast activities 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.730
 nautical does not seem to diminish 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.410
 unlike the meeting the schools of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.329
 surf always welcomes so many young people 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.969
 wishing to learn discipline 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.010
 garrett lane surf monitor since 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.690
 two years did not really find any 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.369
 drop in attendance from 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.229
 his students in australia there is always 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.700
 had more or less attacks according to the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.740
 years but there are always 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 I think people week with 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.729
 this risk in their heads just as on 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.979
 our island the lifeguards lifeguards 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.330
 frames the bath areas but they are 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.520
 also trained in the event of an alert to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.650
 sharks every state of australia has put in 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.020
 place its anti-defense policy 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.670
 squale each year no but if he is a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.200
 shark in the area we are triggering the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.880
 tear and we take everyone out of 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.560
 water we know that there is a shark that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.570
 trolling around thanks to 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.960
 helicopter or marking on 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.390
 sharks 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.649
 if there is a specimen marked 500 meters away 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.659
 suitcases it detects 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:54.119
 automatically devices 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.430
 challenged by researchers drum line 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.009
 shark nets or surveillance by 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.869
 helicopter so many ways useless 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.420
 according to this scientist from the University of 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.399
 sydney christopher nef traveled to 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.229
 four corners of the world to study the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.360
 behaviors of the sharks and for him 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.720
 no doubt kill specimens only leads 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.720
 to nothing 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.660
 for the time being there is no evidence that 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.550
 demonstrates that killing sharks reduce 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.600
 the attacks all the evidence grows 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.760
 even to believe the opposite 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.410
 you have a shark hunt and six months 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.100
 or a year later there is still a 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.630
 new attack 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.550
 so there is no real proof that 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.550
 kill one by one the sharks will work 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.230
 every year they are millions 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.940
 of euros invested by the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.490
 Australian government to respond 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.720
 to the problematic sharks in 2012 5 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.160
 million euros were allocated to the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.080
 research to study behavior 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.880
 squales 3 million euros 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 extra to mark the sharks 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.080
 and secure the beaches
