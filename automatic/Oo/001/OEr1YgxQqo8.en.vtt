that you know detail but kind of the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.670 
that you know detail but kind of the
same<00:00:52.770> logic<00:00:53.190> i<00:00:53.280> guess<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.719> i<00:00:54.840> wanted<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.199> this

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
same logic i guess and i wanted a this

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.979 
same logic i guess and i wanted a this
is<00:00:55.829> really<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> super<00:00:57.090> beast<00:00:57.360> score<00:00:57.750> i

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
is really like a super beast score i

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.189 
is really like a super beast score i
will<00:00:58.500> take<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> score<00:00:59.100> any<00:00:59.430> day<00:00:59.760> any<00:01:00.199> game

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
will take the score any day any game

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.830 
will take the score any day any game
probably<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.309> especially<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.600> team

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
probably and especially in this team

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.560 
probably and especially in this team
when<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.170> haven't<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.650> figured<00:01:04.920> out

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
when I haven't really figured out

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.050 
when I haven't really figured out
there's<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> lot<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.799> really<00:01:08.159> i<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.700> i

modern warfare 2 and it wasn't as

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.060 
modern warfare 2 and it wasn't as
chaotic<00:01:23.840> but<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.740> i<00:01:27.740> forget<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.920> he<00:01:29.040> said

making him rage as much but there's just
a<00:01:34.710> lot<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.920> things<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.369> he<00:01:35.640> hasn't<00:01:35.759> figured

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
a lot of things that he hasn't figured

a lot of things that he hasn't figured
out<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.900> six<00:01:37.350> months<00:01:37.409> from<00:01:37.740> now<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.280> might<00:01:38.610> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
out so six months from now it might be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409

but uh I picked up this heartbeat sensor
I<00:01:46.590> don't<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> always<00:01:47.310> thought<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I don't know I always thought the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.010 
I don't know I always thought the
heartbeat<00:01:48.030> sensor<00:01:48.240> was<00:01:48.509> kind<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.869> like

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
heartbeat sensor was kind of like

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.499 
heartbeat sensor was kind of like
glitchy<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:49.920> whenever<00:01:50.729> whenever<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
glitchy but whenever whenever I have the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.289 
glitchy but whenever whenever I have the
heartbeat<00:01:51.899> sensor<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.530> always<00:01:52.680> kinda<00:01:53.299> always

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
with that so does like my ended up being

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.910 
with that so does like my ended up being
my<00:04:10.820> favorite<00:04:11.180> gun<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:12.709> I<00:04:14.410> this<00:04:15.410> was<00:04:15.590> also<00:04:15.770> in

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
my favorite gun the I this was also in

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.280 
my favorite gun the I this was also in
another<00:04:16.160> video<00:04:16.370> somebody<00:04:16.850> said<00:04:17.120> there<00:04:17.870> was<00:04:18.020> so

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
another video somebody said there was so

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.979 
another video somebody said there was so
much<00:04:18.440> about<00:04:18.920> the<00:04:19.100> maps<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.270> think<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:20.750> was

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
much about the maps and I think this was

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.930 
much about the maps and I think this was
a<00:04:21.020> scene<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.620> his<00:04:21.709> video<00:04:21.919> it<00:04:22.310> might<00:04:22.460> they<00:04:22.669> both

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
a scene in his video it might they both

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.230 
a scene in his video it might they both
might<00:04:23.180> have<00:04:23.300> been<00:04:23.419> this<00:04:23.570> new<00:04:23.720> daters<00:04:23.960> video

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
might have been this new daters video

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.710 
might have been this new daters video
but<00:04:26.240> he<00:04:26.450> was<00:04:26.570> talking<00:04:26.930> about<00:04:27.200> how

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
but he was talking about how

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.480 
but he was talking about how
every<00:04:27.960> single<00:04:28.290> map<00:04:28.470> looks<00:04:28.860> like<00:04:29.100> it's<00:04:29.310> just

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
every single map looks like it's just

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.840 
every single map looks like it's just
like<00:04:30.470> rubble<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.220> know<00:04:32.340> there's<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:32.580> much

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
like rubble and you know there's so much

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.080 
like rubble and you know there's so much
stuff<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.480> every<00:04:33.870> map<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.350> agree<00:04:34.680> without

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
stuff on every map and I agree without

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.660 
stuff on every map and I agree without
extremely<00:04:36.090> uh<00:04:37.160> then<00:04:38.160> what<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.490> was<00:04:38.640> just

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670

but back to what I was going with the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.400 
but back to what I was going with the
there's<00:05:21.000> likes<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.570> he<00:05:21.750> saw<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:21.990> in<00:05:22.110> my<00:05:22.140> last

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
there's likes and he saw it in my last

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.960 
there's likes and he saw it in my last
video<00:05:22.680> that<00:05:22.860> barrel<00:05:23.370> that<00:05:23.580> was<00:05:23.700> just<00:05:23.850> like

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
video that barrel that was just like

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.570 
video that barrel that was just like
randomly<00:05:24.390> on<00:05:24.600> fire<00:05:24.870> as<00:05:25.169> like<00:05:25.290> a<00:05:25.350> time<00:05:25.590> bomb<00:05:25.620> so

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
randomly on fire as like a time bomb so

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.850 
randomly on fire as like a time bomb so
I<00:05:26.940> think<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.570> might<00:05:27.930> start<00:05:28.230> shooting<00:05:28.530> like<00:05:28.680> all

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
I think I might start shooting like all

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.340 
I think I might start shooting like all
the<00:05:29.100> barrels<00:05:29.280> around<00:05:29.760> the<00:05:29.880> map<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.360> see<00:05:31.080> if<00:05:31.260> I

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
the barrels around the map and see if I

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.990 
the barrels around the map and see if I
can<00:05:31.500> just<00:05:31.620> get<00:05:31.770> like<00:05:31.919> lucky<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:32.490> they<00:05:32.580> explode

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
can just get like lucky and they explode

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.270 
can just get like lucky and they explode
with<00:05:33.240> somebody<00:05:33.570> but<00:05:34.380> anyways<00:05:34.710> this<00:05:34.950> Reaper

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
with somebody but anyways this Reaper

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.960 
with somebody but anyways this Reaper
has<00:05:35.400> I<00:05:35.460> think<00:05:35.580> like<00:05:35.940> five<00:05:36.270> missiles<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.970> you

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
has I think like five missiles and you

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.610 
has I think like five missiles and you
can<00:05:39.120> you<00:05:39.419> can<00:05:39.570> see<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.870> red<00:05:40.110> dot<00:05:40.350> on<00:05:40.380> the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
can you can see the red dot on the

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.510 
can you can see the red dot on the
screen<00:05:40.710> it's<00:05:41.640> a<00:05:41.790> glazier<00:05:42.210> what<00:05:42.630> not<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:43.520> that

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
screen it's a glazier what not and that

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.430 
screen it's a glazier what not and that
is<00:05:44.760> where<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.060> missiles<00:05:45.419> going<00:05:45.870> I<00:05:46.050> thought<00:05:46.380> it

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
is where the missiles going I thought it

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.440 
is where the missiles going I thought it
was<00:05:46.530> kind<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.800> like<00:05:46.890> an<00:05:47.040> ac-130<00:05:47.790> where<00:05:48.150> you

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
was kind of like an ac-130 where you

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.100 
was kind of like an ac-130 where you
just<00:05:49.260> you<00:05:49.590> shot<00:05:49.919> it<00:05:50.160> and<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:51.180> went<00:05:51.540> Tori<00:05:51.780> shot

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
just you shot it and it went Tori shot

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.450 
just you shot it and it went Tori shot
and<00:05:52.320> then<00:05:52.380> you<00:05:52.500> can<00:05:52.650> move<00:05:52.770> it<00:05:52.919> around<00:05:52.979> again

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
and then you can move it around again

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.030 
and then you can move it around again
but<00:05:54.240> you<00:05:54.570> are<00:05:54.810> guiding<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.440> missile<00:05:55.770> it's<00:05:55.890> cut

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
but you are guiding the missile it's cut

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.469 
but you are guiding the missile it's cut
so<00:05:56.190> it's<00:05:56.310> kind<00:05:56.520> of<00:05:56.550> like<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.700> predator<00:05:56.940> missile

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
so it's kind of like a predator missile

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.650 
so it's kind of like a predator missile
but<00:05:57.660> it<00:05:57.870> doesn't<00:05:58.169> follow<00:05:58.410> the<00:05:58.830> missile<00:05:59.190> and

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
but it doesn't follow the missile and

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.880 
but it doesn't follow the missile and
I'm<00:06:00.660> going<00:06:00.900> to<00:06:00.960> start<00:06:01.140> using<00:06:01.320> this<00:06:01.560> this<00:06:01.770> is<00:06:01.860> a

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
I'm going to start using this this is a

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.010 
I'm going to start using this this is a
pretty<00:06:02.130> beast<00:06:02.400> kill<00:06:02.669> streak<00:06:02.940> if<00:06:03.120> you<00:06:03.270> can<00:06:03.510> if

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
you can get some kills with it that's a

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.330 
pretty beast kill streak yeah I'm gonna
try<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.190> out<00:06:09.110> just<00:06:10.110> a<00:06:10.260> mean<00:06:10.680> because<00:06:11.130> i'm

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
try it out just a mean because i'm

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.370 
try it out just a mean because i'm
really<00:06:11.970> looking<00:06:12.060> for<00:06:12.360> that<00:06:12.450> middle<00:06:12.780> tier<00:06:13.020> kill

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
really looking for that middle tier kill

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.740 
really looking for that middle tier kill
streak<00:06:13.680> that<00:06:14.460> i<00:06:14.520> can<00:06:14.820> get<00:06:15.030> kills<00:06:15.300> with<00:06:15.540> and

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
streak that i can get kills with and

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.510 
streak that i can get kills with and
i've<00:06:15.810> tried<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.229> overwatch<00:06:16.680> i<00:06:17.010> can<00:06:17.160> get<00:06:17.310> some

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
i've tried the overwatch i can get some

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.430 
i've tried the overwatch i can get some
kills<00:06:17.700> with<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:18.000> overwatch<00:06:18.390> but<00:06:18.780> it's<00:06:19.290> just

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
kills with the overwatch but it's just

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.760 
kills with the overwatch but it's just
not<00:06:19.530> as<00:06:19.770> good<00:06:19.800> i<00:06:19.979> don't<00:06:20.070> think<00:06:20.430> i<00:06:20.580> think<00:06:20.820> i

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
not as good i don't think i think i

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.350 
not as good i don't think i think i
think<00:06:22.770> the<00:06:22.860> Reapers<00:06:23.220> probably<00:06:23.729> my<00:06:23.880> best<00:06:24.060> bet

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
think the Reapers probably my best bet

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.480 
think the Reapers probably my best bet
if<00:06:24.570> you<00:06:24.690> can<00:06:24.810> get<00:06:24.960> really<00:06:25.169> good<00:06:25.440> with<00:06:25.650> it<00:06:25.830> and<00:06:26.010> i

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
if you can get really good with it and i

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.950 
if you can get really good with it and i
will<00:06:26.729> see<00:06:26.880> you<00:06:26.970> i<00:06:27.030> don't<00:06:27.060> know<00:06:27.270> it'll<00:06:27.870> be

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
going to look for some people to play

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.030 
going to look for some people to play
the

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
the

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.940 
the
spec<00:06:41.460> ops<00:06:41.610> missions<00:06:42.150> with<00:06:42.360> and<00:06:43.080> I<00:06:43.710> don't<00:06:43.860> know

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
spec ops missions with and I don't know

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.680 
spec ops missions with and I don't know
how<00:06:44.100> many<00:06:44.130> missions<00:06:44.460> there<00:06:44.820> are<00:06:45.060> or<00:06:45.360> how<00:06:45.510> long

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
how many missions there are or how long

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.840 
how many missions there are or how long
that's<00:06:45.960> going<00:06:46.110> to<00:06:46.170> take<00:06:46.260> but<00:06:47.130> I<00:06:47.160> might<00:06:47.430> do<00:06:47.640> it

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
that's going to take but I might do it

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.850 
that's going to take but I might do it
like<00:06:48.030> two<00:06:48.450> ways<00:06:48.750> where<00:06:49.050> I'll<00:06:49.170> play<00:06:49.350> like<00:06:49.590> half

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
like two ways where I'll play like half

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.660 
like two ways where I'll play like half
or<00:06:50.250> just<00:06:51.090> all<00:06:51.680> all<00:06:52.680> them<00:06:52.980> can<00:06:53.160> just<00:06:53.310> go<00:06:53.430> try<00:06:53.640> and

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
or just all all them can just go try and

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.110 
or just all all them can just go try and
go<00:06:53.790> through<00:06:53.820> all<00:06:54.120> the<00:06:54.270> missions<00:06:56.000> you<00:06:57.000> know

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
go through all the missions you know

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.780 
go through all the missions you know
with<00:06:57.270> one<00:06:57.450> or<00:06:57.570> two<00:06:57.600> people<00:06:57.930> so<00:06:58.410> I<00:06:58.650> was<00:06:59.550> trying

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
with one or two people so I was trying

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.850 
with one or two people so I was trying
to<00:06:59.820> figure<00:07:00.300> out<00:07:00.360> like<00:07:00.630> the<00:07:00.750> fairest<00:07:01.290> the<00:07:01.680> most

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
to figure out like the fairest the most

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.580 
to figure out like the fairest the most
fair<00:07:02.070> way<00:07:02.280> to<00:07:02.310> do<00:07:02.550> that<00:07:02.760> and<00:07:03.270> I<00:07:04.170> thought<00:07:04.410> about

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
fair way to do that and I thought about

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.220 
fair way to do that and I thought about
