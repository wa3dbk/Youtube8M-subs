00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
because it's got two edges so we'll have

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.110 
because it's got two edges so we'll have

clock<00:01:13.710> which<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.189> very<00:01:14.520> similar<00:01:14.790> suppose<00:01:15.240> kind

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
clock which is very similar suppose kind

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330 
clock which is very similar suppose kind
of<00:01:15.900> set<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.140> down<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> clock<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.100> stays

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
of set it down and the clock just stays

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
of set it down and the clock just stays
on<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.180> you're<00:01:18.299> always<00:01:18.390> another<00:01:18.630> time

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
actually change the edge screen position

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.800 
actually change the edge screen position
so<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.880> check<00:01:45.000> from<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.240> left<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.659> the

so you can check from a left or the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.340 
so you can check from a left or the
right<00:01:45.840> side<00:01:46.229> shows<00:01:47.100> pretty<00:01:47.790> cool<00:01:48.350> an

right side shows pretty cool an

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.929 
right side shows pretty cool an
information<00:01:49.860> stream<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.250> turn<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.700> or

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
information stream you can turn it on or

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.520 
information stream you can turn it on or
off<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.270> believe<00:01:51.299> actually<00:01:51.930> managing<00:01:52.320> fades

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
off I believe actually managing fades

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.319 
off I believe actually managing fades
it's<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.280> first<00:01:53.520> time<00:01:53.640> I've<00:01:53.790> gone<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.119> some<00:01:54.240> of

it's the first time I've gone to some of
these<00:01:54.390> sentence<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.409> manage<00:01:55.560> them<00:01:55.740> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
these sentence so you can manage them so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.770 
these sentence so you can manage them so
you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.369> briefing<00:01:56.790> feed<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.689> he

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
you can have like briefing feed and he

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.999 
you can have like briefing feed and he
can<00:01:57.899> actually<00:01:57.990> picked<00:01:58.290> them<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.860> see

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
can actually picked them see to see

got people edge so that's the one where
I<00:02:16.430> showed<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.819> when<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.030> showed<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.239> on<00:02:17.390> a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
I showed you that when I showed it on a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.660 
I showed you that when I showed it on a
previous<00:02:17.780> video<00:02:17.870> at<00:02:18.739> slightly<00:02:18.980> notifications

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
previous video at slightly notifications

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.650 
previous video at slightly notifications
so<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.819> can<00:02:20.000> choose<00:02:20.150> which<00:02:20.300> ones<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.510> want

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
so you can choose which ones you want

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.120 
so you can choose which ones you want
there's<00:02:21.290> only<00:02:21.410> three<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.770> there<00:02:21.890> right<00:02:22.069> now

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
there's only three on there right now

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.979 
there's only three on there right now
but<00:02:22.459> hopefully<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.940> does<00:02:23.120> open<00:02:23.270> up<00:02:23.510> and

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
but hopefully that does open up and

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.780 
but hopefully that does open up and
other<00:02:24.110> companies<00:02:24.650> can<00:02:24.860> take<00:02:24.920> advantage<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.640> it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
other companies can take advantage of it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.199 
other companies can take advantage of it
and<00:02:26.000> that's<00:02:26.720> pretty<00:02:27.110> much<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.610> yeah<00:02:28.610> that's<00:02:29.030> it

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
and that's pretty much it yeah that's it

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.270 
and that's pretty much it yeah that's it
so<00:02:29.989> that's<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.260> settings<00:02:30.830> for<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.130> edge

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
so that's the settings for the edge

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.729 
so that's the settings for the edge
screen<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:32.239> I<00:02:32.360> said<00:02:32.690> instead<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.650> just

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
screen and I said instead of just

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.930 
screen and I said instead of just
putting<00:02:33.950> an<00:02:34.099> edge<00:02:34.190> screen<00:02:34.430> on<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.760> going
