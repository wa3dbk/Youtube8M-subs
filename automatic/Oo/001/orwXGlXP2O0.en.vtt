same what we call neediness neuroses if

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.350 
same what we call neediness neuroses if
you're<00:05:22.250> not<00:05:22.400> hearing<00:05:22.639> the<00:05:22.790> audience<00:05:23.060> laugh

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
you're not hearing the audience laugh

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
that would be exactly correct because it

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.409 
that would be exactly correct because it
is<00:05:26.990> at<00:05:27.200> heart<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.860> comedy<00:05:28.460> show<00:05:28.580> but<00:05:28.610> it's<00:05:29.240> a

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419
