00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.009
 hello so I wanted to make you a 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.530
 small feedback on a tool 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.870
 who had me who had attracted me by his 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.190
 features that is difficult to 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.320
 to find in France because it does not 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.839
 not part of the French catalog of the 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:23.810
 brand bak at this hybrid tool le baco 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:25.550
 24,49 which is derived from another model 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.039
 that he finds quite easily in 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.339
 France which is the 24 48 which is actually 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.140
 a hybrid between a knife and a chisel 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.230
 wood 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.150
 so here is a relatively long lousy I 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.040
 not going to dwell on on the 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.110
 product description because you 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.930
 will quickly understand that in fact I 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.910
 do not recommend this product it's I 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.070
 I am rarely disappointed by the brand Bako 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.340
 but this time you have to be 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.350
 honest the brand bak sells his 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.990
 produced by saying that we can 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.270
 put the full view that can 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.460
 use it with a hammer that one can 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.660
 so sleeve circle resists very well I 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.640
 hated there is no problem the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.110
 handle resists very well but then I 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.080
 do not know how they designed an island 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.540
 steel nor the quenching of the blade 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.880
 but then I did not use it with 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.940
 a frozen hammer simply used in 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.159
 cutting 11 years of the feeder stick with 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.610
 dry job and then you'll see this 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.120
 what is it worth what happened to me 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.260
 first time and a second time 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.170
 hoping that the focus one 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.460
 doctor in sight here that's I think that there I 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.700
 think it's clear for all 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.970
 world that a quench that leaves one and 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.220
 grind in this state there it's just not 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.680
 possible what then it had happened to me 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.320
 a first time a year ago when I 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.100
 acquired when I acquired a knife 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.780
 had happened to me a first time here 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.340
 and here it's not really visible because 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.409
 I had iron knife on the stone 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.219
 and then on ceramics 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.810
 he's his daughter very well but then there the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.789
 quenching is catastrophic because there 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.209
 it's just by falling on a 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.590
 on a knot of small branches of 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.680
 work when it's really nothing at all 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.890
 so down for a chisel it's 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.010
 still damage 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.209
 and then it's okay to start a good 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.700
 that's a good idea 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.739
 at bach with very good ideas but 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.650
 so very bad realization I the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.170
 do not recommend unless bako and decides 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.030
 to review the quality of the quenching of his 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.060
 steel I wish you a good end of 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.060
 day
