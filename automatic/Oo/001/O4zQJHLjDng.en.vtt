one high rise and to mid rises here and

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.820 
one high rise and to mid rises here and
we<00:00:26.680> can<00:00:26.800> see<00:00:28.110> over<00:00:29.110> this<00:00:29.230> way<00:00:29.440> that<00:00:29.680> it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
we can see over this way that it's

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.030 
we can see over this way that it's
connected<00:00:30.310> by<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.849> parking<00:00:31.270> deck<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:31.990> a

relatively<00:00:33.040> new<00:00:33.280> jewel<00:00:33.460> osco<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:35.140> can<00:00:35.260> you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
relatively new jewel osco what can you

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.220 
relatively new jewel osco what can you
tell<00:00:35.470> us<00:00:35.530> about<00:00:35.680> this<00:00:35.950> one<00:00:36.600> well<00:00:37.600> different

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
tell us about this one well different

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.140 
tell us about this one well different
from<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.500> other<00:00:38.650> two<00:00:38.949> this<00:00:39.280> one<00:00:39.550> was<00:00:39.820> really

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
from the other two this one was really

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.550 
from the other two this one was really
designed<00:00:40.330> with<00:00:41.320> very<00:00:41.680> small<00:00:41.800> units<00:00:42.400> in<00:00:42.520> mine

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
designed with very small units in mine

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.420 
designed with very small units in mine
average<00:00:44.430> unit<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.240> think<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.990> under<00:00:46.950> 700

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
average unit I think here is under 700

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.980 
average unit I think here is under 700

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.060 

quite<00:00:52.660> yeah

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.960 

developer<00:00:56.880> one<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.150> a<00:00:57.210> half

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.740 

the<00:01:02.360> kitchens<00:01:02.750> are<00:01:02.900> all<00:01:02.960> very<00:01:03.320> high<00:01:03.530> design

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.539 

but<00:01:09.750> fairly<00:01:10.020> high<00:01:10.259> end<00:01:10.439> finishes<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.009> well<00:01:11.220> who

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
but fairly high end finishes as well who

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.660 
but fairly high end finishes as well who
think<00:01:11.970> from<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:13.159> stance

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
think from a stance

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.620 
think from a stance
obviously<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:16.540> had<00:01:16.780> going<00:01:17.439> into<00:01:17.799> this<00:01:17.920> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
obviously we had going into this this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.380 
obviously we had going into this this
idea<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.990> three<00:01:20.229> buildings<00:01:21.090> coming<00:01:22.090> here

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
idea of the three buildings coming here

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.590 
idea of the three buildings coming here
with<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.570> too<00:01:22.750> low<00:01:22.930> rise

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
with the too low rise

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.260 
with the too low rise
original<00:01:25.470> purpose<00:01:26.310> being<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.000> there<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
original purpose being that there was a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.960 
original purpose being that there was a
way<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.750> fill<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.560> start<00:01:29.430> at

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
way to kind of fill this out start at

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.820 
way to kind of fill this out start at
one<00:01:30.210> end<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.600> kind<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.960> keep<00:01:31.110> moving<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
one end and kind of keep moving so that

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.850 
one end and kind of keep moving so that
you<00:01:32.430> could<00:01:32.640> build<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.119> an<00:01:33.210> occupy<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:34.440> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you could build it an occupy it as you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.380 
you could build it an occupy it as you
move<00:01:36.619> this<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:37.860> also<00:01:38.340> kind<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.909> combination

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
move this was also kind of a combination

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.380 
move this was also kind of a combination
of<00:01:39.450> structural<00:01:39.960> systems<00:01:40.350> because<00:01:40.649> they

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
of structural systems because they

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.469 
of structural systems because they
large<00:01:42.020> basement<00:01:42.440> underneath<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.479> that

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
large basement underneath this that

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.300 
large basement underneath this that
connects<00:01:44.780> all<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.020> buildings<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.650> then<00:01:46.220> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
connects all the buildings and then the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.980 
connects all the buildings and then the
two<00:01:46.460> smaller<00:01:46.729> buildings<00:01:47.180> are<00:01:47.330> all<00:01:47.450> precast

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
two smaller buildings are all precast

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.300 
two smaller buildings are all precast
concrete<00:01:48.229> than

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
concrete than

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.390 
concrete than
is<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.460> cast<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.149> place

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
is a cast in place

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.360 
is a cast in place
ok

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
ok

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.020 
ok
if<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:54.730> look<00:01:54.970> at<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.510> plan<00:01:56.050> of<00:01:56.290> these<00:01:57.030> again

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
if you look at the plan of these again

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.120 
if you look at the plan of these again
this<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.390> building<00:01:58.800> all<00:01:59.800> of<00:02:00.010> these

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
this is a building all of these

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.320 
this is a building all of these
buildings<00:02:00.460> are<00:02:00.520> going<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.730> buildings<00:02:01.120> built

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
buildings are going to buildings built

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.850 
buildings are going to buildings built
around<00:02:01.510> corner<00:02:01.900> units<00:02:02.260> similar<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.800> other

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
around corner units similar to the other

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.180 
around corner units similar to the other
two

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
two

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.280 
two
the<00:02:04.520> floor<00:02:04.760> plans<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.240> these<00:02:05.390> pinwheel<00:02:05.870> you

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
the floor plans of these pinwheel you

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.280 
the floor plans of these pinwheel you
can<00:02:06.410> see<00:02:06.590> how<00:02:06.740> each<00:02:07.130> balcony<00:02:07.790> kind<00:02:08.570> of<00:02:08.720> steps

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
can see how each balcony kind of steps

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.250 
can see how each balcony kind of steps
out<00:02:09.670> next<00:02:10.670> balcony<00:02:11.150> steps<00:02:11.750> out<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.050> other<00:02:12.140> way

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
out next balcony steps out the other way

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.650 
out next balcony steps out the other way
as<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.250> spin<00:02:13.490> around<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.760> building<00:02:14.120> death
