00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 then all had to take a seat in a metro that was made available 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.760
 for him as a guest driver during the hosting meter of which we start here 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.760
 polite 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.140
 we see changes there from the sande gang 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.689
 precursor campaign also to be found in the field but still somewhat unfortunate 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.600
 this season where he made it last season 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.770
 taking the lead, almost everything won 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.770
 maybe this season 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.200
 who had not had much bad luck 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.320
 little away 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.780
 was eric option 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.969
 this fits that the wagon that his wife had taken over from women with sausage 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.710
 As a result, the ball got to drive this eric horst that drove excellent and 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.770
 achieved many many victories and there you can see through the whole stuff 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.090
 panorama bend go wherever we picture 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.369
 on the participant the permanent participant 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.369
 spreading 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.719
 Eric Horssius in the Aex shares Porsche Car's role with the House Consort 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.940
 together with his brother Alex was percent 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.500
 mail delivered 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.290
 at the front of the field of the subways 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.430
 wonderful leading and often on collaboration this 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.500
 there is scattering 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.020
 continue inside beautifully to go with van looking campaign that means 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.020
 yet that sees the better but managed to report 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.050
 three colleagues poorer cars in the front 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 and went there 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.799
 then we see a very surprising development because it is a job in it 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.149
 field while someone is leaving the job 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.899
 complete the gravel bin 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.659
 you have coronel 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.959
 who makes a trip in the gravel bin at certain rama bend we see a lady 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.929
 lead the field 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:35.609
 An extremely surprising event that fyra scrape them well 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:36.979
 we already knew how to drive 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.129
 which was very good enough for a composition on the field 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.099
 of this extremely competitive class that we knew mention 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.099
 here in second place 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.129
 but later 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.599
 well ahead of the shooting gallery after the first position 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:03:00.889
 order so right now a direct chest two tremors shed 3 Romeo 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.889
 van de sande emmen 4 alex post 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.269
 there she goes through the street the man who is all guest drivers 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.429
 guidance and they tried how 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.039
 around it's about the circuit 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:17.009
 then the whole field arrives 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:19.809
 everything still very brittle together 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.689
 then let yourself be on timing and in the field 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.419
 now the past year brought some rattling tape from me alone 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.449
 around 17 spectacular blow 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.899
 have a chance to win a roof 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:33.449
 Sprinkle sticks the government in the longitudinal axis upside down 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.630
 a terrible condition 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.139
 that fortunately ended well you watch sales fall in this spectacular crash 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.139
 for a 4 5 if even subways 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.819
 it's not about a cyclist's direction 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.269
 please kick off the guardrail and then cross over through the fauw to get there again 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.269
 end up in the crash barrier 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:07.669
 he certainly already supports third in the metro solutions and touring there 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.769
 suddenly in an excellent position it seemed completely wrong what we with all ex 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.730
 actor does 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.639
 but i tell i don't tell you 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.910
 not all that fast and yes and I got the worst of it being one 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.749
 piece we sat with rogue 3 4 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:22.349
 pay in addition 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.719
 but I believe it came to my attention that I do with that 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.270
 saturday already next i was pushed further and further i think but i'm pushing through 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.129
 happens too 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.099
 he quickly came to the roadside on one meal a day and a night at a good time 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.610
 came then yes I do not know where then the 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.610
 plow not all agree a bit 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.379
 after a bit it may well be the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.979
 on the basis of what remains of the metro there 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.090
 spreaders 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.160
 too bad for him too bad for the other participants who look underneath 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.040
 other stranded marco bakers are standing but the race went on as usual 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.830
 handball club 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.729
 nice metro and here the rest of the field passes by 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.729
 Well, you returned well ten years later, Coronel 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.729
 behind Ronald van de Sande we see four shed here 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.430
 that reported earlier 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.650
 she had chances to grab that head and she did 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.930
 shed phyra 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.419
 in this race at least in the footsteps scoring of her 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.760
 methorst you also did it once so fantastic ending in the master 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.680
 a better race 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.650
 position so currently one 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.969
 jeroen 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.490
 two honestly predicted 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.490
 3 cornell 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.779
 fierce battle therefore fourth and fifth and sixth place and third person 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:06.380
 sending it terribly 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.319
 really serious about that 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.740
 and then did everything to correct that 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.740
 whatever at the last minute 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.919
 It is a wonderful trip every time that if the metro we have here it goes 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:23.660
 female 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.360
 jeroen 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.460
 we will blame many for doing her son 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.909
 but it is and remains a woman special it is one of them 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:36.279
 fantastic achievement that she hears this municipality weesp is going to win 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:40.709
 for incidentally eric predicted and heartcore record add up the fight 

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:41.169
 to be 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.169
 but the order will no longer change
