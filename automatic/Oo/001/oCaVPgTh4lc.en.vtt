what's up what's up this hoser we're

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.509 
what's up what's up this hoser we're
doing<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> little<00:00:07.259> update<00:00:07.740> here<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.280> just<00:00:08.880> got<00:00:09.090> my

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
doing a little update here I just got my

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.690 
doing a little update here I just got my
bubble<00:00:11.519> Magus<00:00:12.000> protein<00:00:12.809> skimmer<00:00:13.490> just<00:00:14.490> see

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
bubble Magus protein skimmer just see

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.120 
bubble Magus protein skimmer just see
5.5<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:17.539> it's<00:00:18.539> my<00:00:18.840> very<00:00:18.900> first<00:00:19.529> protein

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
5.5 and it's my very first protein

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.099 
5.5 and it's my very first protein
skimmer<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.670> was<00:00:20.820> recommended<00:00:21.390> by<00:00:21.420> my<00:00:21.510> fish<00:00:21.869> guy

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
skimmer I was recommended by my fish guy

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.269 
skimmer I was recommended by my fish guy
and<00:00:24.800> it's<00:00:25.800> from<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.099> 55<00:00:26.519> gallon<00:00:26.910> back<00:00:27.090> there

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
and it's from my 55 gallon back there

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.900 
and it's from my 55 gallon back there
eventually<00:00:29.279> he's<00:00:29.670> gonna<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:29.970> some<00:00:30.410> coral

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
eventually he's gonna have some coral

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.100 
eventually he's gonna have some coral
eventually<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.420> might<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.660> well<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:33.960> get

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
eventually you might as well just get

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.510 
eventually you might as well just get
started<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.620> my<00:00:34.770> protein<00:00:35.190> skimmer<00:00:35.430> right

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
started with my protein skimmer right

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.100 
started with my protein skimmer right
now

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
now

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.580 
now
and<00:00:38.510> yeah<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.020> wanna<00:00:40.230> give<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.530> little

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and yeah so just wanna give you a little

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.150 
and yeah so just wanna give you a little
update<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.790> protein<00:00:42.149> skimmer<00:00:42.480> I've<00:00:42.750> been

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
update of this protein skimmer I've been

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.290 
update of this protein skimmer I've been
doing<00:00:44.160> some<00:00:44.510> online<00:00:46.309> check<00:00:47.309> ups<00:00:47.520> about<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
doing some online check ups about it and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.020 
doing some online check ups about it and
now<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:49.079> good<00:00:49.260> things<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:52.940> went<00:00:53.940> ahead

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
now you're good things so I went ahead

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.020 
now you're good things so I went ahead
and<00:00:54.510> got<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.870> bigger<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.910> instead<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and got the bigger one instead of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.220 
and got the bigger one instead of
getting<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:57.780> supposed<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.109> be

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
getting the one that was supposed to be

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
getting the one that was supposed to be
for<00:00:58.469> my<00:00:58.620> tank<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.070> there's<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> 60<00:00:59.699> gallon<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
for my tank if there's a 60 gallon and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.689 
for my tank if there's a 60 gallon and
this<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:00.600> goes<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.430> do<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> other

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
this one I think goes up to do the other

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.729 
this one I think goes up to do the other
one<00:01:02.820> goes<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> 75<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.350> goes<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> like

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
one goes to 75 and this one goes to like

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.750 
one goes to 75 and this one goes to like
a<00:01:04.769> hundred<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.280> something<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> don't<00:01:05.610> know

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
a hundred or something I don't know

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.910 
a hundred or something I don't know
something<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.750> one's<00:01:06.960> more

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
something like that but this one's more

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.760 
something like that but this one's more
than<00:01:08.070> enough<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.640> 55<00:01:09.060> gallon<00:01:09.590> let's<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
than enough for my 55 gallon let's get a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.550 
than enough for my 55 gallon let's get a
pump<00:01:11.150> that<00:01:12.150> comes<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:13.130> it's<00:01:14.130> uh<00:01:15.560> mobile

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
pump that comes with it it's uh mobile

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.469 
pump that comes with it it's uh mobile
Maggie's<00:01:16.920> pump<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.280> guess<00:01:17.460> SP<00:01:18.000> mm<00:01:19.820> it's<00:01:20.820> very<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
Maggie's pump I guess SP mm it's very is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.960 
Maggie's pump I guess SP mm it's very is
very<00:01:21.509> easy<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.110> install<00:01:22.520> very<00:01:23.520> easy<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.790> put

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
very easy to install very easy to put

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.740 
very easy to install very easy to put
together<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.340 

the<00:01:27.750> cup<00:01:28.070> at<00:01:29.070> least<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> rookie<00:01:29.760> like<00:01:29.910> me

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the cup at least for a rookie like me

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:39.760 
the cup at least for a rookie like me
it's<00:01:31.350> pretty<00:01:31.590> cool<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:34.940> legs<00:01:35.940> right<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.000 

lid<00:01:40.770> right<00:01:40.980> here<00:01:42.470> it's<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:43.830> not<00:01:43.950> that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
lid right here it's actually not that

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:52.400 
lid right here it's actually not that
big<00:01:44.400> it's<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:46.190> see<00:01:47.190> my<00:01:47.970> measuring<00:01:48.330> tape<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:51.410> no

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
big it's a see my measuring tape here no

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.249 
big it's a see my measuring tape here no
it's<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.860> little<00:01:53.220> bit<00:01:53.490> over<00:01:55.640> like<00:01:56.990> let's<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it's a little bit over like let's do it

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.430 
it's a little bit over like let's do it
this<00:01:58.380> would<00:01:58.590> give<00:01:58.710> me<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.830> second<00:01:59.220> a<00:02:03.259> little<00:02:04.259> bit

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
this would give me a second a little bit

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.620 
this would give me a second a little bit
about<00:02:05.400> 20<00:02:05.790> inches<00:02:08.060> 20<00:02:09.060> 20<00:02:09.630> half<00:02:09.780> inches<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
about 20 inches 20 20 half inches and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.350 
about 20 inches 20 20 half inches and
it's<00:02:12.630> not<00:02:12.780> really<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.140> wide<00:02:13.500> which<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.360> kind

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
it's not really that wide which is kind

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.070 
it's not really that wide which is kind
of<00:02:15.450> impressed<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.050> about<00:02:17.540> maybe<00:02:18.540> six<00:02:18.930> inches

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
of impressed it's about maybe six inches

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.870 
of impressed it's about maybe six inches
although<00:02:19.739> if<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.070> do<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.430> way<00:02:20.489> with<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
although if you do it this way with the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.880 
although if you do it this way with the
pipe<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:22.530> about<00:02:22.830> eight<00:02:23.130> inches<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:25.680> it's

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
pipe it's about eight inches but it's

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.720 
pipe it's about eight inches but it's
still<00:02:26.070> not<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.430> big<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:28.310> imma<00:02:29.310> try<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.550> out

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
still not that big and imma try it out

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.300 
still not that big and imma try it out
see<00:02:30.420> how<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.600> goes<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:31.230> was<00:02:31.860> looking<00:02:32.070> at<00:02:32.160> some

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
see how it goes I was looking at some

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.310 
see how it goes I was looking at some
YouTube<00:02:32.610> videos<00:02:33.000> about<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.510> because<00:02:34.080> since

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
YouTube videos about it because since

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.540 
YouTube videos about it because since
it's<00:02:34.470> my<00:02:34.620> first<00:02:34.650> one<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.130> want<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.370> make<00:02:35.519> sure

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
it's my first one I want to make sure

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.540 
it's my first one I want to make sure
everything<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.209> cool<00:02:36.450> they're<00:02:36.630> instructions

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
everything is cool they're instructions

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.900 
everything is cool they're instructions
they're<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:38.730> all<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.650> detailed<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.790> is

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
they're not all that detailed this is

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.259 
they're not all that detailed this is
all<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.320> give<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.760> basically<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.880> schematic

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
all they give you basically a schematic

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.620 
all they give you basically a schematic
of<00:02:45.570> how<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:45.900> supposed<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:47.090> but<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.120> just

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
of how it's supposed to be but I just

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.060 
of how it's supposed to be but I just
curious<00:02:48.959> about<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.320> hose<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.769> where<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
curious about the hose is where the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.020 
curious about the hose is where the
hoses<00:02:50.430> went<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.940> wasn't<00:02:51.630> too<00:02:51.720> sure<00:02:52.730> as<00:02:53.730> far<00:02:53.880> as

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
hoses went I wasn't too sure as far as

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.600 
hoses went I wasn't too sure as far as
the<00:02:54.150> pump<00:02:54.680> was<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.830> stuff<00:02:56.070> they<00:02:56.190> give<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.430> for

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the pump was the stuff they give you for

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.539 
the pump was the stuff they give you for
the<00:02:56.730> pump<00:02:59.090> it's<00:03:00.090> got<00:03:00.299> all<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.570> readings<00:03:00.930> there

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
the pump it's got all the readings there

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:08.390 
the pump it's got all the readings there
SP<00:03:02.549> mm<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:06.000> all<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.870> good<00:03:07.140> stuff<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:08.010> it

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
SP mm and all that good stuff because it

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.789 
SP mm and all that good stuff because it
gets<00:03:08.790> us<00:03:08.880> different<00:03:09.239> types<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.570> pumps<00:03:09.799> mine's

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
gets us different types of pumps mine's

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.630 
gets us different types of pumps mine's
SP<00:03:11.280> mm

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640
