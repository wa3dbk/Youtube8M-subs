expecting<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.790> second<00:03:39.090> game<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.689> will<00:03:39.870> be<00:03:40.019> the

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
expecting the second game it will be the

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.499 
expecting the second game it will be the
same<00:03:40.319> as<00:03:40.379> fault<00:03:40.680> us<00:03:41.129> take<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.459> so<00:03:42.150> yeah<00:03:42.359> we

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
but we were a lot more focused so we

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.040 
but we were a lot more focused so we
felt<00:04:43.670> like<00:04:43.790> we<00:04:43.970> were<00:04:44.090> ahead<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.630> entire<00:04:44.870> game

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
felt like we were ahead the entire game

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.190 
felt like we were ahead the entire game
by<00:04:45.320> quite<00:04:46.040> a<00:04:46.070> lot<00:04:46.360> accepted<00:04:47.360> in<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.510> start<00:04:47.750> so

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
by quite a lot accepted in the start so

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.410 
by quite a lot accepted in the start so
I<00:04:48.560> was<00:04:49.250> actually<00:04:49.490> quite<00:04:49.700> surprised<00:04:50.150> when<00:04:50.240> i

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
I was actually quite surprised when i

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.970 
I was actually quite surprised when i
watch<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.570> game<00:04:50.750> later<00:04:51.050> Hanley<00:04:51.410> was<00:04:51.650> we<00:04:51.860> were

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
watch the game later Hanley was we were

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.160 
watch the game later Hanley was we were
pretty<00:04:52.190> equal<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:52.760> game<00:04:52.910> cold<00:04:53.660> wise<00:04:53.870> I

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
pretty equal in the game cold wise I

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.710 
pretty equal in the game cold wise I
think<00:04:54.950> it<00:04:55.490> was<00:04:55.610> kind<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:55.940> like<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.330> see<00:04:56.540> what

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
think it was kind of like you see what

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.710 
think it was kind of like you see what
it<00:04:57.020> wasn't<00:04:57.230> easy<00:04:57.560> but<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.580> like<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.180> didn't

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
it wasn't easy but it like I didn't

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.090 
it wasn't easy but it like I didn't
really<00:04:59.840> feel<00:05:00.050> like<00:05:00.110> we<00:05:00.350> could<00:05:00.500> lose<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.830> at<00:05:00.950> any

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
really feel like we could lose it at any

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.310 
really feel like we could lose it at any
point<00:05:01.340> yeah<00:05:02.240> maybe<00:05:02.420> if<00:05:02.540> they<00:05:02.690> still<00:05:02.900> apparent
