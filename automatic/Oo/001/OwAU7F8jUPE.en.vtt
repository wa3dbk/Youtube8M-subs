00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.140 
hard to see chest blends in with the
wood<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.130> there's<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> yellow<00:01:41.520> will<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.820> inside

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
wood but there's a yellow will be inside

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.330 
wood but there's a yellow will be inside
so<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.259> want<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> stack<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.009> rupees

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
so if you want to stack up on rupees

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.840 
so if you want to stack up on rupees
then<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:44.790> ahead<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:44.939> grab<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:46.850> and

then you can go ahead and grab that and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.789 
then you can go ahead and grab that and
then<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.930> use<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> monkey's<00:01:49.380> ass<00:01:49.500> all<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> way

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
then just use a monkey's ass all the way

00:01:49.799 --> 00:02:02.050 
then just use a monkey's ass all the way
back<00:01:49.860> out

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.580 

okay<00:02:03.060> now<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.210> we're<00:02:03.420> done<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.470> go

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
okay now that we're done here you can go

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.429 
okay now that we're done here you can go
over<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.490> you'll<00:02:06.150> know<00:02:06.299> there's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.080> big

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
over here and you'll know there's a big

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.290 
over here and you'll know there's a big
chest<00:02:07.770> behind<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.250> well<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.149> look

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
chest behind there well if you look

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.940 
chest behind there well if you look
closer<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.959> Z<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.380> floor<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
closer this is Z on the floor and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.970 
closer this is Z on the floor and
basically<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.000> target<00:02:12.390> these

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
basically you have to target these

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.040 
basically you have to target these
little<00:02:13.980> propellers<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.480> shape<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> Z

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
little propellers in the shape of the Z

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.960 
little propellers in the shape of the Z
that<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.349> see<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.650> floor<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.819> will

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
that you see on the floor and that will

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.300 
that you see on the floor and that will
cause<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.450> door<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.989> open<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.470> remember<00:02:20.130> when<00:02:20.220> I

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
cause the door to open I remember when I

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
first played I tried so many times to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.990 
first played I tried so many times to
open<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.650> up<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.010> just<00:02:23.190> didn't<00:02:23.520> see<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> Z

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
