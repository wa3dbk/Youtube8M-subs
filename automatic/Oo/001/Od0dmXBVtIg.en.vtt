this<00:05:32.050> commentary<00:05:32.560> right<00:05:32.920> here<00:05:33.310> I<00:05:33.520> was<00:05:33.880> just

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
this commentary right here I was just

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.850 
this commentary right here I was just
trying<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.390> get<00:05:34.600> my<00:05:34.630> teammates<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.590> call<00:05:35.740> in

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
trying to get my teammates to call in

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.800 
trying to get my teammates to call in
all<00:05:36.040> their<00:05:36.190> moves<00:05:36.490> so<00:05:36.640> we<00:05:36.760> could<00:05:36.940> make<00:05:37.570> the

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
all their moves so we could make the

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.750 
all their moves so we could make the
spawns<00:05:38.110> go<00:05:38.350> crazy<00:05:38.770> because<00:05:39.040> when<00:05:39.310> you<00:05:39.460> start

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
spawns go crazy because when you start

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.610 
spawns go crazy because when you start
calling<00:05:39.910> in<00:05:40.150> moab<00:05:40.450> spawns<00:05:40.930> they<00:05:41.170> kind<00:05:41.440> of<00:05:41.500> get

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
calling in moab spawns they kind of get

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.830 
calling in moab spawns they kind of get
confused<00:05:42.160> and<00:05:42.370> they<00:05:42.880> start<00:05:43.120> spotting<00:05:43.510> people

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
confused and they start spotting people

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.390 
confused and they start spotting people
all<00:05:44.140> around<00:05:44.290> you<00:05:44.620> which<00:05:44.800> is<00:05:44.830> kind<00:05:45.190> of<00:05:45.220> weird
