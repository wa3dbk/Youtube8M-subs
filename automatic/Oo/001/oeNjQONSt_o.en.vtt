00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The DNA as you can see

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
back to the roots of Dynafit in the world of competition

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a very light ski with mixed contruction

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
wood and carbon

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
DNA - competiton is in the genes of Dynafit

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so we introduced this ski and a shoe of the same name

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the dee-nah, DNA

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so back to the roots which we never abandonned

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but where we were always improving our products

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
its very light but very stiff

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the carbon stiffens the package

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I can see there are no edges on the shovel

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
we are always looking to improve performance

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
so we've reduced the weight of the edges

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
by only putting them where they are needed

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the edge of a ski is 25% of the weight

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the DNA is for skiers who are looking for a lightweight, straight ski

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and who know how to ski that type of product

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
they are not necessarily interested in freeride skis

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
they are interested in climbing performance and not

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:04.000
so concerned about a ski that is dynamic for the descent

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
there is only 1 size, 160cm

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
very short

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but if you watch videos of the Perra Menta, PDG

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the competitors ski quickly but they are not freeride skis

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.533
1517 grammes for a pair
