00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello people welcome to our tv and 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.770
 has in that career 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.920
 What are today 's tips for continuity? 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.650
 this project here we did that is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.509
 canister made with kitchen roll 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.279
 this part of the holo in here 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.330
 kitchen we made this whole box 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 stickers for wedding invitation 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.359
 We made this decoration with flowers. 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.320
 sack of bread and some decoration 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.390
 so with lace and legs and today we 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.680
 Let's learn how to be part of dense 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.800
 that's the text size it's all 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.660
 Aged is common sheet A4 paper only 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.730
 we get old with coffee or tea 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.739
 to do the inside that is the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.039
 part of the text itself is not 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.980
 well this thing inside the shin stays a lot 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.010
 original very charming and indifferent 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.049
 for your girls wedding we 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.670
 we have there is our packaging is not the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.619
 box ready for the invitation and now 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.409
 Let's make the invitation itself. 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.000
 is also the whole aged paper 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.090
 so I'll teach you how to do 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.909
 this parchment to put it inside the 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.799
 gift from the box also looks at us 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.470
 we need a leaf as a leaf 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.330
 a4 a little coffee or tea ae 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.420
 diluted in water also 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.329
 and you are going to seal this 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.270
 role for the aging because it is 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.720
 a leaf as a leaf divide the 4 or 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.909
 as hostess a sheet of sulphite at 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.850
 people are going to age her so you go 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:50.820
 win there, yes, lightly with the one with the water 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.909
 and dilute coffee or tea and bpc 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.909
 two-sided brush on one side and then 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.159
 and dry to do it in a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.439
 day there is plenty of hot sun 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.240
 which is easier too but it's music 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.710
 much cheaper than you buy 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.439
 You're welcome to make the invitations. 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.429
 So good marriage also did fez 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.429
 it lets it dry 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.250
 Ready with the sheet already dry you go 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.840
 pick up will print the text you want 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.850
 in here too 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.270
 and then to make that effect anyway 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.070
 of parchment you will rip sheet to 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.100
 rip roughly 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.320
 even with your fingers ok tear it 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.550
 all the polka dots 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.530
 Ah yes and then you will burn in the light candle 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.510
 be careful not to set your invitation on fire 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.840
 after it's done because that's not what 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.180
 We also want you to do it, you will. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.320
 burn here with the favela shops 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.000
 so take care if it happens 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.080
 anything just because mediately 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.870

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.380
