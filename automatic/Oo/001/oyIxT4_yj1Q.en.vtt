00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
going to do a quick benchmark and we're

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.800 
going to do a quick benchmark and we're
going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> see<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> test<00:00:27.269> results<00:00:27.660> are

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
going to see what the test results are

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
going to see what the test results are
all<00:00:28.680> right<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> benchmark<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:29.760> done<00:00:30.060> i

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
all right so the benchmark is now done i

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.460 
all right so the benchmark is now done i
actually<00:00:30.510> skipped<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.840> process<00:00:31.260> because

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
actually skipped that process because

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.260 
actually skipped that process because
it's<00:00:31.650> about<00:00:31.830> five<00:00:32.070> minutes<00:00:32.279> long<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:32.790> after

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it's about five minutes long but after

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.180 
it's about five minutes long but after
the<00:00:33.360> process<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.930> done<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the process is done as you see here the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.250 
the process is done as you see here the
iphone<00:00:35.610> 5<00:00:35.880> actually<00:00:36.540> beats<00:00:36.780> out<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.020> iphone

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
iphone 5 actually beats out the iphone

iphone 5 actually beats out the iphone
5c<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.579> by<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> little<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.329> every<00:00:39.600> single

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
5c just by a little and every single

5c just by a little and every single
category<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.649> set<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.160> memory<00:00:41.520> which<00:00:42.000> is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
category is set for memory which is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.670 
category is set for memory which is
going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> come<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.660> after<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.200> right<00:00:43.469> here

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
going to come up after this right here

going to come up after this right here
at<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> disk<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.750> not

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
at the disk but as you can see it's not

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.470 
at the disk but as you can see it's not
by<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> lot<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.100> iphone<00:00:47.399> 5<00:00:47.610> does<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.239> out

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
by a lot but the iphone 5 does be out

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.869 
by a lot but the iphone 5 does be out
the<00:00:48.690> iphone<00:00:49.110> 5c<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> supposed<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> have

the iphone 5c which is supposed to have
almost<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> same<00:00:51.449> exact<00:00:51.899> specs<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
almost the same exact specs but the

iphone 5c is supposed to be a little bit

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
iphone 5c is supposed to be a little bit
better<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:55.860> i'm<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
better so now i'm going to go do a

better so now i'm going to go do a
couple<00:00:57.120> web-based<00:00:57.539> searches<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.440> which

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
couple web-based searches and see which

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
couple web-based searches and see which
one<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.010> comes<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.609> first<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
one actually comes up first and as you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.360 
one actually comes up first and as you
can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> iphone<00:01:01.530> 5<00:01:01.739> does<00:01:02.039> beat<00:01:02.219> up

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
can see here the iphone 5 does beat up

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.579 
can see here the iphone 5 does beat up
the<00:01:02.460> iphone<00:01:02.730> 5c<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.439> couple

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the iphone 5c you can see in a couple

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
the iphone 5c you can see in a couple
other<00:01:04.920> searches<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.580> iphone<00:01:05.939> 5c<00:01:06.390> beats<00:01:06.780> out

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
other searches to iphone 5c beats out

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.289 
other searches to iphone 5c beats out
the<00:01:06.990> iphone<00:01:07.560> 5<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.700> goes<00:01:08.820> back<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the iphone 5 and it goes back and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.120 
the iphone 5 and it goes back and
forward<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.290> test<00:01:10.590> result<00:01:10.979> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
forward so this little test result is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.520 
forward so this little test result is
inconclusive<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:12.510> course<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.290> based

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
inconclusive of course it is just based

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.980 
inconclusive of course it is just based
on<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:13.860> career<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.520> can't<00:01:14.790> test<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.299> unless

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
on your career you can't test it unless

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
on your career you can't test it unless
you're<00:01:16.170> both<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.680> same<00:01:16.710> network<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you're both on the same network in the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
you're both on the same network in the
same<00:01:17.970> exact<00:01:18.299> spot<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.140> can't<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> same

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
same exact spot you can't get the same

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.590 
same exact spot you can't get the same
test<00:01:20.159> results<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.729> course<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.210> might<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
test results of course one might be a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.420 
test results of course one might be a
little<00:01:21.780> faster<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.799> can't<00:01:23.040> really<00:01:23.130> test

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
little faster and you can't really test

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.460 
little faster and you can't really test
it<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.750> now<00:01:24.869> I'm<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.170> through<00:01:25.350> it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
it on that it's now I'm going through it

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.670 
it on that it's now I'm going through it
they<00:01:25.950> both<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> same<00:01:26.600> feel<00:01:27.600> emotion<00:01:28.439> for

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
they both have the same feel emotion for

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.920 
they both have the same feel emotion for
it<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.189> they're<00:01:29.729> both<00:01:29.970> are<00:01:30.270> almost<00:01:30.630> exactly

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it to it they're both are almost exactly

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.590
