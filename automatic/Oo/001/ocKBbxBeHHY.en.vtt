00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.260
 The identity of the alien is known 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.530
 We know three of the established theory that is a powerful three of dogma has been whispered about the invitation of the alien 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.509
 Is not it 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:37.220
 Apparently there is no doubt that UFO is an unidentified flying object from space 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:44.630
 So who is the alien who will be operating? 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:53.510
 I can not stop my interest There are three major theories about the identity of aliens 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:57.260
 (1) Future Earth people are far away from Earth people in the future with creatures with advanced culture and horns on different planets 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.310
 But I moved to another star for some reason 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.390
 The descendants of the former Earthers 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.390
 What do you think 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.860
 I think that any theory is a possible story 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.560
 Let's consider in turn the identity of the alien 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.790
 Creature snow with advanced culture and one tail on a single eye planet 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.940
 This theory is the most commonly considered theory 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:28.250
 In this universe there is about a lot of star countless 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.670
 It can not be said that only the earth was in the environment that produces life 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.370
 Life is born before us 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:41.530
 Form a unique culture in a way that suits the environment of the stars 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:44.450
 It is no wonder if there are stars that have undergone more than our chemical evolution 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 We will put scientific progress at a stretch 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:53.260
 It is 40.3 billion years since the earth was born 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:57.050
 Even though it's only 100 years since the Earthman flew in the sky 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:02.150
 Now is the time when space exploration is taking place 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:08.360
 HanaNaru shop Hayabusa, etc. such as an aqueous unmasking that have been carried out 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:13.310
 It is no wonder that an alien who has made scientific development early is somewhere in this large universe 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:18.140
 I think not, but what do you think 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.250
 Let's think about the people of the future in the future 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.490
 Future Earth People Snow 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:30.830
 Why does UFO not get in touch with this theory ? 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.930
 You will understand why why don't you wear a movie that depicts time travel 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.000
 As 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:41.940
 There is a point that you should not be involved with the people of that time 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.890
 Back to the future Marty interferes with his father and mother 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.280
 It was a crisis that would not be born 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:53.650
 It was avoided because we managed to connect the two people 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:57.330
 There is a risk that the times will change if you get in touch with people at that time 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.510
 So yu fo is not related to humanity 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.770
 Man who traveled time travel time with yu fo 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.420
 Do you know Lily Wire 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:11.930
 He is, of course, a space trip at UFO of Pleiades 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.540
 I travel timely and go to different times 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:20.250
 He says he has also met that Jesus Christ 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.480
 George Adamski and Howard Menger of user F O Con tacticity place of here 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.720
 Such 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.010
 Yu fo Contactee related articles have been written 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.050
 Hmm 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.010
 But even if they travel in space 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.150
 I'm not saying I did time travel 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.060
 More than the gold spirit UFO who they got 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.970
 It will function but those of the Pleiades star of people Yuefuo is good 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.880
 It's because I am a future man 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:52.530
 Have advanced science than it is now our 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:56.910
 Earthlings theory of the future as I personally I believe that leading So long ago last far 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.950
 I was an earthling, but moved to another star for some reason 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:06.000
 The descendants of the former Earthers 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:07.050
 Other star in the 3 long ago earthling was was but any Kano circumstances Let's think about the theory that 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.650
 Moved 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:16.889
 An epistemology of the former Earthly people Earthists who used to reflect this theory on Earth 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:22.680
 Natural disasters, air pollution wars, etc. 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:27.020
 I moved to another star because I could not live on the earth for some reason 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.860
 They are riding on Yuefuo thing to say that has come to look at the Earth 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:38.610
 Indeed, there are plans to emigrate to Mars, even on modern earth 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:40.360
 I'm serious like this, or if the previous earthman had great scientific power, would it be 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.699
 I may not 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:51.590
 Breaches is almost impossible not but be too believe is a request theory and with me 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:54.810
 It is said that there was a more advanced scientific civilization on the Mu and Atlantis continents . 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.580
 I wondered if the people around us were living there 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.150
 Or more 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.020
 Oops. A long time ago humanity 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.460
 Mystery is not complete, but these three fixed ideas 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.030
 Not contradictory 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:12.500
 There are no contradictions of the three realities of aliens 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:16.010
 A powerful theory about the identity of the alien introduced this time 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.820
 And advanced culture in 1 simply different planet 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:25.130
 Future earthling to creatures with three tails 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.330
 3 It was a long time ago Earth man, but moved to another star for some reason 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.610
 The descendants of the former Earthers 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.860
 It does not contradict with all three 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:40.849
 If out one which do not that the other does not hold 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:42.150
 Aliens with highly developed civilization with other stars and future Earthers are coming to see the Earth together 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.330
 It is good 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.910
 There's even come to see an old Earthling 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:56.500
 There is no contradiction even if there are Venus and Pre- Essian 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:57.550
 I think that Pleiades Alien is a lie and say, but rather than one of these common ideas being said one correct answer 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:04.680
 cute 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.680
 I think that every theory is the correct answer What will you think about? 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:56.309
