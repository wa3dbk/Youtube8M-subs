00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.050
 climate change occurs throughout the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.449
 solar system 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.850
 the so-called denialists of the 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.560
 global warming encompassed by this 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.809
 way by the great means of 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.059
 communication insist on defining that the 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.890
 Climate change is a reality but 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.929
 that has nothing to do with the activity 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.269
 human climatic change of origin 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.339
 anthropogenic but with another series of 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.309
 processes that are affecting all 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.319
 solar system a good part of them 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.299
 ensures that climate change is 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.639
 related to solar activity 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.559
 some say that the change is 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.659
 producing a cooling and others 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.609
 they argue that there is actually a process 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.739
 of heating but what does it have to do 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.499
 with solar activity more than with the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.390
 pollution generated by man the 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.620
 most so-called denialists 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.020
 they assure that the idea 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.090
 anthropocentric climate change what 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.010
 seeks to impose among the nations a 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.020
 global tax on emissions of 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.360
 carbon that maintain the powers 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.270
 emerging countries limited in their growth 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.760
 through an economic gag which is 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.200
 be the theory that they pay the certain thing is 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.960
 that there is more and more astronomical data 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.860
 about a climate change throughout the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.590
 solar system 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.560
 Two recent examples are enough 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.510
 Sighted by astronomers 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.390
 On the one hand, scientists have been 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.580
 observing recently massive changes 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.890
 on jupiter the largest planet in 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.530
 our solar system huge belts 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.510
 in the atmosphere of the planet have changed 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.700
 colored radiation areas have been 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.010
 faded only to re-activate 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.140
 intermittently the levels of the 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.480
 clouds have condensed and dissolved and 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.810
 Space rocks have been impacting 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.400
 to the gas giant these changes signals 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.000
 glenn orton jet propulsion 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.070
 laboratory are of global scale changes 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.720
 so on our planet they could end up 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.970
 with life or at least alter 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.950
 radically what we know as 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.750
 such although obviously one of the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.069
 things that sustains life on earth 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.900
 it's a stable atmosphere already in 2009 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.459
 astronomers observed the disappearance of 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.680
 a brown band on the belt 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.099
 south equatorial Jovian which 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.870
 reappeared in 2011 by Tony his team 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.910
 then they discovered that the belt 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.950
 Equatorial North is in Blazquez I 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.190
 more than he had in a century 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.150
 and then it got dark again this year 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.269
 radiation emitted from the atmosphere 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.970
 disappeared from 2010 to 2011 and returned in 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.280
 June of this year were also observed 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.430
 seemingly anomalous behaviors 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.680
 in the clouds among other changes the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.720
 researchers highlighted that the planet 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.940
 has suffered the impact of a series of 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.380
 objects what has created fireballs 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.170
 visible to observers 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.150
 fans from the ground there are 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.829
 phenomena that are happening by 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.250
 first time and others that decades ago 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.260
 that we did not see orton said the community 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.030
 scientific so far does not have 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.370
 explanation for what is happening 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.799
 on this planet although some people 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.260
 they think maybe jupiter presents 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.250
 seemingly chaotic behaviors 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.200
 commonly and 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.360
 So far there are so many 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.970
 amateur astronomers and tools 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.890
 observation that we noticed clearly that 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.720
 there is also the possibility that 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.090
 our knowledge of physics and 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.890
 meteorology are not enough to 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.680
 understand what happens in a system 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.930
 strange like that of the great giant 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.180
 planetary of our system changes 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.390
 similar have been appreciated in others 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.610
 planets as is the case of uranus a 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.740
 international team of scientists has 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.810
 conducted a study on uranium that 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.170
 reveals that the wind on the planet can 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.390
 achieve gusts of more than 900 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.610
 kilometers per hour according to experts 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.070
 it is a surprising fact, since 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.180
 when the voyager probe passed next to 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.400
 Murano in 1986 showed a landscape with 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.830
 few novelties which caused the 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.040
 astronomers baptized the planet as the 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.470
 black hole of the solar system the new 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.870
 work presented at the meeting of the 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.790
 American astronomical society has 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.400
 made thanks to new images 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.330
 obtained thanks to a new technique in 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.310
 the care away observatory 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.460
 who have revealed a strange climate in 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.500
 now not specifically the images 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.930
 they reveal that the planet has a thick 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.419
 atmosphere of hydrogen helium and methane and 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.349
 that there the winds blow 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.810
 mainly from east to west to 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.879
 speeds that reach 900 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.770
 kilometers per hour despite the 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.169
 small amounts of energy 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.379
 available to drive them as they have 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.270
 indicated the scientists plus the 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.009
 researchers have pointed out that the 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.530
 atmosphere is almost equal to that of neptune 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.900
 and that its temperatures reach cold 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.740
 enough to freeze the methane 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.330
 around minus 180 degrees one of 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.340
 the authors of the work 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.740
 heidi hammel has explained that these 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.840
 images reveal an amazing amount 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.659
 of complexity in the atmosphere of uranium 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.729
 it was known that the planet was active 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.949
 but so far most of the 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.250
 activity was masked by noise in 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:22.349
 the data has indicated for its part the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.060
 scientist the robot robots that has 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.580
 explained that the big systems 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.440
 Uranian weather behave 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.870
 different form to those now detected 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.820
 has indicated the cloud band in form 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.880
 wave near the planet's equator 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.740
 may indicate atmospheric instability 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.450
 this is new and it is not just understood 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.610
 what it means because you have not seen 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.430
 in no other place has he confessed the 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.800
 researcher some of these systems 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.080
 meteorological remain fixed in 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.060
 certain latitudes but experience 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.490
 large variations in their activity 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.890
 while others experience great 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.040
 changes in the size and shape has added 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.990
 now the team will start working on 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.970
 the study of the seventh planet of 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.400
 solar system and warn that now not 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.740
 is changing is not expected that the 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.430
 things remain as they are now 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.490
 has pointed out is robowski 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.980
 well this has been all I hope that you 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.470
