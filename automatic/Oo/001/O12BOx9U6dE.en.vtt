00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.230
 Hello everyone, Nikita and today I 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.960
 show you how to quickly make matter in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.540
 we need the mantra naturally 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.930
 matter generator 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:22.769
 fiber optic and kvv or lv 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.289
 well, or we put the solar panel generator 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:33.500
 matter we conduct fiber from it and 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:44.730
 we put it in an hour and now about 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:49.309
 progress is faster 9 10 11 12 13 14 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:58.460
 15 hour I will show how it will go even faster 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:58.460
 as if all the court and 2425 already acts 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:07.260
 cool this stuff and you still soon 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.970
 I still want to check how it will work 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.510
 this is how it is worn on the sun 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:21.380
 panels 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:24.380
 in general will work here still spend 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.380
 optical fiber 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:41.190
 but I do not know if someone has unnecessary 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:42.270
 and in for the mother and see with us already 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.840
 five matches 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:52.460
 I now draw near seven more precisely here 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.460
 see how fast progress is going 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.890
 Do you want to 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.880
 fast isn't it 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.599
 Okay, everybody, I think the video fits 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.330
 the end 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:22.280
 leave comments put Like all 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.280
 while you were nekit
