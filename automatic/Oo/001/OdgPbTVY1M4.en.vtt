00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.880
 And so, the people with the artist 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.490
 how do not use and why 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.069
 that is the starting point of the beautiful project by André Fresneda 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.719
 that inquires about the appropriation of art in the daily life of the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.719
 people beyond the official spaces 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.099
 v to the extent that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.409
 that I was studying art every time I realized that I had 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.409
 like a bet west does it was art 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.160
 less clear and it's a good question from those of the 500 we supposedly have 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.860
 a 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.300
 an answer 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.150
 but come as an agreement 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.920
 about what is art is very difficult because there is no commune 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.270
 clear definition 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.050
 because the field of art nodded, expanding below 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.359
 Greece impossible 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.829
 we cover by definition or when people do health as 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.670
 choose a picture 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.880
 so that it combines with the curtains and with 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.119
 and with the sofa and with the vase and with the ornaments then it was 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.270
 just at least take some spaces where somehow 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.030
 the Sunday article will be manifested 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.620
 the living room of a house 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.170
 a gallery 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.700
 an office 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.550
 a good house leg of different people quarter of the front people 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.290
 I chose those those spaces 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.290
 i according to those spaces 16 a documentation 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.480
 from the documentation I made some paintings 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.549
 to decide some paintings that 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.570
 somehow 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.990
 will be in the club with all the art construction I could 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.450
 manifest that meaning for example if a mural in a 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 in a fish shop 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.460
 why every day after that before they opened a 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.200
 the restaurant to be painted 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.010
 like that Mr. summer's concern 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.210
 this guy does not charge something 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.970
 having the fishmongers with pictures or with murals so it spreads back 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.850
 much closer than before 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.009
 To the coast 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.140
 Kevin Lopez and after that is where he comes from 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.350
 fish 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.409
 then like in a relationship like com 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.839
 as with the place from where people usually come who are 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:18.189
 the owner of the spaces 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.719
 a succession of animal consumption 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:26.209
 you want in a club where in a room from point to point was the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.499
 history of his paintings 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.169
 shocking image 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.279
 He told me that he was very proud of his paintings 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.109
 what until a veterinarian had voted because he had told me that 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.099
 notified the pamperos the mediapunta 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.219
 shortly after 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.619
 it was not the pictures nor was it showing how berta expressed certain skill for me 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.259
 make different kinds of pictures 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.110
 if not that it was that which will be inscribed with a space 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.900
 tulio lópez that's how he takes the paintings to that space and with the paintings 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.769
 took the pictures 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.779
 and with the photographs I took out a fear that compiled 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.299
 the different messages he had made 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:08.849
 of which one speaks 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.869
 about it is written is displayed 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.209
 we have an opinion of him and how to circulate 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.639
 It is even a subject of study 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.439
 experiences like the tentacles project tried to articulate the 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.680
 research the curatorship 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.140
 creation and appropriation in the Colombian artistic field 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.979
 the exhibition was not only an exhibition that 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.709
 pick up 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.709
 i sent as what the stabaek doing artists at this time 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.600
 19 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.459
 I will try Alvaro Alvaro 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.479
 in the line of exit ie 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.389
 the grand finale were already the people who enter the museum 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.789
 in the middle of a line of thought 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:04:01.149
 and can pick up from those investigations something that from the most 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:06.169
 there is a different visual object to another and to another and another 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.549
 that was more or less what was coming andoain 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.049
 the benzema exhibitions 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.190
 also in the matter 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.339
 same as nothing 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.559
 which you two laws and linked 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:21.729
 there was the landa that was before in relation to the body 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.229
 the other that were relationship 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.999
 with drawing and painting 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.990
 the other in relation to video and photography 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.430
 and a fifth that were long 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.139
 before this destination 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.210
 then there we are with five looks with a 5 or 10 ships 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.490
 very punctual 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.460
 and added that 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.280
 of the possibility that this is the only thing that exists is the only thing that 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.569
 added 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.330
 what's still there 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.779
 another five another day is another day when it starts no longer change 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:57.219
 possibilities of thinking 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:59.150
 down or not 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.849
 one 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.180
 maybe the audience 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.430
 has been able to meet contemporary Colombian art 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.460
 conventionally through biennials and salons 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.139
 the national artists' show and its regional versions has been the space 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.039
 more traditional to generate the encounter between the public and the Arctic 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.059
 however, while for some it is a heritage institution of the country 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.979
 others consider that their forms of participation and validation 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.939
 they must be restated 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:34.860
 already part of the committee 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.860
 the fair of the arrival to bogotá of the year 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.729
 we divided between four people throughout the country 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.389
 I touched the Atlantic coast 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.750
 what basically does or does not do 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.150
 artists' workshops and 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.409
 so talk to people but in the classrooms 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:57.169
 At the same time we chose about ten hours of Colombian art from the 60s 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.909
 until today 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:03.009
 that has marked as guidelines for what was this biennial knows nothing about everything 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.499
 as 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:07.430
 I was trying to show 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.319
 kevin love the artists have as mutated 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.319
 then they have become like him the academic artist on stage after 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.349
 the great creator who has given landed things and super producing 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.319
 an artist as concerned about the context 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.319
 Colombians 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:28.999
 referring to the regional be 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.520
 different also talks about the biennial 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.639
 they are very institutional and have that weight or giant the institution to 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.749
 it is also 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:41.789
 It is very plausible 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.830
 one is going to make wait now 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.719
 to the regions 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:48.889
 the cen be spaces that have 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.899
 people from all over the world overturn 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:53.680
 to which the professor ansaldo regional 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.860
 even if it is not 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.649
 although the scheme does not do it 

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:00.939
 but still ojeda 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:02.340
 the presence of the state 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.800
 in the association 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.659
 name 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.659
 it implies how that state wants 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:12.050
 the acquisition of sun 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.970
 and it's obscuring a number of other issues when one encounters 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:19.559
 2 after the final expositions 

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:23.849
 it ends up happening the same as always if it will be the 2 two people who won 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:27.749
 and it is spoken in a very superficial way there is no deep reflection on 

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:30.080
 really what is happening there 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.559
 about what they touch loop 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:35.509
 in that universe 2009 when to him 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:36.629
 it's evening time
