00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.240
 there were not eight nice there was no total football but it seems that is the dynamic 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.060
 of the football of this century Holland is in the semifinals and does so with a certain 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.280
 of revenge for the last few times I see him so he left it out as he did that 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.449
 comes for long the mechanical orange and the disappointment of Brazil is it analyzes Indian 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.630
 carbide by our fellows I serve with a big head 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:27.159
 thank you very much to greet you once again just as Orlando charged those two 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.940
 eliminations in the 90s 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.020
 Eden had the Brazilians in the 74th Netherlands had won to Brazil two 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.539
 goals to zero with annotations of the mythical me with rockets and also 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.039
 nesquens and in this way the team is a Brazilian and curiously 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.690
 shares defensive squibs in plays that are born avalon stopped 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.059
 one of them including pal marker 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.239
 courtesy of felipe melo who is the one who reached the last 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.109
 instant a ball 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.819
 in which I do not exercise well either, it is not enough to connect it and the second 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.309
 scored by oxen nayar teammate of self I know how to do 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.250
 great internazionale champion of Milan in the last campaign in order 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.630
 so it is that Brazil was out of the team d Holland forward Carlos Alberto 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.680
 rafael bridge forward sir with analysis yesterday we hardly talked about that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.270
 the best goalkeeper in the world for me for example was July Caesar and today he committed 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.540
 a blunder 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.350
 the defender does what he has to do however the goalkeeper 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.640
 the one that arrives late did not have to have left and well there it is there is the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.770
 pri the first goal 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.420
 this duty of a 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.670
 spy the Dutch team that did not lose at any time 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.990
 lala to the calm that kept the 1 0 against with tranquility and that was 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.119
 slowly 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.310
 aligning the ball of some areas 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 the Brazilians some Swiss cyclists gave of bravado 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.280
 and at some point the red card had to happen 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.580
 It was not Brazil 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.980
 maybe because of the impotence that we know normally 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.270
 that seems to me 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.000
 that is more or less to comment widely 1 a match very much in tune with 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.470
 what has been the cup of the world I think that as a show like 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.410
 a level of football is short for both selections 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.760
 felt brasil better the first time a goal to his boy man chunky voided 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.060
 could have taken correctly must have taken greater advantage between 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.659
 others the great deviated 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.180
 cassel the dutch goalkeeper stekelenburg to jama will not change this he cared 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.790
 and that avoids the second goal that surely would have led to Brazil or 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.569
 I would have routed it to a victory in the second half percent we could 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.239
 talk about which improvement is still a tough game I think there was 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:37.569
 any number of faults was not lucid the encounter well the error that I 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.099
 he was credited above the Russian although they give head veil ayub the 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.769
 Caesar because the goalkeeper who the authority of a calm ball 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.019
 front or diagonal to the arch if he has the authority as goalkeeper and 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.199
 shouts the defender or the wheel that is standing there has to be made a side and 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.099
 it was a ball not even to put a fist to keep her 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.709
 and well this in pairs things then comes a set piece that 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.669
 well I was commenting 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:11.389
 trier 40 the man who has it and is older without a mark in that kind of e 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:16.370
 balls it is very difficult to find the mark a similar situation in the arc 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.739
 from hollanda that own which 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.989
 sent to the corner kick in second post 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.029
 but 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.559
 we can not talk about the fact that the holland victory has not been deserved action 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:30.269
 he could calmly have made the third goal when Brazil completely 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.619
 blurred they lost their heads was robinho to rebuke @m in a play that if 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:39.449
 he had committed the mistake, then alves was complaining and I think that 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.939
 well brazil in sin leads the penance went out of style and 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:47.469
 ended up losing the match felipe melo was ejected at minute 72 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:51.059
 the Dutch team can not count on its two central headings because the 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:52.540
 nuances in the d 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.109
 heating is injured 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.500
 has to put andre ooijer and in the play of the goal 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.890
 where robinho scored a gap is made by the neighborhood center I do not know what was 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.930
 making arjen roben in those hours that ends up losing the brand but it 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.669
 there will be a barbarian overturn through that area 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.700
 Brazil will be eliminated in the quarterfinals not play spectacular that 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.629
 we wanted as it happens to the story 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.689
 in the balance this participation of brazil in this world 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.319
 priego that for this performance 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.749
 very bad 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:23.479
 in the first part only the first part there were 20 fouls this means 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.059
 that causes a lack every two minutes 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:31.249
 speak of a party lie truncated by everything without pace without speed or is a 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.590
 game in which the game was longer in the field thrown than playing 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.690
 and what you said sorry this 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.960
 epec of the first goal 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.910
 it's the beta from kindergarten it can not be that all holland players are in 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:44.500
 line 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.500
 almost almost screaming that in the middle 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.480
 entry robinho de sama de lugo sensational midfield pass 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.689
 and first-touch robinho but they can not have told robinho 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.689
 it happens that here is more easily incredible rafa 2 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:00.539
 to the even bread 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.819
 if with the aggravating circumstance that one of them was robbed or technicians 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.899
 had absolutely nothing to do there because if he is a regular gentleman or 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:13.259
 usually you do not fight a ball when you lose it in the offensive sector 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.229
 of your team you do not go dpa to sign the commitment to comply with a brand 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.409
 When he does not know how to do it and apart he does not feel good because the first of the 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.509
 conmebol teams that were alive in this round of quarterfinals has 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:27.849
 been eliminated lugo has said 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.120
 he will have the word right here in local gurgles we will know the history 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:32.719
 we come back with you 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.770
 thank you very much gentlemen and talking about the defense of brazil 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.060
 this is the first time he loses a world cup match n that the ones in 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.110
 two or more goals the most recent had been France 98 the final with this 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.390
 triunfo improved her record against brazil in world cups now in semis 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.220
 his rival could be Uruguay against whom he also has favorable and 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.629
 in a hypothetical final against Argentina 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.979
 holland also has the serious one in favor of Paraguay and I have never tried it
