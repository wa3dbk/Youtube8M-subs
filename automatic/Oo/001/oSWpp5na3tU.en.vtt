00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.340 
could be ridden if some people are ready
to<00:05:33.010> surf<00:05:33.250> it<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:34.540> it<00:05:34.960> can<00:05:35.139> be<00:05:35.290> there<00:05:35.560> for<00:05:35.770> sure

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
to surf it it it can be there for sure

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.689 
to surf it it it can be there for sure
so<00:05:38.350> it's<00:05:38.710> a<00:05:38.770> feeling<00:05:39.010> you<00:05:39.040> have<00:05:39.190> when<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:39.550> go

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
so it's a feeling you have when you go

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.120 
so it's a feeling you have when you go
and<00:05:39.790> paragraph<00:05:40.330> first<00:05:40.690> you<00:05:41.470> are<00:05:41.650> privileged

person<00:05:42.639> but<00:05:43.600> the<00:05:43.750> most<00:05:44.020> important<00:05:44.620> is<00:05:44.770> the

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
person but the most important is the

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.770 
person but the most important is the
fact<00:05:45.100> you<00:05:45.310> leave<00:05:45.639> something<00:05:45.970> exceptional

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
fact you leave something exceptional

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.469 
fact you leave something exceptional
it's<00:05:47.020> it's<00:05:47.740> another<00:05:48.100> dimension<00:05:48.479> something

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
it's it's another dimension something

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.590 
it's it's another dimension something
but<00:05:49.770> such<00:05:50.770> little<00:05:51.250> number<00:05:51.610> of<00:05:51.790> surfers<00:05:52.360> we

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
but such little number of surfers we

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.620 
but such little number of surfers we
know<00:05:52.870> we<00:05:53.260> see<00:05:53.620> with<00:05:53.979> practice<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:55.120> I<00:05:55.600> think

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
know we see with practice and I think

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.750 
know we see with practice and I think
the<00:05:55.960> special<00:05:56.200> spot<00:05:56.590> people<00:05:57.040> who<00:05:57.250> know<00:05:57.490> that

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
the special spot people who know that

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.690 
the special spot people who know that
it's<00:05:58.090> not<00:05:58.330> accessible<00:05:59.190> without<00:06:00.190> training<00:06:02.700> to

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
it's not accessible without training to

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.879 
it's not accessible without training to
catch<00:06:03.970> a<00:06:04.150> very<00:06:04.450> large<00:06:04.810> wave<00:06:05.080> in<00:06:05.260> Europe<00:06:05.620> is

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
catch a very large wave in Europe is

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.909 
catch a very large wave in Europe is
much<00:06:06.490> more<00:06:06.729> difficult<00:06:07.240> than<00:06:07.300> in<00:06:07.510> Hawaii<00:06:07.919> here

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
much more difficult than in Hawaii here

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.830 
much more difficult than in Hawaii here
we<00:06:09.190> have<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.400> wind<00:06:09.639> to<00:06:10.090> watch<00:06:10.300> out<00:06:10.570> because

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
we have the wind to watch out because

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.500 
we have the wind to watch out because
the<00:06:11.200> the<00:06:11.620> low-pressure<00:06:11.979> are<00:06:12.430> always<00:06:13.090> pretty

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
the the low-pressure are always pretty

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.270 
the the low-pressure are always pretty
low<00:06:13.840> so<00:06:14.169> they<00:06:14.289> come<00:06:14.470> with<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.770> wind

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
low so they come with the wind

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.010 
low so they come with the wind
we<00:06:15.820> don't<00:06:16.000> have<00:06:16.090> the<00:06:16.240> trade<00:06:16.479> winds<00:06:16.720> to<00:06:16.840> push

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
we don't have the trade winds to push

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.430 
we don't have the trade winds to push
back<00:06:17.199> to<00:06:17.470> balance<00:06:17.949> the<00:06:18.729> system<00:06:18.940> we<00:06:19.780> could<00:06:20.020> wave

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
back to balance the system we could wave

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.900 
back to balance the system we could wave
above<00:06:21.250> 20<00:06:21.910> foot<00:06:22.150> maybe<00:06:23.250> three<00:06:24.250> time<00:06:24.490> in<00:06:24.700> five

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
above 20 foot maybe three time in five

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.940 
above 20 foot maybe three time in five
years<00:06:25.150> so<00:06:25.270> it's<00:06:26.229> odd<00:06:27.930> if<00:06:28.930> you<00:06:29.229> also<00:06:29.440> have<00:06:29.770> the

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
years so it's odd if you also have the

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.710 
years so it's odd if you also have the
cojones<00:06:30.310> and<00:06:30.639> the<00:06:30.820> skill<00:06:31.090> to<00:06:31.300> surf<00:06:31.510> the

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
cojones and the skill to surf the

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.960 
cojones and the skill to surf the
biggest<00:06:32.080> and<00:06:32.289> earliest<00:06:32.800> waves<00:06:33.039> on<00:06:33.310> the<00:06:33.550> planet

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
biggest and earliest waves on the planet

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.089 
biggest and earliest waves on the planet
you<00:06:34.389> will<00:06:34.539> probably<00:06:34.810> meet<00:06:35.200> Robbie<00:06:35.530> and<00:06:35.800> Sean

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
you will probably meet Robbie and Sean

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.760 
you will probably meet Robbie and Sean
on<00:06:36.340> their<00:06:36.880> journey<00:06:37.180> to<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:37.510> swells<00:06:37.900> see<00:06:38.680> you

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
on their journey to the swells see you

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.370 
on their journey to the swells see you
on<00:06:38.889> the<00:06:38.979> water<00:06:39.130> guys
