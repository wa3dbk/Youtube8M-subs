i'm thinking while talking and I
probably<00:01:05.000> shouldn't<00:01:05.390> think<00:01:05.509> or<00:01:05.750> talk<00:01:06.350> well<00:01:07.250> I

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
probably shouldn't think or talk well I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.580 
probably shouldn't think or talk well I
should<00:01:07.610> talk<00:01:07.729> it's<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.030> commentary<00:01:08.420> okay<00:01:09.380> I<00:01:09.409> was

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
should talk it's a commentary okay I was

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.340 
should talk it's a commentary okay I was
always<00:01:09.950> betting<00:01:10.430> on<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.610> fact<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:11.350> that

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
always betting on the fact that that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.810 
always betting on the fact that that
this<00:01:12.560> guy<00:01:12.710> would<00:01:12.770> have<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.190> Cape<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.549> believe
