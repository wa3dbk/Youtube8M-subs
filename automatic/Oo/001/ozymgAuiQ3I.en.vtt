00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
variables one is going to be my combo

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.980 
variables one is going to be my combo
timer<00:01:33.470> because<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.860> mine<00:01:35.010> based<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.430> time

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990

and<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:44.310> third<00:01:44.490> will<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.729> my<00:01:44.880> score<00:01:47.510> okay

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.410 

perfect<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.130> since<00:01:53.490> our<00:01:53.580> timer<00:01:53.910> is<00:01:54.240> gonna

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
perfect so since our timer is gonna

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.540 
perfect so since our timer is gonna
since<00:01:55.020> our<00:01:55.140> columns<00:01:55.410> be<00:01:55.500> based<00:01:55.679> on<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.890> timer<00:01:56.220> I

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
since our columns be based on a timer I

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.990 
since our columns be based on a timer I
need<00:01:57.179> to<00:01:57.270> set<00:01:57.539> up<00:01:57.570> my<00:01:57.690> timer<00:01:58.490> with<00:01:59.490> Delta<00:01:59.820> time

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
need to set up my timer with Delta time

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.740 
need to set up my timer with Delta time
so<00:02:00.330> I'm<00:02:00.630> gonna<00:02:00.720> add<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:02.220> combo<00:02:02.610> timer<00:02:02.850> DT<00:02:03.450> on

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
so I'm gonna add to combo timer DT on

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.950 
so I'm gonna add to combo timer DT on
every<00:02:04.740> tick<00:02:05.009> okay<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.000> set<00:02:06.330> up<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> timer<00:02:08.960> now

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
every tick okay to set up that timer now

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.300 
every tick okay to set up that timer now
most<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.380> events<00:02:10.530> are<00:02:10.740> gonna<00:02:10.830> most<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
most of the events are gonna most the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
most of the events are gonna most the
actions<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:11.940> happen<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> bullet

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
actions going to happen on the bullet

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.720

gonna do is each time a bullet hits an

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.890 
gonna do is each time a bullet hits an
enemy<00:02:22.380> we're<00:02:22.980> gonna<00:02:23.069> reset<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.970> combo<00:02:24.540> timer

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
enemy we're gonna reset the combo timer

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.510 
to zero all right so what we're gonna do
is<00:02:31.020> we're<00:02:31.110> gonna<00:02:31.200> check<00:02:31.470> later<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.010> see<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.250> it

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
is we're gonna check later to see if it

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.740 
is we're gonna check later to see if it
goes<00:02:32.640> over<00:02:33.080> like<00:02:34.080> two<00:02:34.380> for<00:02:34.650> two<00:02:34.770> seconds<00:02:35.190> that

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
goes over like two for two seconds that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.240 
goes over like two for two seconds that
our<00:02:36.750> combo<00:02:37.110> will<00:02:37.290> reset<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.830> I'll<00:02:37.980> show<00:02:38.130> you

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
our combo will reset and I'll show you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.650 
our combo will reset and I'll show you
that<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.550> minute<00:02:38.670> let's<00:02:39.270> get<00:02:39.450> ahead<00:02:39.540> of

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
that in a minute let's get ahead of

here

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
here

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:11.800 
here
we're<00:03:04.200> gonna<00:03:06.950> set<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> value<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.660> score

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
we're gonna set the value of this score

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.970 
we're gonna set the value of this score
to<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.840> score

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:25.880 

plus<00:03:17.300> 100<00:03:18.300> times<00:03:20.000> combo<00:03:22.310> multiplier<00:03:24.890> so

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
plus 100 times combo multiplier so

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.670 
plus 100 times combo multiplier so
whatever<00:03:26.130> my<00:03:26.280> score<00:03:26.550> already<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:27.000> add<00:03:27.680> 100

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
whatever my score already is add 100

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.190 
whatever my score already is add 100
times<00:03:28.920> over<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.340> multiplier<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.880> okay<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:31.020> my

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
times over the multiplier is okay so my

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.860 
times over the multiplier is okay so my
multipliers<00:03:31.590> at<00:03:31.710> 1<00:03:32.120> it's<00:03:33.120> gonna<00:03:33.240> be<00:03:33.360> 100<00:03:33.750> if

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
multipliers at 1 it's gonna be 100 if

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:42.200 
multipliers at 1 it's gonna be 100 if
it's<00:03:34.050> 5<00:03:34.350> than<00:03:34.650> 500<00:03:37.640> okay<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:41.090> lastly<00:03:42.090> I

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
it's 5 than 500 okay and lastly I

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.300 
it's 5 than 500 okay and lastly I
believe<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.930> we're<00:03:43.110> going<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.380> check<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:44.220> make

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
believe is we're going to check to make

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.800 
believe is we're going to check to make
sure<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.850> timer<00:03:45.090> hasn't<00:03:45.450> taken<00:03:45.600> too<00:03:45.870> long<00:03:47.810> so

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
sure the timer hasn't taken too long so

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.250 
sure the timer hasn't taken too long so
we're<00:03:48.960> gonna<00:03:49.080> compare<00:03:49.380> our<00:03:49.890> combo<00:03:50.460> timer<00:03:51.260> or

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
we're gonna compare our combo timer or

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.310 
we're gonna compare our combo timer or
si<00:03:52.590> if<00:03:52.650> it's<00:03:52.800> greater<00:03:53.190> than<00:03:53.310> or<00:03:53.460> equal<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.420> 2

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
si if it's greater than or equal to 2

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.550 
si if it's greater than or equal to 2
seconds<00:03:56.870> then<00:03:57.870> we're<00:03:57.990> gonna<00:03:58.080> reset<00:03:58.470> our

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
seconds then we're gonna reset our

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.340 
seconds then we're gonna reset our
multiplier

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.410 

okay<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.770> then<00:04:07.600> we're<00:04:08.600> gonna<00:04:08.690> set<00:04:09.080> up<00:04:09.110> our

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
okay and then we're gonna set up our

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:20.650 
okay and then we're gonna set up our
score<00:04:11.420> box<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.930> score<00:04:18.320> variable<00:04:19.660> and

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
score box and the score variable and

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:31.380 
score box and the score variable and
we're<00:04:21.050> gonna<00:04:21.170> set<00:04:21.500> up<00:04:21.620> our<00:04:21.739> combo<00:04:24.040> say<00:04:25.210> combo

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:39.940 

and<00:04:33.370> combo<00:04:34.370> multiplier<00:04:38.080> all<00:04:39.080> right<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.590> that

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
and combo multiplier all right and that

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.620 
and combo multiplier all right and that
should<00:04:40.250> take<00:04:40.490> care<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.790> that<00:04:41.000> let's<00:04:41.240> give<00:04:41.420> it<00:04:41.450> a

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
should take care of that let's give it a

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.720 
should take care of that let's give it a
test<00:04:41.810> run<00:04:44.590> all<00:04:45.590> right<00:04:45.740> my<00:04:45.950> combos<00:04:46.340> at<00:04:46.490> one
