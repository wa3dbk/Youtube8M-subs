advice to create this bookmark it's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.830 
advice to create this bookmark it's
better<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.479> start<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.970> here<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.210> it's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
better to start here and here so it's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
better to start here and here so it's
better<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.560> divide<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:39.360> work<00:01:39.659> into

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
better if you divide this work into

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.179 
better if you divide this work into
parts<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:42.170> after<00:01:43.170> creating<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.979> two

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
parts and then after creating the two

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.319 
parts and then after creating the two
parts<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.329> join<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.680> two<00:01:46.829> parts<00:01:47.329> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
parts you can join the two parts so

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.670 
parts you can join the two parts so
through<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:50.040> beats<00:01:50.280> okay<00:01:51.020> in<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.320> part

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
through all the beats okay in this part

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.550 
through all the beats okay in this part
and<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.850> part<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.600> work<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.259> bigger

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and in this part the work is bigger

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.240 
and in this part the work is bigger
because<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.270> columns<00:01:57.869> than<00:01:58.860> in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
because you have more columns than in

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.609 
because you have more columns than in
the<00:01:59.850> central<00:02:00.360> part<00:02:00.659> okay<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.810> want<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the central part okay and so I want to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.950 
the central part okay and so I want to
show<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.219> previous<00:02:05.549> book<00:02:05.850> bookmark<00:02:06.630> too
