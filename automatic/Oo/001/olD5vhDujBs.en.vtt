bring it to the boil wait for about five
minutes<00:00:14.690> and<00:00:14.959> then<00:00:15.020> test<00:00:15.740> it<00:00:15.950> by<00:00:16.160> taking<00:00:16.400> a

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
minutes and then test it by taking a

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.100 
minutes and then test it by taking a
little<00:00:16.849> bit<00:00:17.000> of<00:00:17.060> sugar<00:00:17.270> and<00:00:17.420> putting<00:00:17.689> into<00:00:17.840> ice

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
little bit of sugar and putting into ice

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.620 
little bit of sugar and putting into ice
water<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:18.830> then<00:00:18.950> if<00:00:19.640> it's<00:00:19.790> hardens<00:00:20.300> enough

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
water and then if it's hardens enough

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.740 
water and then if it's hardens enough
all<00:00:21.110> right<00:00:21.349> and<00:00:21.500> it<00:00:21.800> has<00:00:22.009> to<00:00:22.220> be<00:00:22.340> hard<00:00:22.750> okay

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
all right and it has to be hard okay

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.880 
all right and it has to be hard okay
then<00:00:24.110> it's<00:00:24.320> cracked

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
then it's cracked

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.939 
then it's cracked
okay<00:00:25.460> maybe<00:00:25.820> it's<00:00:26.029> still<00:00:26.210> like<00:00:26.689> you<00:00:27.470> can<00:00:27.650> roll

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949

have 200 grams of nuts
okay<00:02:22.700> I'm<00:02:23.270> using<00:02:23.660> cons<00:02:24.069> yeah<00:02:26.230> I'm<00:02:27.230> gonna<00:02:27.560> add

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
okay I'm using cons yeah I'm gonna add

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.160 
okay I'm using cons yeah I'm gonna add
in<00:02:28.400> all<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.790> actually<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:29.810> it's

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
in all of it actually it's it's it's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.790 
in all of it actually it's it's it's
there<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.310> an<00:02:31.640> upper<00:02:32.030> limit<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.560> I

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
there is an upper limit to it and I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.540 
there is an upper limit to it and I
would<00:02:33.950> think<00:02:34.250> it's<00:02:34.610> about<00:02:35.769> 250<00:02:36.769> because

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
would think it's about 250 because

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.930 
would think it's about 250 because
otherwise<00:02:38.350> that's<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:39.560> too<00:02:39.709> much

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
otherwise that's just too much

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.090 
otherwise that's just too much
I'm<00:02:41.300> trying<00:02:41.660> not<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.810> let<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.230> get<00:02:42.320> up<00:02:42.590> here<00:02:42.860> so

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
I'm trying not to let it get up here so

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.690 
I'm trying not to let it get up here so
slowly<00:02:43.850> slowly<00:02:44.150> just<00:02:45.080> turn<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:45.980> off<00:02:46.100> so

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
slowly slowly just turn it on and off so

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.080 
slowly slowly just turn it on and off so
if<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:47.030> mix<00:02:47.209> this<00:02:47.360> in<00:02:47.570> evenly<00:02:48.610> or<00:02:49.610> as<00:02:49.790> evenly

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
if you mix this in evenly or as evenly

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.850 
if you mix this in evenly or as evenly
as<00:02:50.180> possible<00:02:50.300> don't<00:02:51.110> do<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.500> freshness

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
as possible don't do it to a freshness

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.820 
as possible don't do it to a freshness
