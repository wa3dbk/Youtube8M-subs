 the prayer the art of believing by neville 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.049
 goodness 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.650
 chapter 7 and last the biggest 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.650
 prayer 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.940
 the imagination is the beginning of the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.460
 creation you imagine what you want and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.320
 then you believe it true every dream 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 could be done by that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.059
 sufficiently self-disciplined to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 Believe it, people are what you choose 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.620
 make them and a man agrees 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.660
 the way you look at it you should 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.430
 look at him with different eyes before 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.230
 objective change 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.690
 two men looked from the bars 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.540
 of the prison one saw the logo and the other 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.180
 saw the stars centuries ago 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.760
 Isaiah asked who is blind if not my 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.830
 servant or deaf as the messenger who 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.050
 send who is blind like he is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.570
 perfect and blind as the servant of 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.460
 Sir, this means that man 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.759
 perfect judge not by appearances 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.369
 but he judges rightly he sees others 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.590
 as he wishes it to be he hears only 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.289
 what he wants to hear he sees only the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.270
 well in others there is no condemnation 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.970
 for he transforms the world with his seeing and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.940
 listen to the king who sits on the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.100
 throne escapes evil with his eye the 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.960
 sympathy for living things is not in 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.729
 the king's conscience because 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.340
 I have learned to separate their fakes 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.990
 concepts of his true self for the the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.380
 poverty is nothing but the dream of 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.110
 wealth he does not see silk worms but 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.810
 Picturesque butterflies about to be 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.820
 see winter but sleeping summer do not see 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.550
 Man interference and not Jesus in sleep 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.409
 Jesus of Nazareth who is the evil field 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.930
 with his eye he is asleep in the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.000
 imagination of every man and from his 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.909
 own imagination man should 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 awaken him affirming subjectively I 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.399
 I am Jesus then and only then will you see 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.730
 to jesus since man can only see 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.680
 what is awake inside you the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.519
 Holy Matrix is ​​the imagination of the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.680
 man 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.540
 the holy infant is that self concept 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.209
 same that fits with the definition of 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.130
 perfection of isaiah serves the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.100
 words of Saint Augustine 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.190
 too late I have loved you because look at you 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.900
 you were inside and I looked for you outside is a 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.900
 your own conscience that you should 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.120
 become the only reality there and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.700
 only there you wake up what is 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.870
 asleep even though Christ was born a thousand times 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.209
 in Bethlehem 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.330
 and he is not born in you your soul is still 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.879
 lost the creation is finished flames 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.099
 your creation do feeling the reality 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.470
 of the state you would call a state 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.290
 psychic attracts its affinities but not 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.209
 create what attracts like sleep 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.700
 is called by the feeling I have 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.340
 dream like this is also Jesus Christ called 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.590
 for the feeling I am Jesus Christ the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.420
 man sees himself only people 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.310
 emerges from the mass betraying his 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.980
 immediate affinity with your states 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.260
 psychic insofar as they are generated 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.329
 you find by apparent accident but 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.150
 you discover that they are intimate of your states 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.400
 moods because your states 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.329
 moods are continually outsourced to 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.370
 themselves 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.220
 you could prophesy from them that 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.290
 you without looking for it you would find yourself soon 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.319
 with certain characters and you would find 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.239
 with certain conditions that's why he calls 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.819
 perfect to be living in the 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.709
 feeling I am christ because Christ is 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.420
 that concept of being through which 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.450
 the unveiled ones can be seen 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.489
 realities of eternity our 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.560
 behavior is influenced by our 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.300
 subconscious assumption respect 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.340
 our own social rank and 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.220
 intellectual and that of whom we 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.680
 we direct seek and evoke the greatest 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.810
 rank and the most noble of all is that 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.930
 you saw the man of his mortality and 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.940
 You saw him as sovereign immortal glory 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.860
 let's assume the feeling I am Christ and 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.900
 all our behavior will change 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.750
 subtly and unconsciously according to 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.459
 that assumption our assumptions 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.980
 subconscious continuously it 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.660
 they outsource themselves so that others 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.850
 can consciously see us as 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.160
 we see ourselves subconsciously to 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.930
 ourselves and tell us for their 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.960
 actions what we have subconsciously 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.090
 assumed that we are why 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.340
 let's assume the feeling I am christ 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.770
 until our conscious statement 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.270
 become our subconscious assumption 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.310
 that all of us face 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.320
 discovered ' contemplating as in 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.270
 crystal the glory of the Lord we are 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.400
 converted into that same image of 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.200
 glory in glory let's leave god 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.010
 wake up and your enemies be 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.080
 destroyed 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.370
 there is no greater prayer for the 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.610
 man 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.449
