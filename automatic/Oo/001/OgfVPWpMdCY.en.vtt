00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
that some people think it's kind of

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.920 
that some people think it's kind of
funny<00:04:39.979> but<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.460> actually<00:04:41.330> appreciate<00:04:41.810> that

course the recline the way you recline
this<00:06:38.569> one<00:06:38.749> is<00:06:38.899> it<00:06:39.049> was<00:06:39.109> just<00:06:39.169> a<00:06:39.349> canvas<00:06:39.559> strap

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
this one is it was just a canvas strap

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.129 
this one is it was just a canvas strap
hanging<00:06:40.369> in<00:06:40.489> the<00:06:40.549> back<00:06:40.759> and<00:06:41.149> sort<00:06:41.959> of<00:06:42.019> a

pinched tab it grabs on to that which

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.539

and kind of let it fall down with
gravity<00:06:48.529> or<00:06:48.619> give<00:06:48.739> it<00:06:48.829> a<00:06:48.889> little<00:06:49.039> tug<00:06:49.219> and<00:06:49.669> you

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:50.089 
gravity or give it a little tug and you

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:52.949 
gravity or give it a little tug and you
can<00:06:50.239> stop<00:06:50.479> anywhere<00:06:50.929> along<00:06:50.989> that<00:06:51.259> strap<00:06:51.829> so

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:52.959 
can stop anywhere along that strap so

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:56.919 
can stop anywhere along that strap so
once<00:06:53.959> you<00:06:54.079> go<00:06:54.199> down<00:06:54.879> the<00:06:55.879> the<00:06:56.359> fabric<00:06:56.569> here

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
one more thing on the back of the

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.990 
one more thing on the back of the
stroller<00:07:17.900> here<00:07:18.230> that<00:07:19.160> I<00:07:19.190> really<00:07:19.580> like<00:07:19.730> is<00:07:19.880> the

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
stroller here that I really like is the

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.990 
stroller here that I really like is the
safety<00:07:20.240> strap<00:07:20.830> it<00:07:21.830> has<00:07:21.890> elastic<00:07:22.580> in<00:07:22.700> here

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 
safety strap it has elastic in here

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.750 
safety strap it has elastic in here
which<00:07:23.450> means<00:07:23.540> it<00:07:23.780> won't<00:07:23.870> tug<00:07:24.170> on<00:07:24.320> you<00:07:24.760> like

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:25.760 
which means it won't tug on you like

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.520 
which means it won't tug on you like
hard<00:07:26.360> enough<00:07:26.510> to<00:07:26.630> rip<00:07:26.780> your<00:07:26.900> hand<00:07:27.110> off<00:07:27.320> or

hard enough to rip your hand off or

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.380 
hard enough to rip your hand off or
anything<00:07:27.710> should<00:07:28.610> you<00:07:28.730> lose<00:07:28.850> track<00:07:29.180> of<00:07:29.210> the

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390 
anything should you lose track of the

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.110 
anything should you lose track of the

on<00:07:32.150> the<00:07:32.330> handle<00:07:32.780> which<00:07:33.050> means<00:07:33.620> it's<00:07:33.830> not<00:07:33.980> in

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 
on the handle which means it's not in

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.170

your<00:07:34.670> way

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:40.850 
tangled up in it with everything so I

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.620 
tangled up in it with everything so I
really<00:07:41.330> liked<00:07:41.510> it<00:07:41.660> was<00:07:41.720> up<00:07:41.900> high<00:07:42.110> now

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:46.940 
as we said this thing is really

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.860 
as we said this thing is really
maneuverable<00:07:47.540> and<00:07:47.930> it's<00:07:48.140> very<00:07:48.470> compact<00:07:49.100> it's

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:51.870 
maneuverable and it's very compact it's

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.159 
maneuverable and it's very compact it's
the<00:07:52.169> ability<00:07:52.500> to<00:07:52.530> add<00:07:52.710> that<00:07:52.919> joke<00:07:53.160> scene<00:07:53.400> and

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:54.169 
the ability to add that joke scene and

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:56.019 
the ability to add that joke scene and
worried<00:07:54.680> about<00:07:54.830> kicking<00:07:55.279> anything<00:07:55.490> extra

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:56.029 
worried about kicking anything extra

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:58.809
