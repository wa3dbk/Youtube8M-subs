00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.299
 marvel 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.250
 the first rule of marvel comics is that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.920
 all the characters move in the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.920
 therefore the same narrative universe 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.949
 soon they are destined to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.619
 meet to interact and ally 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.630
 often many users who read manga or 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.250
 who do not read comics do not know how

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.490
 favorite character and we have to go 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.229
 to put in with how we can start in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.990
 comics found everything found 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.810
 stapled monthly volumes that work 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.960
 more volumes or small volumes if you have one 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.940
 well stocked comics instead vi 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.399
 I recommend this or the volumes of the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.079
 marvel season 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:18.909
 this is about the avengers are 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:24.140
 112 color pages indeed very well e 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:29.049
 we say summarizes from the beginning of how 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.049
 the avengers and the avengers were born 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.370
 so if you can find these 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.629
 I recommend the volumes at 2000 percent 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.970
 but don't worry because they exist 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.980
 volumes of the saison not only for the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.790
 avengers but also for other superheroes 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:54.319
 like spider man the fantastic four 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.889
 hicks man hulk devil doctor strange ant 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:02.599
 man iron man thor and wolverine 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:07.549
 so if your superhero is in between 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.799
 these of the volume I recommend 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.639
 buy it and if you find them you are already at 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.900
 good point 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:17.900
 these cost 12 euros while if you have i 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.069
 big money you can buy the caskets 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:25.459
 ranging from 60 to 70 euros and collect 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.190
 obviously more stories of more characters 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.739
 if you do not find these volumes 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.590
 throw there you like thor buy yourself 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.560
 number 180 of thor you will not understand us 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.560
 nothing goes well the 181 the beretta already of 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.840
 plus 182 even more and so on 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.199
