back to surfing the internet so we're

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.890 
back to surfing the internet so we're
sitting<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.489> Lima<00:02:29.819> Peru<00:02:30.120> airport<00:02:30.720> where

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
sitting in the Lima Peru airport where

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.839 
sitting in the Lima Peru airport where
we've<00:02:31.079> been<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> few<00:02:31.590> hours<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.459> we<00:02:32.760> were

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
we've been for a few hours and we were

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.089 
we've been for a few hours and we were
supposed<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.360> fly<00:02:33.569> from<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.290> Brazil<00:02:34.829> to

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
supposed to fly from here to Brazil to

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.339 
supposed to fly from here to Brazil to
see<00:02:35.549> iguassu<00:02:35.849> falls<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.110> might<00:02:37.319> be

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
see iguassu falls but that might be

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.809 
see iguassu falls but that might be
cancelled<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.129> I<00:02:38.159> think<00:02:38.370> we're<00:02:38.459> gonna<00:02:38.549> fly

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
cancelled so I think we're gonna fly

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.460 
cancelled so I think we're gonna fly
directly<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.360> Argentina<00:02:39.900> which<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.379> a<00:02:40.409> shame

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
directly to Argentina which is a shame

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.050 
directly to Argentina which is a shame
because<00:02:40.739> we<00:02:41.310> did<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.519> much<00:02:41.610> work<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.819> get<00:02:42.000> my

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
because we did so much work to get my

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.699 
because we did so much work to get my
Brazilian<00:02:42.510> Passport<00:02:42.689> but<00:02:43.260> that's<00:02:43.439> how<00:02:43.590> these

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
Brazilian Passport but that's how these

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.349 
Brazilian Passport but that's how these
things<00:02:43.769> go<00:02:44.069> sometimes<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:44.879> figured<00:02:44.909> while<00:02:45.329> I

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
things go sometimes so I figured while I

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.470 
things go sometimes so I figured while I
was<00:02:45.599> in<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.290> Peruvian<00:02:47.159> airport<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.939> would<00:02:48.299> show
