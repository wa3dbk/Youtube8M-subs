Daniel Bryan choked out justin roberts

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.830

and<00:05:01.530> he<00:05:01.590> ended<00:05:01.710> up<00:05:01.830> getting<00:05:02.070> fired<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.970> there's

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
and he ended up getting fired so there's

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.990 
and he ended up getting fired so there's
taken<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.350> too<00:05:04.470> far<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:05.010> then<00:05:05.670> there's<00:05:05.820> just

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
taken it too far and then there's just

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.700 
taken it too far and then there's just
following<00:05:06.420> the<00:05:06.450> rules<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.260> think<00:05:07.560> Brock

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
following the rules and I think Brock

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.980 
following the rules and I think Brock
Lesnar<00:05:08.070> followed<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.460> rules<00:05:08.670> maybe<00:05:09.630> throwing
