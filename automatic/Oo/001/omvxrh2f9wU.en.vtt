class and I feel like I have
this<00:01:58.100> huge<00:01:58.370> group<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.820> friends<00:01:59.330> is<00:01:59.450> an<00:01:59.540> actual

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
this huge group of friends is an actual

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.470 
this huge group of friends is an actual
practical<00:02:00.590> experience<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.340> he<00:02:01.970> had<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.120> trip

to<00:02:02.570> New<00:02:02.660> York<00:02:15.790> put<00:02:16.790> us<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.120> set<00:02:17.360> aside<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
to New York put us you set aside the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.830 
to New York put us you set aside the
actual<00:02:18.050> simulations<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:20.180> think<00:02:20.420> everyone

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
actual simulations and I think everyone

when<00:03:30.210> we<00:03:30.240> were<00:03:30.510> assigned<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.170> but<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.710> is<00:03:31.860> one

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
when we were assigned it but it is one

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
competition you really do get that

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.339 
competition you really do get that
especially<00:05:50.669> through<00:05:51.229> researching<00:05:52.229> your

from and the countries that are you
searching<00:06:01.439> I<00:06:02.210> thought<00:06:03.210> it<00:06:03.270> was<00:06:03.389> really<00:06:03.479> neat

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
searching I thought it was really neat

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.749 
searching I thought it was really neat
to<00:06:03.990> be<00:06:04.110> able<00:06:04.199> to<00:06:04.379> go<00:06:04.529> and<00:06:05.069> sit<00:06:05.310> in<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.490> UN

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
General Assembly Room and we got to sit

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.129 
General Assembly Room and we got to sit
at<00:06:08.129> the<00:06:08.250> candidate<00:06:08.639> of<00:06:08.699> desk<00:06:09.060> and<00:06:09.300> so<00:06:09.840> that<00:06:09.990> was

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
at the candidate of desk and so that was

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.809 
at the candidate of desk and so that was
really<00:06:10.199> neat<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:10.949> that's<00:06:11.069> not<00:06:11.219> an<00:06:11.340> experience

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
really neat and that's not an experience

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.040 
really neat and that's not an experience
you<00:06:11.909> can<00:06:12.029> have<00:06:12.060> in<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.360> worlds<00:06:12.659> and<00:06:12.810> world

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
you can have in the worlds and world

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.709 
you can have in the worlds and world
matter<00:06:13.349> how<00:06:14.039> great<00:06:14.340> they<00:06:14.550> do<00:06:14.610> it's<00:06:15.509> never

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
matter how great they do it's never

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.869 
matter how great they do it's never
going<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:15.960> be<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.110> same<00:06:16.349> as<00:06:16.500> that<00:06:16.620> so<00:06:17.099> I<00:06:17.340> think

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:17.879 
going to be the same as that so I think

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:19.909 
going to be the same as that so I think
it<00:06:18.120> was<00:06:18.240> really<00:06:18.810> beneficial<00:06:18.960> for<00:06:19.529> us<00:06:19.590> to<00:06:19.770> go<00:06:19.860> to

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
it was really beneficial for us to go to

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.379 
it was really beneficial for us to go to
New<00:06:20.069> York<00:06:20.340> and<00:06:20.460> experience<00:06:20.909> that's<00:06:21.090> an<00:06:21.270> actual

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
New York and experience that's an actual

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:22.909 
New York and experience that's an actual
organization<00:06:21.689> you<00:06:22.259> know<00:06:22.349> they<00:06:22.469> actually<00:06:22.529> do

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
organization you know they actually do

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.499 
organization you know they actually do
do<00:06:23.189> things<00:06:23.460> there<00:06:23.699> they're<00:06:23.969> not<00:06:24.090> making<00:06:24.300> this

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
do things there they're not making this

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.969 
do things there they're not making this
up<00:06:24.689> it<00:06:24.900> so<00:06:25.080> it's<00:06:25.469> not<00:06:25.560> a<00:06:25.620> part<00:06:25.860> of<00:06:25.889> the

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
up it so it's not a part of the

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.679 
up it so it's not a part of the
