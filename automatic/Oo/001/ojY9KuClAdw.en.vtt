the most important issues is protection

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.600 
the most important issues is protection
on<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.650> kind<00:01:40.830> of<00:01:40.860> protection<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.520> we

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
on it so what kind of protection can we

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.600 
on it so what kind of protection can we
expect<00:01:41.880> from<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.360> 19<00:01:43.320> well<00:01:43.830> with<00:01:44.040> regards<00:01:44.550> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
expect from the 19 well with regards to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.750 
expect from the 19 well with regards to
the<00:01:44.909> csa<00:01:45.510> heck<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.960> cee<00:01:46.229> standards<00:01:46.830> this

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
the csa heck and cee standards this

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.180 
the csa heck and cee standards this
helmet<00:01:48.210> performs<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.320> forty-nine<00:01:49.920> percent

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
helmet performs up to forty-nine percent

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.700 
helmet performs up to forty-nine percent
better<00:01:51.030> than<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.659> minimum<00:01:51.810> requirements<00:01:52.620> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
better than the minimum requirements of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.500 
better than the minimum requirements of
those<00:01:52.860> standards<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:53.580> from<00:01:54.030> an<00:01:54.150> impact

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
those standards so from an impact

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.350 
those standards so from an impact
standpoint<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.229> incredibly<00:01:55.710> protective

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
standpoint it's incredibly protective

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.969 
standpoint it's incredibly protective
but<00:01:57.360> wear<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.720> helmet<00:01:57.900> is<00:01:58.140> different<00:01:58.770> from

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
but wear this helmet is different from

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.580 
but wear this helmet is different from
anything<00:01:59.670> else<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.180> market<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.780> crush

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
anything else on the market is a crush

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.460 
anything else on the market is a crush
resistance<00:02:02.159> technology<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
resistance technology that we have the

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.350 
resistance technology that we have the
solid<00:02:04.710> state<00:02:05.040> construction<00:02:05.490> makes<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
solid state construction makes it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.619 
solid state construction makes it
incredibly<00:02:06.690> stiff<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:07.979> can't

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
incredibly stiff so you really can't

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.029 
incredibly stiff so you really can't
compress<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:10.019> squish<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.560> front-to-back

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
compress it or squish it front-to-back

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.489 
compress it or squish it front-to-back
side-to-side<00:02:12.079> so<00:02:13.079> it's<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.290> type<00:02:13.469> of

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:13.499 
side-to-side so it's a type of

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.020 
side-to-side so it's a type of
protection<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.489> nobody

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
protection that nobody

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.780 
protection that nobody
he<00:02:15.150> talks<00:02:15.390> about<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.800> see<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.730> know

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
he talks about you can see I you know

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.340 
he talks about you can see I you know
put<00:02:18.090> as<00:02:18.240> much<00:02:18.360> force<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
put as much force as I can and the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.260 
put as much force as I can and the
helmet<00:02:19.709> barely<00:02:20.100> closes<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.850> you've<00:02:20.970> got<00:02:21.000> this

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
helmet barely closes so you've got this

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.470 
helmet barely closes so you've got this
really<00:02:21.569> solid<00:02:22.140> state<00:02:23.180> protecting<00:02:24.180> your<00:02:24.330> head

designed<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.820> be<00:03:26.910> very<00:03:27.030> simple<00:03:27.650> players<00:03:28.650> just

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
designed to be very simple players just

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.970 
designed to be very simple players just
are<00:03:29.370> meant<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.380> find<00:03:31.380> their<00:03:31.500> setting<00:03:31.829> and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
are meant to just find their setting and

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.100 
are meant to just find their setting and
then<00:03:32.250> forget<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.640> pop<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.360> helmet<00:03:33.630> on<00:03:33.720> take<00:03:33.989> it

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
then forget it pop the helmet on take it

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.050 
then forget it pop the helmet on take it
off<00:03:34.200> no<00:03:34.500> fidgeting<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:35.250> any<00:03:35.459> type<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.730> fits

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
off no fidgeting with any type of fits

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.910 
off no fidgeting with any type of fits
that's<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.900> feedback<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.500> got<00:03:37.620> from<00:03:37.739> our

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
that's the feedback that we got from our

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.440 
that's the feedback that we got from our
pros<00:03:38.160> went<00:03:38.430> right<00:03:38.610> into<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.850> development<00:03:39.390> of

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
pros went right into the development of

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.970 
pros went right into the development of
this<00:03:39.570> helmet<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.170> was<00:03:40.500> designed<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.890> be

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
this helmet so it was designed to be

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.100 
this helmet so it was designed to be
simple<00:03:41.480> there's<00:03:42.480> really<00:03:42.660> no<00:03:42.900> width

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
simple there's really no width

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.240 
simple there's really no width
adjustment<00:03:43.530> those<00:03:43.769> that's<00:03:43.980> where<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.220> have

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
adjustment those that's where you have

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.940 
adjustment those that's where you have
to<00:03:44.400> go<00:03:44.670> through<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.090> different<00:03:45.720> size<00:03:46.470> ranges

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
to go through the different size ranges

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.349 
to go through the different size ranges
this<00:03:47.579> helmet<00:03:47.760> comes<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.150> five<00:03:48.329> different

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
this helmet comes in five different

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.319 
this helmet comes in five different
sizes<00:03:49.019> extra<00:03:49.410> small<00:03:49.739> through<00:03:49.950> extra-large

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
sizes extra small through extra-large

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.000 
sizes extra small through extra-large
yeah<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.600> mean<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:52.019> think<00:03:52.200> that's<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.859> great

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
yeah and I mean I think that's a great

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.229 
yeah and I mean I think that's a great
feature<00:03:53.280> too<00:03:53.579> because<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:53.910> mean<00:03:54.060> not<00:03:54.209> all

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
feature too because I mean not all

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.300 
feature too because I mean not all
helmets<00:03:54.600> out<00:03:54.870> they're<00:03:55.140> gonna<00:03:55.380> go<00:03:55.920> from<00:03:56.130> that

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
helmets out they're gonna go from that

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.569 
helmets out they're gonna go from that
access<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.090> XL<00:03:57.420> yeah<00:03:58.130> yeah<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.160> mean<00:03:59.400> and

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
access to the XL yeah yeah I mean and

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.580 
access to the XL yeah yeah I mean and
also<00:03:59.940> as<00:04:00.209> far<00:04:00.239> as<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.630> fitting<00:04:01.109> system<00:04:01.470> you

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
also as far as the fitting system you

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.410 
also as far as the fitting system you
know<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.709> don't<00:04:01.859> really<00:04:02.130> find<00:04:02.400> myself<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:03.390> know

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
know I don't really find myself you know

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.759 
know I don't really find myself you know
changing<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.930> size<00:04:04.109> of<00:04:04.230> my<00:04:04.290> helmet<00:04:04.620> at<00:04:04.680> all

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
changing the size of my helmet at all

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.699 
changing the size of my helmet at all
once<00:04:05.040> it's<00:04:05.190> set<00:04:05.400> exactly<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:07.049> then<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.470> mean

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
once it's set exactly and then I mean

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.610 
once it's set exactly and then I mean
the<00:04:08.040> look<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.519> guy<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:10.170> mean

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
the look of this guy and I mean

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.349 
the look of this guy and I mean
definitely<00:04:10.799> when<00:04:11.489> I'm<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:11.880> know<00:04:11.970> trying<00:04:12.000> on

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
definitely when I'm you know trying on

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.170 
definitely when I'm you know trying on
hasn't<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.930> low<00:04:13.200> profile<00:04:13.680> design<00:04:13.970> which<00:04:14.970> I

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
hasn't that low profile design which I

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.490 
hasn't that low profile design which I
mean<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.810> wouldn't<00:04:16.049> necessarily<00:04:16.169> expect

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
mean you wouldn't necessarily expect

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.199 
mean you wouldn't necessarily expect
from<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.039> protection<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.880> above<00:04:18.060> average

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
from the protection the above average

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.240 
from the protection the above average
protection<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:19.019> guy's<00:04:19.200> offering<00:04:19.739> right

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
protection of this guy's offering right

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.560 
protection of this guy's offering right
how<00:04:20.489> long<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.970> know<00:04:21.060> how<00:04:21.180> does<00:04:21.299> it'll<00:04:21.479> look

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
how long you know how does it'll look

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.360 
how long you know how does it'll look
kind<00:04:21.810> of

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
kind of

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.430 
kind of
today<00:04:22.580> going<00:04:22.820> over<00:04:23.060> well<00:04:23.360> low<00:04:23.540> profile<00:04:23.990> was<00:04:24.229> a

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
today going over well low profile was a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.310 
today going over well low profile was a
very<00:04:25.310> important<00:04:25.850> factor<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.720> went<00:04:26.990> into<00:04:27.139> the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
very important factor that went into the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.140 
very important factor that went into the
design<00:04:27.620> brief<00:04:27.860> we<00:04:28.460> really<00:04:28.790> want<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:28.970> maintain

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
design brief we really want to maintain

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.510 
design brief we really want to maintain
a<00:04:29.360> low<00:04:29.780> profile<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.590> mirror<00:04:30.889> test<00:04:31.100> is<00:04:31.310> so

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
a low profile the mirror test is so

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.310 
a low profile the mirror test is so
important<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.479> people<00:04:32.600> when<00:04:32.840> they<00:04:32.960> try<00:04:33.169> on<00:04:33.229> a

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
important to people when they try on a

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.860 
important to people when they try on a
helmet<00:04:33.620> so<00:04:33.740> we<00:04:33.860> didn't<00:04:34.070> want<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.310> have<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.030> you

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
helmet so we didn't want to have a you

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.320 
helmet so we didn't want to have a you
know<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.020> large<00:04:36.320> volume<00:04:37.010> helmet<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.699> we<00:04:38.060> wanted

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
know a large volume helmet and we wanted

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.670 
know a large volume helmet and we wanted
to<00:04:38.360> look<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.780> stay<00:04:38.960> consistent<00:04:39.169> with<00:04:39.650> our

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
to look to stay consistent with our

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.400 
to look to stay consistent with our
other<00:04:39.919> line<00:04:40.540> so<00:04:41.540> basically<00:04:42.169> with<00:04:42.380> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
other line so basically with the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.439 
other line so basically with the
introduction<00:04:43.040> of<00:04:43.130> this<00:04:43.280> helmet<00:04:43.669> we're<00:04:44.240> kind

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
introduction of this helmet we're kind

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.870 
introduction of this helmet we're kind
of<00:04:44.510> redefining<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:45.320> helmet<00:04:45.650> category<00:04:46.100> Z
