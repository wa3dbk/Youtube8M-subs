00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 I chose to teach you a panel 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.490
 made in very colorful stained glass varnish 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.400
 that I'm sure will be fine 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.099
 your room or not its the aisle 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.839
 suddenly in your room behind your bed 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.570
 decorating any way you want 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.220
 it is all done in stained glass then 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.400
 Let's get to work. 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.650
 the material will be on the site just you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 access the program's website and you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.099
 find the material ratio 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.099
 so we will start working now 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.550
 the first part of our work that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.559
 We're going to receive this raw piece. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.430
 will be a waterproofing with some 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.070
 Indian lacquer or any cheap house 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.680
 it will be is we'll go with a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.720
 brush with a brush after we go 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.809
 lynch with a sandpaper 220 for wood 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.059
 when it dries there about ten minutes 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 we will start the painting in the back 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.720
 of the panel 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.560
 we will work with the black ink of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.229
 Suvinil the water based tent is 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.690
 is applied with a 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.479
 foam is necessary to give him two to 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.119
 three brothers to close with already placed 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.780
 which will be guaranteed to the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.090
 premium 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.700
 we move to the front and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.610
 we apply snow white also from 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.289
 suvinil the coral a water bar tent 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 preferably a good fifth 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.649
 We give two to three brothers to close 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.300
 In color 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.599
 We'll start doing the work later. 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.179
 decorative 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:45.300
 so I'll choose the middle of the panel and 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.940
 I'll start applying a brush that goes 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.030
 be referenced there on the website for you 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:57.360
 Let's start with the clearest 30 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:01.459
 applying a certain tone and inspiring more 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.459
 always from the middle to the ends 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:16.910
 then the green will join the red 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.270
 So that we can give more beauty to this 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.410
 actually call I call this piece of 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.660
 headdress 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.270
 Why do you see that the works 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.180
 indigenous peoples are very colorful and 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.300
 very beautiful and they are not afraid of 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.410
 mix live the green with red with 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.590
 one blue they work with colors 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.209
 colored primary and the work 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.670
 it's perfect 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.670
 I'll do a touch-up now with the green 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.459
 taking the excess closing well is mine 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.819
 I will try to give a 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.209
 cleaned up if any 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.530
 I get something now, I come with 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:10.000
 brown another brush for brown 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.000
 brown will go into the right green government 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.110
 that this is the work here beautiful 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.349
 cracked as if it would break if 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.870
 he lay on the black varnish 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:45.120
 so I already worked with the brownie 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.030
 do that job of fixing it right 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.150
 to 30 not get stuck 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.970
 see that it is a dilution of colors one 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.590
 Mix color back with yellow 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:04.730
 together with a certain frog we will now make a 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.730
 second a second painting symbol 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.430
 to be able to complete our put in 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.430
 stained glass 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.280
 so I see that mixing the yellow 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.000
 with red I have shape in orange tone 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.000
 very beautiful 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.419
 the second part of the work is already 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.030
 ready 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.340
 It was already all colored now I go 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:45.490
 come in with black stained glass in the middle 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.930
 to form the center of the koka father I do not 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.160
 I'm going to come in with black 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.289
 I'm going to spill black, I'm not going 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.120
 pinch black with more other colors 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:02.590
 I'm going to spill black 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.590
 and I will distribute in all colors 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.600
 the brushstrokes are short 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.730
 If they are long they will be Priscilla. 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.550
 brush strokes without too much force 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:28.650
 about the government and the panel because 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.650
 I want a pint in the office, it goes out 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.800
 right then I try to distribute this 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.540
 black 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.389
 so that it goes into all 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.389
 colors but in an unequal way 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:50.460
 a final part of this work I go 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:54.420
 enter a little bit of yellow but 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.660
 no stained glass is the stained glass enamel it 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:01.110
 over the stained glass and that 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.390
 a little it wrinkles and when they are that 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.390
 it does a very beautiful job when 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.690
 you are applying you have the sensation 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:13.110
 and you make up for mistake but there is no beauty 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.950
 will be just in this error 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.220
 from that crack and lament and there 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.590
 I do that there is will 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:26.220
 Our work is finished. 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:29.460
 a panel that I'm sure you will 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.950
 I like to decorate your house and 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.710
 easy to see I did not even spend 15 minutes 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.490
 of time of this decorative part you 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.490
 can also do 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.699
 this was our first lesson our 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:51.430
 First job of the week let's do 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:55.240
 a second job in a box and mdf 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.810
 decorated with deco and rhinestones and the 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.810
 photo will be
