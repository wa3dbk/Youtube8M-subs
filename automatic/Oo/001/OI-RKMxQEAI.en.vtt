 good afternoon everyone my name is 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.730
 luciano bostal I am Argentine and I wanted 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.410
 tell you my experience about 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.519
 investment course of the stock exchange 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.469
 values of Juan Dominguez 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.310
 I spent a lot of time looking for a course 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.230
 quality about it 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.000
 I not find it anywhere until 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.090
 and just with a testimony equal to 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.669
 this what made me know him to play and 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.230
 I did it first before buying the 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.779
 course 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.460
 acquire the free 30-day course 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.950
 gives the also on the web page 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.140
 with the course I realized that while 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.199
 there was some actions and 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.420
 investments is very far from really 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.640
 invest correctly in the stock market 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.280
 and that's what I decided me 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.650
 Acquire the full course good the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.040
 full course really surprised me 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.040
 why 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.970
 you never know what you can get 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.730
 namely a name that has already more than 10 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.500
 years of experience to the stock market and that's 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 how good it is I think the course is 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.630
 Excellent 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.150
 John continuously he is always in 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.939
 skype and delivery all doubts and I 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.189
 I think that is the most important thing of the course 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.520
 and advisory organization that I think 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.149
 is 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.250
 more than a guarantee that the course 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.469
 it's worth it and you're going to learn 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.000
 a lot much with him 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.000
 the course I think is very complete 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.280
 that tells you how to use the graphics 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.470
 technical indicators formulas and others 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.710
 things like to know what actions 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.210
 buy and what shares out there one has 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.080
 in mind that they can rise 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.160
 but they really are not convenient 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.700
 obviously that one learns a lot with the 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.290
 course and I think obviously what 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.320
 I recommend 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.240
 others is grateful the john for 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.090
 for this opportunity that gives me to 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.440
 offer you the course and nothing else 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.780

 experience about that and that obviously 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.430
