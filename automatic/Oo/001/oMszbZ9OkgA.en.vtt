00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.790 
will get a lot of points and be able to
bring<00:02:11.180> out<00:02:11.330> more<00:02:11.480> units<00:02:11.840> which<00:02:12.590> won't

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
bring out more units which won't

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.740 
bring out more units which won't
necessarily<00:02:12.950> make<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.580> win<00:02:13.970> especially<00:02:14.450> if

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
necessarily make you win especially if

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.530 
necessarily make you win especially if
you're<00:02:14.900> being<00:02:15.130> stupid<00:02:16.130> with<00:02:16.790> your<00:02:16.940> units<00:02:17.269> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
you're being stupid with your units and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.509 
you're being stupid with your units and
you're<00:02:17.660> just<00:02:17.720> rushing<00:02:17.930> them<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.500> think<00:02:19.400> see

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
you're just rushing them in I think see

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.699 
you're just rushing them in I think see
right<00:02:19.640> here<00:02:19.760> that's<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.930> artillery<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.620> we

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
right here that's the artillery that we

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.500 
right here that's the artillery that we
can't<00:02:21.920> see<00:02:22.220> but<00:02:22.610> we<00:02:22.700> can<00:02:22.730> see<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.060> artillery

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
can't see but we can see the artillery

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.470 
can't see but we can see the artillery
coming<00:02:23.930> out<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.379> trees<00:02:24.910> because<00:02:25.910> right

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
coming out of the trees because right

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.089 
coming out of the trees because right
from<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.989> start<00:02:27.049> of<00:02:27.380> this<00:02:27.440> match<00:02:27.739> they

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
from the start of this match they

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.850 
from the start of this match they
started<00:02:28.430> our<00:02:28.549> tailoring<00:02:29.260> everywhere<00:02:30.260> all

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
started our tailoring everywhere all

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.770 
started our tailoring everywhere all
over<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.160> place<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.549> think<00:02:32.299> they<00:02:32.390> got<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.540> couple

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
over the place I think they got a couple

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.860 
over the place I think they got a couple
of<00:02:32.930> our<00:02:33.019> units<00:02:33.319> but<00:02:34.239> shooting<00:02:35.239> right<00:02:35.569> from<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
of our units but shooting right from the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.330 
of our units but shooting right from the
bat<00:02:36.019> like<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.430> isn't<00:02:37.430> always<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.720> good<00:02:38.780> idea

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
bat like that isn't always a good idea

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.600 
bat like that isn't always a good idea
because<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:41.000> wastes<00:02:41.360> their<00:02:41.510> ammo<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.610> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
because it wastes their ammo and the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.610 
because it wastes their ammo and the
farther<00:02:43.880> artillery<00:02:44.480> unit<00:02:44.720> away<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.200> less

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
farther artillery unit away the less

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.740 
farther artillery unit away the less
likely<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.670> hit<00:02:47.090> because<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.599> has<00:02:47.720> a

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
likely it is to hit because it has a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.000 
likely it is to hit because it has a
really<00:02:48.260> broad<00:02:49.150> range<00:02:50.150> if<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:50.810> really<00:02:51.049> far<00:02:54.010> so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
really broad range if it's really far so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.920 
really broad range if it's really far so
their<00:02:55.160> accuracy<00:02:55.549> is<00:02:55.880> based<00:02:56.209> on<00:02:56.480> how<00:02:56.690> close

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
their accuracy is based on how close

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.690 
their accuracy is based on how close
they<00:02:57.290> are<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.590> something<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.099> they'll<00:02:58.549> have<00:02:58.670> a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
they are to something and they'll have a

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.660 
they are to something and they'll have a
little<00:02:59.090> circular<00:02:59.359> pattern<00:02:59.959> that<00:03:00.109> will<00:03:00.230> show

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
little circular pattern that will show

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.789 
little circular pattern that will show
and<00:03:01.670> if<00:03:02.150> you're<00:03:02.299> shooting<00:03:02.510> from<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.560> first

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
and if you're shooting from the first

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.940 
and if you're shooting from the first
area<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:05.030> their<00:03:05.180> first<00:03:05.450> area<00:03:05.870> it's<00:03:06.410> like

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
area to their first area it's like

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.890 
area to their first area it's like
really<00:03:07.340> really<00:03:07.670> really<00:03:08.030> huge<00:03:08.329> area<00:03:08.780> that

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
really really really huge area that

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.660 
really really really huge area that
they're<00:03:08.959> going<00:03:09.109> to<00:03:09.170> hit<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:10.100> its<00:03:10.250> really

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
they're going to hit and its really

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.479 
they're going to hit and its really
inaccurate<00:03:11.500> but<00:03:12.500> uh<00:03:12.560> I'm<00:03:13.069> moving<00:03:13.370> all<00:03:13.459> my

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
inaccurate but uh I'm moving all my

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.449 
inaccurate but uh I'm moving all my
units<00:03:14.329> of<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.569> Gulf<00:03:14.780> right<00:03:15.079> here<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.560> I'm

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
units of the Gulf right here and I'm

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.160 
units of the Gulf right here and I'm
kind<00:03:16.670> of<00:03:16.730> skipping<00:03:17.000> around<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.690> gameplay

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
kind of skipping around and gameplay

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.840 
kind of skipping around and gameplay
here<00:03:18.410> because<00:03:18.829> this<00:03:19.190> was<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.880> 30<00:03:20.510> minute<00:03:20.840> match

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
here because this was a 30 minute match

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.340 
here because this was a 30 minute match
I'm<00:03:22.850> not<00:03:23.269> sure<00:03:23.329> how<00:03:23.569> many<00:03:23.630> points<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.139> was<00:03:24.230> up

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
I'm not sure how many points it was up

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.020 
I'm not sure how many points it was up
to<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.500> think<00:03:24.590> or<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.859> 5,000<00:03:25.519> playing<00:03:25.700> game

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
to I think or the 5,000 playing game

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.910 
to I think or the 5,000 playing game
meaning<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.690> first<00:03:26.870> team<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.109> 5,000<00:03:27.799> points

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
meaning the first team to 5,000 points

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.559 
meaning the first team to 5,000 points
wins<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.209> points<00:03:29.510> are<00:03:29.660> determined<00:03:30.200> by

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
wins and the points are determined by

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.900 
wins and the points are determined by
kills<00:03:32.569> and<00:03:32.930> deaths<00:03:33.310> at<00:03:34.310> least<00:03:34.489> in<00:03:34.639> this<00:03:34.700> mode

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
kills and deaths at least in this mode

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.980 
kills and deaths at least in this mode
there<00:03:35.540> are<00:03:35.630> other<00:03:35.810> modes

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
there are other modes

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.600 
there are other modes
not<00:03:37.560> sure<00:03:37.680> if<00:03:37.740> there's<00:03:37.890> element<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.400> beta

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
not sure if there's element in the beta

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.040 
not sure if there's element in the beta
but<00:03:38.940> there<00:03:39.090> are<00:03:39.210> other<00:03:39.390> mounts<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.840> actual

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
but there are other mounts in the actual

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.680 
but there are other mounts in the actual
game<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.550> am<00:03:41.700> taking<00:03:41.940> my<00:03:42.150> helicopters

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
game and I am taking my helicopters

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.810 
game and I am taking my helicopters
around<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.200> back<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.680> try<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.920> cripple

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
around to the back to try to cripple

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.980 
around to the back to try to cripple
their<00:03:44.940> artillery<00:03:45.920> which<00:03:46.920> kind<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.940> works<00:03:48.360> but

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
their artillery which kind of works but

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.680 
their artillery which kind of works but
I<00:03:49.020> have<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.290> black<00:03:49.830> hawks<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.820> cobras<00:03:51.480> and

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
I have a black hawks and cobras and

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.480 
I have a black hawks and cobras and
Blackhawks<00:03:54.690> don't<00:03:54.990> really<00:03:55.230> have<00:03:55.440> any<00:03:55.920> weapons

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
Blackhawks don't really have any weapons

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.550 
Blackhawks don't really have any weapons
there's<00:03:56.970> transport<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.810> am<00:03:57.960> anti-tank

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
there's transport and I am anti-tank

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.400 
there's transport and I am anti-tank
infantry<00:03:59.490> Avenue<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.930> while<00:04:01.110> that's<00:04:01.260> going

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
infantry Avenue and while that's going

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.890 
infantry Avenue and while that's going
on<00:04:01.940> one<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.030> their<00:04:03.150> guys<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.480> trying<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.780> come

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
on one of their guys is trying to come

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.720 
on one of their guys is trying to come
down<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.170> middle<00:04:04.350> push<00:04:04.950> into<00:04:05.130> our<00:04:05.340> Delta

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
down the middle push into our Delta

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.040 
down the middle push into our Delta
because<00:04:06.180> it's<00:04:06.300> Delta<00:04:06.600> is<00:04:06.660> one<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.930> highest

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
because it's Delta is one of the highest

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.260 
because it's Delta is one of the highest

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
points and they try to take it the whole

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.300 
points and they try to take it the whole

around the map which is very nice I love
hiding<00:04:23.580> coventry<00:04:24.060> on<00:04:24.150> trees<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:25.200> very<00:04:25.320> very

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
hiding coventry on trees it's very very

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.190 
hiding coventry on trees it's very very
very<00:04:25.950> very<00:04:26.130> useful

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
very very useful

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.790 
very very useful
but<00:04:28.880> infantry<00:04:29.880> is<00:04:30.150> very<00:04:30.540> weak<00:04:30.810> like<00:04:31.530> these

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
but infantry is very weak like these

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.760 
but infantry is very weak like these
helicopters<00:04:32.210> helicopters<00:04:33.210> are<00:04:33.810> very<00:04:34.050> very

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
strong they're very weak and they can go

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.100 
strong they're very weak and they can go
down<00:04:36.990> in<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:38.370> couple<00:04:38.760> shots<00:04:38.990> thankfully<00:04:39.990> these

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
down in a couple shots thankfully these

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.570 
down in a couple shots thankfully these
are<00:04:40.230> Blackhawks<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.010> they<00:04:41.280> don't<00:04:41.430> really

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580

have<00:04:41.850> any<00:04:42.060> anti-air<00:04:42.600> there<00:04:43.250> so<00:04:44.250> I'm<00:04:44.310> just

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
have any anti-air there so I'm just

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.850 
have any anti-air there so I'm just
landing<00:04:44.820> them<00:04:44.970> next<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.810> their<00:04:45.990> artillery

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
overall really tactical game that is

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.500 
overall really tactical game that is
really<00:05:14.950> similar<00:05:15.220> to<00:05:15.430> ruin<00:05:15.820> if<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.030> play<00:05:16.210> ruse

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
really similar to ruin if you play ruse

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.340 
really similar to ruin if you play ruse
by<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:16.900> same<00:05:17.140> time

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900 
hard to protect them and it always is

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.080 
hard to protect them and it always is
pretty<00:07:11.650> depressing<00:07:12.100> when<00:07:12.610> they<00:07:12.730> get<00:07:12.880> hit<00:07:13.000> an
