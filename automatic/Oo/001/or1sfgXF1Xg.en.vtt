00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 the appearing in this farce 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.830
 stories are completely conceived and 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.960
 do not correspond to real backgrounds 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.849
 for legal reasons said that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.860
 all figures that do not appear theirs 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.360
 relate to the real person and you 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.070
 that's why it's representative of everything 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.660
 list of their representation 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.190
 should still be random 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.270
 Similarities occur 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.270
 unfounded conjecture 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.370
 the tv does not care if 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.390
 you there on it was what are you doing to me times 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.010
 still nothing at all 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.720
 you just can not seem to do it 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.580
 to press this button correctly 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.070
 while I have you before him with edding 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.900
 marked but I'm always guilty 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.239
 even with the pumping bass last 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.620
 eight pumps 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.620
 Well it was that the street party 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:17.240
 kilo heavy music things ordered profi 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.700
 equipment for large halls no faith 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.140
 Continue to do that with the TV 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.479
 A crane made the stove out to me 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.060
 you have never forgotten him because you 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.850
 it always checks several times before 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.229
 The mother of the porcelain box 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.829
 your father on monday jammer I know 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.840

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.659
 I mean we have to save in too 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:53.329
 my broken but we wanted to 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:55.369
 other corners start to save or where 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.890
 he can get you 10 right because 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.579
 Nail fungus was always just about it 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.950
 black and right because it is a disease 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.140
 is 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.830
 I have to soak and try it 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.360
 Cut the granny for the number of times 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.470
 just try the high 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.470
 nail care 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.400
 the cost or cut you come 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.989
 or granny the nail scissors you have is 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.970
 far too weak for these thick ones 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.610
 hornberger call better the nail salons 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.080
 As you all advise Kurth advises that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:43.709
 also or at least something good 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:48.630
 water advised we were even on the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:03:03.090
 Heating Wherever we are always on we have 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:03:05.040
 the terrace of a heating this 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.470
 crackling noises and this biting 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.940
 Hairy stink when moth after me 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.019
 she drove out of my canopy 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.390
 Miserable in the uv lamp perish 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.420
 Oh, you're traveling on your dream as well 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.130

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.319

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.120
 insect the halloren answer must die 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.120
 and yes i know i was not quite there yet 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.170
 plucking so well does not help a week mischief 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.880
 That's why I'll never keep a garden 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.230
 that is growing someday it is like this 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.799
 that it stops growing or not 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.799
 bends 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.590
 there is income and I have 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.599

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.599
 not a lot of paranoia you know that 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:16.260
 you do not say standing without question you see 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.780
 you when you are up you can see that 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.000
 You do not even see him 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:27.300
 coffee mug from me men is that 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.380
 Company could do your water bottle 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:36.090
 But I do not have in every corner 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.530
 I do not go up a bit , I think 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.610
 I'll tell you what I'm going to do and above 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.750
 look forward but not like one 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.050
 stupid wild against it 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:47.880
 but I do not know anything here 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.320
 fold it again, yes I can 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.270
 Reasonably run and get the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.830
 physicist 2 cm therefore I do not look 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:01.229
 still shivering, those are calling down 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.880
 dresden must not listen to him 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.180
 have to 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.560
 living i was eating yes yes 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.560
 We have the same one here 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.560
 yogurt 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:26.870
 I do not think it's still called 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:30.760
 what does that look like robbie me 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:36.200
 So pizza I buy with one 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:41.330
 What is chappi dog food like so many 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.430

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.450
 it's so hot yet and I can not but 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.820
 do not eat yet 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.900
 then we have to go to the neighbors 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.900
 pour the flowers 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.030
 yes we are all home you have them 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.040
 you said that no 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.470
 another neighbor takes care of it 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.420
 or she just wants to profile herself 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.440
 so that cares properly for others 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.150
 To tell people you can take a picture of him 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.840
 flowers 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.820
 if you have yours and lindsay yes 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.110
 as proof that we snooped around 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.390
 have already realized 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.800
 Also , my stomach is annoying the case 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.760
 I do not like to move up too much 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.770
 to go shopping 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:28.010
 that's not working themselves are 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.680
 then it hurts as well that is 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.350
 no work this is not work 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.820
 this is not work that is not 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.720
 work on what measures itself in you 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.720
 work really nice 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.460
 that is stupid drudgery that the 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.650
 Body destroys you as your own 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.140
 something should not be recognized 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.690
 It is desirable that I will never do that 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.100
 in mechanical physical sense 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.290
 every kind of kinetic energy 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.990
 talking or expending work itself 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.000
 Think if I 'm here with my hand 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.950
 to choose air because we are too warm 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.450
 that already work that is the work in 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.450
 my standards yes 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.750

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.540

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.310

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.310

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:28.550

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.800
