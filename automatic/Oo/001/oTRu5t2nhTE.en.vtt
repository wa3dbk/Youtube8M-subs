00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.170
 Sanych 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.400
 today I will tell you what to do 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.269
 the wood chips that you insisted on 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.920
 your product from the rings for example like 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.570
 do I have brandy there yet 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.760
 some other settings and for example you 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.949
 here on insisted yes and where to put it 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.789
 think well, what did you do with your 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.789

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:44.769

 throw out and it will be useful to us even I 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.670
 I think that if you take moonshine 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.850
 you also probably do there, but 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.729

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.729
 further so here friends this sliver can 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.789

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.009
 chips for smoking here this chips 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.750
