robious<00:00:10.530> 5991<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.150> map<00:00:12.360> was<00:00:12.540> heavily

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
robious 5991 now this map was heavily

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.860 
robious 5991 now this map was heavily
inspired<00:00:13.080> by<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.799> map<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:14.549> crysis<00:00:15.389> 3<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.750> was

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
inspired by the map on crysis 3 that was

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.540 
inspired by the map on crysis 3 that was
called<00:00:16.139> airport<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.250> see<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> lot<00:00:17.520> of

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
called airport so you can see a lot of

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.650 
called airport so you can see a lot of
similarities<00:00:18.090> there<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.390> can<00:00:18.510> see<00:00:18.630> that

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
similarities there and you can see that

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.480 
similarities there and you can see that
he<00:00:18.960> has<00:00:18.990> actually<00:00:19.230> taken<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.830> game<00:00:20.310> mode

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
he has actually taken the game mode

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.950 
he has actually taken the game mode
which<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.029> hunter<00:00:21.359> game<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:21.689> i<00:00:21.720> believe

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
which is the hunter game what i believe

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080 
which is the hunter game what i believe
it's<00:00:22.109> called<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.529> crysis<00:00:23.070> 3<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.430> he<00:00:23.970> is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it's called in for crysis 3 and he is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.660 
it's called in for crysis 3 and he is
molded<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.900> into<00:00:25.289> halo<00:00:25.529> 4<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.160> essentially

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
molded here into halo 4 so essentially

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.099

I<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:35.100> did<00:00:35.219> enjoy<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> course<00:00:36.540> this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I really did enjoy it and of course this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.750 
I really did enjoy it and of course this
is<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> crashed<00:00:37.440> airplane<00:00:37.890> now<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.250> first<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
is a crashed airplane now at first you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.130 
is a crashed airplane now at first you
might<00:00:38.879> think<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.300> generic<00:00:39.660> concept

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
might think that's a generic concept

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.810 
might think that's a generic concept
however<00:00:40.410> he<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.649> taking<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.190> concept<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
however he is taking this concept and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.240 
however he is taking this concept and
crafted<00:00:42.270> into<00:00:42.600> something<00:00:43.040> magnificent<00:00:44.040> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
crafted into something magnificent I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.100 
crafted into something magnificent I
absolutely<00:00:45.000> love<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.300> map<00:00:45.480> especially<00:00:45.899> for

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
absolutely love this map especially for

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.139 
absolutely love this map especially for
the<00:00:46.170> fact<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.890> ravine<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> at

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the fact that it is on ravine and at

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.549 
the fact that it is on ravine and at
first<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.570> would<00:00:48.629> think<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.870> ravine<00:00:49.289> maps

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
first you would think that ravine maps

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
first you would think that ravine maps
like<00:00:49.829> they<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:50.460> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.940> feel<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> same<00:00:51.539> but

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
like they all kind of feel the same but

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.000 
like they all kind of feel the same but
not<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.079> map<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:52.649> complex

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
not this map it's very complex

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
not this map it's very complex
especially<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.820> being<00:00:54.120> map<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.480> mean<00:00:54.629> there's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
especially for being map I mean there's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360 
especially for being map I mean there's
so<00:00:54.989> many<00:00:55.079> structures<00:00:55.620> there's<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.219> lot<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
so many structures there's a lot of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.680 
so many structures there's a lot of
depth<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.850> there's<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> lot<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.239> places<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
depth to it there's a lot of places to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.479 
depth to it there's a lot of places to
go<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.050> he's<00:00:58.710> done<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> very<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.190> job<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
go and he's done a very good job of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.010 
go and he's done a very good job of
defining<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.030> holed<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> does<00:01:00.809> play

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
defining is holed out so it does play

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.439 
defining is holed out so it does play
very<00:01:01.440> very<00:01:01.949> well<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.460> absolutely<00:01:02.640> love<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
very very well and I absolutely love the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
very very well and I absolutely love the
game<00:01:03.600> plan<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.899> mountain<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.290> course<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
game plan this mountain of course it is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.679 
game plan this mountain of course it is
a<00:01:04.920> crash<00:01:05.220> plane<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.670> said<00:01:05.850> earlier<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
a crash plane as I said earlier so you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.060 
a crash plane as I said earlier so you
can<00:01:06.780> imagine<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.290> go<00:01:07.409> inside<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.830> crash

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
can imagine you can go inside this crash

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.410 
can imagine you can go inside this crash
plane<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.670> see<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> believe<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.299> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
plane you can see I believe this is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.149 
plane you can see I believe this is
called<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.630> fuselage<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.560> don't<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.799> main

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
called the fuselage I don't know main

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.190 
called the fuselage I don't know main
section<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.729> play<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> big<00:01:12.119> tube<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.020> an

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
section to play in a big tube I'm not an

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.050 
section to play in a big tube I'm not an
airplane<00:01:13.560> specialist<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.280> uh<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.939> can

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
airplane specialist but uh you can

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.310 
airplane specialist but uh you can
actually<00:01:15.180> go<00:01:15.390> inside<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> course<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
actually go inside of it of course and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.300 
actually go inside of it of course and
it<00:01:16.439> offers<00:01:16.710> some<00:01:16.830> pretty<00:01:17.009> cool<00:01:17.100> gameplay

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it offers some pretty cool gameplay

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
it offers some pretty cool gameplay
because<00:01:17.490> you've<00:01:17.700> got<00:01:17.790> these<00:01:17.909> two<00:01:18.150> long<00:01:18.390> sight

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
because you've got these two long sight

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.300 
because you've got these two long sight
lines<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> broken<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.890> by<00:01:20.040> hump

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
lines and it's kind of broken up by hump

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.620 
lines and it's kind of broken up by hump
in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> middle<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.820> there's<00:01:21.000> some<00:01:21.180> crates

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
in the middle and there's some crates

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
in the middle and there's some crates
blocking<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:22.920> he's

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
blocking up and you can see here he's

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.980 
blocking up and you can see here he's
also<00:01:23.130> used<00:01:23.430> containers<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.150> cool<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
also used containers for cool and like a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.200 
also used containers for cool and like a
nice<00:01:25.320> cool<00:01:25.650> dynamic<00:01:26.130> way<00:01:26.280> which<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.060> really

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
nice cool dynamic way which I really

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.910 
nice cool dynamic way which I really
liked<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.509> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.659> an<00:01:27.780> exit<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.439> broken

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
liked it's kind of an exit to the broken

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.280 
liked it's kind of an exit to the broken
saya<00:01:29.250> center<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> plane<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.270> whatever<00:01:30.509> so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
saya center of the plane or whatever so

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.240 
saya center of the plane or whatever so
we're<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> show<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> some<00:01:31.860> gameplay<00:01:32.220> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
we're going to show you some gameplay of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
we're going to show you some gameplay of
course<00:01:32.549> which<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.689> i<00:01:33.840> said<00:01:33.990> earlier<00:01:34.049> i

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
course which I as i said earlier i

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.780 
course which I as i said earlier i
absolutely<00:01:34.740> love<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> gameplay<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.610> map

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
absolutely love the gameplay on this map

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.780 
absolutely love the gameplay on this map
and<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> course<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.500> hit<00:01:37.790> flood

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and of course it is one hit flood

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.670 
and of course it is one hit flood
however<00:01:39.270> i<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.110> works<00:01:40.259> well<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
however i think it works well on this

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.140 
however i think it works well on this
map<00:01:40.829> normally<00:01:41.189> i'm<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> huge<00:01:41.579> fan<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> one

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
map normally i'm not a huge fan of one

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.580 
map normally i'm not a huge fan of one
hit<00:01:42.299> flood<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.750> i<00:01:42.780> did<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> way<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
hit flood but i did like the way it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.620 
hit flood but i did like the way it
played<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.070> map<00:01:44.299> which<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.450> very

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
played out on this map which is very

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.539 
played out on this map which is very
rare<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.439> very<00:01:46.560> difficult<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.280> pull<00:01:47.460> that

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
rare it's very difficult to pull that

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.190 
rare it's very difficult to pull that
off<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.970> he's<00:01:48.149> done<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> very<00:01:48.720> nice<00:01:48.930> job<00:01:49.020> of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
off and he's done a very nice job of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.080 
off and he's done a very nice job of
doing<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.670> i'm<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
doing so so you can see here i'm kind of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.840 
doing so so you can see here i'm kind of
using<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> plane<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.530> run<00:01:52.740> my<00:01:53.100> course<00:01:53.430> towards

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
using the plane to run my course towards

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.789 
using the plane to run my course towards
the<00:01:53.970> other<00:01:54.270> section<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> map<00:01:54.869> which<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.710> is

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the other section of the map which it is

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.289 
the other section of the map which it is
an<00:01:55.950> effective<00:01:56.280> route<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:56.640> keep<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:56.969> mind<00:01:57.000> that

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
an effective route but keep in mind that

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.940 
an effective route but keep in mind that
it's<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> risk<00:01:57.899> versus<00:01:58.229> reward<00:01:58.350> concept

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
it's the risk versus reward concept

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.840 
it's the risk versus reward concept
because<00:01:59.130> you're<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.369> top<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.700> plane

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
because you're on top of the plane

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.219 
because you're on top of the plane
you're<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.270> exposed<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.810> flood<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.170> they

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you're very exposed to flood and they

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.109 
you're very exposed to flood and they
spot<00:02:01.439> all<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.619> way<00:02:01.799> around<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.939> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
spot all the way around you and you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.730 
spot all the way around you and you
can't<00:02:03.329> really<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:03.540> down<00:02:03.810> below<00:02:03.960> well<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.469> can

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
can't really see down below well you can

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.380 
can't really see down below well you can
but<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.950> can't<00:02:05.189> see<00:02:05.340> directly<00:02:05.729> below<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
but you can't see directly below you and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.449 
but you can't see directly below you and
they<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.840> climb<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> plane<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> kind

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
they can climb up so the plane is a kind

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.469 
they can climb up so the plane is a kind
of<00:02:08.550> an<00:02:08.670> effective<00:02:09.000> way<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.119> getting<00:02:09.390> around

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
of an effective way of getting around

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.500 
of an effective way of getting around
however<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.319> infected<00:02:10.619> very<00:02:11.039> easily

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
however you can be infected very easily

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
however you can be infected very easily
so<00:02:12.510> my

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so my

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.870 
so my
session<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.220> find<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.550> place<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
session is that you find a place to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.120 
session is that you find a place to
hunker<00:02:15.030> down<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:16.200> personally<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.950> this

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
hunker down and I personally like this

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.710 
hunker down and I personally like this
kind<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.459> room<00:02:17.730> over<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:18.060> since<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.630> only

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
kind of room over here since you only

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.210 
kind of room over here since you only
need<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> worry<00:02:19.140> about<00:02:19.260> directly<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:19.980> front<00:02:20.040> of

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
need to worry about directly in front of

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.430 
need to worry about directly in front of
you<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.490> behind<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.000> what<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.840> might<00:02:22.050> sound

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
you and behind you what you might sound

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.140 
you and behind you what you might sound
like<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.709> lot<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.670> two<00:02:23.819> people<00:02:23.970> in

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
like a lot but if you have two people in

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.280 
like a lot but if you have two people in
here<00:02:24.240> which<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> don't<00:02:24.870> anymore

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
here which you can see I don't anymore

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.260 
here which you can see I don't anymore
um<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.459> actually<00:02:26.670> hold<00:02:26.760> down<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.000> area

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
um you can actually hold down this area

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.940 
um you can actually hold down this area
pretty<00:02:27.390> effectively<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.020> you'll<00:02:28.590> see<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:28.860> I

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
pretty effectively so you'll see that I

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.920 
pretty effectively so you'll see that I
do<00:02:29.010> get<00:02:29.220> quite<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.430> few<00:02:29.490> kills<00:02:29.819> here<00:02:30.030> but<00:02:30.720> soon

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
do get quite a few kills here but soon

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.479 
do get quite a few kills here but soon
as<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.170> flood<00:02:31.530> start<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.860> get<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> jump<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.310> us

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
as the flood start to get a jump on us

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.710 
as the flood start to get a jump on us
and<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:32.700> start<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.090> realize<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.630> we're

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
and they start to I realize that we're

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.420 
and they start to I realize that we're
up<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.620> go<00:02:34.709> down<00:02:34.890> pretty<00:02:35.100> quickly<00:02:35.280> so

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
up here we go down pretty quickly so

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.830 
up here we go down pretty quickly so
it's<00:02:35.580> not<00:02:35.670> overpowering<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.390> at<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.660> same

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
it's not overpowering but at the same

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.660 
it's not overpowering but at the same
time<00:02:37.020> it's<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.709> fun<00:02:37.860> place<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.100> hold<00:02:38.340> out<00:02:38.489> I

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
time it's just a fun place to hold out I

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.340 
time it's just a fun place to hold out I
believe<00:02:39.300> there's<00:02:39.450> also<00:02:39.600> another<00:02:39.720> hold<00:02:40.080> out<00:02:40.200> at

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
believe there's also another hold out at

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.660 
believe there's also another hold out at
the<00:02:40.470> north<00:02:40.830> side<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.130> guess<00:02:41.340> I'll<00:02:41.489> actually

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the north side I guess I'll actually

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.699 
the north side I guess I'll actually
there<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.120> no<00:02:42.270> north-south<00:02:42.720> or<00:02:42.870> whatever<00:02:43.080> but

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
there is no north-south or whatever but

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.110 
there is no north-south or whatever but
at<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> front<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> plane<00:02:44.580> where<00:02:44.970> it's

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
at the front of the plane where it's

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.540 
at the front of the plane where it's
like<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.390> front<00:02:45.690> kind<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> cockpit<00:02:46.650> there's

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
like the front kind of a cockpit there's

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.710 
like the front kind of a cockpit there's
a<00:02:47.610> nice<00:02:47.700> place<00:02:47.940> called<00:02:48.150> out<00:02:48.239> over<00:02:48.420> there<00:02:48.540> too

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
a nice place called out over there too

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.180 
a nice place called out over there too
so<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.140> mean<00:02:49.410> there's<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> lot<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.739> places<00:02:49.920> that

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
so I mean there's a lot of places that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.580 
so I mean there's a lot of places that
you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.750> defend<00:02:51.750> there's<00:02:52.170> different<00:02:52.440> places

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
you can defend there's different places

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.750 
you can defend there's different places
you<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.830> go<00:02:52.860> obviously<00:02:53.130> because<00:02:53.489> math<00:02:53.730> is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
you can go obviously because math is

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.130 
you can go obviously because math is
very<00:02:54.000> complex<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:54.600> all<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.080> just

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
very complex but all in all it just

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.350 
very complex but all in all it just
plays<00:02:55.440> absolutely<00:02:56.070> amazing<00:02:56.459> i<00:02:56.580> love<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:57.180> map
