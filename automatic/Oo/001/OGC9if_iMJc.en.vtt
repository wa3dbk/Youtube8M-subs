00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
we believe technology is at its very

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.120 
we believe technology is at its very
best<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.859> it's<00:00:08.100> invisible

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
best and it's invisible

best and it's invisible
when<00:00:10.670> you're<00:00:10.820> conscious<00:00:11.240> only<00:00:11.360> of<00:00:11.660> what

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
when you're conscious only of what

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.200 
when you're conscious only of what
you're<00:00:11.990> doing<00:00:12.340> not<00:00:13.340> the<00:00:13.520> device<00:00:13.760> you're<00:00:13.940> doing

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
you're doing not the device you're doing

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.620 
you're doing not the device you're doing
it<00:00:14.300> with<00:00:14.480> an<00:00:15.550> iPad<00:00:16.550> is<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.210> perfect

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
it with an iPad is the perfect

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.260 
it with an iPad is the perfect
expression<00:00:17.900> of<00:00:18.140> that<00:00:18.500> idea<00:00:18.880> it's<00:00:19.880> just<00:00:20.180> this

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
expression of that idea it's just this

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.510 
expression of that idea it's just this
magical<00:00:20.840> pane<00:00:21.020> of<00:00:21.170> glass<00:00:21.220> it<00:00:22.220> can<00:00:22.400> become

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
magical pane of glass it can become

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.380 
magical pane of glass it can become
anything<00:00:22.970> you<00:00:23.180> want<00:00:23.390> it<00:00:23.480> to<00:00:23.599> be<00:00:23.630> and<00:00:25.390> that's

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
anything you want it to be and that's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.749 
anything you want it to be and that's
why<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:26.840> many<00:00:26.900> people<00:00:27.079> in<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.340> many<00:00:28.489> different

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
why so many people in so many different

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.179 
why so many people in so many different
places<00:00:28.970> are<00:00:29.570> using<00:00:30.560> it<00:00:30.650> for<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.070> many

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
places are using it for so many

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.910 
places are using it for so many
different<00:00:31.400> things<00:00:32.140> it's<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.260> more<00:00:33.440> personal

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.360 
them from the signals it's a major
breakthrough

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
breakthrough

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.699 
breakthrough
and<00:02:18.459> it's<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.209> key<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.480> making<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.170> pixels<00:02:20.470> so

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
and it's the key to making the pixels so

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.039 
and it's the key to making the pixels so
small<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.340> close<00:02:21.790> together<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.299> the

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
small and so close together that the

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.350 
small and so close together that the
human<00:02:23.379> eye<00:02:23.470> can't<00:02:23.769> even<00:02:23.950> distinguish<00:02:24.370> them<00:02:24.549> so

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
human eye can't even distinguish them so

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.080
