00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
buddy collection works on him because

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.500 
buddy collection works on him because
he's<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> regular<00:00:27.779> size<00:00:28.820> so<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.300> take<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
he's a regular size so if we just take a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.139 
he's a regular size so if we just take a
quick<00:00:30.689> look<00:00:30.929> at<00:00:31.199> his<00:00:31.470> bow<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.969> could

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
quick look at his bow here you could

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.400 
quick look at his bow here you could
find<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> design<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.520> him<00:00:35.520> Orton<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.660> items

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
find the design with him Orton the items

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500

folder<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.800> don't<00:00:38.070> know<00:00:38.190> which<00:00:38.309> i'll<00:00:38.579> try<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
folder I don't know which i'll try to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.680 
folder I don't know which i'll try to
post<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.899> below<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.550> added<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.940> low<00:00:42.149> part<00:00:42.450> so

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
post that below I added this low part so

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.389 
post that below I added this low part so
it<00:00:42.719> could<00:00:42.930> actually<00:00:43.079> stay<00:00:43.440> together<00:00:43.680> because

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
it could actually stay together because

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.330 
it could actually stay together because
before<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.320> squares<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.800> corners<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
before it's just squares and corners and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.160 
before it's just squares and corners and
one<00:00:47.820> stay<00:00:48.030> together<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.539> decided<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.899> little

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
one stay together so I decided a little

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.900 
one stay together so I decided a little
strip<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.399> hard<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> cut<00:00:50.789> out

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
strip there it's really hard to cut out

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.939 
strip there it's really hard to cut out
but<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:51.899> right<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.410> looks<00:00:52.620> really

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
but if you get right it looks really

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.319 
but if you get right it looks really
nice<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:55.160> here<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.520> zero<00:00:56.850> nice<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
