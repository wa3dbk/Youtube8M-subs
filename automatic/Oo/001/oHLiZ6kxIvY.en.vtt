today I'm going to show you how to make
banana<00:00:14.980> milk<00:00:15.400> I'll<00:00:16.000> use<00:00:16.180> that<00:00:16.330> on<00:00:16.420> my<00:00:16.570> cereal

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.530

banana milk I'll use that on my cereal
I<00:00:18.620> used<00:00:19.250> to<00:00:19.370> make<00:00:19.610> almond<00:00:20.120> milk<00:00:20.360> and<00:00:21.370> that's

I used to make almond milk and that's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.390 
I used to make almond milk and that's
great<00:00:22.900> but<00:00:23.900> it<00:00:24.740> can<00:00:24.800> be<00:00:25.040> a<00:00:25.070> little<00:00:25.250> bit

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
great but it can be a little bit

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.000 
great but it can be a little bit
time-consuming<00:00:29.290> so<00:00:30.290> you've<00:00:30.410> got<00:00:30.560> leftover

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
time-consuming so you've got leftover

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.400 
time-consuming so you've got leftover
pulp<00:00:31.250> you<00:00:31.820> have<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.240> soak<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.870> almonds<00:00:33.260> and

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
pulp you have to soak the almonds and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.640 
pulp you have to soak the almonds and
you<00:00:33.560> know<00:00:33.920> you<00:00:34.310> know<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:34.490> can<00:00:34.850> maybe<00:00:35.750> make<00:00:36.590> up

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
you know you know you can maybe make up

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.030 
you know you know you can maybe make up
the<00:00:37.100> almond<00:00:37.580> pulp<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.059> try<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.480> use<00:00:38.630> that<00:00:39.040> the

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
the almond pulp and try to use that the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.780 
the almond pulp and try to use that the
filter<00:00:40.970> the<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.989> milk<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:43.040> blend<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:43.400> and<00:00:43.580> you

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
filter the the milk you blend it and you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.140 
filter the the milk you blend it and you
filter<00:00:44.180> it<00:00:44.210> up<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.540> within<00:00:45.110> that<00:00:45.290> bag<00:00:46.150> that's
