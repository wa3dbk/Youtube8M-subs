let's<00:01:02.440> see<00:01:02.710> if<00:01:02.890> he<00:01:02.980> can<00:01:03.129> find<00:01:03.400> me<00:01:06.630> bottle<00:01:07.630> tops

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
let's see if he can find me bottle tops

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.770 
let's see if he can find me bottle tops
and<00:01:08.080> pull<00:01:08.260> tabs<00:01:08.940> but<00:01:09.940> in<00:01:10.090> between<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.479> bottle

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
and pull tabs but in between the bottle

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.810 
and pull tabs but in between the bottle
tops<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.170> cool<00:01:11.320> tips<00:01:11.590> we<00:01:12.250> found<00:01:12.490> interesting

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
tops and cool tips we found interesting

tops and cool tips we found interesting
things

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.800 

you<00:01:19.409> know

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.680 

okay<00:01:24.350> not<00:01:24.530> brother<00:01:24.920> German

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.460 

so<00:01:29.690> now<00:01:29.810> can<00:01:29.870> I<00:01:30.020> have<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:30.170> go<00:01:30.320> of<00:01:30.770> course<00:01:31.040> yeah<00:01:32.470> so

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
so now can I have a go of course yeah so

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.710 
so now can I have a go of course yeah so
I<00:01:33.500> asked<00:01:33.920> Greg<00:01:34.190> how<00:01:34.760> much<00:01:34.940> am<00:01:35.120> I<00:01:35.210> likely<00:01:35.420> to

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
I asked Greg how much am I likely to

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.190 
I asked Greg how much am I likely to
have<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:36.110> spend<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:37.010> get<00:01:37.160> into<00:01:37.580> this<00:01:37.700> hobby<00:01:38.200> so

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
have to spend to get into this hobby so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.110 
have to spend to get into this hobby so
if<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.470> go<00:01:39.620> and<00:01:39.680> buy<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.920> metal<00:01:40.220> detector<00:01:40.850> for<00:01:40.880> a

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
if you go and buy a metal detector for a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.910 
if you go and buy a metal detector for a
thousand<00:01:41.750> nine<00:01:41.960> one<00:01:42.170> thousand<00:01:42.590> five<00:01:42.740> hundred

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
thousand nine one thousand five hundred

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.770 
thousand nine one thousand five hundred
and<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:44.390> will<00:01:44.540> find<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.960> plow<00:01:46.060> inches<00:01:47.060> ten

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
and you will find the plow inches ten

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.020 
and you will find the plow inches ten
centimeters<00:01:48.530> but<00:01:49.460> it's<00:01:49.580> not<00:01:49.730> going<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:49.910> be

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
centimeters but it's not going to be

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.840 
centimeters but it's not going to be
much<00:01:50.210> bigger<00:01:50.450> than<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:51.040> so<00:01:52.040> an<00:01:52.310> entry-level

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
much bigger than that so an entry-level

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.240 
much bigger than that so an entry-level
machine<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:54.380> about<00:01:54.800> four<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.220> half

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
machine is about four and a half

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.940 
machine is about four and a half
thousand<00:01:55.850> nine<00:01:56.000> but<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:57.620> entry-level

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
thousand nine but the entry-level

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.700 
thousand nine but the entry-level
machine<00:01:58.310> will<00:01:58.760> not<00:01:58.970> work<00:01:59.180> on<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.510> beach

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
machine will not work on the beach

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.800 
machine will not work on the beach
because<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.979> salt<00:02:01.220> water<00:02:01.460> ionizers<00:02:02.360> descend

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
because the salt water ionizers descend

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.070 
because the salt water ionizers descend
and<00:02:03.229> we<00:02:04.010> get<00:02:04.250> what<00:02:04.970> people<00:02:05.000> ghost<00:02:05.570> in<00:02:05.780> the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
and we get what people ghost in the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.750 
and we get what people ghost in the
ghost<00:02:06.350> sounds<00:02:06.950> you'll<00:02:07.100> pick<00:02:07.310> up<00:02:07.430> things<00:02:07.670> that

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
ghost sounds you'll pick up things that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.440 
ghost sounds you'll pick up things that
aren't<00:02:08.000> there

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
aren't there

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.900 
aren't there
so<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.290> need<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> machine<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.670> can<00:02:10.850> handle

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
so you need a machine that can handle

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.040 
so you need a machine that can handle
the<00:02:11.390> seawater<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.980> as<00:02:13.190> soon<00:02:13.340> as<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.610> do<00:02:13.760> that

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
the seawater and as soon as you do that

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.780 
the seawater and as soon as you do that
you<00:02:15.380> look<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.620> little<00:02:15.740> more<00:02:15.860> expensive<00:02:16.610> thus

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
you look a little more expensive thus

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.450 
you look a little more expensive thus
this<00:02:17.000> machine<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.460> medium-range

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
this machine is to the medium-range

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.560 
this machine is to the medium-range
machine<00:02:20.060> cost<00:02:21.050> about<00:02:21.260> sixteen<00:02:21.680> thousand<00:02:22.100> and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
machine cost about sixteen thousand and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.380 
machine cost about sixteen thousand and
you<00:02:23.800> need<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> spend<00:02:25.100> some<00:02:25.190> money<00:02:25.370> because<00:02:25.820> if

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
you need to spend some money because if

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.940 
you need to spend some money because if
you<00:02:26.540> really<00:02:26.870> want<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.200> get<00:02:27.380> into<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.800> hobby

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
you really want to get into the hobby

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.700 
you really want to get into the hobby
and<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.310> are<00:02:28.910> living<00:02:29.120> at<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.420> cost<00:02:29.710> you

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
and you are living at the cost you

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.170 
and you are living at the cost you
probably<00:02:31.010> need<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.220> spend<00:02:31.550> about<00:02:31.670> eighteen

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
probably need to spend about eighteen

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.420 
probably need to spend about eighteen
thousand<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.870> includes<00:02:33.260> your<00:02:33.410> pointer<00:02:33.890> your

is given me a 37 the deads of the city
will<00:04:05.710> be<00:04:05.740> a<00:04:05.890> plane<00:04:06.220> normally<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:09.010> problem<00:04:09.220> is

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
will be a plane normally the problem is

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.610 
will be a plane normally the problem is
things<00:04:09.670> like<00:04:09.850> gold<00:04:10.270> of<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:11.020> same<00:04:11.230> reading<00:04:11.470> as
