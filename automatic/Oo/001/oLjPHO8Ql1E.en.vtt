00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.450
 as you can see that in the center 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.250

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.960
 also the bordeaux the bordeaux of 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.420
 cap or bordeaux I created 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.650
 these ripples to make it look like 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.090
 like a little flower, you can also see the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.780

 I show what you need to be able to achieve 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.490
 let's get these little shoes to the shoes 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.729
 as you can see they are also made 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.159
 if crochet and I alternated colors 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.890
 then pink flower headband 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.009
 pink flower white shoe anyway 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.100
 also embellished this with of the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:02.060
 of the beads you have to see these 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.920
 fantastic ballerina also you see ho 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.689
 applied the ladybirds these 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.410
 ladybugs are practically gods 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.090
 buttons to stop the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.760

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.200
 orthotics noe this orthotics know here 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.260
 as you can see it has been realized 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.450
 tight at the heel is wider at the toe 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.110
 I like to make this kind of 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.680
 rino plant because one is very similar 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.129
 to the classic and two classic shoes 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.340
 however very similar to the shape of the 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.340
 foot 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.959
 but I want to clarify that these do not 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.019
 they are first steps but they are shoes 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.840
 shoes for example these are for 0 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.620
 months these two shoes with the hat 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.480
 they are the size for 0 months but yes 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.150
 they can also analyze in other miscellaneous 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.390
 even much larger measurements also for 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.410
 but adults are not for that 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.690
 walking shoes or for learning to 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.859
 walk as they don't have the plant 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.910
 arino within the plan say tanino 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:24.310
