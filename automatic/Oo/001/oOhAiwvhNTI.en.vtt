 kotler 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.570
 tool in hand agility and though right in the right place 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.220
 This scenario is common for those who work with maintenance but the 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.340
 mechanics of history do without more and this in the six squares scattered 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.130
 Brazil 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.550
 they are recognized for the speed in the workmanship and quality of services 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.029
 are risk areas and require knowledge 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.489
 abiliity 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.489
 too much training 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.850
 be constantly updated about the new tools 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.649
 parts and services available on the entire network if something changes the engine in the 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.059
 accessories your vehicle and released 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.159
 professionals need to be sharp to serve the customer 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.220
 The reason for this meeting here is a warm-up for Thompson 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 a championship that will choose the best left back 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.990
 Brazilian mechanics are preparing to compete with 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.080
 latin america and south africa in the grand finale 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.000
 and mechanic's work is not as simple as it looks beyond the factory 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.740
 and training centers scattered throughout 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.659
 Brazilian regions also have the online courses 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.060
 to stay current the most important within the system 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.030
 it is the existence within him 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 distance learning courses 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.220
 these distance courses they aim to occupy basic training data 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.090
 offered to people 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.380
 product knowledge and citizenship 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.310
 prepare them to be homogenized in terms of knowledge 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.310
 to be able to come to recent hospitalization to these 700 films that we have 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.799
 received and without specialization in the subject forgets 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.280
 josé ramos-horta differential with the theme because because the beginning because 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.760
 formerly strictly mechanical component 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.730
 today the components they are no longer only mechanical injury he has a part 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.630
 electronics then the person needs often understands 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.860
 a little more money and diagnostic electronics the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.100
 soda support of another relative who today in the 3 3 he is very 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.789
 sensitized 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:22.189
 the system that in recent years in sbt 3 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:27.090
 strange diagnostic system it will help us very well to diagnose the 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:31.150
 problems and then we can make a more direct action 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.480
 more focused 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.670
 and much faster returning this vehicle as fast as possible 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.079
 the state 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.430
 so that the attendance is fast the mechanics we adopt is that they 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.140
 an essential customer system that reduces unwanted downtime 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.140
 it's a tool for us to use 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.560
 the punishment of the stopped truck 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.369
 the customer understands so that with the truck 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:59.769
 for the interviews it was as if sadness is made 10 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.939
 before any other service then this streamlines his process 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.289
 implementation of the 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.459
 optimizing time too, right? 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.459
 the mechanics of the escania must obey a standard of quality 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.129
 This international standard has been studied and analyzed worldwide is the 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.189
 of significant results in customer productivity 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.349
 was good with the company 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.759
 with the system s 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.869
 the quality 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.710
 each thing in its place 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.660
 had that history of the Olympique de Lyon started to set the house after 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.799
 our owners heart 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.640
 the red with the customer in line visual would do 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.659
 that 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.479
 We look forward to the recipe 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.969
 do you feel with this organization of your work as a mechanic 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.029
 That's how the team lost 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.599
 a tool 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.259
 each in its square 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.259
 use speed and agility in the service 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.809
 the customer also finds faster service commemorates both 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:11.169
 nowadays many of the tools are computerized is a way of 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.430
 diagnose parts problems with maximum accuracy 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:18.370
 they are also used to not harm 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.659
 other items in the set 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.659
 not all electronic this ability 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.770
 I live there we have a training 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.090
 nine per week the staff train is two hours studying that the most part 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.740
 contact 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.340
 with the worsening of work 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.520
 Talita technology in the market 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.289
 angry with 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.289
 training is fundamental 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.229
 also signed in the month 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.879
 late diagnosis was perfect, and was assailed by 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.309
 steering failures 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:57.580
 in 2000 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.330
 astana help thrown on the training plate until the person bb 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.210
 in teresópolis the are also not all the same then 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.070
 the sister accompanies the evolution of metal prices accompany the 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.219
 technological evolution 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:12.249
 last week 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.079
 surely you believe that skilled work in different phases 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.629
 in the same correct way 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.379
 It takes longer for the São Paulo defense to stop 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.279
 so I think we are going through a good phase 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:31.800
 the market demand 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.039
 this year according to the version of some athletes 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.879
 the process will be taken to hospital são josé with motors explained 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.229
 Thank God 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.009
 vehicle components have undergone accelerated changes over the past ten 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.469
 years 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.469
 the British need constant updates 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.919
 after the holidays 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.419
 two brake I did not leave quadrennial pgr 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:01.779
 the product has a greater change in almost daily change 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.789
 so it's very difficult we can bring the video by clicking 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.789
 here treats companies pass this information 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.600
 so for this 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.129
 this morning 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.039
 in the system 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.339
 communication we're struggling until 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:18.689
 no stf 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.689
 to pass a class live 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.319
 information was from the network in a way to unite I spoke 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.650
 every quicker a much more economical way of wistening for us 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.689
 here we can do it this way 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:36.660
 pass important information to 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.550
 for service to companies for 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.210
 all this will be the effective population 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.150
 they feel satisfied you have completed
