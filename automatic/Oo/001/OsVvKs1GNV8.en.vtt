00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
Pro 13 inch and as you can see there I

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.570 
Pro 13 inch and as you can see there I
don't<00:00:14.580> know<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> password<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.690> computer

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
don't know the password on this computer

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.040 
don't know the password on this computer
this<00:00:17.580> will<00:00:17.850> involve<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.359> couple<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.810> steps

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
this will involve a couple of steps

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.429 
this will involve a couple of steps
including<00:00:20.420> erasing<00:00:21.420> everything<00:00:22.080> that's<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.410> a

including erasing everything that's on a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.640 
including erasing everything that's on a
computer<00:00:23.180> however<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.260> will<00:00:25.439> be

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
computer however I think it will be

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.040 
computer however I think it will be
worth<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.070> because<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.760> will<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.449> able<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.779> use

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
worth it because you will be able to use

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.880 
worth it because you will be able to use
your<00:00:28.199> computer<00:00:28.349> without<00:00:29.279> knowing<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.760> password
