00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
characteristics of this concept is the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.640 
characteristics of this concept is the
wheel<00:01:06.640> really<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.390> original<00:01:07.479> turbine<00:01:08.409> car

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
wheel really the original turbine car

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.520 
wheel really the original turbine car
didn't<00:01:09.070> have<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.700> directional<00:01:10.510> turbine<00:01:11.110> wheel

didn't have a directional turbine wheel

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.430 
didn't have a directional turbine wheel
as<00:01:11.860> such<00:01:12.280> but<00:01:13.150> we<00:01:13.300> felt<00:01:13.600> with<00:01:13.750> this<00:01:13.960> new<00:01:14.170> modern

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
as such but we felt with this new modern

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.140 
as such but we felt with this new modern
concept<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.460> this<00:01:15.640> would<00:01:15.820> be<00:01:15.940> a<00:01:15.970> good

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
concept that this would be a good

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.480 
concept that this would be a good
opportunity<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.810> showcase<00:01:17.280> sort<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.400> a

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
opportunity to showcase sort of a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:28.550 
opportunity to showcase sort of a
turbine<00:01:18.850> effect<00:01:19.210> wheel

Chrysler studio I created the concept if
you<00:01:33.360> are<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.990> image<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.560> taking<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> 300<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
you are the image of taking the 300 and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.670 
you are the image of taking the 300 and
adding<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.510> these<00:01:36.570> parts<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
adding some of these parts one of the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.050 
adding some of these parts one of the
things<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.100> about<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.850> particular

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
concept is that the matte finish paint

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.880 
concept is that the matte finish paint
because<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.270> makes<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.690> body<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.500> star<00:01:43.770> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
because it makes the body the star of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.450 
because it makes the body the star of
the<00:01:43.979> show

really shows how the 300 is really a

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.190 
really shows how the 300 is really a
good<00:02:10.590> canvas<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.910> those<00:02:12.060> kinds<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.630> ideas
