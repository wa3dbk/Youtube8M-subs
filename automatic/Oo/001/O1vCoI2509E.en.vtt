times the resolution of 1080p we own a
lot<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> 1080p<00:00:55.590> smartphones<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520

main initial reason for making this

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.700 
main initial reason for making this
video<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.049> really<00:01:19.409> notice<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
video was I don't really notice a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
video was I don't really notice a
difference<00:01:20.009> between<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.400> quad<00:01:20.759> HD<00:01:20.970> smartphone

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
difference between a quad HD smartphone

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.440 
difference between a quad HD smartphone
and<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.229> standard<00:01:22.680> 1080p<00:01:23.400> smartphone<00:01:23.909> I've

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and a standard 1080p smartphone I've

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.149 
and a standard 1080p smartphone I've
looked<00:01:24.689> at<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> lot<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.049> them<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.619> don't

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
looked at a lot of them and I just don't

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.249 
looked at a lot of them and I just don't
really<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.090> difference<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.869> where<00:01:28.049> it's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
really see the difference to where it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
really see the difference to where it's
mind<00:01:28.590> blowing<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> did<00:01:29.729> see<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.939> big<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
mind blowing but I did see that big of a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.510 
mind blowing but I did see that big of a
difference<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> switched<00:01:31.290> from<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.560> 720p

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
difference when I switched from a 720p

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
difference when I switched from a 720p
smartphone<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> original<00:01:33.780> moto<00:01:33.930> X<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
smartphone like the original moto X to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.649 
smartphone like the original moto X to
the<00:01:34.920> new<00:01:35.100> Moto<00:01:35.340> X<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.729> 2014<00:01:36.420> there's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the new Moto X of 2014 there's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.410 
the new Moto X of 2014 there's
definitely<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> big<00:01:37.290> leap<00:01:37.500> from<00:01:37.680> 720p<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:39.060> 1080

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
definitely a big leap from 720p to 1080

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
definitely a big leap from 720p to 1080
but<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.900> don't<00:01:40.079> find<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.439> big<00:01:40.650> leap<00:01:40.860> from

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
but I just don't find a big leap from

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.270 
but I just don't find a big leap from
1080<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:42.030> quad<00:01:42.270> HD<00:01:42.420> also<00:01:42.990> known<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.530> 2<00:01:43.799> K<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
1080 to quad HD also known as 2 K so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.700 
1080 to quad HD also known as 2 K so
this<00:01:44.880> whole<00:01:45.060> quad<00:01:45.360> HD<00:01:45.540> movement<00:01:46.290> really

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
this whole quad HD movement really

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.670 
this whole quad HD movement really
started<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.540> 2013<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.750> LG<00:01:49.079> debuted<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
started in 2013 when LG debuted the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.100 
started in 2013 when LG debuted the
first<00:01:49.979> quad<00:01:50.340> HD<00:01:50.490> panel<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.869> didn't

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
first quad HD panel out there it didn't

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.569 
first quad HD panel out there it didn't
come<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.560> smartphone<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> was<00:01:53.460> just

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
come out on a smartphone but it was just

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.420 
come out on a smartphone but it was just
cool<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> technology<00:01:54.329> out<00:01:54.720> there<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
cool to see the technology out there and

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.889 
cool to see the technology out there and
the<00:01:56.430> current<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.939> smartphones<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.689> are

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the current for smartphones we have are

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.649 
the current for smartphones we have are
the<00:01:57.990> LG<00:01:58.409> g3<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.189> Nexus<00:01:59.610> 6<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.149> Samsung<00:02:00.570> Galaxy

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
Note 4 and the Oppo find 7 those are the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
Note 4 and the Oppo find 7 those are the
four<00:02:03.479> most<00:02:03.630> popular<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.590> think<00:02:04.770> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
four most popular that I can think of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.310 
four most popular that I can think of
off<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> top<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.399> my<00:02:05.520> head<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.780> reason

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
off the top of my head but the reason

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.960 
off the top of my head but the reason
and<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.770> kind<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.009> whole<00:02:08.099> core<00:02:08.640> thing

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and just kind of the whole core thing

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
and just kind of the whole core thing
about<00:02:09.239> quad<00:02:09.509> HD<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:10.259> about<00:02:10.530> being<00:02:10.920> able<00:02:11.069> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
about quad HD it's about being able to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.980 
about quad HD it's about being able to
distinguish<00:02:11.730> pixels<00:02:12.209> when<00:02:12.810> you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
distinguish pixels when you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.960 
distinguish pixels when you
has<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.380> higher<00:02:13.620> resolution<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:14.550> more

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
has a higher resolution you have more

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.360 
has a higher resolution you have more
pixels<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.320> overall<00:02:16.800> gives<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.340> a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
pixels and that just overall gives you a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.240 
pixels and that just overall gives you a
better<00:02:17.820> image<00:02:18.030> at<00:02:18.390> least<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:18.870> paper<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:20.040> when

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
better image at least on paper so when

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.850 
better image at least on paper so when
you<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.460> ahead<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.850> look<00:02:20.970> at<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.660> 720p<00:02:22.470> start

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
you go ahead and look at a 720p start

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.750 
you go ahead and look at a 720p start
phone<00:02:23.040> you're<00:02:23.220> gonna<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.490> able<00:02:23.670> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
phone you're gonna be able to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.760 
phone you're gonna be able to
distinguish<00:02:24.180> pixels<00:02:24.690> at<00:02:24.900> 11<00:02:25.260> inches<00:02:25.560> away

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
distinguish pixels at 11 inches away

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.910 
distinguish pixels at 11 inches away
from<00:02:26.070> your<00:02:26.190> face<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.760> 1080p<00:02:27.630> smartphone<00:02:28.110> at<00:02:28.260> 7.8

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
from your face a 1080p smartphone at 7.8

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.950 
from your face a 1080p smartphone at 7.8
inches<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.550> with<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> quad<00:02:30.030> HD<00:02:30.060> smartphone<00:02:30.780> at

inches and with a quad HD smartphone at
6<00:02:31.410> inches<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.430> another<00:02:32.700> cool<00:02:33.030> factoids

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
6 inches and just another cool factoids

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.490 
6 inches and just another cool factoids
that<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.200> kind<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.270> found<00:02:36.270> out<00:02:36.570> about<00:02:36.720> was

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that I kind of just found out about was

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.250 
that I kind of just found out about was
an<00:02:37.770> IPS<00:02:38.400> display<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.090> see<00:02:39.270> on<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.600> lg<00:02:39.990> g3

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
an IPS display like we see on the lg g3

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.120 
an IPS display like we see on the lg g3
and<00:02:40.590> Oppo<00:02:41.070> find<00:02:41.250> 7<00:02:42.320> it's<00:02:43.320> powered<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.860> little

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
and Oppo find 7 it's powered a little

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.530 
and Oppo find 7 it's powered a little
bit<00:02:44.220> differently<00:02:44.610> than<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:45.000> we'd<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:45.330> on

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
bit differently than what we'd see on

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
bit differently than what we'd see on
the<00:02:45.810> samsung<00:02:46.230> galaxy<00:02:46.620> note<00:02:46.740> 4<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.040> Nexus<00:02:47.490> 6

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the samsung galaxy note 4 and Nexus 6

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.020 
the samsung galaxy note 4 and Nexus 6
meaning<00:02:48.390> an<00:02:48.510> IPS<00:02:49.110> display<00:02:49.490> powers<00:02:50.490> all<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
meaning an IPS display powers all the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.670 
meaning an IPS display powers all the
pixels<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.510> there<00:02:51.720> whereas<00:02:52.050> an<00:02:52.230> AMOLED

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
pixels on there whereas an AMOLED

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.010 
pixels on there whereas an AMOLED
display<00:02:53.070> only<00:02:53.340> powers<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.420> colored<00:02:54.810> pixels

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
display only powers the colored pixels

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.140 
display only powers the colored pixels
so<00:02:55.710> when<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.040> see<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> black<00:02:56.460> pixel<00:02:56.880> on<00:02:56.970> there

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
so when you see a black pixel on there

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.030 
so when you see a black pixel on there
that's<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.050> native<00:02:58.350> black<00:02:58.530> screen<00:02:58.890> so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that's just the native black screen so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.380 
that's just the native black screen so
it<00:02:59.130> really<00:02:59.280> does<00:02:59.490> save<00:02:59.730> battery<00:02:59.910> life

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
it really does save battery life

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.120 
it really does save battery life
we'll<00:03:00.660> talk<00:03:00.810> about<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.140> in<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.380> next<00:03:01.650> bit<00:03:01.830> so

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
we'll talk about that in the next bit so

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.860 
we'll talk about that in the next bit so
going<00:03:02.310> into<00:03:02.550> this<00:03:02.670> video<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:03.150> thought<00:03:03.390> quad<00:03:03.690> HD

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
going into this video I thought quad HD

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.380 
going into this video I thought quad HD
was<00:03:04.170> bad<00:03:04.380> 1080p<00:03:05.040> was<00:03:05.220> good<00:03:05.460> more<00:03:05.760> pixels<00:03:06.240> being

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
was bad 1080p was good more pixels being

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.040 
was bad 1080p was good more pixels being
pushed<00:03:06.780> equals<00:03:07.770> bad<00:03:08.640> experience<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.750> worse

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
pushed equals bad experience and worse

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.230 
pushed equals bad experience and worse
battery<00:03:10.470> life<00:03:10.650> but<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.220> was<00:03:11.370> actually<00:03:11.610> really

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
battery life but I was actually really

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.700 
battery life but I was actually really
really<00:03:12.630> really<00:03:12.870> surprised

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
really really surprised

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.290 
really really surprised
so<00:03:14.100> display<00:03:14.550> made<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> company<00:03:15.150> out<00:03:15.270> there

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
so display made a company out there

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.420 
so display made a company out there
actually<00:03:16.110> did<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.260> test<00:03:16.530> between<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.920> note<00:03:17.160> 4

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
actually did a test between the note 4

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.820 
actually did a test between the note 4
and<00:03:17.460> note<00:03:17.820> 3<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.330> they<00:03:18.660> found<00:03:18.870> out<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.140> note<00:03:19.350> 4

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
and note 3 and they found out the note 4

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.850 
and note 3 and they found out the note 4
requires<00:03:20.310> less<00:03:20.940> power<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.870> push<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.350> quad<00:03:22.710> HD

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
requires less power to push a quad HD

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.910 
requires less power to push a quad HD
display<00:03:23.040> over<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.240> note<00:03:24.420> 3's<00:03:24.870> display<00:03:25.380> which

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
display over the note 3's display which

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.010 
display over the note 3's display which
is<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.310> 1080p<00:03:26.700> panel<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.630> note<00:03:27.780> 4

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
is just a 1080p panel and the note 4

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.440 
is just a 1080p panel and the note 4
only<00:03:28.260> requires<00:03:28.560> point<00:03:28.920> 8<00:03:29.100> 5<00:03:29.370> watts<00:03:29.700> whereas

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
only requires point 8 5 watts whereas

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.450 
only requires point 8 5 watts whereas
the<00:03:30.570> note<00:03:30.750> 3<00:03:30.990> required<00:03:31.350> point<00:03:31.710> 9<00:03:31.920> watts<00:03:32.160> and

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
the note 3 required point 9 watts and

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.530 
the note 3 required point 9 watts and
that<00:03:32.790> was<00:03:32.910> just<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.120> really<00:03:33.390> interesting

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
that was just a really interesting

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.680 
that was just a really interesting
factoid<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.160> drew<00:03:35.940> was<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.210> like<00:03:36.390> wait

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
factoid that I drew was just like wait

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.140 
factoid that I drew was just like wait
am<00:03:37.260> i<00:03:37.350> reading<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.710> wrong<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.250> then<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:38.880> did<00:03:39.120> a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
am i reading this wrong and then I did a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.310 
am i reading this wrong and then I did a
little<00:03:39.300> bit<00:03:39.480> more<00:03:39.600> researching<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.170> found

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
little bit more researching and found

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.500 
little bit more researching and found
out<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> peak<00:03:41.010> white<00:03:41.400> test<00:03:41.700> another<00:03:42.060> test<00:03:42.330> out

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
out the peak white test another test out

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.890 
out the peak white test another test out
there<00:03:43.220> where<00:03:44.220> they<00:03:44.850> found<00:03:45.090> out<00:03:45.240> the<00:03:45.420> note<00:03:45.600> 4

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
there where they found out the note 4

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.380 
there where they found out the note 4
only<00:03:46.200> consumed<00:03:46.650> 1.8<00:03:47.490> watts<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.970> power<00:03:48.120> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
only consumed 1.8 watts to power the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.540 
only consumed 1.8 watts to power the
display<00:03:48.600> whereas<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.350> note<00:03:49.530> 3<00:03:49.830> required<00:03:50.220> two

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
display whereas the note 3 required two

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.080 
display whereas the note 3 required two
watts

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
watts

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.490 
watts
I<00:03:51.120> know<00:03:51.480> these<00:03:51.630> numbers<00:03:51.960> are<00:03:52.110> definitely

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
I know these numbers are definitely

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.710 
I know these numbers are definitely
different<00:03:52.890> but<00:03:53.400> one<00:03:53.640> thing<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.150> pretty<00:03:54.450> common

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
different but one thing is pretty common

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.530 
different but one thing is pretty common
the<00:03:55.260> note<00:03:55.440> 4<00:03:55.740> does<00:03:56.160> require<00:03:56.670> less<00:03:57.000> energy<00:03:57.210> to

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
the note 4 does require less energy to

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.050 
the note 4 does require less energy to
power<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.960> display<00:03:58.170> than<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.190> note<00:03:59.370> 3<00:03:59.760> and

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
power the display than the note 3 and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.230 
power the display than the note 3 and
that<00:04:00.540> just<00:04:00.750> absolutely<00:04:01.010> blew<00:04:02.010> my<00:04:02.490> mind<00:04:02.790> for

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
that just absolutely blew my mind for

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.050 
that just absolutely blew my mind for
like<00:04:03.360> days<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.530> note<00:04:04.650> 4<00:04:04.890> was<00:04:05.130> 14%<00:04:05.580> more

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
like days so the note 4 was 14% more

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.030 
like days so the note 4 was 14% more
efficient<00:04:06.450> than<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.660> note<00:04:06.810> 3<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.350> that<00:04:07.860> just

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
efficient than the note 3 and that just

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.410 
efficient than the note 3 and that just
kind<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.280> seems<00:04:08.520> a<00:04:08.700> little<00:04:08.940> bit<00:04:09.030> interesting

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
kind of seems a little bit interesting

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.760 
kind of seems a little bit interesting
because<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.780> thought<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.200> note<00:04:10.350> 3<00:04:10.590> would

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
because I thought the note 3 would

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.050 
because I thought the note 3 would
definitely<00:04:11.190> be<00:04:11.310> more<00:04:11.490> efficient<00:04:11.910> than<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
definitely be more efficient than the

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.180 
definitely be more efficient than the
note<00:04:12.270> 4<00:04:12.570> but<00:04:13.080> with<00:04:13.140> Samsung's<00:04:13.680> AMOLED

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
note 4 but with Samsung's AMOLED

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.550 
note 4 but with Samsung's AMOLED
technology<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.540> new<00:04:15.660> Qualcomm<00:04:16.109> chips<00:04:16.380> it

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
technology and the new Qualcomm chips it

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.890 
technology and the new Qualcomm chips it
can<00:04:16.709> identify<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:17.430> static<00:04:17.910> image<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.420> pump

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
can identify a static image and pump

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.449 
can identify a static image and pump
only<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.320> certain<00:04:19.680> amount<00:04:19.830> of<00:04:19.920> energy<00:04:20.280> needed

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
only a certain amount of energy needed

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.940 
only a certain amount of energy needed
from<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.270> phone's<00:04:21.450> battery<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.530> quad<00:04:22.800> HD

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
from the phone's battery to the quad HD

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.190 
from the phone's battery to the quad HD
display<00:04:23.270> definitely<00:04:24.270> saving<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.660> battery<00:04:24.990> life

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
display definitely saving a battery life

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.910 
display definitely saving a battery life
so

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
so

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.920 
so
contech<00:04:26.250> also<00:04:26.700> published<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.180> report<00:04:27.330> saying

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
contech also published a report saying

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.490 
contech also published a report saying
the<00:04:28.470> Samsung<00:04:29.310> Galaxy<00:04:29.730> s5<00:04:30.210> lte-a<00:04:30.870> edition<00:04:31.380> and

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
the Samsung Galaxy s5 lte-a edition and

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.020 
the Samsung Galaxy s5 lte-a edition and
if<00:04:31.560> you're<00:04:31.680> like<00:04:31.830> wait<00:04:32.220> what's<00:04:32.580> this<00:04:32.760> device

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
if you're like wait what's this device

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.450 
if you're like wait what's this device
basically<00:04:33.690> just<00:04:34.140> had<00:04:34.230> a<00:04:34.260> quad<00:04:34.560> HD<00:04:34.710> display<00:04:34.950> and

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
basically just had a quad HD display and

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.340 
basically just had a quad HD display and
a<00:04:35.520> few<00:04:35.700> other<00:04:35.850> bumped<00:04:36.240> up<00:04:36.360> specifications<00:04:37.200> on

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
a few other bumped up specifications on

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.050 
a few other bumped up specifications on
it<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.890> was<00:04:37.980> only<00:04:38.250> released<00:04:38.490> in<00:04:38.820> South

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
it and it was only released in South

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.450 
it and it was only released in South
Korea<00:04:39.450> but<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.170> had<00:04:40.410> he<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.860> had<00:04:41.130> an<00:04:41.220> emitter

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
Korea but it had he it had an emitter

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.730 
Korea but it had he it had an emitter
that<00:04:41.730> was<00:04:41.850> 27%<00:04:42.810> more<00:04:42.840> efficient<00:04:43.440> than<00:04:43.590> the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
that was 27% more efficient than the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.340 
that was 27% more efficient than the
standard<00:04:44.160> Samsung<00:04:44.610> Galaxy<00:04:45.060> s5<00:04:45.390> that<00:04:46.020> we<00:04:46.140> saw

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
standard Samsung Galaxy s5 that we saw

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.410 
standard Samsung Galaxy s5 that we saw
pretty<00:04:46.980> much<00:04:47.190> everywhere<00:04:47.640> else<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.390> just

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
pretty much everywhere else and I just

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.360 
pretty much everywhere else and I just
find<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.840> really<00:04:48.900> really<00:04:49.530> in<00:04:49.680> really<00:04:50.100> really

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
find that really really in really really

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.720 
find that really really in really really
really<00:04:50.910> interesting<00:04:51.420> because<00:04:52.100> we<00:04:53.100> have<00:04:53.310> the

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
really interesting because we have the

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.760 
really interesting because we have the
quad<00:04:54.000> HD<00:04:54.150> displays<00:04:54.660> requiring<00:04:55.200> less<00:04:55.530> power

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
quad HD displays requiring less power

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.830 
quad HD displays requiring less power
being<00:04:56.430> more<00:04:56.730> efficient<00:04:57.150> from<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.360> note<00:04:57.510> 4<00:04:57.750> to

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
being more efficient from the note 4 to

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.070 
being more efficient from the note 4 to
the<00:04:57.930> note<00:04:58.080> 3<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.650> lte-a<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.760> the<00:05:00.240> standard<00:05:00.630> s5

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
the note 3 the lte-a to the standard s5

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.890 
the note 3 the lte-a to the standard s5
being<00:05:01.670> 27%<00:05:02.670> more<00:05:02.700> efficient<00:05:03.120> there<00:05:03.570> seems<00:05:03.810> to

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
being 27% more efficient there seems to

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.420 
being 27% more efficient there seems to
be<00:05:03.990> a<00:05:04.050> common<00:05:04.470> trend<00:05:04.650> here<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.370> think

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
be a common trend here and I think

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.070 
be a common trend here and I think
Samsung<00:05:05.790> is<00:05:06.090> definitely<00:05:06.510> killing<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.930> with

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
Samsung is definitely killing it with

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.780 
Samsung is definitely killing it with
the<00:05:07.440> with<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:07.950> kind<00:05:08.130> of<00:05:08.190> technology<00:05:08.670> they're

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
the with the kind of technology they're

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.850 
the with the kind of technology they're
using<00:05:08.820> on<00:05:09.240> their<00:05:09.390> AMOLED<00:05:09.780> panels<00:05:10.140> and<00:05:10.410> last

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
using on their AMOLED panels and last

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.410 
using on their AMOLED panels and last
but<00:05:11.040> definitely<00:05:11.130> not<00:05:11.370> least<00:05:11.460> is<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:12.090> lack<00:05:12.390> of

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
but definitely not least is the lack of

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.080 
but definitely not least is the lack of
content<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.380> YouTube<00:05:13.800> started<00:05:14.100> supporting<00:05:14.460> 2k

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
content so YouTube started supporting 2k

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.410 
content so YouTube started supporting 2k
and<00:05:15.390> 4k<00:05:15.420> options<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.620> 2010<00:05:17.370> which<00:05:17.610> seems

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
and 4k options and 2010 which seems

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.740 
and 4k options and 2010 which seems
forever<00:05:18.720> ago<00:05:19.370> mainly<00:05:20.370> because<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.970> 4k<00:05:21.450> boom

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
forever ago mainly because the 4k boom

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.040 
forever ago mainly because the 4k boom
in<00:05:22.020> like<00:05:22.140> the<00:05:22.260> 2k<00:05:22.620> boom<00:05:22.890> happened<00:05:23.550> at<00:05:23.880> CES<00:05:24.450> 2014

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
in like the 2k boom happened at CES 2014

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.250 
in like the 2k boom happened at CES 2014
so<00:05:25.620> I'm<00:05:26.190> like<00:05:26.430> YouTube<00:05:27.090> I<00:05:27.330> just<00:05:27.750> kind<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.020> saw

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
so I'm like YouTube I just kind of saw

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.810 
so I'm like YouTube I just kind of saw
this<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.560> googled<00:05:28.950> it<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.070> I<00:05:29.160> was<00:05:29.280> like<00:05:29.400> wait

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
this I googled it and I was like wait

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.520 
this I googled it and I was like wait
YouTube<00:05:30.240> started<00:05:30.570> supporting<00:05:30.780> this<00:05:31.050> like<00:05:31.200> way

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
YouTube started supporting this like way

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.710 
YouTube started supporting this like way
back<00:05:31.740> when<00:05:32.010> but<00:05:32.280> right<00:05:33.210> now<00:05:33.330> as<00:05:33.450> it<00:05:33.570> is

back when but right now as it is

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.170 
back when but right now as it is
I'd<00:05:34.020> say<00:05:34.290> about<00:05:34.410> 95%<00:05:34.830> of<00:05:35.340> youtubers<00:05:35.790> don't

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
I'd say about 95% of youtubers don't

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.570 
I'd say about 95% of youtubers don't
have<00:05:36.480> cameras<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.110> can<00:05:37.260> shoot<00:05:37.410> in<00:05:37.620> 2k<00:05:38.070> or

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
have cameras that can shoot in 2k or

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.190 
have cameras that can shoot in 2k or
even<00:05:38.790> 4k<00:05:39.150> for<00:05:39.300> that<00:05:39.420> matter<00:05:39.600> and<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.020> gotta

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
even 4k for that matter and you gotta

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.630 
even 4k for that matter and you gotta
you<00:05:40.440> gotta<00:05:40.620> kind<00:05:40.890> of<00:05:40.950> exclude<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.460> tech

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
you gotta kind of exclude the tech

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
community a little bit here because I

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.040

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
cameras and nice resolutions and I would

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.290 
cameras and nice resolutions and I would
almost<00:05:49.740> say<00:05:50.040> exclude<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.700> tech<00:05:50.850> community<00:05:50.970> a

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
almost say exclude the tech community a

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.870 
almost say exclude the tech community a
little<00:05:51.450> bit<00:05:51.600> but<00:05:52.260> 95%<00:05:52.890> of<00:05:53.190> youtubers<00:05:53.580> just

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
little bit but 95% of youtubers just

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
spend a ton of time on here I would

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.500
