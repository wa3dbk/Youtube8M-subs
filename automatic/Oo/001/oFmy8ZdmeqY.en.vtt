00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 then what I did I put in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.360
 marinate you see I also used one 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.570
 double film of ham of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.949
 fresh pork and I put it to marinate 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.619
 with some amy of the root of 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.590
 ginger and very hot chilli 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.700
 here are three hot peppers 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.110
 considered to keep it in the marina for 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 at least a couple of hours at this 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.920
 point we take a pan add 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.250
 oil and to increase the dose 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.539
 let's put a couple of these peppers 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 are the African peppers the most 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.710
 in short, they are very hot 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.590
 scent a couple of cloves of garlic that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.159
 however we will leave in shirt or rather 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
 keeping the outer film 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.970
 crushing them slightly like this 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.030
 resting the palm right and bringing 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.220
 so overweight the value of the pan 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.229
 this is what it takes here 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.689
 almost immediately temperatures it 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.580
 you see that already we see that the oil is 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.799
 there are almost all frying 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.040
 bubbles around the chili pepper 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.119
 to garlic we take our morsels 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.670
 tidbits we can slightly from 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.259
 fire because the oil is at temperature also 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.720
 excessive you saw then there is the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.579
 reaction that makes with the liquid part 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.869
 then some marinade and let's go to 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.869
 put all our tidbits 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.930
 I would say that's enough because we have to 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.630
 however leave enough space to 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.320
 to be able to move ours easily 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.480
 rather pretty flame morsels 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.480
 cheerful and let the cooking begin 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.780
 here you see that the effect of that is 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.090
 releasing all the pig aside 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.090
 of the navy she had absorbed 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:30.290
 perfect here you see here is so must 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:34.340
 come our pig we can 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:39.800
 push the fire at this point e 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.320
 let's add the cold slices 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.220
 cut as if it were some kind of 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.820
 salad 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:54.020
 we take two three rinse 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:58.730
 quickly here is the part of the seeds la 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.830
 we leave not because we want to avoid the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.080
 spiciness as you know we have loaded 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.440
 in a scary way so that's fine 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.400
 so 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.870
 only for the version of sensations below 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.590
 teeth 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:17.630
 let's take and throw the pans like that 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:22.400
 without reigniting the fire one must 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.150
 just slightly warm it up for not 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.930
 have a too violent detachment between the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:36.730
 warm of our ham and this 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.730
 simple white dish chili 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.959
 take a spoon and go to 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.959
 put our medial 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:57.209
 let's take a little of his bow 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.860
 so final touch the salt we do not 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.060
 we absolutely salted the dish is 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.160
 so we're doing it in this 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.550
 moment 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.790
 we put abundant and we also put to 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.010
 all around Christmas if one wants then 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.800
 dips the small piece in the salt here it is 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.160
 our spicy pork stumps are 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.160
 ready
