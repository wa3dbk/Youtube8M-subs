and<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.450> final<00:02:15.780> benefit<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.650> we<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:17.040> from

and the final benefit that we have from
our<00:02:17.700> sealer<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.870> since<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.350> not<00:02:19.500> a

you scratch the floor it will not be

you scratch the floor it will not be
damaged<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:24.840> therefore<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.470> don't<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.709> to
