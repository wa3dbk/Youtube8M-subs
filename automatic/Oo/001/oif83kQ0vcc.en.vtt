methods of doing this and I'll get to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.240 
methods of doing this and I'll get to
that<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.859> moment

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
that in a moment

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.340 
that in a moment
now<00:00:23.789> our<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.180> ingredient<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> be

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
now our first ingredient is going to be

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.040 
now our first ingredient is going to be
PVA<00:00:26.099> glue<00:00:26.420> then<00:00:27.420> we're<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> use<00:00:27.750> some

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
PVA glue then we're going to use some

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.950 
PVA glue then we're going to use some
water<00:00:29.480> borax<00:00:30.480> powder

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
water borax powder

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.380 
water borax powder
it's<00:00:31.410> available<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.890> chemists<00:00:32.430> I've<00:00:32.820> mixed<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
it's available in chemists I've mixed it

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
it's available in chemists I've mixed it
actually<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.930> some<00:00:34.280> water<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.579> bottle

the more water you put it you want to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.870 
the more water you put it you want to
take<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> bit<00:01:03.180> thicker<00:01:04.070> put<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.189> less<00:01:05.400> or

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
take a bit thicker put it in less or

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.500 
take a bit thicker put it in less or
leave<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.600> completely<00:01:08.270> it's<00:01:09.270> going<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
leave it out completely it's going to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.899 
leave it out completely it's going to
stop<00:01:09.720> very<00:01:09.990> quickly<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.880> food<00:01:11.880> coloring

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
stop very quickly with the food coloring

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.100 
stop very quickly with the food coloring
one<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:15.090> only<00:01:15.479> need<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.869> tiny

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
one now you really only need a tiny

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.660 
one now you really only need a tiny
amount<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:16.710> using<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.100> kebab<00:01:17.520> skewer

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
amount so I'm using this kebab skewer

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
amount so I'm using this kebab skewer
just<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> dip<00:01:18.720> into<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.259> color<00:01:19.939> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.560> give

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
just to dip into the color and then give

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.820 
just to dip into the color and then give
it<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.710> mix<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> we've<00:01:24.750> got<00:01:24.930> quite<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.350> nice<00:01:25.470> pink

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
it a mix so we've got quite a nice pink

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.929 
it a mix so we've got quite a nice pink
there<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.380> second<00:01:28.920> method<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.909> use

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
there and the second method is to use

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.359 
there and the second method is to use
beetroot<00:01:30.720> juice<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.409> I've<00:01:31.650> taken<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.130> just

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
beetroot juice now I've taken this just

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.480 
beetroot juice now I've taken this just
out<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.759> pack<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> beetroot<00:01:33.890> we<00:01:34.890> mix<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.520> in

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
out of a pack of beetroot we mix that in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.260 
out of a pack of beetroot we mix that in
let's<00:01:38.490> give<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.880> slightly<00:01:39.119> different

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
this is the food right now doesn't

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.150

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
we had our borax and we give it a good

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.500 
we had our borax and we give it a good
stir<00:02:08.619> as<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.800> can<00:02:09.950> see<00:02:10.160> all<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.270> liquid

stir as you can see all of that liquid
is<00:02:11.780> being<00:02:11.930> absorbed<00:02:12.290> into<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.770> slime<00:02:14.200> once

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
is being absorbed into the slime once

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.540 
is being absorbed into the slime once
you<00:02:15.350> get<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.740> stage<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.220> know<00:02:16.370> you're

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
ready and then same with the beetroot

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.390 
ready and then same with the beetroot
slime<00:02:23.650> doesn't<00:02:24.650> take<00:02:24.830> long

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
slime doesn't take long

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.090 
slime doesn't take long
give<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> stir<00:02:26.090> then<00:02:26.840> as<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.170> can<00:02:27.290> see<00:02:27.530> all
