is then discarded so L rest now has this

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.180 
is then discarded so L rest now has this
item<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:51.959> his<00:03:52.079> possession<00:03:52.379> you<00:03:52.860> can<00:03:53.010> use<00:03:53.159> it

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
item in his possession you can use it

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.890
