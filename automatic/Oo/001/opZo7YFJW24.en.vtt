00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.029
 today we are going to prepare a delicious dessert 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.830
 three milks first let's make a 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.330
 cake the cake would be done 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.710
 normal the ingredients are going to be 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.689
 yeast sugar flour margarine or tui 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.689
 bread eggs and milk 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 well, as you can see, we have already made the mixture 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.909
 that would be sugar flour the envelope of 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.489
 yeast and milk now let's 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.039
 throw the eggs is worth it and then what 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.170
 we passed this mold there are people who 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.180
 like to throw butter and sugar 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.920
 that the cake does not stay pegadito to 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.810
 I personally like it much more 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.080
 put this paper 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.580
 with the round shape but already each one 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.030
 put as you are used to and as 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.030
 want 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.380
 Now let's move everything with our 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.240
 rods and we're going to add the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.400
 butter that we have melted in the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.460
 microwave we just took our 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.840
 biscuit has been at 180 degrees during 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.640
 40 minutes 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.340
 now let's leave about 10 minutes 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.659
 it's cool we let it cool and 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.180
 now we 're going to split it in half 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.750
 well with the help of this roll for 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.750
 pastry 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.630
 after having opened the cake we are going 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.180
 to need three types of milk milk 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.670
 evaporated condensed milk and milk 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.710
 normal cow or soy strawberries for the 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.220
 filling and chantilly to decorate the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.220
 top part 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.930
 is that we are going to use is half a can of 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.180
 can milk condensed milk can 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.090
 evaporated 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.170
 and about 10 teaspoons of cow's milk 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.119
 or soy milk 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.390
 we're going to throw everything in a bowl to go 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.390
 stirring 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.899
 good as we saw imported a strawberry 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.910
 in slices to then fill 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 ok this is the aspect that has to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.030
 stay in our milk in one color 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.160
 you have to try it yellow and it has 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.740
 that being pretty sweet now we're going to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.900
 start throwing it in the cake without 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.640
 scared so it's pretty good 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.590
 Boys 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.920
 the cake will little by little be going 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.130
 drinking vale 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.220
 we are going to do this process in both 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.410
 parts of the cake 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.870
 well, as you can see, we have soaked the two 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.000
 cupcakes does not matter if it gets wet 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.970
 because then go absorbing now 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.230
 let's take the strawberries and go to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.230
 cover the whole cake 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.420
 they seem for the voice up so much but the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.420
 truth that they are very rich 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.700
 good to make the chantilly are 200 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.140
 milliliters of very cold milk plus 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.770
 chantilly what we do is take the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.320
 about cold milk now let's put 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.000
 the other capita of pie here is that 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.820
 take it very carefully because it is 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.860
 soaked and you can break the we take 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.860
 carefully and we turn it over 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.330
 with 200 milliliters of very cold milk 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.330
 we throw the envelope of chantilly 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.440
 and now let's move with the blender to 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.150
 maximum power until a 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.930
 mix that when we overturned the pileup 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.930
 do not overturn 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.850
 then you see we have already done the chantilly and 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.280
 it is a mass that when we put finished 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.470
 the pileup does not fall is very rich 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.180
 What we are going to do is take the 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.800
 Chantilly on the cake and those who 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.300
 have dye then let's reserve 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.080
 a little chantilly for then 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.080
 decorate it with coloring 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.760
 so be a little careful 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.260
 that we do not mix the cake with the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.260
 chantilly we were all white 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.760
 well after the help of our 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.750
 camera that is the specialist in 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.610
 decoration we are going to take the strawberries that 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.610
 we have cut to decorate 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.730
 let's just finish making the cake the 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.340
 we have to put in the refrigerator 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.360
 because when carrying so much milk it tends to 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.360
 get off pretty 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.099
 good to those that you want because you already have 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.750
 the cake made and those that you have 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.970
 coloring what we are going to do is the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.039
 dye we have made as a kind of a 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.620
 coral color we put it in the sleeve 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.120
 pastry and then I have the expiration 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.490
 we go for so let 's coming 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.880
 decorating I'm going to decorate because he has not 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.160
 was left a lot chantilly by the edge 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.060
 as you see a pretty nice color that 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.060
 stick with the cake 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.520
 Well, as you can see, this is the 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.080
 result the pint is pretty good 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.300
 he assured that the taste is even better 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.860
 Now what we are going to do is leave it in 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.419
 the refrigerator approximately one 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.419
 horita and now we can eat it
