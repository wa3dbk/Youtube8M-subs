 one of the user who talked that to do 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.160
 wine with pause on this machine here I 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.890
 I liked, for example, to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.170
 record the video and then here on the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.350
 test here on your side the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.930
 preview button failed to launch on 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.269
 preview is a close he pauses 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.309
 then squeeze it again it comes back to record 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.040
 but from the tests I did 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.380
 previously he does not do this personally 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.670
 He is to show you here my 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.629
 hang time I'm filming or squeezing the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.690
 button in the preview to pause the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.690

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.359

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:10.740

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.729
 also not display 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.310
 He did not pause at the moment. 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.040
 of recording or recording is 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.040
 continue without pressing again the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.500
 button on the machine to record and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.630
 simply cut it off and it 's that 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 Are not you going to enjoy it more? 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.770

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 I can not now if someone knows of a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.729
