so<00:00:01.770> I'm<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> show<00:00:02.790> you<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.060> make<00:00:03.330> a

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
so I'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.519 
so I'm going to show you how to make a
corner<00:00:03.840> template<00:00:04.500> for<00:00:05.400> example<00:00:06.049> for<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.080> Corian

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.730 
corner template for example for a Corian
countertop<00:00:08.630> this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.809> really<00:00:10.080> useful<00:00:10.500> if

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
countertop this is really useful if

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.009 
countertop this is really useful if
you've<00:00:11.460> got<00:00:11.730> something<00:00:12.150> that's<00:00:12.330> an<00:00:12.450> unusual

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
you've got something that's an unusual

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.980 
you've got something that's an unusual
shape<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.099> actually<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.990> semi

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
shape like this is actually a semi

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.029 
shape like this is actually a semi
hexagonal<00:00:16.980> almost<00:00:17.789> seeming<00:00:18.449> octagonal<00:00:19.170> dry

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039

hexagonal almost seeming octagonal dry
sink<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:21.150> order<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.779> get<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.619> odd<00:00:22.980> angle

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
sink and in order to get this odd angle

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.080 
sink and in order to get this odd angle
it's<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.119> 120<00:00:24.779> degree<00:00:25.170> angle<00:00:25.529> I've<00:00:26.340> got<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.760> tell

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it's a 120 degree angle I've got to tell

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.800 
it's a 120 degree angle I've got to tell
the<00:00:28.939> guy<00:00:29.939> who's<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> fabricate<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the guy who's going to fabricate the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.889 
the guy who's going to fabricate the
Quarian<00:00:31.520> what<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.759> angle<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.690> do

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
Quarian what this angle is going to do

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.380 
Quarian what this angle is going to do
and<00:00:34.230> how<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.770> relates<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> size<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
and how that relates to the size of the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.299 
and how that relates to the size of the
whole<00:00:36.540> piece<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:39.660> first<00:00:39.930> step<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.980> cut

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
whole piece so the first step is to cut

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
whole piece so the first step is to cut
a<00:00:41.520> piece<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:44.210> cardboard<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.570> actually

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
a piece of cardboard that's actually

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
a piece of cardboard that's actually
smaller<00:00:46.440> than<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.920> Corian<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.239> way

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
smaller than your Corian all the way

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.380 
smaller than your Corian all the way
around<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.680> fits<00:00:50.059> easily<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
around so this just fits easily and it

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.450 
around so this just fits easily and it
doesn't<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:52.020> neat<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.590> anything<00:00:54.320> so

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
doesn't have to be neat or anything so

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.840 
doesn't have to be neat or anything so
there<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.920> poorly

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
there as you can see that's my poorly

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.929 
there as you can see that's my poorly
fitted<00:01:00.500> template<00:01:01.500> from<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.309> from<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> top

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.090 

now<00:01:09.409> how<00:01:10.409> am<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> tell<00:01:10.860> them<00:01:11.010> what

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
now how am I going to tell them what

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.859 
now how am I going to tell them what
this<00:01:11.250> angle<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.700> well<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> need<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this angle is well I need to make a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.800 
this angle is well I need to make a
corner<00:01:13.790> I've<00:01:14.790> been<00:01:14.970> experimenting<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.720> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
corner I've been experimenting and I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330 
corner I've been experimenting and I
figured<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> way<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.130> not

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
figured out a way to do this that's not

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700 
figured out a way to do this that's not
that<00:01:17.490> hard<00:01:17.900> what<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.470> take<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that hard what you want to do is take a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
that hard what you want to do is take a
small<00:01:19.979> piece<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.189> cardboard<00:01:20.490> again<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
small piece of cardboard again it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.980 
small piece of cardboard again it
doesn't<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.810> pretty<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:24.780> want

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
doesn't have to be pretty and you want

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.999 
doesn't have to be pretty and you want
to<00:01:25.140> score<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:26.360> lengthwise<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.900> I'm<00:01:28.799> just

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to score it lengthwise and I'm just

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.420 
to score it lengthwise and I'm just
using<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.610> utility<00:01:30.150> knife<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.340> what<00:01:32.340> I'm

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
using it to a utility knife and what I'm

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.450 
using it to a utility knife and what I'm
scoring<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> I'm<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.659> cutting<00:01:33.900> through<00:01:34.460> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
scoring it I'm just cutting through the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.560 
scoring it I'm just cutting through the
first<00:01:35.850> layer<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:38.430> corrugation<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.479> I'm

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
first layer of the corrugation so I'm

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
first layer of the corrugation so I'm
not<00:01:39.750> coming<00:01:40.049> through<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:41.400> just

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
not coming through the back I'm just

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.179 
not coming through the back I'm just
scoring<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> front<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> now<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.860> bend<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
scoring the front so now I can bend it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.999 
scoring the front so now I can bend it
easily<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:46.049> now<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.259> has<00:01:46.409> got<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> happy<00:01:46.770> way

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
easily and now this has got a happy way

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.830 
easily and now this has got a happy way
to<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:49.229> bend<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.340> I'm<00:01:51.060> gonna<00:01:51.210> give<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.630> bend

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
to to bend so I'm gonna give it a bend

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.810 
to to bend so I'm gonna give it a bend
again<00:01:52.560> does<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.280> matter<00:01:53.430> where<00:01:53.790> or

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
again does it really matter where or

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.170 
again does it really matter where or
just<00:01:54.180> want<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> good<00:01:54.540> Bend<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> need<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
just want a good Bend and now I need to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
just want a good Bend and now I need to
make<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> cut<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.079> has<00:01:58.290> legs<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.979> starting

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
make the cut so it has legs so starting

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.330 
make the cut so it has legs so starting
at<00:01:59.549> that<00:02:00.229> starting<00:02:01.229> exactly<00:02:01.950> where<00:02:02.100> I've<00:02:02.189> got

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
at that starting exactly where I've got

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.240 
at that starting exactly where I've got
my<00:02:02.520> score<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.869> down<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.590> my

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
my score and going down on my

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.150 
my score and going down on my
I'm<00:02:05.640> gonna<00:02:05.820> cut<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:06.780> through<00:02:07.160> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
I'm gonna cut all the way through the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.520 
I'm gonna cut all the way through the
carpet<00:02:09.290> so<00:02:10.290> what<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> thought<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:12.500> actually<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
carpet so what I thought is actually a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.610 
carpet so what I thought is actually a
little<00:02:13.860> piece<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.610> will<00:02:15.420> Bend<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:16.140> this

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
little piece that will Bend like this

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:26.120 
little piece that will Bend like this
and<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.170> exactly<00:02:19.910> what<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> need<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:25.130> this

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
and that is exactly what I need in this

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.490 
and that is exactly what I need in this
corner<00:02:26.520> now<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:28.890> lay<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.520> on<00:02:30.110> top<00:02:31.110> of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
corner now you just lay this on top of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.240 
corner now you just lay this on top of
your<00:02:31.620> torch<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:33.000> you're<00:02:33.330> already<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:35.010> a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
your torch of you're already in a

your torch of you're already in a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
smaller than life-size corrugated

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.330 
smaller than life-size corrugated
template<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.170> ensure<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.800> rest<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
template you ensure that the rest of it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.360 
template you ensure that the rest of it
is<00:02:41.520> flush<00:02:41.850> up<00:02:42.060> against<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> edges<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:44.310> you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
is flush up against the edges and you

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.580 
is flush up against the edges and you
start<00:02:44.790> taping<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.270> one<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.630> place<00:02:45.870> this

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
start taping this one in place this

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.350 
start taping this one in place this
would<00:02:46.800> be<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.130> case<00:02:47.400> where<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.760> was<00:02:47.850> easier<00:02:48.240> to

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
would be a case where it was easier to

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.870 
would be a case where it was easier to
go<00:02:48.510> eight<00:02:49.500> hands<00:02:49.890> than<00:02:50.370> mine<00:02:50.850> too<00:02:51.680> but<00:02:52.730> if<00:02:53.730> you

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
go eight hands than mine too but if you

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.400 
go eight hands than mine too but if you
can<00:02:54.060> see<00:02:54.360> once<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.140> start<00:02:55.440> taping<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.950> down

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
can see once you start taping this down

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.970 
can see once you start taping this down
there<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.500> go<00:02:58.650> what<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.670> end<00:02:59.850> up<00:02:59.970> with

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
there we go what you end up with

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.470 
there we go what you end up with
accurately<00:03:01.980> shows<00:03:04.100> what<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.190> angle<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.420> that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
accurately shows what the angle of that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.390 
accurately shows what the angle of that
cameras<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:07.980> were<00:03:08.100> looking

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
cameras and that's what we were looking

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.340 
cameras and that's what we were looking
for<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:11.000> if<00:03:12.000> we<00:03:12.300> go<00:03:12.450> around<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.110> same

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
for so if we go around and do the same

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.670 
for so if we go around and do the same
thing<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.980> all<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.640> other<00:03:14.820> corners<00:03:15.680> what

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
thing in all of the other corners what

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.040 
thing in all of the other corners what
you'll<00:03:16.860> end<00:03:16.890> up<00:03:17.220> with<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:18.150> perfectly<00:03:18.810> sized

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
you'll end up with is a perfectly sized

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.140 
you'll end up with is a perfectly sized
template<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.830> it's<00:03:20.160> easier<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.790> do<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.090> than

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
template and it's easier to do this than

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.690 
template and it's easier to do this than
to<00:03:21.480> attempt<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.170> cut<00:03:22.500> one<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:23.400> would<00:03:23.580> have

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
to attempt to cut one that would have

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.300 
to attempt to cut one that would have
fit<00:03:23.970> square<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.110> true<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.680> first<00:03:25.980> time

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
fit square and true the first time

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.170 
fit square and true the first time
around<00:03:26.580> so<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.570> hope<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.140> helpful<00:03:29.180> again

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
around so I hope this is helpful again

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.699 
around so I hope this is helpful again
the<00:03:30.330> process<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.989> making<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.500> little

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
the process for making that little

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.250 
the process for making that little
corner<00:03:32.040> I'll<00:03:32.250> do<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.459> one<00:03:32.640> more<00:03:32.790> time<00:03:33.260> you're

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
corner I'll do it one more time you're

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.470 
corner I'll do it one more time you're
gonna<00:03:34.549> first<00:03:35.549> take<00:03:35.820> any<00:03:36.000> old<00:03:36.120> piece<00:03:36.330> of

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
gonna first take any old piece of

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.930 
gonna first take any old piece of
cardboard<00:03:37.040> cut<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.570> there<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.690> go

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.920 

you're<00:03:42.420> gonna<00:03:42.510> want<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.900> score<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.930> through

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
you're gonna want to score it so through

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.500 
you're gonna want to score it so through
the<00:03:46.049> first<00:03:46.080> layer<00:03:46.739> but<00:03:47.310> not<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.730> entire<00:03:48.090> thing

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the first layer but not the entire thing

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.900 
the first layer but not the entire thing
of<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.950> corrugation<00:03:50.580> so<00:03:50.850> I'm<00:03:50.940> going<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.150> score

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
of the corrugation so I'm going to score

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.530 
of the corrugation so I'm going to score
badly

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
badly

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.699 
badly
like<00:03:56.140> this<00:03:57.810> then<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:59.170> want<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.799> fold<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.709> in

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
like this then I want to fold it in

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.170 
like this then I want to fold it in
order<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.099> give<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.310> somewhere<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.879> make<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
order to give it somewhere to make the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.220 
order to give it somewhere to make the
legs<00:04:04.560> that's<00:04:05.560> folded<00:04:06.720> then<00:04:07.720> you<00:04:07.840> want<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.049> cut

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
legs that's folded then you want to cut

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.600 
legs that's folded then you want to cut
from<00:04:08.500> my<00:04:08.680> corrugations

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
from my corrugations

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.809 
from my corrugations
from<00:04:09.909> a<00:04:10.030> little<00:04:10.239> score<00:04:10.420> line<00:04:10.659> down<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:12.519> that's

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
from a little score line down and that's

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.869 
from a little score line down and that's
what<00:04:13.150> gives<00:04:13.299> me<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:14.129> legs<00:04:15.129> that<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.549> can<00:04:15.730> make<00:04:15.849> a

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
what gives me the legs that I can make a

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.029 
what gives me the legs that I can make a
quarter<00:04:16.329> with<00:04:16.539> and<00:04:17.289> then<00:04:17.410> I'm<00:04:17.530> gonna<00:04:17.650> put<00:04:17.889> this

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
quarter with and then I'm gonna put this

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.629 
quarter with and then I'm gonna put this
one<00:04:18.310> over<00:04:18.579> in<00:04:19.150> this<00:04:19.329> corner<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:20.320> tape<00:04:21.190> it<00:04:21.400> down

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
one over in this corner and tape it down

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.010 
one over in this corner and tape it down
and<00:04:22.530> build<00:04:23.530> in<00:04:23.710> corner<00:04:23.979> by<00:04:24.100> corner<00:04:25.020> I've

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
and build in corner by corner I've

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.140 
and build in corner by corner I've
created<00:04:26.350> a<00:04:26.590> template<00:04:26.949> and<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.430> suggests

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
created a template and that suggests

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.390 
created a template and that suggests
that<00:04:28.360> when<00:04:28.539> you<00:04:28.690> do<00:04:28.840> this<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.770> do<00:04:29.949> two

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
that when you do this you do two

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.640 
that when you do this you do two
opposite<00:04:31.240> corners<00:04:31.270> first<00:04:32.080> just<00:04:32.470> so<00:04:32.590> you

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
opposite corners first just so you

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.710 
opposite corners first just so you
secure<00:04:33.220> your<00:04:33.490> smaller<00:04:33.970> template<00:04:34.479> in<00:04:34.570> place

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
secure your smaller template in place

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.700 
secure your smaller template in place
