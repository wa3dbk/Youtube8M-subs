00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
system one of my favorite parts of this

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.869 
system one of my favorite parts of this
is<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.019> fact<00:01:03.230> that<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:03.469> really<00:01:03.649> gives<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:04.250> two

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
is the fact that it really gives you two

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.410 
is the fact that it really gives you two
axes<00:01:05.540> on<00:01:05.810> which<00:01:06.230> to<00:01:06.770> base<00:01:07.010> your<00:01:07.580> adventures

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
axes on which to base your adventures

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.600

before<00:01:08.870> we<00:01:09.200> get<00:01:09.350> into<00:01:09.560> those<00:01:09.680> axes<00:01:10.160> we<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.490> to

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
before we get into those axes we have to

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.340 
before we get into those axes we have to
talk<00:01:10.760> about<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.180> sanity<00:01:11.600> mechanic<00:01:12.020> because

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
talk about the sanity mechanic because

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.140 
talk about the sanity mechanic because
when<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:12.800> talk<00:01:13.040> about<00:01:13.220> web<00:01:13.550> crafts<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.090> we

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
when we talk about web crafts and we

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150 
when we talk about web crafts and we
talked<00:01:14.390> about<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.750> Cthulhu<00:01:14.990> Mythos<00:01:15.410> we<00:01:15.920> have

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
talked about the Cthulhu Mythos we have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.920 
talked about the Cthulhu Mythos we have
to<00:01:16.310> end<00:01:16.490> up<00:01:16.640> sitting<00:01:16.910> in<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.210> corner<00:01:17.450> soiling

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
to end up sitting in the corner soiling

down<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.700> cuckoo<00:02:08.000> spiral<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.780> really<00:02:09.140> are<00:02:09.610> so

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
down the cuckoo spiral you really are so

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.880 
down the cuckoo spiral you really are so
the<00:02:10.789> way<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.030> use<00:02:11.269> those<00:02:11.689> two<00:02:11.900> axes<00:02:12.379> in<00:02:12.620> in

the way to use those two axes in in

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.440 
the way to use those two axes in in
combining<00:02:13.400> them<00:02:13.549> is<00:02:13.700> something<00:02:13.909> like<00:02:14.090> this

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
combining them is something like this

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.479 
combining them is something like this
you've<00:02:14.569> got<00:02:14.780> heroic<00:02:15.500> horror<00:02:15.739> which<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.129> pulpy

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.820 
pulpy
that<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.450> take<00:02:18.630> damage<00:02:18.900> kind<00:02:19.680> of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that is you you can take damage kind of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.380 
that is you you can take damage kind of
you<00:02:20.130> can<00:02:20.280> take<00:02:20.430> damage<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.120> don't<00:02:21.300> go

that's easy

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.930 
that's easy
then<00:02:22.530> there's<00:02:22.740> slippery<00:02:23.160> slope<00:02:23.520> which<00:02:23.910> is

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
then there's slippery slope which is

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.570 
then there's slippery slope which is

this<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.520> for<00:02:38.730> example<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.630> could<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:39.959> a

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
this in for example you could do a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.250 
this in for example you could do a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
rrah or you could do something like a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.350 
rrah or you could do something like a
Delta<00:02:48.450> green<00:02:48.690> or<00:02:49.670> paranormal<00:02:50.670> investigations

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
Delta green or paranormal investigations

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.240 
Delta green or paranormal investigations
which<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.780> physically<00:02:52.380> not<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.830> damaging

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
which is physically not that damaging
