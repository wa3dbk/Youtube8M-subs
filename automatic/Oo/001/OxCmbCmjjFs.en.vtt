00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the statewide is worth two so you could

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.830

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
around this but what Democrats certainly

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.020 
around this but what Democrats certainly

in Pennsylvania and around the country

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.630 
in Pennsylvania and around the country
have<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.420> do<00:02:29.599> is<00:02:29.810> prove<00:02:30.500> how<00:02:30.709> distasteful<00:02:31.250> and

to go into Pennsylvania but the flip
side<00:03:01.549> of<00:03:01.819> that<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:03.349> it<00:03:03.590> marginalizes<00:03:04.130> you

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
side of that is that it marginalizes you
