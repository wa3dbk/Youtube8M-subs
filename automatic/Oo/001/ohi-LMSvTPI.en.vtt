00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400 
I've got heat on this tire as you can
see<00:03:21.610> my<00:03:21.790> torpedo<00:03:22.390> heater<00:03:22.569> their<00:03:22.930> glowing

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
see my torpedo heater their glowing

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.790 
see my torpedo heater their glowing
white<00:03:23.890> hot<00:03:24.720> that's<00:03:25.720> heating<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.290> tire<00:03:26.530> up

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
white hot that's heating this tire up

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.699 
white hot that's heating this tire up
which<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:27.970> turn<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.330> going<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.540> cause<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.290> glue

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
which in turn is going to cause the glue

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.520 
which in turn is going to cause the glue
in<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.760> plug<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:32.319> cure<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.780> put<00:03:34.780> pressure<00:03:35.290> in

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
in that plug to cure so put pressure in

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.350 
in that plug to cure so put pressure in
the<00:03:35.620> tire

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
the tire

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.540 
the tire
and<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.810> tire<00:03:38.020> will<00:03:38.170> be<00:03:38.260> hot<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.770> it'll<00:03:39.370> have

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
and the tire will be hot and it'll have

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.920 
and the tire will be hot and it'll have
the<00:03:39.580> right<00:03:39.910> amount<00:03:40.180> of<00:03:40.240> air<00:03:40.360> pressure<00:03:40.660> in

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
the right amount of air pressure in

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.470 
the right amount of air pressure in
there<00:03:41.080> that<00:03:41.680> plug<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.070> going<00:03:42.520> to<00:03:42.730> adhere<00:03:42.880> to

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
there that plug is going to adhere to

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.240 
there that plug is going to adhere to
the<00:03:43.720> wall<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> tire<00:03:44.440> or<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:44.860> whole<00:03:45.040> would

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
the wall of the tire or the whole would

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.309 
the wall of the tire or the whole would
retire

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
retire

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.110 
retire
that<00:03:47.530> should<00:03:47.859> seal<00:03:48.129> it<00:03:48.310> up

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.710 

it<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.690> how<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:53.930> do<00:03:54.650> that

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
it is how you do that

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.270 
it is how you do that
the<00:03:57.020> other<00:03:57.170> side<00:03:57.470> is<00:03:57.680> doing<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.950> same<00:03:58.130> thing

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
the other side is doing the same thing

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.730 
the other side is doing the same thing
just<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.700> slow<00:04:00.090> slow<00:04:00.540> leak<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.020> I<00:04:01.170> really<00:04:01.590> hate

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
just a slow slow leak and I really hate

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.300 
just a slow slow leak and I really hate
that

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
that

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.180 
that
you<00:04:03.730> know<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:03.910> don't<00:04:04.270> like<00:04:04.420> have

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:17.740 

anyway<00:04:09.640> that's<00:04:10.270> what<00:04:10.750> I've<00:04:10.870> got<00:04:11.110> here

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.949 

it<00:04:18.019> looks<00:04:18.290> good<00:04:18.500> or<00:04:18.709> maybe

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.150 

pretty<00:04:21.410> simple

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.770 

at<00:04:24.550> my<00:04:24.730> all-purpose<00:04:25.920> thing<00:04:26.920> here

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
at my all-purpose thing here

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.140 
at my all-purpose thing here
here<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:30.510> scissors

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
here it is scissors

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.399 
here it is scissors
and<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.630> reason<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:34.080> trim<00:04:34.470> it

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
and the reason you trim it

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.600 
and the reason you trim it
is<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.099> if<00:04:36.159> you<00:04:36.309> actually<00:04:36.610> spin<00:04:37.089> your<00:04:37.269> tire

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
is so if you actually spin your tire

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.530 
is so if you actually spin your tire
it<00:04:38.849> won't

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
it won't

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.010 
it won't
it<00:04:41.020> won't<00:04:41.230> it<00:04:41.560> won't<00:04:41.590> pull<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.040> plug<00:04:42.280> out<00:04:42.460> is

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
it won't it won't pull the plug out is

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.920 
it won't it won't pull the plug out is
that's<00:04:44.020> the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
that's the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.520 
that's the
I<00:04:46.280> got<00:04:47.280> my<00:04:47.400> knife<00:04:47.580> physicist<00:04:48.270> would<00:04:48.419> more<00:04:48.660> it's

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
I got my knife physicist would more it's

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.040 
I got my knife physicist would more it's
too<00:04:49.740> warm

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.100 

well<00:06:27.310> maybe<00:06:27.610> this<00:06:27.849> tire<00:06:28.150> is<00:06:28.180> just<00:06:28.599> low<00:06:28.810> the

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
well maybe this tire is just low the

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.390 
well maybe this tire is just low the
other<00:06:29.259> thing<00:06:29.560> is<00:06:29.680> it<00:06:29.860> could<00:06:29.949> be<00:06:30.099> the<00:06:30.190> valve

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
other thing is it could be the valve

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.530 
other thing is it could be the valve
stem

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.360 

I<00:06:34.600> mean<00:06:35.170> it's<00:06:35.290> still<00:06:35.320> had<00:06:35.590> like<00:06:35.830> 30<00:06:36.130> pounds

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
I mean it's still had like 30 pounds

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.180 
I mean it's still had like 30 pounds
arenít<00:06:37.030> which

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.920 

sounds<00:06:40.430> like<00:06:40.520> a<00:06:40.580> lot<00:06:40.850> but<00:06:41.030> for<00:06:41.240> this<00:06:41.330> truck<00:06:41.690> now

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
sounds like a lot but for this truck now

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:49.970 
sounds like a lot but for this truck now
it's<00:06:42.200> not

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.070 

I'm<00:06:50.250> thinking<00:06:50.520> that<00:06:50.940> maybe<00:06:51.180> the<00:06:51.510> valve<00:06:51.720> stems

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080

I'm thinking that maybe the valve stems
