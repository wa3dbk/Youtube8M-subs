I<00:00:15.330> come<00:00:15.870> today<00:00:16.110> -<00:00:16.800> brilliant<00:00:17.040> -<00:00:17.280> you<00:00:17.460> might

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
I come today - brilliant - you might

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.780 
I come today - brilliant - you might
concoct<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.420> version<00:00:19.050> -<00:00:19.340> which<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.490> just

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
concoct a version - which I just

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.780 
concoct a version - which I just
recently<00:00:21.029> put<00:00:21.540> together<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:22.310> chose<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.610> do<00:00:23.759> a

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
recently put together I chose to do a

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.519 
recently put together I chose to do a
few<00:00:24.119> things<00:00:24.360> differently<00:00:24.540> this<00:00:25.020> time

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
few things differently this time

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.390 
few things differently this time
of<00:00:26.520> course<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.480> helps<00:00:27.779> more<00:00:27.960> power<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.950> now<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
of course it helps more power and now it

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.790 
of course it helps more power and now it
is<00:00:29.580> an<00:00:30.090> absolute<00:00:30.660> animal<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.439> actually

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
is an absolute animal it's actually

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.110 
is an absolute animal it's actually
scary<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.310> fly<00:00:32.520> I've<00:00:33.450> gone<00:00:33.690> with<00:00:35.120> these

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
scary to fly I've gone with these

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.240 
scary to fly I've gone with these
scorpion<00:00:36.720> motors<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.320> can't<00:00:37.680> remember<00:00:37.829> exactly

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
scorpion motors I can't remember exactly

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.330 
scorpion motors I can't remember exactly
what<00:00:39.440> KB<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.590> were<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.890> I'll<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.130> read<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
what KB they were so I'll just read it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.800 
what KB they were so I'll just read it
out<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:42.239> s<00:00:42.809> -<00:00:43.200> 2<00:00:44.010> -<00:00:44.520> 1<00:00:44.550> 5<00:00:46.490> 1127<00:00:47.540> kilovolt<00:00:48.540> I

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
out there s - 2 - 1 5 1127 kilovolt I

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.530 
out there s - 2 - 1 5 1127 kilovolt I
believe<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> stock<00:00:49.920> ones<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.430> nine<00:00:51.300> hundred

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
believe the stock ones a nine hundred

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.200 
believe the stock ones a nine hundred
kilowatts<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.530> there's<00:00:53.490> an<00:00:53.700> extra<00:00:54.000> couple

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
kilowatts that there's an extra couple

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.650 
kilowatts that there's an extra couple
of<00:00:54.300> hundred<00:00:54.360> rpm<00:00:55.080> on<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.380> rotors<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.660> I've

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
of hundred rpm on the rotors and I've

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.780 
of hundred rpm on the rotors and I've
also<00:00:57.840> changed<00:00:58.200> the<00:00:58.410> propellers<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.950> Grovner<00:00:59.520> I

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
also changed the propellers to Grovner I

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.540 
also changed the propellers to Grovner I
props<00:01:00.090> which<00:01:00.720> supposedly<00:01:01.680> more<00:01:01.860> reliable<00:01:02.400> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
props which supposedly more reliable and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.260 
props which supposedly more reliable and
better<00:01:02.790> belts<00:01:03.769> these<00:01:04.769> propellers<00:01:05.240> require<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
better belts these propellers require a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.560 
better belts these propellers require a
bit<00:01:06.540> more<00:01:06.570> rpm<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.520> keep<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.759> copter<00:01:09.270> flying

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
bit more rpm to keep the copter flying

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.569 
bit more rpm to keep the copter flying
so<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.110> why<00:01:10.290> we've<00:01:10.439> got<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.920> high<00:01:11.040> kv

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
so that's why we've got the high kv

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.550 
so that's why we've got the high kv
motors<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.119> well<00:01:12.329> just<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> propeller<00:01:13.350> design

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
motors as well just the propeller design

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.980 
motors as well just the propeller design
itself<00:01:14.250> oh<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:17.130> other<00:01:17.280> thing<00:01:17.610> I've<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
itself oh the other thing I've got a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.230 
itself oh the other thing I've got a

Thunder Power 2250 M le M for sale pack

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.560 
Thunder Power 2250 M le M for sale pack
now<00:01:24.479> instead<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> 3-cell<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.270> again<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
now instead of a 3-cell and again that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.000 
now instead of a 3-cell and again that
just<00:01:27.780> gives<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.200> extra<00:01:28.470> couple<00:01:28.860> hundred

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
just gives it that extra couple hundred

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.120 
just gives it that extra couple hundred
for<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> end<00:01:29.940> like<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.890> wouldn't

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
for out the end like this you wouldn't

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.670 
for out the end like this you wouldn't
believe<00:01:32.250> they're<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> same<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.240> thing<00:01:33.479> is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
believe they're the same this thing is

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.840 
believe they're the same this thing is
it's<00:01:34.680> also<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.040> bit<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:35.400> efficient<00:01:35.760> I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it's also a little bit more efficient I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.340 
it's also a little bit more efficient I
guess<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.590> assists<00:01:37.590> an<00:01:37.710> animal<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:39.350> I'll

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
guess but assists an animal now I'll

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.289 
guess but assists an animal now I'll
probably<00:01:40.650> fly<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> three<00:01:41.820> cell<00:01:42.060> pack

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
probably fly it with the three cell pack

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.910 
probably fly it with the three cell pack
on<00:01:42.479> when<00:01:42.690> I'm<00:01:42.780> doing<00:01:43.110> filming<00:01:43.500> stuff<00:01:43.710> like

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
on when I'm doing filming stuff like

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.530 
on when I'm doing filming stuff like
that<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.640> bit<00:01:44.760> more<00:01:44.790> docile<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
that just to make it a bit more docile I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.789 
that just to make it a bit more docile I
really<00:01:45.810> don't<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.320> need<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> four

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
really don't think you need the four

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.359 
really don't think you need the four

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
probably a good time to sort of now that

probably a good time to sort of now that
I'm<00:01:59.640> home<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.030> introduce<00:02:00.510> like<00:02:00.960> micro<00:02:01.409> parts

I've been making like these legs for the
quad<00:02:07.740> which<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.810> GoPro<00:02:10.049> plate<00:02:10.590> to

extend the GoPro I make this I call it
the<00:02:14.459> naked<00:02:14.849> eye<00:02:15.090> for<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.599> GoPro<00:02:16.230> let's<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.769> if

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
the naked eye for the GoPro let's so if

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.130 
the naked eye for the GoPro let's so if
you<00:02:17.700> did<00:02:17.909> share<00:02:18.180> corner<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> stains

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
you did share corner and the stains

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.280 
you did share corner and the stains
aren't<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:20.370> something<00:02:20.849> abrasive<00:02:21.290> it'll
