00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
in Park City Utah with norm and norm can

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.250 
in Park City Utah with norm and norm can
you<00:00:08.400> tell<00:00:08.549> us<00:00:08.580> about<00:00:08.760> your<00:00:08.910> water<00:00:09.090> system<00:00:09.540> yeah

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
you tell us about your water system yeah

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.010 
you tell us about your water system yeah
I<00:00:10.500> just<00:00:10.650> replaced<00:00:11.250> my<00:00:11.779> reverse<00:00:12.779> osmosis

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
I just replaced my reverse osmosis

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.859 
I just replaced my reverse osmosis
system<00:00:13.920> which<00:00:14.400> comprised<00:00:14.910> all<00:00:15.270> these<00:00:15.629> items

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
system which comprised all these items

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.529 
system which comprised all these items
here<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.279> reason<00:00:17.460> why<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.699> replaced<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.359> is

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
here and the reason why I replaced it is

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.310 
here and the reason why I replaced it is
I<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:18.930> noticing<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:20.390> slight<00:00:21.390> discoloration<00:00:21.810> in

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I was noticing a slight discoloration in

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.439 
I was noticing a slight discoloration in
the<00:00:22.410> water<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.919> I<00:00:23.130> noticed<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.970> inside<00:00:24.419> of

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the water and I noticed in the inside of

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.109 
the water and I noticed in the inside of
my<00:00:24.630> coffee<00:00:24.900> pot<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.499> buildup<00:00:26.429> of<00:00:26.490> something

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
my coffee pot a buildup of something

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.050 
my coffee pot a buildup of something
that<00:00:27.240> was<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.539> little<00:00:27.599> bit<00:00:27.869> gummy<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:29.060> contacted

that was a little bit gummy I contacted

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.200 
that was a little bit gummy I contacted
Cogan<00:00:30.960> who<00:00:31.259> had<00:00:31.769> installed<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.460> reverse

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
Cogan who had installed the reverse

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.800 
Cogan who had installed the reverse
osmosis<00:00:33.420> system<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.850> I<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.330> quoted

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
osmosis system and I was quoted

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.320 
osmosis system and I was quoted
approximately<00:00:37.650> three<00:00:37.860> hundred<00:00:38.160> dollars<00:00:38.790> to

found out that reverse osmosis systems

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.760 
found out that reverse osmosis systems
for<00:01:19.259> every<00:01:19.560> gallon<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.039> water<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.770> that

three to four gallons the other thing

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.410 
three to four gallons the other thing
that<00:01:27.899> concerned<00:01:28.439> me<00:01:28.560> was<00:01:28.999> two<00:01:29.999> things<00:01:30.270> number

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that concerned me was two things number

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.389 
that concerned me was two things number
one<00:01:30.719> the<00:01:31.020> space<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> entire<00:01:32.069> system

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
one the space that the entire system

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.300 
one the space that the entire system
takes<00:01:32.789> up<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.799> tank<00:01:35.039> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
takes up and this is the tank the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.340 
takes up and this is the tank the
holding<00:01:35.639> Kang<00:01:35.850> thats<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.450> used<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.139> sit

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
holding Kang thats that used to sit

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.940 
holding Kang thats that used to sit
under<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.710> sink<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.219> then<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.090> was<00:01:39.240> a

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
under the sink and then there was a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.099 
under the sink and then there was a
manifold<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.249> filters<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.969> it<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.630> manifold

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
manifold with filters on it the manifold

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.230 
manifold with filters on it the manifold
with<00:01:43.289> filters<00:01:43.679> was<00:01:43.889> not<00:01:44.069> a<00:01:44.100> problem<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.729> we're

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
with filters was not a problem but we're

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
with filters was not a problem but we're
always<00:01:45.450> trying<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.959> work<00:01:46.139> around<00:01:46.319> this<00:01:47.130> thing

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
always trying to work around this thing

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.639 
always trying to work around this thing
the<00:01:47.969> second<00:01:48.359> thing<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.719> I<00:01:48.959> didn't<00:01:49.319> like<00:01:49.469> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the second thing is I didn't like the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.910 
the second thing is I didn't like the
idea<00:01:49.679> of<00:01:50.159> having

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
idea of having

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.390 
idea of having
water<00:01:51.280> being<00:01:51.549> stored<00:01:52.030> within<00:01:52.299> a<00:01:52.509> system<00:01:52.750> that

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
water being stored within a system that

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.499 
water being stored within a system that
because<00:01:54.400> you<00:01:54.580> never<00:01:54.759> know<00:01:54.880> how<00:01:55.180> pure<00:01:55.479> the

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
because you never know how pure the

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.830 
because you never know how pure the
water<00:01:55.900> actually<00:01:56.170> sitting<00:01:56.860> inside<00:01:57.540> your<00:01:58.540> tank

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
water actually sitting inside your tank

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.580 
water actually sitting inside your tank
is<00:01:59.049> so<00:01:59.680> we<00:02:00.670> installed<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.330> clean<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.409> clear

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
is so we installed the clean and clear

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.410 
is so we installed the clean and clear
system<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.130> took<00:02:03.280> about<00:02:03.399> an<00:02:03.640> hour<00:02:03.759> I<00:02:04.090> did<00:02:04.330> it

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
system it took about an hour I did it

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.690 
system it took about an hour I did it
with<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.570> friend<00:02:04.869> of<00:02:04.960> mine<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:06.100> replay<00:02:06.399> and

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
with a friend of mine and the replay and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.669 
with a friend of mine and the replay and
replacement<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.539> filters<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.229> something

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
replacement of the filters is something

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.410 
replacement of the filters is something
that<00:02:08.920> even<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.429> can<00:02:09.640> do<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.149> do<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.360> in

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
that even I can do and I can do it in

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.809 
that even I can do and I can do it in
probably<00:02:10.780> under<00:02:11.170> 10<00:02:11.380> minutes<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:12.700> the

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
probably under 10 minutes this is the

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.479 
probably under 10 minutes this is the
entire<00:02:13.150> system<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.010> according<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.220> test

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
entire system and according to the test

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.880 
entire system and according to the test
results<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.270> have<00:02:16.510> read<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:17.500> will

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
results that I have read it will

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.250 
results that I have read it will
actually<00:02:18.100> purify<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.850> water<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.959> higher

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
actually purify the water to a higher

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.890 
actually purify the water to a higher
degree<00:02:20.470> than<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.340> reverse<00:02:21.580> osmosis<00:02:22.030> system

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
degree than the reverse osmosis system

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900 
degree than the reverse osmosis system
and<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.500> also<00:02:23.709> does<00:02:24.040> not<00:02:24.220> take<00:02:24.519> out<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
and it also does not take out the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.360 
and it also does not take out the
valuable<00:02:25.420> mineral<00:02:25.780> minerals<00:02:26.470> yet<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.130> does

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
valuable mineral minerals yet it does

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.759 
valuable mineral minerals yet it does
take<00:02:27.640> out<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:28.000> carcinogen<00:02:28.780> carcinogens<00:02:29.590> and

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
take out the carcinogen carcinogens and

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.580 
take out the carcinogen carcinogens and
contaminants<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:32.200> think<00:02:32.440> that's

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
contaminants and I think that's

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.650 
contaminants and I think that's
basically<00:02:33.100> pretty<00:02:33.430> much<00:02:33.549> what<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.090> did<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
basically pretty much what we did in the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.590 
basically pretty much what we did in the
why<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.440> like<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.340> system<00:02:36.880> here<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.330> uh

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
why of it I like the system here and uh

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.930 
why of it I like the system here and uh
and<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.769> way<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.040> does<00:02:39.190> not<00:02:39.340> take<00:02:39.610> up<00:02:39.640> any

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
and the way it does not take up any

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.630 
and the way it does not take up any
significant<00:02:40.930> amount<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.200> space<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
significant amount of space and the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.000 
significant amount of space and the
filter<00:02:43.030> change<00:02:43.299> is<00:02:43.660> extremely<00:02:44.200> easy<00:02:44.230> I've

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
filter change is extremely easy I've

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.039 
filter change is extremely easy I've
also<00:02:45.310> installed<00:02:45.880> one<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.269> these<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.690> my

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
also installed one of these in my

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.789 
also installed one of these in my
condominium<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:48.040> Fort<00:02:48.310> Lauderdale<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:49.799> it's

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
condominium in Fort Lauderdale and it's

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.229 
condominium in Fort Lauderdale and it's
working<00:02:51.160> great<00:02:51.280> that's<00:02:51.640> been<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:51.970> probably

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
working great that's been in probably

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.290 
working great that's been in probably
for<00:02:52.569> about<00:02:52.660> four<00:02:53.080> months
