00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.940
Friends of analog entertainment. Here are
we again . Yes, the warm-up phase is over

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.030
and we are now really taking off with a new
highlight from Essen 2013. One of my own personal

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.300
Essen highlights, namely Rampage! By Antoine
Bauza, this year Spiel des Jahres 2013 won by Hanabi

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.439
7 Wonders, Kennerspiel des Jahres 2012
won. And Ludovic Maublanc,

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.409
we know him now as well . Belgian publisher, 
Repos Production, also known.

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:36.120
And just the subject is quite fantastic because we attack
Meeple City with giant monsters and romp around there,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.149
destroying buildings, throwing cars,
feeding on Meeple! And I really mean that.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.629
Greetings from King of Tokyo. 
Greetings from King of Tokyo regarding the topic.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.699
Funnily enough in Essen there was the
advertising : Why be King of Tokyo

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.680
if you can also destroy it. I thought
already: careful, careful. But is it really a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.210
completely different game. And also with mechanisms
which are in no other game like this.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.460
It begins with the fact, that in Rampage I must really 
perform physical actions

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.460
to move my figures, these really, really nice
made monster stones, no wooden figures,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.720
they are made ​​of large pieces of wood. Indeed, there are no dice,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.450
instead, each monster as a matching foot,
on which it is standing. And to move the monster

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:35.640
I'll take it down and flick this foot with my finger over the game board.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.340
And where the thing ends up, 
my monster will be places in the next turn.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.890
If I throw a car, then I put
the car really on the head of my Monster

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.790
and flick it down.
I can also blow, I can create a hurricane,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.390
I really have to put my chin upon my monster and ....

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.490
blow buildings or other monsters around.
I can also attack buildings, then I can really

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.519
take my monster and throw them into the building.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:10.690
The aim of the game is to level Meeple City
and then eat up a as much as possible.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.930
I can eat these floors of crashed buildings.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.879
And of course the meeples that have landed on the board. 
The meeples come in six different

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.330
colors, which also represent different characters. Gray are the old men,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.400
green are the soldiers, red the super heroes, black
the businessmen, blue the journalists

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.970
and yellow the blondes. A special clou, you'll get only points for full

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.750
sets of meeples, which mean you have to use a
bit of a tactic to complete the sets of

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.269
all six different colors.
And your opponents can also try

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.790
to prevent that by eating away the right meeples
or even destroy your sets afterwards by using cards.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.269
So, Rampage looks like this when built up.
You see, it's really a three-dimensional city

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.880
which we now really attack with our
Monsters.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.780
Yes, and what you can see here, these houses consist
of floors and meeples.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.709
If we demolish them, the meeples will fall on the board
and then we can swallow them.

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.010
All of this wouldn't be a
problem if you would be the only monster

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.049
in the city, but there are still
three other monsters in the city, which of course

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.099
are played by other players. First they
eat up everything up.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:39.690
And second, they can attack me and knock out my teeth. 
Because each monster has

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.690
two fixed teeth and four teeth lying here on the screen, 
that can actually

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.920
can knocked out. And if I have only two teeth left,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.869
I can also swallow only two meeple per round.
If I have six teeth, I can swallow six meeple per round.

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.709
A very nice part of Rampage are the cards.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.080
There are three different types of cards, Character cards,
Power cards and Secret Super Power cards.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.580
At the beginning of the game each player receives
exactly one card of each type.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.010
The character card,as the name suggests, 
gives your monster a certain basic character.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.220
Here for example the "Brawler". 
The player who has this card gets two extra points

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.970
for each knocked-out tooth he eats.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.639
The Power card gives the monster a particular ability. 
Here as an example "telekinesis".

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.960
With this card you can pull vehicles that are not on your field to your monster and use them.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.020
The Secret Super Power Card is the only card remaining secret,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.960
the other two cards are layed out openly.
This card can be used any time and grants

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.530
a one-time bonus effect. Here, for example the "Catcher" . 
Once this player can

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.490
snatch an opponent's monster instead of a vehicle, 
put it down on his head,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.570
and demolish something with it... 
"and the enemy would simultaneously lose a tooth."

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.680
I, however, have the " Passionate Kiss", 
and therefor I can tongue two monsters ...

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.350
er two meeples from your monster's stomach.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.300
I think the cards are really lovingly designed
and have incredibly funny captions.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.800
One of the only weak points of the game in my eyes,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.080
that these cards are not quite as well balanced. 
And with certain combinations

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.449
you can get a huge advantage 
or rain vigorously on someone's parade.

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.280
But I also want to say Rampage is a fun game!

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.420
Stretchy Tongue, Long tail, Star Dancer, Anarchist , 
so that's really funny and it also fits well to

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.110
what the cards have as an effect.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.910
So I really like Rampage a lot.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.650
It is of course not something for everyone and
on the negative side might stand,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.220
that it's just a physical game. 
So who does not like flicking , who does not

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.430
like to blow is perhaps not quite right here.
Applies perhaps a bit for me as well.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.050
But especially for those longing for change. Who is just sick of

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.120
O my God a worker placement game again
and I don't want to roll the dice again and what should

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.030
I do now? No, here we are attacking a city for real. Original, unique

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.680
mechanisms, a great monster theme, but still family-friendly.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.369
So I think it's quite fantastic, but I'm  a monster fan of course.

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:26.160
Yes, that's it for Rampage. As I said we absolutely loved it and can totally recommend it, if you're into something like this.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.860
Briefly something personal, 
if you are interested a little closer in a game,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.770
that we present here, then have
a look at the description of the video.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.130
There's always a few extra information, 
some trivia, things that we simply

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.509
have not been able to include here in the video. 
And our rating is made a little transparent there

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:49.750
with pros and cons . And if you prefer

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:56.000
to consume our content as a blog, 
then we have superimposed the Tumblr link up here.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.349
You may also like to follow us there. 
That's it. We wish you much fun while playing.

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:00.630
And until next time.
