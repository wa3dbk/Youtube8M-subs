in my opinion at the end here it's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.240 
in my opinion at the end here it's
picking<00:04:02.790> up<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.150> last<00:04:04.049> week's<00:04:04.290> 5r<00:04:04.799> Sergio

Martinez Paul Williams which and

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.780 
Martinez Paul Williams which and
incidentally<00:04:07.590> my<00:04:08.100> prediction<00:04:08.519> was<00:04:08.579> right
