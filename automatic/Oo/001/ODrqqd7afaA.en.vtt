device<00:01:53.159> option<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.420> we've<00:01:54.689> done<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.649> was

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
device option so we've done that was

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.069 
device option so we've done that was
something<00:01:56.579> similar<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.180> we'll<00:01:57.659> type<00:01:57.899> in

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
something similar to that we'll type in

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.350 
something similar to that we'll type in
the<00:01:58.170> parents<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:58.860> three<00:01:59.310> nine<00:01:59.520> eight<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the parents that's three nine eight and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
the parents that's three nine eight and
I<00:02:01.290> believe<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.280> your<00:02:02.399> own<00:02:02.610> network

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
I believe this is on your own network

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
I believe this is on your own network
like<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.689> can't<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.229> multiple<00:02:04.740> networks

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
like you can't be on multiple networks

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.090 
like you can't be on multiple networks
and<00:02:05.460> access

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
and access

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.490 
and access
the<00:02:06.369> device<00:02:08.520> 4:71<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:11.170> let's<00:02:11.440> add<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.920> TV

other<00:04:19.840> devices<00:04:20.170> will<00:04:20.620> still<00:04:20.860> be<00:04:20.950> synched<00:04:21.310> up

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
other devices will still be synched up

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.770 
other devices will still be synched up
so<00:04:22.530> let's<00:04:23.530> go<00:04:24.280> over<00:04:24.400> here<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:25.030> into<00:04:25.450> that<00:04:25.600> per
