00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.900 

this<00:00:02.159> is<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.399> compost<00:00:03.179> thermometer<00:00:03.689> and

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
this is a compost thermometer and

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.059 
this is a compost thermometer and
basically<00:00:06.020> it's<00:00:07.020> just<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.319> thermometer<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
basically it's just a thermometer with a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.799 
basically it's just a thermometer with a
very<00:00:08.340> long<00:00:10.070> yes<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.759> know<00:00:11.820> prong<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.630> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
very long yes you know prong on it to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.650 
very long yes you know prong on it to
measure<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.440> temperature<00:00:14.150> down<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> far

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
measure the temperature down at the far

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.170 
measure the temperature down at the far
end<00:00:15.870> there<00:00:16.310> so<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.699> stick<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.060> into

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
end there so that you can stick it into

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.269 
end there so that you can stick it into
your<00:00:18.359> compost<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.080> get<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> reading<00:00:19.680> right<00:00:20.220> now

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
three feet high and I'll just fill that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.069 
three feet high and I'll just fill that
up<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:46.680> leaves<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.570> throw<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.719> my<00:00:48.870> kitchen

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
up with leaves and throw in my kitchen

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.799 
up with leaves and throw in my kitchen
scraps<00:00:49.559> when<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:51.600> I'm<00:00:51.690> just

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
scraps when I have them and now I'm just

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.560 
scraps when I have them and now I'm just
going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> stick<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.649> into<00:00:53.239> here<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.420> go

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
going to stick this into here we go

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.010 
going to stick this into here we go
again<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.989> 75<00:00:55.500> degrees<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.340> outside<00:00:57.020> and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
again it's 75 degrees or so outside and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.270 
again it's 75 degrees or so outside and
now<00:00:58.199> I'm<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> stick<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> end<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
now I'm going to stick the end of it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.740 
now I'm going to stick the end of it
right<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.629> into<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> compost<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.750> watch

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
right on down into the compost and watch

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
right on down into the compost and watch
what<00:01:04.140> happens<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.680> put<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.010> creeping<00:01:08.520> up<00:01:08.700> up

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
what happens and put your creeping up up

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.820 
what happens and put your creeping up up
up<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:12.240> right<00:01:12.990> now<00:01:13.170> i'm<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.500> about<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> hundred

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
up and right now i'm at about a hundred

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.929 
up and right now i'm at about a hundred
and<00:01:14.280> five<00:01:14.580> degrees<00:01:15.680> maybe<00:01:16.680> i<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.610> tad<00:01:17.909> over

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and five degrees maybe i just a tad over

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.730 
and five degrees maybe i just a tad over
that<00:01:18.390> hundred<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.869> six<00:01:19.049> hundred<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.380> seven

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that hundred and six hundred and seven

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.850 
that hundred and six hundred and seven
so<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.170> basically<00:01:22.170> we're<00:01:22.380> looking<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
so so basically we're looking at the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.390 
so so basically we're looking at the
compost<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:26.009> will<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.189> out<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
compost here this is that will go out of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
compost here this is that will go out of
focus<00:01:26.549> or<00:01:26.939> i<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.330> macro<00:01:27.689> mode<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
focus or i have it on macro mode it's a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.830 
focus or i have it on macro mode it's a
you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.920> compost<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:30.450> 30

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you know this compost is now about 30

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.770 
you know this compost is now about 30
degrees<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.530> 32<00:01:31.979> degrees<00:01:32.250> or<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.640> above<00:01:33.090> air

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
degrees or 32 degrees or so above air

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.280 
degrees or 32 degrees or so above air
temperature<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.340> certainly<00:01:35.700> warmer<00:01:36.090> than<00:01:37.049> air

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
temperature so certainly warmer than air

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.590 
temperature so certainly warmer than air
temperature<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.820> actually<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.479> up

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
temperature here up actually now it's up

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.880 
temperature here up actually now it's up
to<00:01:39.920> 110<00:01:40.939> you<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.439> again<00:01:43.439> remember<00:01:43.470> we

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to 110 you know so again remember we

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.630 
to 110 you know so again remember we
started<00:01:44.130> off<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:45.439> 75<00:01:46.439> degrees<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.220> got<00:01:47.369> ya

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
started off at 75 degrees so we got ya

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.899 
started off at 75 degrees so we got ya
so<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.450> got<00:01:48.630> about<00:01:49.070> we<00:01:50.070> got<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> good<00:01:50.399> good

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so we got about we got a good good

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.480 
so we got about we got a good good
stretch<00:01:51.210> there<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.770> now<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.220> i'm<00:01:53.310> going<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
stretch there and now what i'm going to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.969 
stretch there and now what i'm going to
do<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.670> though<00:01:53.880> i'm<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> show<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.979> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that of course is 35 degrees above air

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.600

basically<00:02:11.580> made<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> same<00:02:12.300> stuff<00:02:12.360> but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
basically made of the same stuff but

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.670 
basically made of the same stuff but
I haven't<00:02:13.800> turned<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:15.000> few<00:02:15.300> months<00:02:15.680> so

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
I haven't turned it in a few months so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.600 
I haven't turned it in a few months so
we're<00:02:16.920> going<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.100> see<00:02:18.110> what<00:02:19.110> happens<00:02:19.560> here<00:02:21.560> and

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
we're going to see what happens here and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.630 
we're going to see what happens here and
you<00:02:23.610> can<00:02:23.730> see<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.720> are<00:02:24.750> warmer<00:02:25.500> than<00:02:25.680> air

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
you can see we are warmer than air

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.070 
you can see we are warmer than air
temperature<00:02:27.470> we're<00:02:28.470> at<00:02:28.650> about<00:02:29.900> what's<00:02:30.900> that

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
temperature we're at about what's that

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.230 
temperature we're at about what's that
look<00:02:31.260> like<00:02:31.470> maybe<00:02:31.800> about<00:02:32.900> 75<00:02:33.900> 85<00:02:34.760> 84<00:02:35.760> somewhere

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
look like maybe about 75 85 84 somewhere

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.230 
look like maybe about 75 85 84 somewhere
between<00:02:36.360> maybe<00:02:36.690> 85<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.380> 90<00:02:37.650> degrees<00:02:38.240> but

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
between maybe 85 and 90 degrees but

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.100 
between maybe 85 and 90 degrees but
nowhere<00:02:39.570> near<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.520> 110<00:02:41.520> degrees<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:42.930> had

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
nowhere near the 110 degrees that we had

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.250 
nowhere near the 110 degrees that we had
off<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.890> other<00:02:44.010> side<00:02:44.280> there<00:02:44.780> where<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.810> had

compost about a week ago so last weekend
and<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:17.610> thought<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.000> would<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:18.180> take<00:03:18.510> this

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660

and I thought I would just take this
opportunity<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.550> use<00:03:20.550> my<00:03:20.790> handy<00:03:21.420> dandy

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
opportunity to use my handy dandy

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.280 
opportunity to use my handy dandy
compost<00:03:23.010> thermometer<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:24.180> see<00:03:25.050> if<00:03:25.260> that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
compost thermometer and see if that

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.020 
compost thermometer and see if that
really<00:03:25.739> made<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:25.920> difference<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.520> obviously

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
really made a difference and obviously

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.350 
really made a difference and obviously
it<00:03:27.630> did<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.920> pile<00:03:29.190> off<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.640> left<00:03:29.880> that

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360
