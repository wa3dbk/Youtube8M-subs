00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.400
 young psv is playing at hogenoord 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.259
 the squatter against the young on Monday evening 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.690
 Feyenoord and both teams take the lead 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.150
 with a selection that you can essentially at 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.250
 psv among others this zanka in the base 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.230
 but also jürgen locadia stef 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.699
 netherlands and memphis depay 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.039
 and at feyenoord we see names like 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.550
 miguel nelom ruud vormer 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.840
 gyon fernandez and wesley veroek 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.269
 supporters could therefore go well 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.189
 sit there at pig's place 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.170
 this is john how can maria three minutes 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.170
 played soccer in Rotterdam 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.670
 locadia with the boss on memphis depay with 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.219
 very lucky that is there for 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.980
 feet from the left winger of young psv 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.379
 and then it stands for 103 minutes 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.440
 played and a dream start 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.719
 for the marco roelofsen team 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.850
 is all happily achieved 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.690
 may then the pie gets the ball and stays 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.690
 He is now very calm how an island 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.760
 mail to 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.010
 perhaps a new one due to potassium 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.590
 possibility for young PSV but it is 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.440
 busy there maria does not come out 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.090
 rammstein then defend name is young 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.760
 feyenoord 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.860
 achieved here splits satisfied much a bar 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.300
 with the opening on the corner 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.369
 it's a prey for some it seems 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.220
 miscommunication between summer and bertrams 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.140
 and then wesley's hit goal 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.020
 one minute after the opening goal of the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.850
 pie is the same again 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.619
 some tries with his bertrams chest 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.509
 so that can still be processed 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.940
 the foot of corner in between 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.750
 and the goal for young feyenoord and that 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.750
 may they charge themselves 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.340
 ramsteijn holy the construction begins at 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.140
 him 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.030
 nice open and here on neon has quite 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.440
 a lot of time and a lot of space and the ball 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.330
 is good but what about that 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.420
 rescue of bertrams on the header of 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.039
 satisfied beautiful rescue of nigel 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.390
 Bertrams all the way back to that 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.280
 shoulder injury 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.490
 there is a disadvantage for young here 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.490
 psv 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.959
 from beautiful the ball sangha doe wasted 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.399
 this also does not pick up nicely 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.649
 how immediately goes looking for fernandez 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.310
 it is prepared and then the two one 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.230
 for young feyenoord sankata smith and 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.270
 fernandez yes you shouldn't have such a chance 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.459
 to give 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.200
 get the ball with luck but then 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.110
 He remains calm and no chance 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.090
 bertrams now so the start is incredible 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.180
 nice 20 minutes played at pig village 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.580
 and have already seen three goals 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.170
 zanka with the ball on maria a lot of space 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.560
 for maria 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.390
 he also gets the space opens 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.580
 then on memphis depay 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.770
 with the remarkable blonde hair the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.920
 the pie's pie chose for each aria 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.290
 a team which is not yet very many sizes 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:58.520
 on 13 in the promises competition and this 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:00.140
 should have been number 14 your marcel 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.870
 brands she was always a spectator 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.760
 every match of young PSV 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.160
 and these are images from the 2nd half 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:13.100
 your bike with the superstructure 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.750
 Rick Schouw Feyenoord and PSV come 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.910
 feyenoord is also possible because it is over 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.590
 finally with two one for this is from all 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.900
 you try it is with his left leg 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.530
 is not his strongest leg but this 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.530
 doesn't matter much 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.880
 watch locadia 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.019
 great feyenoord psv all the time and again 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.720
 space to build on 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.489
 zanka with the pass on locadia and there the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.750
 two two 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.580
 you should not give it too much room 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.800
 jürgen locadia 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.970
 then he usually knows what to do with this 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.010
 of course a mistake by goalkeeper 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.370
 Ronald Graafland who is scratching his on 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.190
 head 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.329
 with all my experience he just thinks 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.510
 it does not stand 2 2 summer on locadia 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.600
 up to price summer but via an island 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.670
 keeps young psv in possession 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.079
 weather locadia who you are not a co-player 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.450
 found then you get the ball back 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.360
 delicious swipe and this time one 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.860
 Excellent rescue from Ronald Graafland 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.350
 but what a fun match 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.670
 pig place 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.910
 sense this is running well 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.680
 rammstein feyenoord 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.350
 builds an attack and does it well 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.940
 because this is john fernandez in front 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.730
 with the outside on the right and completely there 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.030
 free mitchell to peace and that may be the 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.040
 defense of young PSV 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.270
 for how can mitchell to peace day 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:41.250
 about him and all in all it says 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.250
 yet again just 3 2 for feyenoord 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.540
 watch locadia 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.190
 and you will hear the whistle 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.510
 Referee Edwin van de Graaf 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.770
 feyenoord players are here 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.479
 of course disagree 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.010
 but a free kick in a nice position 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.290
 for psv 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.700
 nijland nestles behind the ball stef 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.400
 Netherlands and again Ronald Graafland 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.960
 stylish rescue 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.940
 this way the three and two remain a corner 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.560
 for psv 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.750
 that is kicked by Peter van Ooijen 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.680
 feyenoord does not get disposed of 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.720
 john pants to maria with the three 3s like that 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.560
 keeps young psv but keeps coming back 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.320
 therefore responded well to the competition 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.780
 john buchan maria gets the ball with what 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.240
 luck but remains pretty master of that 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.240
 situation and thus states 3 3 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.680
 locadia how many goals are going to fall 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.900
 here on pig country nijland 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.960
 The spaces remain large for PSV to enter 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.840
 to operate and this is johnny canaria 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.080
 the man of the equalizer 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.490
 where opt for peter van ooijen 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.220
 you hear the duel with 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.810
 mokotjo fouls 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.810
 from feyenoord and the penalty kick 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.259
 yes here the referee can count 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.130
 no different than the ball at 11 meters 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.500
 to lay 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.389
 Jurgen Locadia naturally behind the ball 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.870
 and of course it is then hit four 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.199
 three 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.320
 follow young psv hit number 15 in the 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.910
 promise competition for jürgen locadia 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.699
 and this is important because you are 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:18.650
 two again take the lead 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:20.419
 75 minutes football and 4 3 plus 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.750
 forest sale 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:25.400
 maria with on cours dropped in the 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.330
 rest beautifully turned and what a 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.919
 goal 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.650
 calling cool then he thinks what 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:35.199
 Jurgen Locadia can do that too 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:37.460
 scoring this is a very nice saying 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.199
 five he gets the ball around his ears 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.639
 Ronald County 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.990
 and we can still assume that the 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.990
 contest is decided 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:50.210
 vormer with the boss on sing and super hair 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:53.960
 it will be 549 goals in one 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:57.410
 competition but ultimately all 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.120
 in favor of psv because despite that 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.250
 john how can maria have a second yellow 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.740
 card in injury time 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.690
 remains at this position young PSV 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.330
 fines a handsome win over it 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.669
 team of giovanni van bronckhorst 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.699
 5 4 so and these are the other results 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.800
 fc utrecht beats fc twente and rkc 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:17.840
 waalwijk nac breda and vitesse agio vv 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.789
 against Ajax both end in one 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.710
 tie and the bottom two 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:25.159
 matches are the matches of the 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:27.080
 Tuesday evening this is the PSV stand again 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:29.240
 leader ten points out of five 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.870
 matches as many points as fc 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.330
 utrecht 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:35.300
 but the goal balance of psv is just what 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.460
 better the high scores 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.180
 jürgen locadia made two state now 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:43.159
 on 15 jan luca maria is on five and 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.870
 yell then made cool yesterday 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:46.870
 his fourth goal of the season
