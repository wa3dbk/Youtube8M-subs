that<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.340> weren't<00:00:53.670> previously<00:00:54.390> able<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
that you weren't previously able to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.580 
that you weren't previously able to
craft<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.890> now<00:00:56.309> makes<00:00:56.670> them<00:00:56.910> craftable<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
craft and now makes them craftable so it

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.170 
craft and now makes them craftable so it
kinda<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> makes<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.579> another<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.120> for

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
I like that a lot that could be useful

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.320 
I like that a lot that could be useful
even<00:01:16.049> though<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> never<00:01:16.619> personally<00:01:17.330> used

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
even though I never personally used

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.240 
even though I never personally used
horse<00:01:18.780> armor<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.590> maybe<00:01:19.799> that's<00:01:20.070> just

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
horse armor but maybe that's just

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
horse armor but maybe that's just
because<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.850> fact<00:01:21.090> I've<00:01:21.299> never<00:01:21.509> been<00:01:21.720> able<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
because the fact I've never been able to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
because the fact I've never been able to
really<00:01:22.290> find<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.979> uh<00:01:23.009> yeah<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.759> would<00:01:23.939> add

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
really find it so uh yeah this would add

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.060 
really find it so uh yeah this would add
a<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.720> cool<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.140> feature<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:25.830> next

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
a very cool little feature and now next

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280 
a very cool little feature and now next
up<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.000> furnace<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.140> can

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
up we have a furnace here you can

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.969 
up we have a furnace here you can
actually<00:01:28.619> craft<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:30.420> craft<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.140> cook<00:01:31.680> up

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
actually craft or not craft but cook up

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.149 
actually craft or not craft but cook up
some<00:01:32.579> leather<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.630> rotten<00:01:34.110> flesh<00:01:34.350> awesome

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
some leather out of rotten flesh awesome

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.740 
some leather out of rotten flesh awesome
very<00:01:35.340> awesome<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.299> ties<00:01:36.509> into

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
very awesome and I think that ties into

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.560 
very awesome and I think that ties into
our<00:01:36.869> next<00:01:37.229> thing<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.650> which<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.610> saddle

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
our next thing here which is the saddle

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.539 
our next thing here which is the saddle
you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.869> now<00:01:39.960> craft<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.380> saddle<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:41.369> are<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you can now craft a saddle there are a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
you can now craft a saddle there are a
lot<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.700> other<00:01:41.909> mods<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.750> deal<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.320> other

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
lot of other mods that deal with other

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
next up we have the feather which

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.809 
next up we have the feather which
described<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.230> strange<00:02:16.590> way<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.830> believe<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
described it a strange way I believe a

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.089 
described it a strange way I believe a
string<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.660> make<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:19.019> feather<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.379> think<00:02:19.620> raining

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
string to make a feather I think raining

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.650 
string to make a feather I think raining
outside<00:02:20.190> how<00:02:20.519> dare<00:02:20.849> it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
outside how dare it

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.960 
outside how dare it
weather<00:02:22.580> here<00:02:24.290> yes<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:26.160> don't<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:26.670> that's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
weather here yes so I don't know that's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.449 
weather here yes so I don't know that's
a<00:02:27.300> recipe<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.170> kind<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.860> doesn't<00:02:29.160> make<00:02:29.250> much

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
a recipe that kind of doesn't make much

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.400 
a recipe that kind of doesn't make much
sense<00:02:29.489> maybe<00:02:29.910> needs<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.269> little<00:02:30.510> tweaking<00:02:30.810> but

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
sense maybe needs a little tweaking but

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.170 
sense maybe needs a little tweaking but
then<00:02:31.650> again<00:02:31.769> I've<00:02:32.160> always<00:02:32.549> wanted<00:02:32.730> feathers

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
then again I've always wanted feathers

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.789 
then again I've always wanted feathers
you<00:02:33.299> know<00:02:33.360> what<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.569> think<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.110> should<00:02:34.620> be

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
you know what I think that should be

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.309 
you know what I think that should be
done<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.849> actually<00:02:36.209> use<00:02:36.390> shears<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.080> just

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
done is you actually use shears to just

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.800 
done is you actually use shears to just
shear<00:02:37.620> chickens<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:39.299> makes<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.599> lot<00:02:39.780> more

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
shear chickens and that makes a lot more

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.400 
shear chickens and that makes a lot more
sense

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
sense

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.390 
sense
