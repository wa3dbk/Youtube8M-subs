torque<00:03:12.380> when<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.890> drive<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.400> vehicle<00:03:13.549> and

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
torque when you drive the vehicle and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.140 
torque when you drive the vehicle and
not<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.269> power<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:16.370> is<00:03:16.519> one<00:03:16.700> thing<00:03:16.970> and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
not the power and this is one thing and

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.069 
not the power and this is one thing and
it<00:03:17.360> is<00:03:17.720> also<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.350> customer<00:03:18.680> demand<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.700> we

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
it is also a customer demand that we

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.229 
it is also a customer demand that we
need<00:03:21.079> to<00:03:21.110> have<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.530> quiet<00:03:21.950> vehicle<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:23.030> means

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
need to have a quiet vehicle that means

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.509 
need to have a quiet vehicle that means
the<00:03:23.510> noise<00:03:23.780> reduction<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.340> in

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
the noise reduction of this in

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.120 
the noise reduction of this in
comparison<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.540> old<00:03:26.750> let's<00:03:27.590> say<00:03:27.829> old

version the 1.9 liter TDI what we have

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.840 
version the 1.9 liter TDI what we have
it's<00:03:33.250> really<00:03:34.250> a<00:03:35.530> much<00:03:36.530> better<00:03:37.010> solution<00:03:37.700> what

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
it's really a much better solution what

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.820 
it's really a much better solution what
we<00:03:38.030> have<00:03:38.239> now<00:03:38.480> with<00:03:39.079> all<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.410> same

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
we have now with all the same

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.640 
we have now with all the same
