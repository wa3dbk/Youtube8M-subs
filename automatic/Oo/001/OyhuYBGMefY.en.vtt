three<00:02:07.770> different<00:02:08.340> sets<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.849> frames<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
three different sets of frames that you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.160 
three different sets of frames that you
could<00:02:10.170> put<00:02:10.440> around<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.730> decorate<00:02:12.420> as

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
could put around to decorate as

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.890 
could put around to decorate as
well<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.590> let<00:02:13.770> me<00:02:13.890> show<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.130> how<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.459> use<00:02:14.819> that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
here on the 12 days of Christmas I'm

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.280 
here on the 12 days of Christmas I'm
trying<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.150> open<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.540> up<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.080> not

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
trying to open this up and it's not

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.220 
trying to open this up and it's not
working<00:02:19.440> very<00:02:19.680> well<00:02:19.920> for<00:02:20.099> me<00:02:20.599> you<00:02:21.599> can<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:22.020> on

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
working very well for me you can see on

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350 
working very well for me you can see on
this<00:02:22.440> first<00:02:22.770> page<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.310> had<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.520> black<00:02:23.910> background

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
this first page I had a black background

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.010 
this first page I had a black background
and<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> chose<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.430> scalloped<00:02:26.940> border<00:02:27.420> to

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
and so I chose the scalloped border to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.890 
and so I chose the scalloped border to
decorate<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.099> then<00:02:29.850> when<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.239> all<00:02:30.420> folds

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
decorate with and then when it all folds

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.380 
decorate with and then when it all folds
up<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.440> folds<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.100> inside<00:02:32.580> but<00:02:33.239> it's

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
up that folds to the inside but it's

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.970 
up that folds to the inside but it's
still<00:02:33.600> decorated<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.500> could<00:02:34.739> decorate

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
still decorated you could decorate

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.100 
still decorated you could decorate
certainly<00:02:35.760> both<00:02:36.060> sides<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.660> that's<00:02:36.840> probably

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
certainly both sides and that's probably

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.210 
certainly both sides and that's probably
what<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.709> should<00:02:37.800> have<00:02:38.010> done<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:38.760> project

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
what I should have done in this project

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.770 
what I should have done in this project
so<00:02:41.220> you're<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.610> decorate<00:02:41.850> with<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.510> I

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780

your first full of the pages is going to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.960 
your first full of the pages is going to
be<00:02:59.760> down<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.630> your<00:03:00.750> flap<00:03:01.019> gets<00:03:01.350> folded<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:01.980> you

be down so your flap gets folded up you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.600 
be down so your flap gets folded up you
simply<00:03:03.420> remove<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.989> liner<00:03:04.200> tape<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.890> attach

your second page there once those are
together<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.560> manner<00:03:13.860> we're<00:03:14.610> going<00:03:14.730> to

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
together in that manner we're going to

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.259 
together in that manner we're going to
fold<00:03:15.030> up<00:03:15.330> our<00:03:15.650> labels<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.890> both<00:03:17.130> sides<00:03:17.459> because

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
it I think you can find so so many uses

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.349 
it I think you can find so so many uses
for<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.470> particular<00:03:44.100> die<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.549> think<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.209> would

for this particular die I think it would

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.420 
for this particular die I think it would
be<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.510> fun<00:03:45.780> way<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.989> send<00:03:46.380> kids<00:03:46.590> school<00:03:46.950> photos
