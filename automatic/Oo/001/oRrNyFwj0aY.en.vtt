better<00:00:45.909> for<00:00:46.059> customization<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:46.809> can<00:00:46.899> switch

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
better for customization you can switch

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.600 
better for customization you can switch
out<00:00:47.350> keyboards<00:00:47.860> you<00:00:47.949> don't<00:00:48.129> like<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.399> stock

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
out keyboards you don't like the stock

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.149 
out keyboards you don't like the stock
one<00:00:48.879> we<00:00:49.479> had<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.629> lot<00:00:50.199> more<00:00:50.229> options<00:00:50.589> to<00:00:50.890> really

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
one we had a lot more options to really

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.890 
one we had a lot more options to really
make<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.430> device<00:00:51.549> yours<00:00:52.269> and<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.629> can<00:00:52.750> mess

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
make the device yours and you can mess

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.259 
make the device yours and you can mess
around<00:00:52.930> tinker<00:00:53.530> with<00:00:53.650> it<00:00:53.710> where<00:00:54.220> I<00:00:54.250> OS<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.879> more

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
around tinker with it where I OS is more

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.579 
around tinker with it where I OS is more
likely<00:00:55.479> again<00:00:55.839> it's<00:00:55.960> going<00:00:56.019> to<00:00:56.140> be<00:00:56.229> that<00:00:56.409> type

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
likely again it's going to be that type

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.020 
likely again it's going to be that type
of<00:00:56.619> environment<00:00:56.890> is<00:00:57.309> what<00:00:57.610> you<00:00:57.760> see<00:00:57.909> is<00:00:57.970> what

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
of environment is what you see is what

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.000 
of environment is what you see is what
you<00:00:58.180> get<00:00:58.420> unless<00:00:58.659> you<00:00:58.809> jailbreak<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.379> it's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
you get unless you jailbreak it it's

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.170 
you get unless you jailbreak it it's
going<00:01:00.129> to<00:01:00.159> be<00:01:00.250> better<00:01:00.400> for<00:01:00.580> media<00:01:00.820> consumption

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
going to be better for media consumption

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.210 
going to be better for media consumption
I<00:01:01.360> think<00:01:01.570> either<00:01:01.750> on<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.019> cell<00:01:02.379> phone<00:01:02.409> or<00:01:02.589> tablet

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
I think either on a cell phone or tablet

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.070 
I think either on a cell phone or tablet
and<00:01:03.460> also<00:01:03.699> I<00:01:03.729> think<00:01:03.939> I<00:01:04.000> us<00:01:04.269> does<00:01:04.449> have<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.629> best

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
and also I think I us does have the best

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.420 
and also I think I us does have the best
applications<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.799> think<00:01:05.950> they<00:01:06.040> have<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.250> best

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
applications I think they have the best

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.030 
applications I think they have the best
developers<00:01:06.939> on<00:01:07.299> iOS<00:01:07.960> right<00:01:08.229> now<00:01:08.439> but

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
developers on iOS right now but

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.070 
developers on iOS right now but
ultimately<00:01:09.369> what's<00:01:09.759> my<00:01:09.970> personal<00:01:10.540> choice<00:01:10.780> I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
ultimately what's my personal choice I

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.350 
ultimately what's my personal choice I
would<00:01:11.409> say<00:01:11.530> on<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.770> day-to-day<00:01:12.070> usage<00:01:12.490> iOS<00:01:13.240> is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
would say on a day-to-day usage iOS is

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.600 
would say on a day-to-day usage iOS is
going<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.570> be<00:01:13.659> more<00:01:13.869> relevant<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.409> my<00:01:14.530> life<00:01:14.770> but

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
going to be more relevant in my life but

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.980 
going to be more relevant in my life but
that's<00:01:15.880> not<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.180> say<00:01:16.299> that<00:01:16.329> I<00:01:16.509> don't<00:01:16.810> use

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
that's not to say that I don't use

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.899 
that's not to say that I don't use
Android<00:01:17.470> all<00:01:17.650> I<00:01:17.680> use<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.040> nexus<00:01:18.310> 7<00:01:18.579> now<00:01:18.670> when<00:01:18.850> I

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
Android all I use the nexus 7 now when I

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.480 
Android all I use the nexus 7 now when I
travel<00:01:19.390> a<00:01:19.420> lot<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.840> also<00:01:20.619> I've<00:01:20.829> run<00:01:21.100> rocking

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
travel a lot and also I've run rocking

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.800 
travel a lot and also I've run rocking
the<00:01:21.580> Nvidia<00:01:21.940> shield<00:01:22.000> we<00:01:22.330> should<00:01:22.480> be<00:01:22.540> coming<00:01:22.780> up

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the Nvidia shield we should be coming up

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.990 
the Nvidia shield we should be coming up
in<00:01:22.900> another<00:01:23.170> video<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.920> like<00:01:24.580> both<00:01:24.790> of<00:01:24.820> them

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
in another video so I like both of them

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.360 
in another video so I like both of them
but<00:01:25.180> for<00:01:25.480> my<00:01:25.690> personal<00:01:26.020> choices<00:01:26.800> because

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
but for my personal choices because

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.370 
but for my personal choices because
mostly<00:01:27.820> because<00:01:28.060> of<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.330> applications<00:01:28.870> I<00:01:29.050> use

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
mostly because of the applications I use

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.020 
mostly because of the applications I use
iOS<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.159> his<00:01:30.250> next<00:01:30.430> question<00:01:30.730> comes<00:01:30.760> from

recharge<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:09.000> be<00:04:09.090> completely<00:04:09.330> dead<00:04:09.750> and

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
recharge so I can be completely dead and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.570 
recharge so I can be completely dead and
definitely<00:04:10.590> at<00:04:10.680> least<00:04:10.709> get<00:04:11.010> back<00:04:11.220> up<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.550> a

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
definitely at least get back up to a

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
definitely at least get back up to a
hundred<00:04:11.760> percent<00:04:12.000> because<00:04:12.270> there's<00:04:12.480> nothing

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
hundred percent because there's nothing

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.360 
hundred percent because there's nothing
worse<00:04:12.900> than<00:04:13.080> being<00:04:13.140> out<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.680> your<00:04:14.130> phone

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
worse than being out and your phone

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.699 
worse than being out and your phone
dying<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.630> case<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:15.930> pretty<00:04:16.109> cool<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.560> did

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
dying so this case is pretty cool I did

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.220 
dying so this case is pretty cool I did
a<00:04:16.770> review<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.370> juice<00:04:17.970> pack<00:04:18.000> helium<00:04:18.239> case<00:04:18.959> I

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
a review of the juice pack helium case I

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.620 
a review of the juice pack helium case I
think<00:04:19.709> on<00:04:20.100> my<00:04:20.130> soldier<00:04:20.970> knows<00:04:21.090> best<00:04:21.359> channel

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
think on my soldier knows best channel

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.630 
think on my soldier knows best channel
and<00:04:21.900> it's<00:04:22.680> very<00:04:22.830> similar<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.310> case<00:04:23.490> it

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
and it's very similar to this case it

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.610 
and it's very similar to this case it
just<00:04:23.790> doesn't<00:04:24.060> offer<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:25.080> know<00:04:25.200> more<00:04:25.410> I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
just doesn't offer that you know more I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.780 
just doesn't offer that you know more I
think<00:04:25.919> only<00:04:26.040> gets<00:04:26.220> you<00:04:26.250> up<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.550> about<00:04:26.669> one

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
think only gets you up to about one

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.760 
think only gets you up to about one
hundred<00:04:26.850> percent<00:04:27.060> battery<00:04:27.480> recharge<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.710> you

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
hundred percent battery recharge but you

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.840 
hundred percent battery recharge but you
can<00:04:28.890> definitely<00:04:29.040> check<00:04:29.280> out<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.520> review<00:04:29.730> who

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850
