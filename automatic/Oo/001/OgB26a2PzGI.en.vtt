Entertainment System we get it mode 7
okay<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.429> don't<00:00:08.610> have<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.880> put<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.179> as<00:00:09.450> regain

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
okay we don't have to put it as regain

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
but the be fair Konami did some cool

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.600 
but the be fair Konami did some cool
things<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.719> note<00:00:12.900> 7<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.320> their<00:00:13.440> games<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.920> I

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
things with note 7 in their games and I

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.029 
things with note 7 in their games and I
don't<00:00:15.120> love<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.020> overhead<00:00:16.590> sections<00:00:16.949> of

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
don't love the overhead sections of

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.769 
don't love the overhead sections of
contra<00:00:17.369> 3<00:00:17.550> they're<00:00:17.699> pretty<00:00:17.970> good<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.449> think

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
contra 3 they're pretty good I think

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.570 
contra 3 they're pretty good I think
they're<00:00:18.960> creative<00:00:19.350> our<00:00:19.740> object<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> pick<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
they're creative our object is to pick a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.359 
they're creative our object is to pick a
starting<00:00:20.850> point<00:00:21.060> traverse<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.689> map<00:00:22.369> rotate

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
starting point traverse this map rotate

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
starting point traverse this map rotate
around<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.000> kill<00:00:24.750> these<00:00:24.869> five<00:00:25.140> guys<00:00:25.529> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
around and kill these five guys and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.529 
around and kill these five guys and
manhole<00:00:26.099> covers<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.090> notice<00:00:27.359> by<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
manhole covers have you notice by the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.179 
manhole covers have you notice by the
way<00:00:27.660> when<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.930> switch<00:00:28.109> weapons<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.769> bright

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
way when you switch weapons this bright

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.189 
way when you switch weapons this bright
actually<00:00:29.670> does<00:00:29.910> use<00:00:29.939> left<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:30.840> weapons

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
actually does use left and right weapons

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.330 
actually does use left and right weapons
it's<00:00:31.410> pretty<00:00:31.679> good<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> nice<00:00:32.189> little

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
it's pretty good it's a nice little

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.580 
it's pretty good it's a nice little
detail<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.759> think<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.360> decided<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> take<00:00:34.410> any

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
detail I think I decided to take any

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
detail I think I decided to take any
weapon<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.550> given<00:00:35.850> they're<00:00:36.180> randomly

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
weapon that I was given they're randomly

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
weapon that I was given they're randomly
assigned<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.230> each<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> pods<00:00:38.070> or

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
assigned and each one of the pods or

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.830 
assigned and each one of the pods or
this<00:00:38.460> drawing<00:00:38.670> has<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.910> gimmick<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.540> these

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
this drawing has a gimmick to it these

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.530 
this drawing has a gimmick to it these
first<00:00:40.140> two<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.500> should<00:00:40.800> kind<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> crazy

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
first two they just should kind of crazy

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.910 
first two they just should kind of crazy
so<00:00:42.540> we're<00:00:42.660> gonna<00:00:42.780> get<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> laser<00:00:43.379> which<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
so we're gonna get it the laser which is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.619 
so we're gonna get it the laser which is
pretty<00:00:44.160> great<00:00:44.430> before<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.120> though<00:00:45.300> here's<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
pretty great before that though here's a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
pretty great before that though here's a
trick<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.079> DoubleTap<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.980> rotate<00:00:47.340> button

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
trick if you DoubleTap the rotate button

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.779 
trick if you DoubleTap the rotate button
lrr<00:00:48.260> you'll<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:49.440> rotate<00:00:49.950> twice<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.520> fast

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
lrr you'll actually rotate twice as fast

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.720 
lrr you'll actually rotate twice as fast
as<00:00:51.120> normal<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.800> rotation<00:00:53.219> speed<00:00:53.340> aren't

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
as normal the rotation speed aren't

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.819 
as normal the rotation speed aren't
great<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.300> normal<00:00:54.840> speed<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.230> too<00:00:55.440> slow<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
great the normal speed is too slow to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.119 
great the normal speed is too slow to
circle<00:00:56.760> straight<00:00:56.969> things<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.129> faster

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
circle straight things and the faster

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.830 
circle straight things and the faster
speeds<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.489> little<00:00:59.670> too<00:00:59.789> fast<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.149> control<00:01:00.510> but

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
speeds a little too fast to control but

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
speeds a little too fast to control but
it<00:01:00.989> comes<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.739> helpful<00:01:02.129> later<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.399> much<00:01:03.120> later

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
it comes as helpful later on much later

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.170 
it comes as helpful later on much later
on<00:01:03.559> anyway<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.860> third<00:01:05.250> manhole

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
on anyway here is the third manhole

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.850 
on anyway here is the third manhole
cover<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.689> one's<00:01:06.900> gimmick<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.590> won't

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
cover this one's gimmick is it won't

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.010 
cover this one's gimmick is it won't
open<00:01:08.280> unless<00:01:08.580> you're<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:08.970> looking<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
open unless you're not looking at it so

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.990 
open unless you're not looking at it so
it's<00:01:10.590> easy<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.100> run<00:01:11.369> around<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.970> can

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it's easy to just run around it you can

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120 
it's easy to just run around it you can
rotate<00:01:12.270> away<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.170> rotate<00:01:13.470> back<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> just

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
rotate away and rotate back but I just

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.080 
rotate away and rotate back but I just
like<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.580> circle<00:01:15.330> around<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.720> basically

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
like to do circle around it basically

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
like to do circle around it basically
anyway<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> laser<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> pretty

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
anyway you can see the laser is a pretty

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.450 
anyway you can see the laser is a pretty
great<00:01:19.290> weapon<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> overhead<00:01:20.100> view<00:01:20.250> it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
great weapon in the overhead view it's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.710 
great weapon in the overhead view it's
just<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.700> steady<00:01:20.880> screen<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.479> only<00:01:21.600> one

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
just a steady screen it's the only one

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.530 
just a steady screen it's the only one
that<00:01:21.780> acts<00:01:22.020> very<00:01:22.619> differently<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that acts very differently in the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.170 
that acts very differently in the
side-scrolling<00:01:24.750> sections<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:26.670> final<00:01:27.000> one's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
side-scrolling sections this final one's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.700 
side-scrolling sections this final one's
gimmick<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.869> only<00:01:27.960> opens<00:01:28.350> when<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:28.590> not

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
gimmick is it only opens when you're not

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.200 
gimmick is it only opens when you're not
shooting<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> crush<00:01:29.460> gun<00:01:29.670> has<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> slower

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
shooting and the crush gun has a slower

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.179 
shooting and the crush gun has a slower
rate<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.509> fire<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.470> doesn't<00:01:31.920> count<00:01:32.009> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
rate of fire is it it doesn't count it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.410 
rate of fire is it it doesn't count it
and<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> game<00:01:32.549> give<00:01:32.700> me<00:01:32.790> another<00:01:32.970> crush<00:01:33.210> gun

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and the game give me another crush gun

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.819

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
some more most second stuff and he

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.320 
some more most second stuff and he
basically<00:02:17.470> tried<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.830> jump<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.400> on<00:02:18.940> hard

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
basically tried to jump on you on hard

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.360 
basically tried to jump on you on hard
he's<00:02:19.660> smart<00:02:20.049> enough<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.260> try<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.620> land<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.220> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
he's smart enough to try to land on you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.670 
he's smart enough to try to land on you
with<00:02:21.489> one<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.760> his<00:02:21.819> pod<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.329> the<00:02:22.450> idea<00:02:22.780> so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
with one of his pod is the idea so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.280 
with one of his pod is the idea so
that's<00:02:24.250> very<00:02:25.090> tricky<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.630> dodge<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.049> only<00:02:26.170> way

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
that's very tricky to dodge the only way

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.750 
that's very tricky to dodge the only way
I<00:02:26.319> can<00:02:26.560> do<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:26.980> by<00:02:27.130> kind<00:02:27.489> of<00:02:27.519> going

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
I can do it is by kind of going

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.360 
I can do it is by kind of going
diagonally<00:02:28.360> but<00:02:28.480> see<00:02:28.810> lands<00:02:29.200> really<00:02:29.799> fast<00:02:30.069> so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
diagonally but see lands really fast so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.150 
diagonally but see lands really fast so
it's<00:02:30.549> hard<00:02:30.849> as<00:02:30.970> hell<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.329> judge<00:02:31.860> where<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.010> go

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
it's hard as hell to judge where to go

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.190 
it's hard as hell to judge where to go
anyway<00:02:34.150> just<00:02:34.269> keep<00:02:34.420> backing<00:02:34.630> away<00:02:34.810> from<00:02:34.959> him

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
anyway just keep backing away from him

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.949 
anyway just keep backing away from him
if<00:02:35.319> he<00:02:35.410> has<00:02:35.500> no<00:02:35.650> pop<00:02:35.920> elastance<00:02:36.430> he<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.959> pretty

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
if he has no pop elastance he is pretty

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.729 
if he has no pop elastance he is pretty
simple<00:02:39.599> now<00:02:40.599> let's<00:02:40.810> hold<00:02:40.959> L&amp;R<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:41.530> spin

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
simple now let's hold L&amp;R and spin

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:50.339 
simple now let's hold L&amp;R and spin
around<00:02:41.860> like<00:02:42.400> an<00:02:42.579> idiot

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.219 

awesome
