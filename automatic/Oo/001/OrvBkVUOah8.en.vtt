and all these flowers come out that Yelp
that<00:01:04.680> orange<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.510> right<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:07.920> one

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that orange one right up there that one

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:20.240 
that orange one right up there that one
goes<00:01:08.280> through<00:01:08.490> my<00:01:08.670> firewall<00:01:16.159> through<00:01:17.159> here

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.230 

around<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:21.640> over<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.270> battery

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
around and over to the battery

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.620 
around and over to the battery
and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:29.330> this<00:01:30.330> orange<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.260> right<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:32.630> goes

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and then this orange one right here goes

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.240 
and then this orange one right here goes
around<00:01:34.610> go<00:01:35.610> through<00:01:35.880> my<00:01:35.970> door<00:01:40.580> out<00:01:41.580> of<00:01:41.759> here

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
around go through my door out of here

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
around go through my door out of here
and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.580> connects<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:46.470> my<00:01:50.420> coil<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and then it connects to my coil the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.690 
and then it connects to my coil the
igniter<00:01:52.979> coil<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> did<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.369> ran<00:01:56.580> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
igniter coil so what I did I just ran it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.300 
igniter coil so what I did I just ran it
through<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:58.770> use<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.160> of<00:01:59.190> these

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
through here and I use one of these

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.219 
through here and I use one of these
3-way<00:01:59.970> splice<00:02:02.570> connector<00:02:03.570> things<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.080> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
3-way splice connector things and I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.090 
3-way splice connector things and I
clamp<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.710> right<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:06.979> if<00:02:07.979> you

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
clamp it right on to this one and if you

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.060 
clamp it right on to this one and if you
see<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.720> don't<00:02:09.720> know<00:02:09.899> what<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.350> but<00:02:10.649> that

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
see I don't know what this is but that

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.460 
see I don't know what this is but that
one's<00:02:11.250> got<00:02:11.760> two<00:02:11.970> sides<00:02:12.269> on<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.230> guess

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
one's got two sides on it and I guess

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.750 
one's got two sides on it and I guess
this<00:02:13.739> one<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.810> Toyota<00:02:15.810> which<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.830> kind<00:02:17.700> of

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
this one on a Toyota which is kind of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.050 
this one on a Toyota which is kind of
car<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:19.590> has<00:02:19.739> this<00:02:19.860> cap<00:02:20.160> over<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.550> and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
car I have it has this cap over it and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.390 
car I have it has this cap over it and
that's<00:02:21.360> where<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.980> tachometer<00:02:22.980> would

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
that's where the tachometer would

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.610 
that's where the tachometer would
usually<00:02:23.610> go<00:02:24.000> slightest<00:02:24.840> spliced<00:02:25.110> into<00:02:25.410> there

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
usually go slightest spliced into there

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.699 
usually go slightest spliced into there
and<00:02:26.480> with<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.510> instructions<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> says<00:02:28.320> to

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
and with the instructions it says to

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.460 
and with the instructions it says to
connect<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.190> negative<00:02:29.549> side<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:31.260> guess

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
connect to the negative side and I guess

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.120 
connect to the negative side and I guess
this<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> negative<00:02:32.070> side<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.489> works<00:02:32.640> so

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
this is a negative side it works so

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.960 
this is a negative side it works so
that's<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.400> cord<00:02:36.739> now<00:02:40.459> there's<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.610> white

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
that's that cord now there's a white

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.860 
that's that cord now there's a white
cord<00:02:42.360> right<00:02:42.810> here<00:02:43.850> that<00:02:44.850> goes<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.630> light

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
cord right here that goes to the light

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.479 
cord right here that goes to the light
so<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.530> found<00:02:46.890> on<00:02:47.130> my<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:48.530> fuse<00:02:49.530> box<00:02:49.940> up<00:02:50.940> here

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
so I found on my a fuse box up here

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.479 
so I found on my a fuse box up here
that's<00:02:53.489> for<00:02:53.820> my<00:02:53.970> tail<00:02:54.209> light<00:02:54.480> it's<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:55.489> push

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
that's for my tail light it's like push

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.130 
that's for my tail light it's like push
it<00:02:56.519> right<00:02:56.820> in<00:02:57.030> there<00:02:58.370> along<00:02:59.370> with<00:02:59.430> the<00:03:00.140> diffuse

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
it right in there along with the diffuse

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.430 
it right in there along with the diffuse
and<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:02.370> gives<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.910> power<00:03:03.120> for<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
and that gives you the power for the the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.620 
and that gives you the power for the the
backlight<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.280> tachometer<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.650> then

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
backlight on the tachometer and then

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.380 
backlight on the tachometer and then
this<00:03:09.630> light<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.739> uh<00:03:10.799> blue<00:03:11.760> one<00:03:11.970> right<00:03:12.120> here

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
this light this uh blue one right here

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.740 
this light this uh blue one right here
that<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> continuous<00:03:14.340> power<00:03:14.609> source<00:03:14.970> which

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
that is a continuous power source which

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.789 
that is a continuous power source which
came<00:03:16.049> from<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:18.260> this<00:03:19.260> one<00:03:19.440> right<00:03:19.560> here

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
came from the the this one right here

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.120 
came from the the this one right here
that<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.010> tested<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:21.269> not<00:03:22.230> not<00:03:22.530> continuous

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
that I tested and not not continuous

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.370 
that I tested and not not continuous
that's<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.549> one<00:03:24.329> when<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.900> key<00:03:25.109> is<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
that's the one when the key is in the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.410 
that's the one when the key is in the
accessory<00:03:25.859> position

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.830 

and<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.440> ground<00:03:31.710> of<00:03:31.920> course<00:03:32.660> goes<00:03:33.660> right

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
and in the ground of course goes right

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.580 
and in the ground of course goes right
up<00:03:34.020> there<00:03:34.610> but<00:03:35.610> that's<00:03:35.790> about<00:03:36.030> it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
up there but that's about it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.070 
up there but that's about it
the<00:03:38.460> instructions<00:03:39.090> aren't<00:03:39.450> very<00:03:39.600> good<00:03:39.720> they

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
the instructions aren't very good they

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.700 
the instructions aren't very good they
don't<00:03:40.260> really<00:03:40.440> tell<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:40.770> a<00:03:41.390> whole<00:03:42.390> lot<00:03:44.240> but

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
don't really tell you a whole lot but

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:52.130 
don't really tell you a whole lot but
seemed<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:46.860> work<00:03:46.950> pretty<00:03:47.190> good<00:03:47.340> for<00:03:47.490> me<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.720> all

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
seemed to work pretty good for me so all

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:01.460 
seemed to work pretty good for me so all
the<00:03:52.440> instructions<00:03:53.040> say<00:03:59.720> the<00:04:00.720> white<00:04:00.930> goes<00:04:01.170> to

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
the instructions say the white goes to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.160 
the instructions say the white goes to
the<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.880> your<00:04:05.880> brake<00:04:06.120> lights<00:04:06.390> or<00:04:06.600> your<00:04:06.750> your

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
the the your brake lights or your your

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.820 
the the your brake lights or your your
headlights<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:08.700> when<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.060> turn<00:04:09.270> your

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
headlights so when you turn your

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.810 
headlights so when you turn your
headlights<00:04:10.830> on<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:13.430> don't<00:04:14.430> know<00:04:14.550> if<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:14.730> can

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
headlights on I don't know if you can

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.750 
headlights on I don't know if you can
see<00:04:15.030> that<00:04:15.180> but<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.570> light<00:04:15.750> comes<00:04:15.990> on<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.760> can

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
see that but the light comes on you can

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.880 
see that but the light comes on you can
switch<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.209> colors<00:04:18.540> around<00:04:21.590> hangouts<00:04:22.590> five

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
switch the colors around hangouts five

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.820 
switch the colors around hangouts five
colors<00:04:23.340> or<00:04:23.520> six<00:04:24.140> so<00:04:25.140> then<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.380> orange<00:04:25.590> one<00:04:25.800> I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
colors or six so then the orange one I

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.160 
colors or six so then the orange one I
said<00:04:26.130> goes<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.880> battery<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.450> ran<00:04:28.020> that

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
said goes to the battery I ran that

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.280 
said goes to the battery I ran that
through<00:04:28.230> my<00:04:28.500> firewall<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.940> red<00:04:30.150> one<00:04:30.360> also

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
through my firewall the red one also

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.560 
through my firewall the red one also
goes<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.860> fuse<00:04:32.070> box<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.940> green<00:04:33.150> one<00:04:33.330> goes

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
goes to the fuse box the green one goes

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.720 
goes to the fuse box the green one goes
to<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.780> negative<00:04:33.990> side<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.590> coil<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.160> the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
to the negative side of the coil and the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.800 
to the negative side of the coil and the
black<00:04:35.970> one<00:04:36.180> goes<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.480> ground

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
black one goes to ground

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.150 
black one goes to ground
that<00:04:37.500> was<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.830> let's<00:04:38.190> see<00:04:38.490> how<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.669> works

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.290 

now<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.220> one<00:04:44.520> thing<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.820> don't<00:04:44.880> really<00:04:45.120> like

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
now the one thing I don't really like

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.100 
now the one thing I don't really like
about<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:46.350> jumps<00:04:46.650> around<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:47.010> lot<00:04:47.160> it<00:04:48.110> when

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
about it it jumps around a lot it when

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.530 
about it it jumps around a lot it when
you're<00:04:49.230> driving<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:50.490> could<00:04:50.670> go<00:04:50.820> from<00:04:51.030> 3<00:04:51.419> to

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
you're driving it could go from 3 to

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.700 
you're driving it could go from 3 to
4,000<00:04:52.169> rpm<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:53.430> you're<00:04:53.910> not<00:04:54.060> doing<00:04:54.330> anything

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
4,000 rpm and you're not doing anything

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.680 
4,000 rpm and you're not doing anything
it<00:04:55.710> jumps<00:04:56.070> around<00:04:56.160> maybe<00:04:56.400> 500<00:04:56.940> rpm<00:04:57.240> at<00:04:57.389> a<00:04:57.480> time

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
it jumps around maybe 500 rpm at a time

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.570 
it jumps around maybe 500 rpm at a time
so<00:04:58.050> that's<00:04:58.830> one<00:04:59.010> thing<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.250> don't<00:04:59.310> really<00:04:59.430> like

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
so that's one thing I don't really like

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.340 
so that's one thing I don't really like
about<00:04:59.850> it<00:05:00.090> but<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.889> guess<00:05:01.889> you<00:05:02.040> decide
