00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.650
 hey here was sitting by oliver together but 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.580
 I'm not here on the path 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.799
 and here's a little world's 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 first because collections presented the first 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.480
 bent pc monitor in front and I start 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.890
 now with the back to the looks 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 you keep the complete metal here 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.180
 I'm pretty noble so it's already on 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.640
 It's fun to work with 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.529
 and back is for offices and further 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.490
 a fine thing but probably the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.710
 Of course, hammer is the one 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.160
 friend because here you have it looks like that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.480
 a slightly curved display and there 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 Of course it's a lot of fun 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.620
 is going to work or link here 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.899
 By this slight vaulting one has so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 a certain 3d effect of the internet 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.600
 Testing has but a bit 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.100
 louder I hope that does not bother me 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.690
 but that has us in certain 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.920
 defective really makes the mood 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 picture is already impressive 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.410
 you have a full hd resolution here 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.910
 that and that makes it so easy and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.859
 reflects and you have it easy 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.000
 spatial effect it's just for gamers 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.890
 on a cause because you do not need 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.760
 extra glasses and is still one 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.260
 a little bit more in it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 However, the price should never be so 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.790
 low citizens are curious if one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.320
 then it really exaggerates you then 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.950
 a pretty cool combination 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.229
 you can see here 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.640
 It looks pretty much like that then 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.170
 three church 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.030
 monitor just next to each other 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.670
 has shown that one already has 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.770
 almost a pretty wide bent picture 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.260
 and on the train the nice gentleman 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.790
 About half say it takes 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.710
 the nice gentleman here any 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.850
 race simulator or something and sees 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.810
 really impressive that is 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.790
 already made really cool 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.740
 on the right is the angle of view now 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.840
 not so outstanding is this one 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.180
 slight bend and there you stand then so 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.710
 sums up in the speed week but so in the 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.930
 point where we advertise for the user 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.570
 the most visible is there already 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.100
 impressive and if so what then 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 actually so in the local office 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.610
 or in the local zacher place 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.119
 could be such a pretty one for one 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.430
 be thing 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.289
 Well, I'm curious what the things 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.160
 my cost is the first impression it should 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.259
 first have been 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.820
 if he has any questions about it 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.720
 in the comments I try that then 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.490
 to answer 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.899
 otherwise completely on the person of 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.670
 get away here 's my other 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.739
 as seen junk the next is therefore 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.149
 a lot of videos on you too and 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.040
 otherwise I say goodbye now 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.000
 First of all and we read the days 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.000
