00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.170
 I have a channel 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.549
 devious spontaneous action 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.310
 Let's see if the ice is free 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:23.769
 So the channel was no longer has ice and 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.420
 It looks pretty good and me 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.869
 I trusted this now 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:41.649
 also pretty flat evans but what 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:44.070
 should actually I actually 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.070
 very well 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.110
 Here you can have a little one 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.340
 cool selection so to see the other 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.310
 small drop shot bait for bartsch but 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.680
 also zander in about eight to ten 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.759
 centimeters 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.650
 you can if you do not have so much 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:23.079
 Comfort connect since finished 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.840
 presale costs about 350 depending on 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:29.049
 occasion and those rubber worms here 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.850
 I want to test a closer look today because 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.310
 I think they have very nice 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.310
 incentive to my reinforce before I have 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:41.860
 I have tied them myself now 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:45.549
 a leader carbon in strength 08 10 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.930
 watch wonderful and here you can again 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.390
 I also have very small children 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.630
 for Bartsch I am also very good with 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.009
 caught here on the canal and it's one 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.280
 small selection always with 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.310
 should when you go out 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.140
 because if you are not so sure 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.600
 know which kÃ¶hler at the time 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.250
 did work as more and more 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.020
 and not much space left now 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.960
 you can put everything in such a small box 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.220
 make it clean and then you're fine with that 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.870
 placed 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.700
 I just look that simple up here 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.190
 a trailer tied to my skin 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.560
 only then comes the hook with the living 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:29.800
 and in about 15 cm below that lead the lead 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.590
 now has a power of 14 grams 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.700
 A bit much on the canal here 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.190
 because you do not see much now either 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.410
 wide and he is not very deep either 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.360
 the lowest point is about two 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.460
 meter 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.450
 but I've taken the heavy order 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.580
 I see if it'll come over and then times 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.610
 Watch if I get something short today 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.459
 fishing I have something older 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.770
 model but a very beautiful model is 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.610
 a great one is three meters long 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.190
 and has a weight of five moment 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.900
 up to 20 grams is sufficient 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.250
 for washing and zander is the great 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.360
 I have two of them 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.080
 he sees you right in front 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.220
 and I also take my other one 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.500
 all the second namely to the 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.170
 scream fishing in the summer for that is 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.269
 really great for you let yourself 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.940
 do not irritate because we'll say a lot 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.890
 stuck are far better may be 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.320
 but I am if someone likes 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.480
 has a lot of space on the car and I have 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.250
 always very compact and 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.250
 That's why I like teleworking 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.560
 the place changed 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:13.530
 but the canal and me, yes, little ones 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.410
 see what is less is also so 30 30 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.800
 hectares or so so small 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.260
 I have only problem here is that he 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.530
 Very bad to handle is therefore only 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.560
 but there are three possible other poses 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:35.160
 we have the really good tooth in there 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:38.400
 and you can see there is a small one 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.470
 Run and I put in another 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.680
 try a bit but my battery is 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.920
 unfortunately all the same therefore thank you 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.540
 He watched and I wish you 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.290
 then much fun on the water for now 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.730
 it starts again the spring comes and 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.110
 I've tested my camera 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.060
 new i hope you like the new ones 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.830
 images 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.960
